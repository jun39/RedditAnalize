fcogl01,whitslack,1,"&gt;if you're a merchant accepting funds from customers and your shop loses power taking your LN node offline any merchant can attempt to steal from you by transmitting an older LN channel state. you need to hire watchtowers to help prevent this.

Again, this is only true if your node is offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`, which you can set up to two weeks. You only need watchtowers if your node might be offline for longer than your `to_self_delay`. A merchant is never going to be offline for that long.

&gt;1 day, 2 weeks is still distincitly worse than waiting 10 minutes for 1 confirmation on Bitcoin.

That clearly depends on your operational priorities. Waiting 10 minutes (or occasionally over an hour) for a confirmation is quite often unacceptable in a retail point-of-sale environment. The merchant can risk accepting an on-chain transaction without any confirmations, but that is absolutely less secure than accepting a Lightning payment.

&gt; Saying both the have the same exact level of security is just plain deceitful.

If there was an inflation bug in Monero or Zcash we may not find out for years, or ever, as there is no way to see the transaction amounts you cannot count all the coins. Can you feel confident using a system like that? 

Bitcoin is pseudonymous so does not give absolute privacy by default. But if you are careful with coin control and not link your transaction history to your real ID, then it is possible to preserve your privacy. Just takes more effort and use things like coin mixing, avoiding KYC exchanges and using Lightning Network for everyday transactions. More privacy preserving tools are coming in the future. Also simply having far more users increases your anonymity set.

fcroz25,juliushenkin,6,"Bitcoin Cash is definitely executing its goal of bringing censorship resistant money to the world, and it is growing every day. It is being used for payments more than BTC in certain regions and websites. It actually works, regardless of the market cap or the number of people using the network. As long as the adoption numbers keep going up, Bitcoin Cash will eventually eclipse all other currencies on Earth.

The best way to increase adoption is to make it easier and more convenient for people to use it. This means improving user experience in wallets and online. Implementing solutions like BIP70 is a good example of this. People should never have to copy and paste addresses and amounts when paying for things online and in person. Many people are not skilled enough with technology to figure out how to navigate complex menu systems in wallets. [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) has a great wallet for the average person.

&gt;  BCH has not seen any material adoption in its short 2.5 year history 

Blockstream troll confirmed. I use Bitcoin Cash to pay online all the time. Also, Bitcoin Cash has been around for over 10 years.

fcs76us,iiJokerzace,4,"Tell them that NANO is potentially *more* secure than bitcoin due to its unique design of PoS. 

Bitcoin uses full nodes to keep the network decentralized with anyone able to run one. However there is a weakness called a Sybil Attack.

When you look at the full nodes connected, there are no sure-fire way to make sure those nodes are unique and not actually one entity pretending to be thousands. This leaves some uncertainty for BTC's security. There is also the fault of full nodes becoming more demanding and expensive to run, less people will be able to run and participate. This is important because the less amount of full nodes, the bigger the chance of a Sybil attack. 

NANO on the other hand has representatives (Also full-nodes) that only validate if the users allow them to. User's in a sense ""stake"" their currency to a rep of their choosing. Since the currency has the power to validate the network, we now have a real and anti-counterfeit number of validators (the static supply) and are controlled by the people who own the money themselves. As a large holder of the coin, it is your incentive to make sure you pick a good representative or risk your own money's value and functions.

Even if nodes start to get low and number and get more demanding, we can still keep them decentralized by distributing validation across what super nodes are still running. 

-

Another thing is that Bitcoin is CONSTANTLY inflating and will continue to inflate until 2140. I say that's too big of a reward for miners since they also make money from FEES of people making transactions. 

NANO though is already completely printed (static) and distributed out and will only continue to distribute without any deflation or inflation. It's perfect for a currency since its already static instead of bitcoin that will be constantly inflating for over a century, it should stabilize much faster and be easier to use going off an already static supply.",2020-01-02 05:59:57

fcrkfo2,ace_rimjob,2,"&gt;The blocks mined on Bitcoin are larger than BCH.

60% Veriblock but keep jacking off like that isn't a thing

&gt;Bitcoin HashRate is much greater than BCH.

There are other ways to mitigate double-spends than raw hashrate, which is grossly overbuilt and inefficient on BTC for how little throughput it has. Many BCH developers are working on TX finality and node synchronicity unlike BTC that gave up any meaningful development or added security *years* ago

&gt;Bitcoin price in USD is 33x that of BCH.

Already circling back to speculative price mattering, it does not except for tiny minded morons like yourself who can't see the bigger picture. Bitcoin wasn't built just to bag hold until you can sell it for more, that is just a distributed pyramid scheme

&gt;Bitcoin has a much greater value sent in US Dollar terms, daily.
&gt;Bitcoin average transaction value is higher than BCH.
&gt;Bitcoin has greater number of transactions actually made per second, than BCH.

Again a lot of it is Veriblock, proving that raw TX counts are also not a good metric of success.

Otherwise value moved is subjective based on market action. Of that value, BTC has the unique ability to destroy that value with high fees. BCH is far less lossy if you are doing a lot of business.

You are welcome to source your numbers otherwise for this claim. 

&gt;Bitcoin has many more active addresses than BCH.

This post highlights the significance of UTXO model to scaling like no other. The author provides elegant supporting mathematical proofs (albeit the randomized set caveat) which have profound implications.

Merkle trees as a testament to Bitcoin's potential to boundless scaling is only HALF the story, the other (arguably more significant) half is the UTXO model itself. 

I had similar intuition behind my distributed architecture paper, where I coined the term [Zero-conf Transaction Inputs (ZTXI)](https://gist.github.com/stoichammer/3bb383f3b4634b2196742ddac5ed6cd1), as the fundamental unit for achieving massively parallel Tx validation/Mempool acceptance/Sharding. Although I fell short of applying academic rigour to furnish proofs like u/-mr-word- has done. 

While my approach was more practical with an engineering bent, to see some mathematical bounds being derived along with a functional (recursive) algorithm is a great thing. I believe u/-mr-word- independently invented the same/similar concept under the name **RTXI**.

The DeFi space in Ethereum is really interesting.  It's providing a way to exist between both crypto and fiat, providing you tools to borrow against assets or program how you want to hedge and leverage your wealth based on the current market.

A lot of people do flee their local markets to USD.  I'm not disputing that.

Stats show the majority of investors are storing and accumulating wealth in bitcoin as opposed to spending it.  They arent fleeing the asset.  They are buying and holding.

fcs26u1,juliushenkin,2,"&gt; No one is going to switch to Bitcoin to make the same purchase at the same price as fiat.

Think of all the benefits of Bitcoin Cash over Fiat

1. No chargebacks, ever
2. No credit card/ bank fees
3. Never deal with banks again
4. Never touch disgusting filthy paper money
5. Never go to an ATM again
6. Pay for LEGAL weed and guns at stores that have been deemed too ""high risk"" for credit card services (basically all the dispensaries where I live in Boulder, CO do NOT accept credit cards for this reason)
7. Merchants never pay credit card fees, which are 1-3%+
8. Donate to people who have been banned from all other payment processors (ex: Laura Loomer)
9. Drug dealers can avoid being spied on by Paypal or Venmo
10. **Send money across borders and currencies for free (this is huge, remittances will change forever)**

Applications like [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/) are far superior to Ebay, with ZERO fees and chargebacks.

Bitcoin Cash is also ideologically far superior to Fiat, as it is not funded through debt printing and extortion the way Fiat is. Bitcoin Cash can usher in the greatest period of human freedom ever seen before.",2020-01-02 05:25:21
fcs1cg5,Kain_niaK,2,"BTC has OMNI and counterparty.

Counterparty was actively sabotaged when the devs changed op_return from 80 to 40 bytes. Yet counterparty became a success.

OMNI only has one token that is actively being used: Tether.

OMNI has it's own nodes. when Tether was hacked, the Tether guys simply asked all the OMNI nodes to upgrade to software that undid the hack. 


So OMNI is pretty centralised. Which is why Tether is now on ECR20 and other token systems.

So BTC only has counterparty.

There use to be something on counterparty called Rare Pepe and it was glorious. The real /r/memoeconomy

fcv5yvs,panduh9228,30,"Would just like to remind everyone of a few simple truths\* that may calm you down some:

* You're most likely here because at one point you learned about how bitcoin works, and concluded it has a real utility and place in today and tomorrow's world.
* These boom and bust cycles are simply market noise overlaid on top of the adoption curve.
* The aforementioned cycles cannot complete themselves until backwards-looking analysis utterly fails. That is to say, those who look at previous bear markets as a confidence-crutch for an incoming recovery (and this is the majority of people) will give up hope once the bear market hits all-time-high levels of despair. That ""measurement"" is vague, but it is a combination of how far down the price goes and for how long the bear market lasts. At this point, most traders' spirit is broken from so many failed rallies and we enter uncharted waters. And there will be no more charts to point to and say ""Look it's been here before and recovered, so it can recover again."" All that's left to hold on to is the understanding that the blockchain technology is extremely reliable, and the belief that individuals of the future will desire to store some wealth in this decentralized, autonomous manner. Only then will the market have the backbone to expand steadily again (and most likely accelerate upwards into another bubble because markets are driven by humans, and humans repeat these emotional cycles over and over).
* The rally to 14k ultimately failed not because the whole experiment is over, but because the current cycle hasn't completed yet. It was too soon. People were (and likely still are) too hopeful for a swift recovery - and with that hope comes fear. Once the hope dissipates, the fear dissipates as well as what remains are the market participants (holders) who are genuinely comfortable with the possibility of the price going to $0. And that, my friends, is the starting foundation from which true price growth again becomes possible.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS.

And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

fcxtxo9,CoolFoundation4,56,"&gt;Ss: Oops I meant Jewish Jessie Smollett

Most people don't know this, but Jessie Smollett IS Jewish (half Jewish to be exact). 

So the Jewish Jessie Smollett is... Jessie Smollett.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussie_Smollett#Early_life

Promoting the idea that there's a huge anti-semitism problem is one of the major ploys that the Jewish Supremacists use to engender public sympathy and thereby wield political influence.

The problem is that there's so little **real** anti-semitism that they have to manufacture it with fake hate crime hoaxes.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-2-years-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers “Paid with Bitcoin”](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/?lang=en

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew’s Bomb Threats against American Jews are “White Hate”](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world""? 

But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are American and most of europe (white majority countries)

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

And.... [When Zion has the Power...all Christians will be killed because they are idolator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJRZkqYkJOM)

Of course, these Jewish Supremacists pay no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jewish Supremacists express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

And the ADL is a [Jewish Supremacy group masquerading as a civil rights group.](http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-adl-in-american-society/)

From the article:

&gt; This new format would allow the following things:
&gt; 
&gt; - On-chain games. Rules of the game are enforced by the smart contract.
&gt; 
&gt; - Native tokens, i.e. token rules are enforced by a smart contract, similar to ERC-20 tokens.
&gt; 
&gt; - Decentralized exchanges (DEX).
&gt; 
&gt; - Advanced wallets, much more capable than what is possible now (recurrent payments, auto-shuffling, last-will clause, etc. all in one wallet, ran automatically, non-interactively).
&gt; 
&gt; - Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which make decisions autonomously. MakerDAO, a decentralized stablecoin that ensures the price of a token stays at $1 using smart contracts would be a complex example, but there are simpler ones.
&gt; 
&gt; - Zero-knowledge proofs like zkSNARKs or zkSTARKs. These are incredible pieces of technology that allow fully private transactions and efficient verification of complex contracts.

The only question now is how to make it a reality.

Crises and fiascos can create opportunities, for instance after 9/11 my uncle recommended American Airlines, because stocks tanked, and everyone quit flying briefly, but things will always return to normal eventually, and you could have made a ton of money. 

Or for instance, I was involved in internet culture and had heard of bitcoin as a darknet currency and when libertarians planned to undermine the USD with it, and recommended it to people long before it got reported by major news outlets and the rush happened. 

Or if you look at the shift from storefront shopping to online shopping. 

It’s a lot easier looking back, but you need to think about which direction society is moving and then research companies thoroughly and diversify throughout the industry you are predicting to boom. And take advantage of your interests and knowledge that might clue you into something potentially successful before it is popularized. 

Already established giants aren’t going to give some ridiculous return, but they are good options for slowly getting a decent return on your money.

fcz0xlc,SolomonGrundle,23,"The authority nodes carry out a mandatory update (technically a fork) after the vote and that is all. There is no fork as you might be thinking (as in, splitting of the chain as with some other protocols), that is the beauty of the VeChainThor blockchain, all updates are unilaterally enacted and everything proceeds as before with all block producers and stakeholders on the same path. No one needs to be concerned at all, nothing will change for anyone.

Also, the addresses weren’t removed, simply blocked from ever adding data to the blockchain again (due to authority nodes not processing data from these addresses). They still exist and always will, just in limbo.

Here is the definition of a fork from Wikipedia to avoid any more confusion:

“Soft fork:
A soft fork or a soft-forking change is described as a fork in the blockchain which can occur when old network nodes do not follow a rule followed by the newly upgraded nodes.”

Which all ANs do, regarding that final point. It’s a seamless transition to a new rule for the whole protocol. That’s the benefit of having an environment where the block producing nodes can easily reach consensus and upgrade in sync. VeChain avoids any contentious hard forks or chain splitting like has previously occurred with Bitcoin and Ethereum as a result. It’s a much more efficient and business friendly means of governance.

fdc48mv,ThrowBackFF,111,"&gt; Anarchy just means no heirarchy. You can still have a government and  rules without heirarchy. A pure democracy (direct voting on all issues)  would be anarchist, for example. 

To expand on this for those interested:

&gt;""If liberalism, communism, and fascism differ over how powerful the state should be, anarchism rejects the notion of the state altogether. Anarchist share with communists the belief that private property leads to inequality, but they are opposed to the ideas that the state can solve this problem. As the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin (1814-76) once stated, ""I am not a communist, because communism unites all the forces of society in the state and becomes absorbed in it... While I see the complete elimination of the principles of authority and governmental guardianship, which under the pretense of making men moral and civilizing them has up to now always enslaved, oppressed, exploited, and ruined them"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, like liberals, anarchist view the state as a threat to freedom and equality rather than as their champion, but they believe that both individual freedom and equality can be achieved only by eliminating the state entirely. Without a state to reinforce inequality or limit personal freedom, argue anarchists, people would be able to cooperate freely as true equals. Given that we live in a world of states, anarchism is the only one of the five primary ideologies that have never been realized. However, anarchist ideas played a role in the Russian Revolution (1917) and in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). In North America, some versions of libertarian come close to an anarchist view in their hostility to the state, though libertarians differ from anarchists in their emphasis on private property. The digital currency bitcoin is a good example where libertarian and anarchist views overlap.

fdd6ujf,kusuriurikun,95,"For those who are....*unaware* of that particular bit of guanopsychosis:  There's been an affinity fraud running for some time now ([at least since 2015](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/inside-a-24-million-investment-scam-buy-the-iraqi-dinar.html) and probably in some form or another since Gulf War II) [essentially claiming that the Iraqi dinar (which is actually a hyperinflated currency that suffered a collapse due to the Gulf Wars and even during Saddam Hussein's reign was largely propped up due to currency controls, was never a freely tradeable convertible currency, and had an artificially low exchange rate) is apparently a Great Investment Whose Time Is Soon To Come](https://www.learningmarkets.com/the-iraqi-dinar-scam/); usually the claim is that the Iraqi government will effectively do a revaluation or redenomination of the currency which--with the magic of forex--will make them Rich Beyond Belief.  In truth, [investing in Iraqi dinars is about as sensible as investing in the (recently returned to circulation) Zimbabwe dollar or the Venezuelan bolivar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlaura/2015/03/24/retire-on-the-iraqi-dinar-and-vietnamese-dong/#19bf760a51b7) (both of which have been subject to severe hyperinflation within recent history, with Zimdollars actually approaching the Hungarian pengo's stratospheric hyperinflation before Zimbabwe killed off the Zimdollar entirely and the SA rand became the official as well as the working currency); typically these types of revaluations are functional redenominations and are a sign that a foreign currency is heading towards hyperinflation (and, well, will eventually become about as useful as a 500-trillion-dollar Zimdollar note--which ended up being sold on Ebay as curios, and resulted in duty-free shops along the South African border asking people to PLEASE not literally wipe their ass with worthless Zimbabwean currency and flush it down the toilet).

This is, of note, a scam which has particular currency (pun intended) [among MAGAts (who've also been taken in by goldbug scams, cryptocurrency trading scams, and ""Christian Gifting Club"" affinity frauds)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-fans-sink-savings-into-iraqi-dinar-scam); this has some remarkable similarities to not only goldbug scams and Bitcoin-trading-scams, but some rather unique ""investment scams"" that are actually a unique form of affinity fraud targeting specifically New Apostolic Reformation and other ""Christian Zionist"" groups (usually involving claims of oil investment involving exploration off the coast of Israel or in or near the West Bank because ""God Blessed Israel""--alas, Israel and the Levant in general are the ONE part of the Middle East that actually is not sitting on top of a petroleum reserve--or involving farmers who are trying to raise Perfect Red Heifers so that the Third Temple can be built (no matter that [there's already a major religious shrine of the second most populous Abrahamic religion both in Israel and worldwide on the site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock) that would have to be removed first--and yes, there are NAR promoters who have actually literally proposed this, despite (or more likely, *because*) the fact that doing so would spark a religious war the likes of which have not been seen since the Middle Ages).  In fact, [at least one promoter of ""Iraqi dinar scams"" actually managed to mix both ""oil exploration"" scams AND ""Iraqi dollar investment"" scams in an apparent affinity fraud targeting the Latter-Day Saint community](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2016/08/10/dinar-scam-takes-on-new-twist/#589d660f684c) (LDS communities--due to insularity and encouragement for women in particular to be ""work at home moms"" in ""Godly businesses"", among other cultural factors--are such a consistent target of various affinity frauds that most MLMs are actually based in Utah).

And the Iraqi Dinar Grift is...apparently [a very profitable one](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/owners-currency-exchange-business-made-600-million-convicted-fraud), for its promoters, at least; [MAGAts have been buying thousands of dollars worth of currency that is hyperinflated and sure to only get worse](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/susanwright/2018/11/you-will-not-get-rich-in-the-dinar-scam/).  This is made worse (yes, seriously) by the fact apparently there is some very MAGAt-specific nonsense going around to the effect *Trump* is apparently a Major Dinar Investor, has millions of dollars invested in Iraqi dinars (which would actually show even worse monetary sense than is typical for Trump) and that [apparently Trump himself is going to, uh, Make The Iraqi Dinar Great Again or something.](https://www.newsweek.com/some-americans-think-trump-make-rich-iraqi-money-1225643)",2020-01-06 16:56:39

Often people in those have somehow bought shares in Microsoft or Apple in the early days and this funds their crackpot schemes in the future. Indeed the year I was born both Nike and Apple went on the stock market the same month (December 1980). I’ve always thought it’s a fun idea to set-up a fund for someone when they’re born. In Britain a lot of people do National Savings Bonds which are a pretty useless investment. A slightly riskier investment is better (and more fun) in my view. Bitcoin is risky, but every time I’ve called a piece of tech as transformative for the future, such as social media, the impact has gone far beyond my initial thoughts. Bitcoin is risky, but it’s still very early stage. A year ago I couldn’t place the advert using Bitcoin, this year I used a Coinbase visa debit card to do it. Using money from her own fund. Whenever there’s scarcity on the internet (domain names?) it’s interesting to see where the price can go. My hope is that when she’s 18 colleges or Unis might even accept Bitcoin for fee payments.",2020-01-06 22:16:08
fdcfust,KuDeTa,64,"Got into crypto in 2010-2011 and remember, fondly, /r/bitcoin with under 2000 subs, and helping out on that dorky little subreddit ad. I was immediately obsessed, and though thoroughly, absolutely convinced this was an important moment in this history of money, I was too young and dumb and broke to do anything ... significant... about it. There was this strange and sexy mystery. Satoshi? Digital currency? Silk Road? Mining? I used to hang around on IRC and tried out the first OTC trading rooms. Bought a GPU and plugged into campus before I realised that could be a thing. My friends openly laughed, at first, (“Magical Internet Money”), yet soon enough they were peppering me with questions. One time I got tipped 0.5 bitcoin though the bot for no particular reason. During the rush up to &gt;$1000 I was naive, and got caught up in MtGox and by the end of the brutal winter of 2013 into 2014, found myself more or less back at square one. My friends started laughing again. At least I was working at this point and able to invest a little. But to what end? The politics in the space became awful and the emerging coup d’etat of the bitcoin project looked like it would be its certain death. I used to read the bitcoin dev mailing list and couldn’t understand the technicals enough to arrive at convincing conclusions. Then I started medical school, and decided I had better learn to code on the side. Python has been fun. In bitcoin land, at this point, there was still just a little glimmer of some hope, Gavin A and Mike H were around and coloured coins seemed promising, but all the double speak and argumentation about scaling made it quite clear we were not ready for prime time. It was also quite plain that the block size had to be increased! LN is a dead end. Lawyers in Japan continued (and continue) arguing about my small little hold. Then came ethereum. What a breath of fresh air. Vitalik and his beautiful strange funky mind. I was slightly late to the party: though not indoctrinated, somewhat confused, by the one-coiner dogma and mentality from bitcoin but, when that penny dropped .. holy fucking shit. THIS IS IT. I fondly remember being on holiday in Asia, pleading with the locals to use their internet so I could login to an exchange to buy, and then quite promptly banned because of the foreign IPs. Since then, you know what, that excitement never left me and I never felt an urge to sell a single coin. Its never really been about getting rich. It’s funny how all the old boys in cryptography argue endlessly in chat rooms about their megabytes of scale and these crazy young geniuses around Ethereum just plan and build, build build. Eventually got banned from /r/bitcoin for arguing with Null C/Greg Maxwell and his cronies (what a twat). Tried to persuade the reddit admins to seriously consider closing down that toxic little hole, but they could not give a shit about community or open source (Thank god we moved on from donuts!) Those first 9 months of 2017 were awesome, I bought into a few too many random ICOs with fervent passion (no regrets). Prediction markets! Stable coins! Cloud computing! The whole space was alive with ideas, energy and unfortunately far too many charming swindlers. My friends stopped laughing and started asking questions again. I duly advised them against the alts, though some made good profit on random hype, others doubled down on shit (TRON) and lost big time and, still would not listen. I should have known to sell when I was being invited to random WhatsApp groups to give advice to the newly converted but I was so caught up by the end of medical school I barely noticed 2017 pop. And I don’t bloody care.  At this point I feel like a wizened old man, my friends, who are now too busy and exhausted having babies to laugh, occasionally ask and then regret it when they are forced to politely listen to the ramblings of this lunatic:  I still can barely contain my excitement at scalable blockchains, smart contracts, stable coins and Web 3.0. I barely notice the price drama and come here just to occasionally exchange hopium and make sure that if I’m going crazy I’m not totally alone. I’ve spent the last two months obsessively running the beta Prysm node software on a massively overpowered mini itx build in anticipation of Phase 0, and nerding out with their devs in discord, who are awesome and energetic.

The emergency department at my local hospital is quiet tonight, so far at least, so apologies for the excessive ramble. It’s been a decade of learning , building and investing, and I guess I feel qualified to say that though nothing is certain, if blockchains are indeed here to stay then Ethereum will be a very bright part of that future. The rest is noise. Here’s to another decade and more exciting development.",2020-01-06 10:24:29

&gt;There is almost 0 innovation difference between 1917 Model T &amp; Modern Day Tesla. In my view we still drive the Model T today (it just has things like seat belts &amp; gps added) Why is it so hard for [@officialmcafee](https://twitter.com/officialmcafee) &amp; many others to see [\#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hashtag_click) adding additional features?

First of all, LOL at the suggestion that there has been no innovation between the Model T and Tesla. The truth is harsh, and I believe between the years of 2020 and 2022, the entire market will come to see it:

[https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1213887618892611584](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1213887618892611584)

&gt;Because the Bitcoin protocol lacks the basic level of programmability / expressivity to add most of the functionality people are excited about.  And it can't be introduced without what most consider to be an impossible hard fork.

There are still quite a few Bitcoiners who are content to just have their digital gold, recognizing it can't do much more than that. I respect those folks more than the ones (like Tone Vays) who are holding out false hope that Bitcoin can somehow meaningfully evolve out of its current state. It will see incremental upgrades and optimization, but it very likely will *never* hard fork to add the functionality to add anything remotely similar to DeFi on Ethereum. Such apps will be relegated to L2, and so far, people don't want to seem to use those- nevermind the fact that most require you to exchange Bitcoin's trust-minimization / censorship-resistance for some federated side chain run by 20 to 30 actors.

I know, I know- I've been saying it for well over a year now, but I still believe that in a market with information asymmetry like this, ETH is tremendously underpriced relative to other chains. I have worked diligently over the past 2 years to build out my own position before that asymmetry is ultimately eliminated.

BTC may start the next cycle with its liquidity advantage, but I believe ETH will later outperform it with its innovation advantage. And at this point, we're not just talking about protocol innovation, but quite meaningfully, we are also talking about composed app innovation.",2020-01-06 04:03:59

This has been possible for 30 years. Bitcoin did not invent any part of that.

So any form of ""private blockchain"" or ""national digital currency"" has the inherent question: why didn't you do this in the late 90s? Either it's a good idea and you were an idiot for 20 years, or it's a bad idea and you're an idiot now. Pick your favorite.",2020-01-06 20:58:11

Bitfinex is just Tether to Bitcoin but today there was 5 million dollar of volume that was split 50/50 between BCH and BSV without any volume between Bitcoin and real money.

Name a 'bubble' that deflated and then RE-INFLATED again? Not the Tulip bubble, not the South Sea bubble, not the Mississippi bubble, or any other. If bitcoin was a simple bubble then when it went down from $19,900 to $3,200 it should have just kept going down.

It's true that those same people will call bitcoin a bunch of stupid names again--like a pyramid scam or some kind of 'Ponzi' scheme. But they can't say it's a bubble like the Tulip bubble since those bubble NEVER re-inflated again.

PS. Those idiots calling bitcoin a scam just don't understand bitcoin. Bitcoin is a new asset class in the process of being monetized. Therefore it is natural for it to go through multiple 'bubble' stages. That's OK. When bitcoin went from $2 to over $31 it was definitiley a bubble--but BTC at $31 was still undervalued.

It's also worth noting that Trump has over 60 million followers but his tweets rarely break 150k in likes.  He buys that follower number so the vast majority of his followers are bots, fake accounts, or scammers.  Last year Trump threw a fit because his follower number dropped and he accused Twitter of some nefarious deed of silencing his supporters.  What actually happened was they did a ban wave of all those aforementioned accounts and he had so many that the drop was noticeable to him.  Then like 4 days later his follower numbers shot up, and that's around the time I started seeing those bitcoin scams.

Edit to add: As to the second part of your question, I tend to think that his PR team absolutely tells him to pump the breaks on Twitter, but I highly doubt they give a shit about all the scams prevalent on his feed.

fdhgj2h,VictorCobra,38,"Hello bitcoinmarkets! Thought I'd pop in to share my current view on the market. I apologize in advance if there's a lot of info, but what I like doing the most is observing and analyzing what's going on––trying to figure out the puzzle. I'm also procrastinating on finishing my grad school essays, and decided to write on Reddit. Feel free to gloss over most of this post if you don't care or have the time.

Anyway, the last time I posted here, I talked about LTC forming a [potential bottom](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCUSD/JPg4VwKs-Comparing-Litecoin-Reversals-Why-The-Bottom-Might-Be-In/) near the $40 area, which told me that the rest of the market could also be forming a base. Since then, it has started to bounce after making a failed breakdown. My [last major long setup](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/FTual2W1-The-Last-Bullish-Setup-BTC-USD/) for Bitcoin was in advance of the 50w100w bullish MA cross. This produced a 100% move to the upside in 2016. It's taken a while to rise above both these moving averages after the cross, but it has finally happened. Since that post, I made [another analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8EEvSCr7-Bitcoin-Prints-A-Failed-Low-And-Tries-to-Form-A-Base/) showing that Bitcoin could indeed start moving up, since it also printed a failed low.

More recently, I made [a new projection](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/3FQS22D7-A-New-Bullish-Projection-For-Cryptos-500-700B-Possible/) for the total valuation of all cryptocurrencies, showing that we can head up to the $500 Billion level or even higher. This is my target zone to make a longer term swing trade, as I think something like [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/dIZQvrFT-What-Would-Happen-If-Crypto-Followed-Amazon/) could happen (comparison with Amazon stock). This may seem arbitrary, but if cryptocurrencies are going to be widely held and used, I think we may see a similar parabolic adoption curve. I don't think $10 Trillion is an unreasonable valuation for this market, *as long as people start entering again and crypto gets more positive exposure over time.*

I think we should still be careful, since the current $206-207B area was the breakdown point in November, 2018. I think we need to clear this pivotal zone, and then $230B to make room for a new market high in 2020. Otherwise, there's still the possibility of a failed rally. For all my charts, the Ultimate Oscillator (red) is showing a bullish [breakout on the weekly.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DEaduIfe/) We haven't seen this since the April Fool's pump last year, as the UO has been cooling off since June. This could indicate that there's real bullish momentum behind this move.

Alts are finding resistance at the 100d MA, just like Bitcoin, but interestingly enough, they're ALREADY testing their [downtrend channel resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NlOdYGx5/). I'm curious to see whether or not they continue to struggle there, losing on their ratios as Bitcoin moves towards its [own descending resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v2FpDY7M/) (around $8600-8700)...or if they break out altogether. [Dominance](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gJ1CZZll/) is at a decision point. It can either head up towards the high 70's/low 80's, or it could break down from the rising wedge, going as low as 50% quite quickly. Past market behavior tells us that alts may have to wait until Bitcoin at leasts tests ATH levels, but you never know. Serious crypto traders will probably want to be prepared, either way.

Thanks for reading! Good luck guys :)

This is amongst the best trading advice on this sub ever posted.

Reposted for posterity's sake. Please report me.

&gt; Quick guide on signals for /u/diydude2 emotions:

&gt; (NOTE: these signals are significantly stronger when the market is trending. Lots of false signals on range bound PA!)

&gt;Happydude = generally meaningless, but a sell signal if it's in a down trend

&gt; Saddude = doesn't exist, refer to Angrydude

&gt; Bearishdude = surprisingly good sell indicator, when diydude says it is time to sell, it's actually generally not been a horrible idea in the past, although he's been off a few times

&gt; Bullishdude = same as Happydude

&gt; Angrydude = strong sell signal, do not fade this one. An increasing number of curse words and personal attacks strengthens this signal significantly. Often accompanied by attacks on people's masculinity, accusing them of being weak and feminine or even gay

&gt; Quietdude = it is time to buy, diydude has either been banned or has finally been humbled by the market

&gt; Euphoricdude = surprisingly NOT a strong sell signal. oftentimes it is a good idea to buy when the dude is euphoric and no one else is, because he is unafraid of being prematurely bullish while others are hesitant to say so. 

&gt; Postydude = the more he posts, the stronger the signal for whatever other emotion he is exhibiting. He's angry and posting a lot? Gtfo. Euphoric and posting a lot? Consider skipping out on food for a few weeks and spend it on some bitcoin.

&gt; Keep in mind that identifying whether or not we are range bound or trending is the key. Otherwise lots of these signals become totally useless! 

&gt; Significantly more advanced, complex signals will be explored later.

&gt; Theories on the existence of certain emotions are highly controversial- e.g. Does diydude become angry at the top because he knows he should sell? Or is he angry because he hasn't been able to buy the dip in a while? Scholars continue to debate endlessly.*",2020-01-08 12:33:09

fdhi8uo,DCinvestor,25,"Don't worry, y'all. Bitcoin is not going into a full on bull market without ETH joining (and likely eventually overtaking) that party as investors seek alpha.

If you can't be patient enough to wait for that (especially if you have a personality which might draw you to FOMO at the wrong time), hold a bit of BTC so you can stop complaining. I hold 20% and sleep pretty well at night with everything else in ETH.

Remember, the lower the ratio gets, the less capital is needed to pump ETH to comparative oblivion *when it is time.* Right now, ETH is at around 1/10th of BTC (for total marketcap)...that's *a lot* of potential comparative gains possible when ETH does eventually move.

If you don't believe the thesis that ETH has the fundamentals and speculative potential needed to really outperform later in the cycle, that's fine- just sell your shit and move on.  I'll see you back here mid-cycle when everyone else starts to FOMO into ETH.

In the meantime, this market is far from a risk-on posture, and we could be many months away from big gains on the ratio...or mere days, or weeks as we continue to hug and start to peek out from under the downtrend line. I really have no idea, and that's why I'm not budging out of my ETH and have added about 30% to my position at these relative price levels in recent weeks.

I think that worked only pre-2017, if ever.   


I'd love to read streamlined thoughts about the real market situation instead of those shitty comments.   


I gladly give you my POV, but I don't claim to be accurate or right.   


A) Halving.   
The event the whole DLT world is looking forward too. Of course, it has some actual impact on the price, because the block-reward will be reduced by 50%, but the truth is that that doesn't mean we suddenly have so little Bitcoins on the markets that the prices are rising. That takes time. And the halving is \~5 months away. Anyway, I believe this thing means hype and bullish sentiment.   


B) After 2 Years of bear-market, people are craving for ROI and a solid bull.   
People want it to happen and they predict green candles, bottoms, and new liquidity streams left and right. (On Twitter and online communities at least. I consider that the effect of living in the crypto-bubble. It's impossible for me to know how people outside of our echo chamber think.) Rather bullish.   


C) Google trend-line for Bitcoin is inconclusive. ( [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=Bitcoin](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=Bitcoin) )   
Maybe it's the bottom, maybe it's a slow death. I really don't know.   


D) Geopolitical reasons... Iran etc. I am slightly bullish.   


  
E) Macro-economic reasons. People talk about a new bubble, zombie-banks, a world economy on the brink of collapsing. Some whales I talked to heard stories that family offices recommend to put 2% of their customer's money into crypto. Slightly Bullish.   


F) Scalability problems are still here. No real solution for the average joe is available. Lightning is promising but really just promising. Bearish.   


G) Bitcoin has a publicity and identity crisis. It's still seen as digital gold. No unity in the community and still too many bad players. Bearish.   


H) TA is inconclusive. TA and google trends kinda mirror each other. It's unclear where we are. And if it isn't a clear bull, I normally expect bearish moves. I'd say bearish sentiment.   


That's all I can think of right now.   


I appreciate other opinions and first and foremost why you are explicitly bullish or bearish.

fdhlc6z,bitusher,21,"&gt;Isn't CoinJoin just the Bitcoin equivalent of Laundering? 

Coinjoin is not money laundering unless the Bitcoins were obtained illegally. There are many legal reasons to desire privacy. Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of **money obtained illegally** by passing it through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. 

**If you buy,receive,mine bitcoin legally, than coinjoin it,  this by definition is not money laundering.**",2020-01-08 04:24:46
fdh8xik,bitvote,20,"if you live in the western world, it's tough to live large for very long on 24btc. even if you sold at the top of the bubble. 

and most people have a very hard time holding when the price starts going up. and up. and up. (or down as it also tends to do). 

I've seen it many times. People who _should_ be millionaires. Early adopters who were huge believers in bitcoin and then got cold feet at some point. One friend was an early miner, 2012-2013 time frame. Had a good number of coins. And then in mid 2015 he had a phase of being burnt out. Tired of the space and starting to doubt bitcoin's future. 

It only takes a few days of doubt to open the door to a sale that almost guarantees you'll never get to the same coin-level again. 

He sold a few hundred coins in the low $300's. Made more than 50x on his initial investment. From one perspective, that's pretty awesome. From another angle, it's probably the biggest financial mistake of his life...

But holding is hard. That's the simple truth of it.",2020-01-08 02:25:43

Nobody in first world countries who didn't own Bitcoin before is buying it now because of recent news. And why would anybody who already owns it buy more? More safety? Makes no sense. Maybe people in Iran are fleeing to BTC? Perhaps. But it's super difficult to buy there. There is no major exchange you can use to buy crypto. And there is no fiat on ramp for people there.

However, while I previously thought LN was likely to succeed, I'm no longer so optimistic. Partly due to the stagnation in growth over the past 9 months (signaling a lack of interest), but as well as a change in my general outlook.

LN was born out of the belief that Bitcoin needed to scale in orders of magnitude in order to facilitate small, daily transactions.

fdkcs93,Curious_Exploder,4,"The energy required to produce a bitcoin though, (and it's not happening just in China) might be what contributes to its inherent value. Also, China seems especially well equipped now to do this, because when they were going through their massive infrastructure expansion they inevitably built some ""roads to nowhere"" or rather, they built dams that produce energy that no one is using. So instead of just allowing these facilities go unused and make the expenditure completely fruitless, some entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the power these facilities are willing to sell for cheap (because no one wants it), to recoup some of the cost of the construction of the facility.

Edit: I should specify that my comment wasn't meant to disagree just contribute to the discussion. If these companies are actually causing the price of the market on graphics cards to skyrocket, which I think is probably true, then this increased demand should be met with increased supply in the next couple of years, we might see the prices of the current generation come down much quicker than previous generations the chip companies are all rushing to meet the needs of blockchain mining.

fdoewp1,harda,1,"Bitcoin Core's policy is to never release opt-in soft fork code in a major release such as 0.20.  They don't want to force users to accept the soft fork just because the users want to get the bug fixes and new features from the major version.  Instead, soft fork code is always released in its own point release (e.g. segwit was [0.13.1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.13.1/)).

With that in mind, a taproot soft fork in a 0.20.x version (not including backports) would have to be released after May 2020 (the [expected release date](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17432) for 0.20.0) and November 2020 (+6 months from May, the usual length of a version cycle).  Whether that's plausible is anyone's guess---for things like this where it's critically important to get everything correct, the policy is usually ""release when ready, no matter how long that takes.""",2020-01-10 06:03:39

Price may be influenced by content and length.

**Other Important Info:**

\- I charge 5$ extra for outfit requests. I also charge an additional 5$ PER any alterations to makeup or hairstyle or shoes.

Currently I usually start shows in just a low cut tank top/Tshirt and

panties or lingerie or i cycle through different types of lingere each day. If you want a little more, I offer

lots of different lingerie, sports wear, or normal clothes and shoes. But im always wearing something sexy.

\- I also Charge a 5$ increase per 10 mins on group shows as they require more organization and prep on my end.

\- I do not start my shows naked.

\- I have a standing rule that I call 'Three Strikes, you are out' Which means, I do not keep clients on my list

who pry, or make repeated contact but no payment, time wasters or rudeness. I understand things happen and

sometimes arrangements don't work out.. But i also think three chances is plenty. If after three chances you

find yourself unable to contact me and are unsure why, In all likeliness you have been blocked. This also applies

to clients who have paid before/have become regulars. The only way to become unblocked is to submit a payment

through my ad, (including your skype ID) and then i will unblock you and contact you for a show to avoid wasted time.

\- I also BLOCK without warning for the following reasons....Calling without payment, Unsolicited pictures,

dishonesty about payment, and asking for free shows, pictures etc. If you find yourself unable to contact

me after having done any of these things, Please follow the steps above in my 'Three Strikes, you are out'

Rule to become unblocked. Although you may earn the privilege to be unblocked, previous offenders are kept

on very short leashes and second time offenders are never forgiven. We are all adults, so act like it.

\- I always show as online on Skype because i am signed in on multiple devices to make reaching me easier.

If you message me I will get back to you as soon as possible. I however, do not always respond, as i may be

in a show or unavailable. The best way to reach me is messaging me immediately when you are ready to pay for

a show. I can't guarantee times and i don't really work on a schedule.

\- If you submit a payment without talking to me first, the show will be given at a time convenient for both

me and the client.

**By adding me on skype you are agreeing to these terms and understand that i am providing a service upon a**

**completion of payment**",2020-01-10 05:44:54

- Why is Bch pumping at the same time? Is BSV a threat to us at all, or not really?

So my dad's, coworker's, dad is some really rich oil tycoon fuck, very good with his money, and he told my dad's coworker about this Bitcoin trading website and hooked him up with some day trader. The coworker showed my dad how he had grown $1000 into almost $100,000 in the span of 2 months and he convinced my dad to get into it. While I was positive it was a scam, my dad still made a $250 investment because he felt that was something he wouldn't be in any financial danger if it ended up being a scam. 


Well a week after he made the $250 investment, it had risen to over $2000. My dad and I were still skeptical, so we decided instead of trying to let it keep growing, we would see if we could withdraw that $2000. To both of our surprise, it actually worked without a problem. My dad then pocketed his $250, and invested the rest back in, and within a week he was already sitting at $12,000. I make OK money for my area, but Ive got a lot of debt, so seeing it work the first time and then seeing how quick we were racking up money was such an insane feeling. 


Well my dad went to pull the 12g out because he wanted to start an account for me, and that's where it all fell apart. The guy started ignoring my dad, and knowing his first and last name, he started putting it into every social media he could think of. He managed to get a hit for the guys name on Instagram, and messaged the guy telling him to not be a fucker and stop ignoring him. Come to find out, the guy my dad found on instagram is actually a relatively popular bitcoin influencer/analyst (honestly idk what he actually does, but he seemed popular) and the guy on the trading website was just using his name to convince people he was some well known bitcoin guy.


Anyways, dumb story that no one probably cares about but I aint got none of them friend things to talk to so you all get to suffer lol. In the end everything was fine because my dad managed to get his initial investment back, but I've got to say the whole thing had me hella bummed. I went through a couple different emotional phases, feeling super ecstatic all the way to feeling like this wasn't something I should be doing/didn't earn, but now I actually feel okay knowing it didn't all pan.

I remember when Bitcoin was surging into the hundreds of dollars for the first time asking a friend if I should get some and him saying ""well not now, it just shot up"". And then I forgot about it. Then I heard about ETH and saw the price compared to bitcoin, I thought maybe I had shot at some big mulah. 

First ETH purchase was in June 2017 at $362 USD / ETH. Continued buying all the way down to $149 USD / ETH in July 2017 at which point I wrote it off as my being completely irresponsible and stupid for buying a falling asset with really no knowledge of it or the market. I didn't even know what Ethereum was, except that I had heard it was ""like Bitcoin but better"".I had almost no EXP with crypto. I didn't even know there were crypto communities like this one on forums like reddit. I remember I was abroad in Japan when I got the notification that I was in profit in August 2017. I frantically signed in and tried to sell, and because I was abroad there was an issue with my linked bank and I got a hold inquiry on my CB account for suspicious activity. I thought ETH was so volatile that if I didn't get my money out IMMEDIATELY I might never get the chance again. I was terrified of losing my money. 

Thankfully (or not given the next few months? haha) I got it sorted out and sold at $315 USD / ETH for an extremely mild profit, and was able to fund a few extra awesome excursions during my time in Japan. I totally wrote crypto off as out of my league after that. I then watched the madness of the bubble ensue and wondered if I was destined to be financially tragic. It wasn't greed (well maybe a little greed lol) but genuine interest that brought me back to ETH after that. That crypto bubble was unlike anything I had ever seen and I wanted to understand what was behind it. What I found was really much much more than I expected. I didn't understand the technology, the potential applications, the communities... None of it. 

I am really grateful I didn't completely scare myself off and took the time after the bubble popped to research ETH and get myself more familiar with the crypto market as a whole.

fe0k3w9,Zandrick,12,"That’s the point. The second thing you said, anyway. That actually pretty much the definition of fiat currency. It is created by a central organization, and has no value other than because of that organization. Runescape money is printed by Ruenscape and can be traded with other people, but it’s primary value is that it is traded back to Runescape. To buy Runescape stuff, swords and armor or whatever. Where Runescape to vanish tommorow in a puff of smoke, all the value of that money vanishes with it. 

Everyone wants gold. There is no gold god that prints and eats the gold. It just exists, and people use it for stuff, it has use in both art and scientific applications. And, critically, it’s rare. 

Poop from your butt, as you so elegantly put it, has no use, no one wants it. And most importantly, it’s infinite. 

There are three factors here. Where the thing comes from, the rarity of the thing, and it’s use. 

Bitcoin is rare, it’s not infinite, but, it has no use. You can’t stack a bunch of bitcoin into some shape and call it artwork or use it to conduct electrons like gold. People just want it, at least for now. 

To summarize. Bitcoin is kind of like poop from your butt, but not really, while Runescape money is the same as the US dollar.",2020-01-12 16:39:30

fdxoe4g,Peter__R,10,"If you look at the number of nodes _in consensus_, there are already more BU than ABC nodes: https://cashnodes.io.  There are ""zombie nodes"" that didn't bother to upgrade and are thus stuck at the last upgrade point.

#FAST INSTANT TRANSACTIONS

Although most miners use ABC, the fact that much of the network runs BU nodes is very helpful.  For example, the fact that instant transactions are so fast in BCH compared to BTC is because of the BU nodes.  The BU nodes very quickly relay new transactions across the network, such that nearly all of the important nodes on the network learn of new transactions in under 1 second.  Without the BU nodes, instant BCH transactions would be as slow as instant BTC transactions are, because ABC inherited the random delays that Core added to transaction propagation.


The large network of BU nodes will also be key to rolling out the two developments being worked on by Bitcoin Unlimited:  

#LONGER CHAINS OF UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTIONS

Several BU nodes on the network already support longer mempool chains, and wallets that connect to them can already send and receive deeply-chained transactions (e.g., up to chain lengths of 500).  We're in the processes of testing the security of deeply-chained transactions, setting up additional supporting infrastructure, and writing an article to document our work.  Our testing so far shows that long-chains should actually be quite useable and surprisingly secure even if NONE of the miners upgrade their mempool chaining limits.  The BU nodes will act as a ""network-wide mempool"" and push the transactions to the miners and other ABC nodes when they are ready to accept them.  The downside is that very deeply chained transactions won't be mined in the next block (they'll be mined in the one after that, or a later block), so it would be similar to if blocks were full and you needed to wait a while to see the confirmation.

#DOUBLE-SPEND PROOFS

Another initiative we're working on is double-spend proofs.  BU nodes will soon relay proofs that a transactions was double-spent to further improve the security of unconfirmed transactions.  SPV wallets will be able to take advantage of this too, as proofs for the transactions they care about will automatically be relayed to them. Miners relaying double-spend proofs isn't necessary for double-spend proofs to be useful.",2020-01-12 04:33:53

fdzs5wl,aescolanus,8,"That's a reasonable attitude to take, in isolation.  But people don't live in isolation.

Stonetoss is saying positive things about Bitcoin in a witty way with his unique style.  Great.  No problem with that message.  R/bitcoin users look at that positive Bitcoin comic and think ""smart guy, he thinks like me, I like him"".  And they come away with positive feelings about Stonetoss, because that's how people think - they like people similar to them, and they like people who agree with them.

So what happens when r/bitcoin readers see a Stonetoss comic in the future?  They think ""I recognize this style, smart guy, likes Bitcoin, I like him"".  And they're just a little bit more likely to read the new comic and just a little bit more likely to think positively of that new comic.  That positive past association predisposes them to like and trust future comics from Stonetoss.  

But Stonetoss is a literal neo-Nazi.  Hundreds of his comics contain subtle [(or not-so-subtle)](https://imgur.com/gallery/E0umAFU) racist and anti-Semitic messages.  And by giving Stonetoss a platform to spread a message that r/bitcoin readers like and trust, Reddit has given all those readers a bias towards looking at his racist and anti-Semitic comics positively.  And that little positive bias might be enough to push a reader from ""I don't agree with him, but he's funny"" to ""he agrees with me on Bitcoin, maybe his other beliefs are justified too"".  And down the white power ranger rabbit hole they go.  

And this is why deplatforming Nazis is justified - because when someone is known to promote a genuinely dangerous ideology, helping them build a positive reputation with your audience is a fucking horrible idea.

**The bad:**

fe5v6ba,Maegfaer,32,"Deflation of any major fiat currency *does* cause an economic collapse, but only because the real value of debts would increase, causing defaults, causing more deflation, causing even more defaults. The spending argument is indeed nonsense, there are plenty of goods that become cheaper every year yet sell very well. People don't wait to buy things that they want because it'll be a few percent cheaper next year. If deflation were consistent you'd be waiting until your life is over and never buy the things you need or want. Obviously that makes zero sense.

In the end, it's all about expectations. Current loans are extended with the expectation and thus conditions that there will be some inflation. Bitcoin loans could be extended in the future with the expectation of some deflation and so different conditions would apply.

Yes, deflation discourages lending compared to inflation and results in less economic activity. But if the current system indeed collapses due to the giant debt bubble that has been created, maybe that means that credit creation *should* be curtailed by deflation to keep the system sustainable. It's very unethical to let future generations pay the heavy price of economic collapse so we can have more growth in the present.",2020-01-13 09:34:32

fe4heyo,DCinvestor,25,"Later this cycle, I expect ETH to ""decouple"" in a sense- where ETH may make huge gains on the BTC ratio. I expect this with ETH as the #2 coin by marketcap, although it is only 10% of BTC's current marketcap. This means a little bit of money (comparatively) could pump it very hard and drive FOMO, and in other markets like this (e.g., precious metals), we see #2 assets outperform #1 assets during bullish periods (and conversely, underperform during bearish periods). I'll warn folks as it wouldn't surprise me to see BTC lead such a move before ETH really stands out.

The big difference with ETH this cycle is that I expect Ethereum's fundamentals will grow tremendously over the next two years, while for Bitcoin, I expect them to change less dramatically (aside from continued capital inflow, which arguably *is* a fundamental for Bitcoin if you believe those theses).

So I don't know how the market will react if/when ETH makes big gains on BTC this cycle. At some point, I expect ETH will give back less and less, potentially even reaching a point where the ETH marketcap is greater than BTCs. But who knows if/when this comes to pass...",2020-01-13 05:02:14
fe4w6vm,Vendor_BBMC,16,"This is a little off-topic, but hey. Nobody will mind me hijacking this dull thread.

All the marketplace DDOS attacks got me thinking:- We have powerful encrypted messenger apps like WIKR on phones. Could the technology be expanded to also have the features of a marketplace? The data doesn't need to be stored on the handset.

Marketplace data (like listings, profiles, feedback, balances, escrows, orders and photos) doesn't need to update in absolutely real time. Every 10 minutes will do. Why not store it in a decentralised blockchain, which the mobile apps on our phones access like they're mobile bitcoin wallets talking to a blockchain? 

Blockchains have been developed to be ultra-secure and un-hackable. Anyone hosting a copy of the ""blockmarket"" (running a node) could be paid a fee in cryptocurrency from the marketplace, based on it's up-time - like a miners fee. There is NO hosting site to subpoena, or central server to bust. And any vendor/customer chat is automatically encrypted by the keys on their handsets - just like WIKR, telegram, surespot etc

Marketplace admins (who are always a weak-point) could be done away with by allowing the market's users to voluntier for ""jury service"" in return for bitcoin payment from the market's profits. If a vendor and a customer have a dispute, they both state their case and a ""market jury"" of 3 or 5 users decide who gets the money in the escrow, or recommend banning a suspected scam vendor. The community wold be policed by odd-numbered bands of ordinary users. The majority decides.

fe47p2t,OsrsNeedsF2P,13,"Bitcoin (and further improved in Bitcoin Cash) solves this with chained transactions, where you can spend an unconfirmed input.

Btw: The question of ""Will merchants use this"" feature is very well answered if you actually try it yourself.

This also means that until Bitcoin Cash becomes the supreme leader, there will be plenty with a burning need to amplify any hint of division within the Bitcoin Cash community. 

Thank you Amaury and Roger and the many other KOLs for your dedication to Bitcoin Cash. I am thankful Bitcoin Cash has such great leaders and pity those that have to carry the dual burden of following their coin into the technical abyss while run by idiots and fools such as Adam Back and Craig Wright.",2020-01-13 11:53:07
fe5og51,stevengineer,11,"Purse.io connects to your metamask wallet and Amazon, and works through the mturks from Amazon who get paid in Amazon gift cards they can't cash out. So you say you want an item for X percent (you can literally set your discount) and then it goes to a marketplace behind the scenes and people trade Amazon gift points for your Eth or Bitcoin, at a discount since you are doing them a service as much we they to you by getting them cash they can use in the real world.

Now normally on large expensive items it can take a while to get selected by someone, so you gotta lower your discount. But in the $50-150 range I can routinely get away with 25-30% discount if I'm willing to wait an extra day or two for my item to arrive. So I often do this.

febkeea,sneakpeek_bot,11,"&gt; # Man out on bail for cheating charges allegedly kidnapped in Thailand

&gt; A Singaporean businessman facing cheating charges here was allegedly kidnapped and tortured in Thailand last week.

&gt; Despite paying his captors more than $60,000 in Bitcoin for his freedom, Mark Cheng Jin Quan, 32, claimed they were still going to execute him at gunpoint until he managed to escape.

&gt; The blockchain adviser with Singapore fintech company X Infinity said he reported the kidnapping to Thai police last Friday, hours after his escape.

&gt; He was worried about his Singaporean acquaintance, Kim Lee Yao Wei, 31, who had also been kidnapped after accompanying him on the business trip to Thailand.

&gt; But in a dramatic twist yesterday, the Royal Thai Police told a press conference that Lee was the alleged mastermind of the kidnapping and had been arrested and charged with robbery, illegal detention, physical assault and illegal possession of firearms.

&gt; FOUR CHARGES

&gt; Cheng was slapped with one charge under the Securities and Futures Act and three charges for criminal breach of trust in the State Courts here last year.

&gt; He is alleged to have dishonestly misappropriated more than $300,000 belonging to an investments company in 2014.

&gt; Cheng was given bail of $120,000 for permission to go to Thailand and Malaysia for work-related matters last Wednesday.

&gt; He reportedly arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok with Lee, whom he knew through Bitcoin dealings, on Thursday morning.

&gt; Cheng claimed Lee had persuaded him to go to Thailand and negotiate a business deal with some locals.

&gt; They took a private taxi at the airport and later stopped at a petrol kiosk along the way at Lee's suggestion, Cheng told Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao.

&gt; At the kiosk, a group of masked men allegedly grabbed and bundled them into a nearby car. They were then blindfolded, beaten and drugged.

&gt; Over the next 12 hours, he was taken to four different locations in forested areas where he was tortured, Cheng told Wanbao.

&gt; ""They took off my clothes, splashed ice water on me and gave me electric shocks. They demanded that I hand over US$1 million (S$1.3m) in Bitcoin,"" he said.

&gt; But he told them he could give them only 1.4 million baht (S$62,400) in Bitcoin. After he paid them, they took him to a hut in a padi field where they pointed a gun at his head.

&gt; He had earlier heard men digging what he believed to be a grave, he told Wanbao.

&gt; ""One of them held the gun against the back of my head while the others stepped away.

&gt; ""Fortunately, I know martial arts. I reached behind my head and grabbed the pistol, and then I fled,"" he said.

&gt; Royal Thai Police spokesman Colonel Krisana Pattanacharoen said a good Samaritan picked up Cheng at the side of the road and took him to Ongkharak Police Station, some 60km from Bangkok, where he made a report at about 7.30am last Friday, Thai news outlet Siam Rath reported.

&gt; Colonel Krisana added that Lee was arrested on Sunday in a Bangkok hotel after a manhunt.

&gt; Mr Chano Pemberger, a 24-year-old Thai actor, who allegedly owns the car used in the kidnapping, is currently a person of interest in the case, Thai news outlet Sanook reported.

&gt; Cheng is still shocked by the revelation that Lee had allegedly masterminded the kidnapping, Wanbao reported.

&gt; ""I didn't expect my friend to be involved. I really don't know who I can trust now,"" he said.

&gt; Cheng, who claims he is currently under police protection in a safe house in Thailand, is expected to testify in Lee's trial at a later date.

&gt; Cheng, who co-founded Avelife, a non-governmental organisation that focuses on social enterprise and the environment, is the first Singaporean to win the Queen's Young Leaders Award in 2016 for his involvement in environmental initiatives.

&gt; It is not known if he will return to Singapore for his next court hearing on Feb 3.

Bitcoin was created directly to divert the power of the banks and government, who are seen as siphoning wealth from the rest of society. It's limited in supply,  which an Austrian concept. Inflation, bailouts, and derivatives affected all of us negatively not so long ago, and many of us are concerned that the problem was only pushed down the road,  and that it will come back far, far worse than it got during the recession.  And seeing how Austrian thought criticizes the behaviors we see as leading to those catastrophes,  most of us who want to avoid the impact of future recessions and depressions look to the advice of the ""Austrans"": Save assets that can't be inflated (bitcoin in this case).

feep0km,jenbanim,2,"Nowadays it's not really right to say that Linux is fundamentally more secure than Windows. In both cases, as long as you're frequently updating and only running trusted software, you should be fine.

While Linux desktops have a smaller, more tech-savvy userbase, I don't think this is a major reason why it's more secure. Outside of desktops, Linux absolutely dominates the market share. The vast majority of cellphones, websites, and embedded systems run Linux. There's ample reason to target Linux with malware, and plenty of attempts have been made.

The real reason (imho) Linux is *generally* more secure than Windows is that it is built to make best-practices easy. By default, you're going to be installing software from a trusted central repository rather than browsing the web and downloading the first result that pops up on Google. That software is also going to be open source, which is not a guarantee of safety, but it massively reduces the risk of bad actors, like the time uTorrent decided to start running bitcoin miners on everyone's computers. Likewise, updates are quick and painless, which means there's very little incentive to put them off.

feebqnk,jamimonie,1,I’m having faith in God. I have had reply’s from Vlad I haven’t violated any TOS ....  all I did was let my account sit while I was doing hood for 4 years now it has been a while and they of course see a suspicion because I changed my email. I can understand their suspension and thank them for keeping my account secure. I am just wondering why now that all my info is verified why I am still under suspension. Vlad said that support left me instructions which I have followed to a T. I have given them every single piece of information that they have asked for and it all matches up. My mom had a problem with her check this month and I lost my job in December. I have been trying since then to get my bitcoin out to no avail.

Bitcoin was up 100% last year.  It's up 15% already this year.  We've been in a bull market for a year and will be in a bull market until the end of 2021.  Stop calling every little pullback from spikes caused by stupid shorts covering (which is what happened from April-June last year and what is happening now) a ""bear market"" and your life will be much more enjoyable.  

Bitcoin bears get slaughtered.  Sure, they have their periods of fun, but those periods are extremely expensive.  Just ask the guy who dumped it by selling 35,000 BTC for a million bucks.  I'm sure that was very fun for him.  He probably felt extremely powerful for a couple months.  But in the end, the enemies of Bitcoin get rekt.

fehnoei,MrRGnome,1,No they don't. As you note Bitcoin was created to be separate from those markets. The fact that the first block includes a british newspaper headline about german bail outs does not make monopoly the board game on topic for a Bitcoin discussion forum.,2020-01-16 05:30:27
fehlw14,vegarde,1,"Well, theft is still theft. Some, I'd say most, people still have morals. 

But I believe in a trustless bitcoin. One that minimizes this requirement of assuming honesty.

Binance is taking a large risk. There's actors out there that are not favourable to BCH that *has* a significant hash rate. If they make good on their promise on double spending exchanges, they are an easy target.

Ayone requiring more than 10 confirmations can probably relax as long as they validate against well-known bitcoin.com and Bitmain pool nodes. They'll override any 11 block reorgs they are not in agreement with.

It's well known know that  at least a lot of ""unknown miner"" is Squire Mining, which has close ties to Coingeek and Calvin.

Laughing as you torture your cock to please your domme, and lick up that cum for me when you’re done. And if you like findomme, you know you're going to have to pay that cum tax and more.

feho7vg,Chytrik,1,"And then what? Some subset of nodes on the minority chain network would agree on a checkpoint at some point in the past. The attacker would then cause havoc at the chain tip: the checkpoint would not stop this from happening. BCH has gained no meaningful security by doing this, just marketing value (supposed ‘protection’, which is in fact false). 

Note that Bitcoin-core has deprecated checkpoint functionality in newer versions, to be replaced by the `assumevalid` command option.

fehpni6,LovinglyRoughDomme,1,"# 👾 YOUR FIRST TASK IS TO READ THIS ENTIRELY: The sessions I offer are different from your usual ones

We will spend part of session time candidly discussing your boundaries, desires, and kinks - this is vital for our mutual enjoyment. If you have something specific in mind, let Me know in your initial message; a list of your kinks and limits is also a good place to start. Our sessions will all begin with guided conversation discussing such things. Be honest with Me and I will be honest with you. Do not be disrespectful to or of Me and I will honor your submissive nature.

# 👾 I never show My face unless I decide to do so

But, it is My absolute favorite thing to watch those I Dominate while in session with them. The visual is very exciting for Me. I don't require it during our sessions, but I adore seeing the effects of My words. If you wish to see Me the best way is to subscribe to My [Onlyfans](https://onlyfans.com/mistresskena) or [AVN](https://stars.avn.com/mistresskena).

# 👾 About Me

I do enjoy more overtly erotic kinky conversations, but need to get acquainted with a submissive first. Connection is of the utmost importance to Me. I have been involved in the D/s lifestyle for over 15 years and have known My Dominant side for almost as long. I am polyamorous and pansexual. Vanilla-wise I am very into video and board games, movies, swimming, dancing salsa, and pizza.

The connection and mental aspect of Domination is what I am all about. I want to partake in mutually beneficial activities and really get to know you and see how our kinks and interests line up. If you have found your past experiences to be fun yet empty, perhaps it is time to spend time with Me. Lets connect.

# 👾 Some of My favorite kinky interests

* Cuckold
* Male chastity
* Forced Bi
* Humiliation
* Orgasm control/tease/denial
* Sissification and/or Crossdressing/panty wearing

fehq8ld,CannedCaveman,1,"Thanks! Fees are 1sat/b for weeks now, but who cares about facts right?

Watchtowers are for Lightning and not Bitcoin, the same goes for channel factories. LN is just a tool and can be implemented on other chains as well, even on BCH!

If you want to run your own full node then you can buy a Raspberry Pi4 and a cheap 1 TB Hdd, so for under $100! I can link you to an online store if you want.

But again, who cares about facts right? Especially if you are willing to give up censorship resistance, decentralization and immutability for a temporary fix for lower fees. 

Apparently you think fees are the problem in the current financial system and not the fact that we have to trust central banks and governments to not fuck up our money like they do now. You just jump to a world where you need to trust miners with huge serverfarms to tell you what the Bitcoin supply is and how many Bitcoin you own.

That’s what I mean about getting frustrated with people like you. You don’t even realize how you are giving up the unique characteristics of Bitcoin for something you already have right now with Paypal and credit cards.",2020-01-16 05:55:05
fehnxop,TechCynical,1,"Not very different based on the whitepaper for the LN. Your right however it's not comparable since the decentralization in today's LN is far more centralized than bch today in anyway. And yes bch can do LN you living under a rock? It's implementable and cheaper to run than btc and it's LN start up costs. And btc is far more centralized given its 1mb blocksize where fees can rack up so big you can buy an entire hard drive to store the blockchain with the amount in fees you pay over a few transactions. 

Personally I think it all sucks and none will succeed long term. They're all shitcoins including btc and only have a name brand to keep them alive.

If you want real p2p cash then visit nano who's decentralization only gets stronger the more people use it. And who's voting power at one point a month ago was so distributed it was more decentralized than bitcoin in governance.",2020-01-16 05:32:56

Just as it is possible to believe that veterans should receive proper benefits and treatment while also believing military expenditures should be sharply reduced, so too is it possible to think that Bitcoin is an interesting and innovative digital currency implementation while also believing that the existence of a Federal Reserve (or, more generally, a lender of last resort) is ideal.",2020-01-16 05:53:25

That's exactly what's occuring in cancel culture.

&gt;That's why they like stuff like bitcoin so that paypal cant tell you 'we don't like you buying that ' and blocking their payment.

Exactly. They don't like paypal, so they don't give them business. If paypal pulled something especially egregious, they'd get cancelled.

&gt;You get freedom, you accept that you shouldnt use that to curb the freedom of others just because they like something you don't like.

fehuau9,brokester,1,"Thats what i dont understand.

1. For arguments sake lets say craig wright gets his \~1Million Bitcoin. Wouldnt this completly fuck the market since the supply goes up but the demand stands the same? Therefore the prices will go down?
2. On the other hand, if big whales buy a lot of crypto and suddenly he doesnt get the 1 million btc, the prices will go to the moon or stagnate since the big whales limit the supply(until they sell and the price dumbs yet again).

Think 2. is a very likely scenario. Tho, am i missing something?",2020-01-16 06:33:27
fekc5dm,Ant-n,1,"&gt;This is a perfectly correct opinion. Adoption is very important. The question is only, what is the use case. And what use cases can be solved in a sustainable way (= ledger doesn't grow too fast). However, during ""normal"" times, like currently, a Bitcoin transaction is with high probability settled with lowest fees (1-3 sat / byte) within 1-2 hours. That means, paying $0.02 - 0.20 Dollar for a transaction.

Problem of BTC is reliability.

Tx price and confirmation time are unreliable.

Even though they are acceptable today, they can go the thought the roof tomorrow in case of even a marginal increase tx demand.

That why steam, microsoft, tether all turned away from crypto.

BTC is not a good tool as a mean of exchange and it loss adoption for it.

&gt;	And what use cases can be solved in a sustainable way (= ledger doesn’t grow too fast). 

There is none, blockchain are permissionless, if you want a garanteed small ledger, you have to restrict capacity.

It will come with a cost (high cost) therefore your chain will give in any use case that rely on low cost.

Typical disruption come from producing a service at much lower cost than before.



&gt;Bitcoin and Monero are very good stores of value, although they are currently not the best solution for micropayments (&lt; $10) in case the whole world used them for every payment (scaling impossible). I’m talking about billions of people doing multiple daily transactions.

Honestly we don’t know.

It is just the beginning, while I cannot see BTC scaling to wordwide use simply because of development choices and Monero because it is more ressources intensive, I can see BCH (and Bitcoin as it was first envisioned) 

Lot of optimization are possible to reach massive scale on BCH.. **and** very importantly that would bring huge fee revenue toward PoW and make it sustainable when block reward will be over.

Unfortunately not many people seem interested in long term sustainability in crypto it seems.



&gt;Would I ever want to store value in Ethereum? No! Because it’s maybe a world computer, but it’s not a store of value. Ethereum reminds me a lot of projects like SETI@Home, but it’s not «  digital gol » ». And when they give up the Eth 1.0 blockchain, because it is too large in a few years, it will leave a catastrophic scratch in the bran«  « Ether »um » a.k.a. VitalikCoin.

What is the problem here? I don’t think ETH was ever built as a store of value?

But if you ask me, I would not discard ETH so quick, it see a huge amount of usage and adoption.. it can very be one of the first cryptocurrency project to be more value on usage than speculation, that would make it a good store of value. You don’t want to rely on speculation alone for a store of value.

&gt;Yes, but for pruned nodes it is only a 51% attack for a short piece of the tip of the blockchain, so much easier.

No, as I said before a pruned node fully verify data before it deleting it.

Such attack wouldn’t work.

Although it would work on a BTC node on default setting and a node using UTXO commitment.



&gt;Rather unlikely scenario.

&gt;Yes, 99% unlikely. But you see why Bitcoin was invented... attacking Bitcoin and Monero is 100% unlikely.

It is possible to prune monero node too

&gt;A miner that own 51% of the network hash rate can basically decide what goes in the chain or not.

&gt;Yes. But what is the motivation of the miner, to control it? At least no economic incentives. This is actually why fees are important: Fee pressure ensures that miners are constantly including as many transactions as they can. If transactions are too cheap, it makes the network less censorship resistant.

&gt;Maybe if a dystopian state was a 51% miner, it would do that for political enemies. But since serious crypto projects are internationally distributed, it is hardly doable for a single s’ate’s political party to control 51% of international hash power.

Then miner should be as decentralized as possible.

High fee prevent small miner from participating and heavily impact negatively mining decentralization (when your payout is $10 worth of BTC then a $1 fee can be enugh to ear up all your profit)

&gt;Yes, we currently see centralization of PoW hashrate in countries with cheap energy, but we will see how it develops in the future. This trend was like everything in this game, a predictable development.

This trend is unavoidable I agree.

High fee make it worst by making small participants unprofitable.

&gt;The risk with 51% is not that a miner will reverse a transaction (he can only reserve transactions he own the private key from)

&gt;51% attacks rewrite history, whole blocks become invalid. History is rewritten for everyone that had settled transactions in the attacked blocks.

The attacker can reject a confirmed transaction that’s correct, not steal your coin. The miner would need your private key for that.


&gt;He can blacklist transactions, cancel transactions, change the network characteristics (basically activate any soft fork he want	..  
&gt;  
&gt;**and** you node will accept it, because he will be producing a valid chain.

&gt;’hat’s true. But I’don’t care so much. As long as my node can prevent hardforks’ it’s fine.

It is a soft fork, by definition a 51% produce a valid chain.

That’s why it is dangerous, because all node will accept the new chain.



&gt;I think we all know that Bitcoin and Monero have a few critical characteristics like mining reward curve / halving, block size constraints, and so on that must not be changed without consensus. As long as a 51% attacker cannot change these properties’ it’s worth running a node.

Correct a 51% is basically a soft fork made without consensus pushed by a single entity.

That why they are dangerous.

&gt;The question is, is a pruned node enough or should it be a full node’ It’s a matter of personal opinion. Of course you can « ay « there are enthusiasts that will always run full  »odes ». Yes, maybe that’s true. But maybe I feel safer running my own full node.

Ok but making the whole network unreliable and killing his potential worth it?

If really auditing the chain has to be cheap, why not reducing the block limit further? 250GB is already a lot.

And what is your opinion on BTC not verify the whole blockchain data? Did you change your settings? (Data is actually not verified here, much worst for security than pruning)

&gt;In my opinion the current state of science and technology allow for 2 types of crypto currencies: Sustainable store of value (Bitcoin, Monero, Grin, ...) and unsustainable super fast, super cheap digital cash. I think it is better to choose the sustainable solution, because crypto currencies are meant to run forever and not only for 10 or 20 years until they collapse.

I strongly disagree BTC choice of low capacity is a sustainable choice.",2020-01-17 02:49:28

feke4vk,solarguy2003,1,"You're not wrong....

Dash has InstantSend that works today.

Bitcoin has the Lightning network that *might* catch on *someday* despite the fact that the economic game theory won't help that adoption rate at all.

Dash has optional on-chain privacy mixing and you can choose how mixed it is.

Bitcoin just doesn't have that.  You could use some 3rd party mixing service, if you trust *them.*

Dash is self funded through the treasury.

Bitcoin kinda ran on donations and generosity until Blockstream took them over.  Blockstream, perhaps coincidentally, is full of banksters. 

BitCoin prevents 51% attacks by.....ummm........hoping for the best from their mining community.  It's not like anybody ever threatened to burn BitCoin to the ground through a mining war.  Oh wait.........Craig Wright did that.

Dash invented Chainlocks, and now Dash is effectively immune to 51% attacks.  This allows Dash the luxury of discussing how much and what kind of mining we really want and need to keep the Dash blockchain secure without wasting resources/electricity/money.  

Dash transactions are very cheap, and designed to stay that way.

Bitcoin transaction costs are volatile, depending on how clogged up the mem pool is.  You didn't want to buy coffee with Bitcoin anyway, did you?

Dash has an actual governance mechanism.  We solved the ""double the block size"" question in a day and never looked back.  

Bitcoin argued about it very publicly for two years and damaged their reputation repeatedly and never did solve the problem.  So the community split over it.  And then split over it again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong here, I got into the space because of Bitcoin.  Long may she live.  BitCoin is not the enemy of Dash. Our use cases have become very different.  BitCoin is 186 times better than most of the funny money printed by governments out there.

RYO imo is a crappy coin. its a fork of SUMO which was a failure.

XMR is barely used as it is. as goes with adoption of payment coins in general, its just worse for privacy coins at this time.

I'm not going to do the math, but I'll still assert a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon has a bigger effect on market supply (as in the amount of bitcoin actually available for purchase) on that particular day.  

New issuance has less and less to do with the amount of bitcoin available to buy every day, not just every every halving.  The vast, vast majority of supply available to buyers is coming from market participants who are choosing to sell or not, not from miners covering costs.  New btc issuance is $16 million today while reported volume even adjusted down to filter out over-reporting from bad exchanges is billions.  Even in 2018's bear market, reports were that unreported OTC volume was several multiples of reported exchange volume.

Further, look at the price action from the bottom of the 2014 crash to the prehalving runup and the post halving crash in 2016 and it looks very similar to the price action we've already had from the bottom of the 2018 crash to the top of the 2019 recovery and correcting from there.  Bitcoin dominance during this time period also supports that a lot of frontrunning against the halving speculators has already happened.  

I very much believe (and have since the fall: https://twitter.com/cachenode/status/1185283295053004801 ) we're getting close to the early 2017 portion of the price action.  Recent ratio action is at least suggestive that the engine to drive those lovely early 2017 ratio moves is turning over as we speak.  At the end of my link, from october, I said watch the btc.d chart for confirmation.  [It finally confirmed a h&amp;s with a target that would breach a 2 year supporting trend.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/viIk87x3/)  If btc.d doesn't bounce off that trend and actually reaches the target, revenge of the alts will ensue.

Will the btc price rise around the halving?  I would imagine so, but it matters whether that's the type of rise that happened in early 2017 where alts outperformed massively, or whether it's the type of rise from the 2016 halving.  Twitter and reddit seem to be expecting a 2016 style rise.  I think that particular move already happened.",2020-01-19 05:11:35

&gt;Stellar Foundation holds ~60% of all XLM in existence, creating a central point of failure and strong degree of centralization risk for the project writ large

I can understand why this is concerning to people, but you can read more about the Stellar mandate [here](https://www.stellar.org/foundation/mandate) on how those XLM will be used.  There is also some comfort (in my opinion) knowing that SDF is organized as a non-profit, so there are no founders/investors entitled to share of profits. 


&gt;Network contains only ~35 validators which are heavily centralized around SDF nodes creating network-wide vulnerability

Actually, the list you link shows closer to 80.  I agree that it could still improve though! And 2019 was great in this regard.  Keep in mind also that unlike POW protocols, which require a lot of validators to decentralize the network, the total number of validators needed on Stellar is significantly lower.  


Second, I wouldn't put too much weight on those other articles, without going in to too much detail... they are just outdated.  As stated, ""the figure shows the structure of the quorum slices on January 22, 2019.""  However, A LOT has changed over the last year, including major steps in decentralization.  Today, the network has decentralized away from SDF's validators, as recently discussed [here](https://www.stellar.org/blog/a-look-back-and-a-look-forward-for-2020/) by SDF in their year-end blog looking back on 2019 (""This group of Tier 1 validators is mature enough at this point that we could turn off our nodes and the network would keep going!"") and recently [here] (https://stellar.expert/blog/stellarexpert-validators-quorum-set) by one of those Tier 1 validator operators (""When the Stellar mainnet was deployed, most of the validators depended on the SDF quorum set, delegating voting power to SDF. Now it is a fully decentralized network."")

&gt;Small team (~7) control the majority of the development work

SDF is much larger than that... according Denelle's blog, which is linked above, ""SDF has grown fivefold [in 2019]- up from 11 to 56 employees.""


&gt;No financial incentive (like a mining reward in the Bitcoin protocol) to become a node, which could lead to a dearth of nodes and node centralization

It's comparatively cheap to run a validator b/c of the significantly less energy that's needed, and while its true that there is no direct financial incentive (i.e. mining), there are incentives.  A business building on Stellar has major incentives to help secure the network that its business depends on, and compared to Bitcoin validators (whose only incentive is financial), these validators become much better partners.   Not to disparage the miners on Bitcoin, but the big ones have largely been anything but good partners.  In my opinion, due in full because of how the incentives work on POW protocols.

&gt;Questionable response by the Stellar team to disclose a bug that was discovered (and patched) in 2017

Is this (below) the questionable response you're referring to?  This is what is given as their response in the link you provided.  I guess I fail to see what's questionable about that. 

""We mentioned it twice, in fact, in the notes, and we were very clear the bug had been exploited. From there, we took the additional step of burning Lumens to “true up"" the supply, so that current $XLM owners wouldn’t be diluted and our projected total supply would remain accurate. We recognize that Stellar has since become significant financial software, and our disclosure standards have grown to reflect that reality. There’s been no notable bug since, and if there were we would disclose it in full detail as soon as it was patched. As we announced last month in our 2019 Roadmap we have already committed to a full accounting of all of SDF’s Lumens by the end of the year, and more details around this old bug were going to be (and still will be) part of that.”",2020-01-19 09:23:54

fesboc5,Pasttuesday,7,"Some examples of funds I have locked up - 

I own both eth and wbtc (wrapped bitcoin on ethereum so you can be exposed to bitcoin price but able to use it on ethereum). I’m not sure which is going to make a bigger run when the bull starts, and maybe it’ll just chop around for a long time. I can’t earn much interest on eth or wbtc, so I take an equal fiat dollar amount of each and interact with uniswaps smart contract to become a liquidity provider. I “lock” up the equal fiat amounts of eth and wbtc and others when trading in and out of each use my liquidity to trade. I earn a portion of trading fees here. You can do this with any pair of tokens on ethereum - BAT/LINK, ETH/DAI etc. 

I used my eth as collateral on makerdao to take out a loan in dai to be margin long on eth. I’ve also used the dai to sell for fiat on Coinbase to pay a few bills as I wanted to stay exposed to eth instead of selling. A portion of my crypto buys each month go towards dai now to pay off that loan. When I have it paid off I can “unlock” my eth. 

I have some eth “locked” up in token sets. Tokensets is a smart contract which automatically utilizes popular trading strategies trying to maximize eth returns without needing babysit the trades. Sets include trades between dai and eth and btc and eth. Think there may be others but those are the ones I’m aware of. Popular trading sets trade on the MACD or something (I don’t know much about trading strategies but it’s been good so far)

I don’t have eth locked, but I have dai locked in pool together. You can earn interest on dai on compound.finance or fulcrum. Pool together is a no loss lottery. How it works is people “lock” up their dai, and all the dai that’s put into the smart contract is then used to get interest. Each week the smart contract randomly draws a ticket. Each dai you put in is 1 ticket. If you win, that weeks interest earned from all the dai put into the smart contract is awarded to the person who owns the ticket drawn. If you don’t win, your dai is automatically put towards the next weeks drawing. You can withdraw at any time.",2020-01-19 01:06:19

As an example, lets say my teacher is explain blockchain and bitcoin, and a thought came to my mind that “What if he (the teacher) is trying to express something that exists in my original species’ world?”. Every person that I see is trying to give clues about my original world, trying to make me self aware of where the fuck I am. Elon Musk, giving clues like creating futuristic rockets and electric cars like Cybertruck. The Avengers, giving an insight to how my original species \*might\* look like (the Chitauri and such). Obviously these signs are being suppressed because we are being tested upon by someone else, and they don’t want us to know that we are in enclosed in the virtual world. What is the escape? For me the sad answer is, suicide. You don’t commit suicide because #mylifesucks, but you come upon the self realisation that you are trapped in the virtual world, and the escape from it is suicide.

fezr6tp,aaj094,7,"Halving and whether it is or can get 'priced in' always fascinates me to no end when i think about it. So here is a scenario:

Supposing there is a community who consumes tomatoes. They obtain a regular supply from farms and thus there is a certain price for the tomatoes prevailing. Today, news arrives that half of the farms will stop producing tomatoes from 4 months later. Now the price of tomatoes would be expected to go up immediately but consider why. It is because the community consumes tomatoes and manywould like to buy more today itself so that they can keep the tomatoes in their freezers and thus be able to maintain their consumption even after the supply becomes insufficient to provide for the whole community. It is the rich guys inthe community who become willing to pay more today to be able to stock up today's supply for later. Note also that this argument works because tomatoes are a consumption good i.e they get eaten up and disappear from the earth.

Now back to Bitcoin. We know certain demand exists today and we know new supply halves after four months. But bitcoin is not a consumption good. It never disappears like tomatoes (forget lost wallets, etc). There is no reason for existing demand to suddenly want to stack up more Bitcoin now other than for greater speculation purposes. Therefore, even if halving is known to be arriving, the price dicated by current interaction of demand and supply has no definitive reason to want to stack up more Bitcoin unlike the tomatoes case. Even if they do, they will release this Bitcoin as sales after the price reaches higher. In general, Bitcoin is held by people as a % of their portfolio and such allocation is usually a fixed investor preference. When halving finally does come, the new demand that comes in daily (and continues to aim to allocate a % to their portfolio) now has fewer new coins to get and therefore must bid up prices to get bitcoin from existing holders. This is what will cause rise of price post halving.

'Pricing in' of post halving price can only occur if a large part of the demand today actively increases their risk preference and takes on a higher % of bitcoin into their overall portfolio. THis is not the same as the behavior of folks who bid tomatoes higher so thatthey can store and preserve their ability to consume them. In my opinion, risk preferences of asset holders as a whole do not just change suddenly due to even known events in the market. The tomato bidders were not taking on risk, just ensuring their ability to consume whereas if bitcoin is to have halving priced in now, you have to make a very bold assumption that existing Bitcoin demand has a coordinated move of taking on higher risk by accepting higher % of bitcoin in their portfolios for a few months prior to halving. This could happen but then it will be termed as something similar to what happens in Bitcoin bubbles and not a normal reaction of the market to known information.

TLDR - I don't see the possibility of Bitcoin halving being 'priced in' as being in the same league as consumption commodity prices adjusting upwards immediately when a future supply shock becomes known.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Another simple way to see why, 'pricing in' of halving, if it occurs, is of bubble form is to see this:

If the price pre halving does reach what is anticipated as the fair price dicated by interaction of demand vs post halving supply then then the big holders could easily dump their stacks at the 'priced in' price and this dump combined with the non halved pre halving supply will immediately cause a crash. This demonstrates that if at all price tries to catch up now with what should be post halving price, it is necessarily a very unstable price that could crash down any time. This again shows that 'pricing in' even of known future supply shocks is not a natural market reaction for an investment good like Bitcoin.",2020-01-20 04:03:37

ff2bofk,jstolfi,7,"Some of the funniest events, in no particular order:

Jeff Epstein, alleged billionaire and notorious child sex trafficker, was jailed on new charges and died in jail before it could testify against its accomplices and clients.  But, still, it came out that he was a bitcoin fan and a big donor to the MIT Media Lab, in spite of MIT having a ban against his donations.  Media Lab director Joi Ito, one of  the early investors in Blockstream, had to resign after leaked emails showed him telling his financial officer to hide Jeff's donations to the Lab from the MIT trustees.   Not clear how Jeff's death and Ito's resignation will impact the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a research project hosted at the Lab and funded by unknown donors, which pays the salary of Core's chief developer Wladimir Van Der Laan.

Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX collapsed in mostly the standard way; except that owner Gerald Cotten, instead of simply fleeing like Cryptsy's Paul Vernon, died unexpectedly in India during a honeymoon trip.  Allegedly, the private keys to QCX wallets, holding more than 200 M CAD in clients' coins, were known only to him. However, investigations showed that he had squandered most of the clients' bitcoins and dollars in bungled speculations.  Disgruntled clients asked for his body to be exhumed and examined, to make sure that it is indeed his.

Australian big-time tax ~~fraudster~~ miner Craig S. Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto and produced tons of falsified evidence to prove it.  He left Australia days before his home was raided by the Aussie police, and convinced online gambling baron Calvin Ayre to back his new cryptocurrency company, nChain, in return for the promise of hundreds of patents on cryptocurrency technology.

A complicated investment scam called TheDAO was created in 2016, using  Ethereum's smart contract mechanism.  Billions in ETH were invested into it, including by Vitalik and major ETH miners.  Then a hacker exploited a bug in the smart contract and stole most of the coins that had been ""invested"" in it.  Then Vitalik, with support of the major ETH miners, junked the holy ""code is law"" principle and changed the protocol to undo the hack and recover most of the coins. The coin suffered a split over that issue, but the branch that rejected the fork (ETC) currently has only ~~8%~~ 5% of Ethereum's market.  Nevertheless the price of ETH did not suffer because of the fork.  On the contrary, ETH proved to be the ideal vehicle for investment scams, with thousands of new coins created on top of it via smart contracts.

The Church of Bitcoin suffered a major schism in 2017, and the coin split in two:  Bitcoin Core, that claimed the title of ""Bitcoin"" and the ""BTC"" ticker, remained in control of Pope Greg Maxwell;  and Bitcoin Cash, with new ticker BCH, led by heretic Roger ""Bitcoin Jesus"" Ver.  Greg kept the 1 MB block size on BTC, in the hope of it creating a ""fee market"" that was a key ingredient of his plan to reform bitcoin.  BTC traffic hit that limit in early 2016, and the coin became unusable because of unpredictable fees and  delays caused by congestion; but there is no sign of the ""fee market"" yet. BCH has a 32 MB block size limit, but so far it commands only a few percent of bitcoin's traffic and price.  Another schism of BCH, a year later, created  Bitcoin Satoshi Vision or BSV, led by Craig ""Satoshi"" Wright.  One distinguishing feature of BSV is that it allows insertion of a large (multi-megabyte) arbitrary file in a single transaction. A child porn picture was promptly uploaded to BSV's chain, but everyone pretended not to notice.

Due to general boycott by banks, many crypto exchanges -- led by Bitfinex -- shifted from national currencies to a dollar surrogate called USDT.  It can be moved and traded anonymously like any cryptocurrency, but its issuance and mining is centrally controlled by a company called Tether, created by the same people who own Bitfinex.  Tether claims that each USDT is backed by one USD in their reserves, and hence can be assumed to be worth the same.  They have issued about 4 billion USDT, but have not provided any real proof that they hold any of the corresponding USD.  In fact, they had to admit that they had at most 3/4of that amount.  But it does not matter anyway, since their ToS does not oblige them to redeem USDT for USD. Nevertheless butters keep trusting USDT as if it was worth 1 USD.  Those 4 billion USDT are believed to be responsible for pumping the price of bitcoin to the current 8600 USD/BTC.

""Blockhain technology"" -- using the blockchain structure for non-currency applications, like tracking Walmart lettuce from farm to hospital, became the new computer technology fad for a while, but then faded as fads are fated to do. It will not be missed.

It reminds me of a recent story from [Peter Schiff](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchiffReport/featured), whom I listen to regularly (he's libertarian and genius on politics and economics/banking; not so smart on Bitcoin). Anyway Peter mentioned he got in trouble with the IRS, which is unusual because he, unlike [his father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Schiff) who died in jail protesting the government, complies with the tax system.

One year he forgot to file a single form. He had put a house in a trust for his kid and forgot to file the correct tax form, or at least his accountant did. The IRS fined him $200,000! He wasn't evading taxes and the property showed up elsewhere too if I recall, but it was a simple honest mistake, a clerical error. Anyway when he got the news he asked his tax lawyer if he'd heard of the 8th Amendment. Here is the text:

*Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.*

Peter said if a $200,000 fine for not filing a single form wasn't an example of an excessive fine in violation of the 8th Amendment he didn't know what was. So he wrote back to the IRS and said he'd keep listeners updated. He said he didn't want to but was prepared to fight the matter up to the Supreme Court if needed, noting that if he was successful it would be a win for all Americans because it would set precedent and relieve them similarly.

1. Even in people who are bullish on Ethereum and advocate it, they don’t know about eip 1559 and it’s potential effects on supply. Many reference the lack of a supply cap making it worse as a store of value than bitcoin. 

2. These same people don’t realize that our inflation even without eip 1559 will be lower than bitcoin in a couple of years. 

These are people who are bullish on eth so people who don’t even have eth on their radar are probably completely oblivious. I believe this information asymmetry will lead to people who are heavily investing in eth to become pretty wealthy once these things become common knowledge.",2020-01-22 06:16:38

I can’t stress how true this is. Very perceptive of you for picking up on that. On one hand, it’s kind of frustrating. But on the other, when I understand a Youtuber’s role in all of this (they’re essentially news reporters), although it’s frustrating to see them not up to date or to see them spread misinformation, it only furthers the difference in perceived value vs. actual value. 

And a youtuber’s lack of awareness of what EIP-1559 is and what effect it’ll have doesn’t negate its existence or effect whether it get adopted. It just means that those youtubers are behind on the news that they’re spreading. It’s unfortunate, but it’s also an opportunity that can potentially be very profitable for the people who are aware of that information gap.",2020-01-22 06:24:47

ff77pqp,cryptorebel,2,"Craig is Satoshi the one who invented Bitcoin. Dr. Wright already proved it privately to many prominent people that have vouched for him based on cryptographic as well as social evidence.  For example [Ian Grigg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6lfz1o/ian_grigg_says_craig_wright_and_dave_kleiman_was/), [Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and [Jon Matonis](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a), among others. Many haters and cult members don't like it, and don't want to accept that evidence and I guess they claim it was some elaborate magic trick hoax. 

The [Tulip Trust](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644014-Tulip-Trust-Redacted.html) is some mysterious trust Dr. Wright was using to hold millions of Bitcoin. There is an ongoing lawsuit with Dave Kleiman's estate over the coins. Dave helped Dr. Wright creating Bitcoin and they were friends but he died several years ago, and now his brother Ira Kleiman is suing Dr. Wright for a portion of the coins. Dr. Wright has said that Dave is owed some coins, but the amount is in question. When the case is resolved we may see coins move on the blockchain as a result of court order or settlement agreement which would shoot down a lot of the doubters about Dr. Wright being Satoshi. But that is just speculation we really don't know what will happen, just have to wait and see.  But in the end if does not matter who Dr. Wright is, all that matters is BSV is following Satoshi's vision and mining world record blocks and trying to spread sound money to the world. +/u/BitsTipper 0.01 bsv verify",2020-01-22 06:39:19

I'm looking forward to the day when a significant portion of the population will keep at least a small portion of their savings in bitcoin.  In my mind, this is the ideal use case and could provide a lifeline for those who just want to buy basic medical supplies or diapers like those in the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's keep our eyes on the prize and work toward providing that lifeline.  In my mind we need volatility to continue dropping (it seems to be happening little by little), continue investing in scaling tech (LN, pegged sidechains, Schnorr, etc.), and UX.  I'm optimistic on all these fronts.

As for what you should buy, A) Everyone has their own favourite horse they are backing, just take it slow and do your own research, B) Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are generally considered the safest choices, and therefore most beginner friendly. If what you like about cryptocurrency is the privacy angle, Monero (XMR) is by far the most popular privacy coin.

Just take it slow. If you feel a panicky fear that you have to act now or you will miss the opportunity of a life time, that's called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), and it's a bad voice. Don't trust it. Come back tomorrow. Read more.",2020-01-22 02:38:43

I think the value of gold standard comes in that it makes it really hard to cheat (other benefits as well but in the modern world this is the main one). Since I can go exchange my currency for gold at any time it is hard to just run the printing press. 

With that said, I agree with you that in the age of the blockchain this may be outdated. If we accept that Cryptocurrency is essentially impossible to counterfeit then we don't need the gold standard qua gold standard any more. 

Honestly I think something like bitcoin, which isn't tied to any numbers that can be manipulated but is tied to the functioning of a ""payment system"" is probably how that should run. 

It is infinitely divisible so it can continue to function under deflation. The only question being if a currency can actually function under a set amount (like Rothbard claimed) or if we do need some system to grow the money supply over time.",2020-01-23 01:30:57

The miners obviously want to spend 6 million USD on BCH infrastructure.

Human greed has destroyed the Bitcoin invention and its currency variants. You people just don't see it yet. 

The Bitcoin invention is eleven years old now and what has the Bitcoin community accomplished? Constant political conflicts and short sighted greedy egotistical disagreements, hostile takeovers and power grabs, stagnating user adoption and market cap growth to irrelevantly small sizes. The central bankers must be observing us and laughing their asses off. They don't need to destroy us when we keep destroying ourselves. 

I really should stop commenting now because what's the point. It's a bad and futile habit to try to correct people on the internet who will never change their opinions anyway. Your personal greed is blinding you people from the big picture and how great things could be for us all if people would be just slightly less greedy and short term egotistical.

ffgjfoo,px403,1,"Gavin has always acted in the best interests of the community, and humanity as a whole. He joined the community by setting up the bitcoin faucet, which gave away 5 BTC to anyone who asked. This move alone introduced a *TON* of early people to the space. Satoshi saw his pure intentions early, and made him in charge of the Bitcoin github, a position that he never abused, though he easily could have. Gavin desperately tried to bring diverse thought to the core development community, which ultimately led bad faith actors into wedging the project, and evicting him when he tried to stop them as diplomatically as he could.

Due to Gavin's statement about Craig, I do actually believe that Craig was the ""idea guy"" behind Bitcoin. For people unfamiliar with the process, the ""idea guy"" is the one who throws a bunch of weird ideas and money at actual developers, and then tries to take all the credit. Craig thinks this contribution has earned him the privilege of calling himself ""Satoshi"", though I disagree.

I think Satoshi was primarily Dave Kleiman, a brilliant cypherpunk who needed money for medical bills towards the end of his life. Craig was the one that ended up paying for Dave's medical bills, likely in exchange for creating Bitcoin and operating the Satoshi identity. The big giveaway IMO is if you notice how desperately Craig has been trying to obtain Dave's personal USB stick from Dave's brother Ira.

ffiznso,652a6aaf0cf44498b14f,1,"In the beginning I generally recommend people leave it on the exchange. Long term you should have a hardware wallet but there's a bit of a learning curve with all this stuff so learning how to use an exchange and then how to use a hardware wallet as two separate efforts makes sense.

Also, while there is some risk of confiscation or loss when keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange as reputable as Coinbase the odds are pretty low. We're in much more mature days than Mt.Gox.

Sounds to me like you're doing exactly what you should be. Small incremental steps, continued research and asking questions. Mistakes can't always be avoided but your approach will help ensure you make recoverable or trivial mistakes (whoops you lost your seed phrase and the $5 of Bitcoin you sent to that account because you didn't write it down.)",2020-01-26 06:11:29

Yes, there is. I do surveys on a site and have got about $80 in the past 6 months or so.  And it's real BTC too, I have withdrawn to my wallet.  It's very small amounts at a time though, I will just go on after work some days while I unwind.

ffj0f4s,WittyStick,1,"An address is either a hashed public key or a hashed script. Each public key is generated from a distinct private key. (`Q = d x G`), where `Q` is the public key, `d` is the private key and `G` is the generator point of the elliptic curve. `x` here means elliptic curve multiplication.

Each private key `d` is essentially a 256-bit random number. Your wallet needs to store each private key it uses, or be able to regenerate them deterministically. The public keys can always be regenerated from the private key, but they're usually cached by the wallet too.

The deterministic approach for key generation usually follows [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), where a single *master* private key and chaining key are remembered, and from this, a hierarchy containing any number of other keys can be generated using a deterministic key derivation function.

In terms of linkage. The public keys are usually entirely distinct and cannot be matched up by an observer, but BIP32 supports a form of ""unhardened"" public keys, which allows anybody knowing the public key and chaining key (known as the xpub) for a public key can themselves regenerate all of the unhardened child public keys of that parent. This is designed so that some accounts can be auditable without revealing private keys.

Aside from the actual keys themselves, the usual way that addresses can be linked is when multiple UTXOs are used in a single spend - and an observer can assume they belong to the same person - and also they can usually assume one of the outputs of a transaction are *change* addresses, and use it to probabilistically trace your transaction activity if they're able to link some other keys to your identity. There's no easy way to fix this - but coin mixing techniques can make it difficult for observers to trace your activity if the anonymity set of the mixes are sufficient.",2020-01-26 06:20:43

Spending on things that might get big later instead of food and bills is absolutely stupid. The people who do that are the same type that go broke buying piles of lottery tickets that end up all worth nothing. 

If you went around spending on things that might get popular, it wouldn't have paid off. If you managed to get anything out of any of those investments, you'd probably just put them into something else, and that thing would end up crashing on you.

Such reorgs are about double spending specific utxos, but if the system was experiencing them regularly, bitcoin could not sustain its value because it would no longer have the properties required of it as a system for reliably representing money.

ffoeur9,backlogg,13,"Thank you Peter. You have answered almost all the questions i had about this, and made some great points. Something no other BCH dev did or could. Introducing this as a protocol change makes this whole proposal very disingenuous. Because what miners will do does not matter, everyone who does not adhere to this policy will be forked off the network regardless, no matter the hashpower. This looks more like ABC is flexing the power they have over the protocol, since they are the only ones that can make this happen as a protocol change right now.

I seriously can't believe so many prominent people in the BCH community think this is a good idea. Another chain or community split is not something BCH can afford right now, but it's looking like it might happen yet again. This whole fund is going to cost so much more than it could ever theoretically benefit the progress of BCH. And somehow so many people are blind to the consequences.

I'm sad. Human nature is weird. I don't want this to be the end of Bitcoin, since i believe BCH is the last chain of Bitcoin that can really bring p2p electronic cash to the world.",2020-01-27 07:15:31

I, for one, will dump my BCH if it looks like another 'Core' type group manages to take it over or introduce some sort of flaw in it.

ffppvpm,FLhelicopterpilot,9,"Hello, I am a DPE and happened to come across this thread while looking at the other helicopter news for today and figured I would answer a few of the questions and comments.  

While I am a helicopter examiner and do less checkrides than most of the airplane examiners, our experiences with practical tests are similar.

I've extracted some of the basic questions from this post and provided answers, comments, and context.

**Are examiners expected to maintain a certain pass rate?**

No, there is no set percentage that we are expected to maintain.  There have been times when I've had probably around 20-30 applicants in a row pass, and times when I've had 5 or so consecutively fail.  I have never had a FAA inspector contact me regarding either a high, or low, pass rate.

Also, pass rates vary widely by checkride.  Consider a Private Airplane Single Engine Sea (ASES) class add on vs. an initial CFI checkride - the pass rate for the Private ASES add on is significantly higher than for an initial CFI.  An examiner who primarily does ASES add ons would likely have a higher pass rate than one who completes a large number of initial CFIs.



**Why do some DPEs only take cash?**

The implication from other posters is that some examiners are misrepresenting their income for taxes.  It would be extremely easy for the IRS to contact AFS 760 (Airmen Certification) and find out exactly how many 8710 applications we individually processed as examiners in a given year, so it would seem a bit odd to me that any examiner would consider this.

Personally, I accept cash or electronic payment such as Venmo, ApplePay, etc.  Additionally, I will accept a check from a reputable flight school. While it has never happened to me personally, I know several examiners who have had checks cancelled on them - some because the applicant failed and was angry and others because of issues with flight schools. It's not really tax avoidance, it's that cash or electronic payment is the best method to avoid those issues.

While it hasn't happened yet, I keep expecting an applicant to offer payment in Bitcoin at some point. 

**Why didn't my examiner give me a receipt for the checkride?**

I always ask at the end of a certification activity if the applicant would like a receipt, but very rarely does anyone request one. Typically the only people who seem to ask are DoD/DoS, government contractors, or applicants sponsored by a company. If they do, I email them a receipt to the email address provided on their 8710.  

**What do I do if the DPE refuses give me a receipt?**

Again, not something I've heard of from other DPEs in my FSDO, but in case this happens, my suggestion would be to not start the checkride until you receive a receipt if you want one. 

Per the FAA, the checkride has not started until the examiner states that ""The checkride has begun."" Prior to that, the examiner and applicant are reviewing the pretest briefing, and that normally includes the fee structure for the examination, and for any discontinuances or re-examinations.  

If the examiner won't provide you with a receipt and you require one, let them know that you prefer to start the checkride only after you receive one. If for some reason they still refuse to provide you with one, then politely let them know that you would prefer to conduct that practical test with another examiner.

**Why is my DPE charging me XX amount for a checkride, or additional fees for [insert reason]?**

I really can't answer that question as it's very broad, and relates to geographic location, volume of checkrides, etc. I can, however, tell you how I approach re-examinations and discontinuances:

For a *Notice of Disapproval* when I need to come back on another day for a re-examination, my fee is half the original fee. 

For a *Letter of Discontinuance* due to weather or maintenance, I do not charge a fee to come back.  

Travel - The FAA removed the geographic restriction of examinations that was previously limited to the FSDO area. If I receive a request outside the FSDO I'm assigned, I charge travel time per hour, and airfare and/or hotel fees as appropriate. I do not charge for travel for any checkride conducted within my FSDO.

As other posters have mentioned, some examiners charge a retake fee equal to the original full cost, or a fee for weather/maintenance related discontinuances. I suspect this is for high volume examiners, who often have their schedules booked out weeks in advance.  The FAA limits us to the number of practical tests we can complete in a given day, so likely these examiners are having to reschedule their other checkrides, which causes a cascade effect causing them to reschedule other checkrides, subsequently causing them to lose the full fee they would normally charge for those slots.  

**I have a complaint about a DPE who failed a checkride for my student (or me), what do I do?**

First of all, consider the validity of the complaint.  As another poster mentioned, sometimes the defense mechanisms of applicants involve blaming the examiner for the pilot's own failure on a checkride.  

Any Notice of Disapproval must be as result of a deficiency in an Area of Operation and Task in the ACS or PTS. The examiner normally will explain the reasons for the unsatisfactory grade and why it did not conform to the ACS/PTS.

In the event the DPE did fail the applicant on something you believe inappropriate, for example, using ACS/PTS Commercial pilot standards despite it being a Private checkride, I would suggest contacting your FSDO and explaining the situation, with as much detail as possible.  

**I can't find an examiner, or the local examiner is scheduled out weeks in advance.**

Unfortunately this has been a problem, which the FAA has been addressing.  One thing the FAA has done to help was to remove the geographic restrictions that were previously placed on us that limited us to our FSDO's borders.  Now, as examiners, we are able to conduct airmen certification anywhere in the U.S.  

If you are having trouble finding an examiner, I would suggest calling DPEs in neighboring areas/FSDOs to see if they can assist.  

Additionally, the FAA is designating more examiners in high volume activity areas.  However, this process does take some time, as selected examiners must undertake classes and FAA indoc into the examiner system.  As a point of reference, it took me approximately four months to complete final approval as an examiner. Recently, I heard that my FSDO had an additional 3-4 pilot examiners selected and completing the process, so the FAA is trying to alleviate checkrides delays in certain areas, but it is not an overnight fix.

&amp;#x200B;

When you own a piece of bitcoin on a website such as 'Coinbase' in theory, you own X amount of BTC - But lets say, your account got frozen, Coinbase went bankrupt, Coinbase locked your account as 'suspicious' or simply your bank account dislikes crypto and locked your transaction to coinbase. All this, resulting your account being locked for X amount of days until support fixes the situation (CB support are horrible). Now, with £100 this aint to bad, but people storing upwards of 10+ Bitcoins are damn right crazy. Now you do not have access to any 'keys' through coinbase, they own them. 

""Not your keys, not your coin"".

Owning a hardware wallet gives you access to the ""Keys"" these are basically a secret piece of data which is used to sign transactions. Your often here the term 'not your keys, not your coin'. Its safe, secure and you have no third party restricting you from using/selling/sending your crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto on exchange = Like putting your money in a pot that other people have access too. You know its there, but someone could ultimately freeze/lock/take/steal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto in hardware wallet = Like putting your money in a safe, meaning its your responsibility to keep it safe and hidden.

But they aren't really, it is something else, what the vendor thinks he can get, and it varies by the day.

With Bitcoin BTC, it is the same, but the futute fees will make small outputs unspendable, so a few hundred dollars is currently a practical minimum. Note that the fee is per output, what you receive into your wallet. So if you buy for 500, then 500, each time moving it to your personal wallet, you will have two outputs, even if you withdraw to the same address, and you will need slightly less than two standard fees to move it in one transaction.

Bear market's bring out the our darkest expectations, but it's worth remembering the sustained and shocking outcomes of bull markets, too.

&gt; Combine this with a very low burn rate and this creates an incentive to oppose and try to block attempts to fund other development teams as they would be lone group remaining if everyone else packed up and left. 

While it's true this dynamic can exist, I think you're being unfair here. I'd like to think they want to block the cartel proposal because they, as do I, see it as incompatible with a decentralized network such as BCH should be. Bitcoin Verde, who aren't exactly swimming in funds, thinks the same.

&gt; But it's pretty clear that Satoshi didn't have a similar plan for financing development during the bootstrap phase.

I always assumed he wanted the project to live on in the spirit of open source, like how it's being done right now.

&gt; But the general opposition, if not outright hostility, to developer financing seems very misguided to me. 

The hostility isn't against developer financing, in fact quite the opposite as people everywhere are now pledging more donations and we're all here discussing how to better finance developers aren't we? The hostility is focused on a central party handling the donations and that miners are forced to ""donate"".

&gt; Show me an alternative financing proposal that has an equally realistic chance of success and I'll seriously consider it. 

Monero's [Community Crowdfunding System](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) has been extremely successful, and there are for example several researchers who've been paid full-time. (Which is something very needed, in addition to developers.)

The strength of such a system is that anyone can get funding, not just a few selected developers, for other things outside of full node implementations. For example wallets, payment gateways and even marketing are also very important.",2020-01-29 04:23:50

Lowpoint was blaming BU using this language:

Wow, just accusation without any proof or frankly even reason. Feels like its just kicking the dog because you feel bad.

And I am sad about this one too;

&gt; Imagine if Satoshi released Bitcoin without a miner subsidy.

Calling the block-reward a subsidy is a perverse twisting of logic. The blockreward is pay for work done. The work needs to be done (Bitcoin would fail without mining) and people don't work for free. That is not a subsidy. We call that pay. Wages. Or, in simple English: a reward for work done. A subsidy ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy)) is a social measure, created by government.

Using this weird view of block-rewards he goes on to conclude that:

&gt; Using part of the miner reward to finance development while the network is bootstapping seems like a reasonable extension of the original concept.

Yes: It's simpler than developing new words. Which is a neat poetic goal, but actually very hard to pull off. New ,widely used, words or phrases are very rare, unless they're from highly sucessful media (supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, In a galaxy far far away) or current cultural trends/events or such (Bitcoin, Yeet).

It is not simplifying already present language. ""Brothermurder"" instead of ""Murder of own brother""isn't much different. There may actually be a lot of creativity involved with sticking words together. Combining established words in unusual ways n stuff. Arno Schmidt, a German literary author, wrote of a ""fuchsrotes Lächelloch"" (FoxRed LaughingHole), also known as a ""geschminkter Mund"" (Mouth with Make-up) or something like that . This is pretty striking, you know the words, but both the unusual combination of words and the unusual naming of already known stuff (Mouth=&gt;laughing-hole) gives the inclined reader a literary 'bruh'-moment without the bother of introducing totally new words.

fg0u3z3,YRuafraid,10,"Any motherfucker shorting right now is a lunatic and doesn’t know how to trade bitcoin. These people are still in denial that btc flipped bullish on a macro scale. They’re still shorting instead of adding longs on dips which is a far better R/R. If you can’t even spot a trend reversal your TA is worthless, and more often than not it’ll lead you wrong because you keep waiting for the perfect entry while bitcoin leaves your ass behind. Waiting for pullbacks = soy strategy in bull markets. Just add on pullbacks. Keep leverage low so your ass doesn’t get liquidated on a 20% pullback. Its really that simple. 


On a different note, how long until shitcoiners finally realize their payments-focused shitcoin (Dash, BCH, Nano, XRP etc) are completely worthless and will be obsolete just like their IQ. Not only will Bitcoin easily 10X just being the most neutral and scarce money in the world, it’s also going to be *convenient* for daily commerce in due time. But if no one wants to hold/accept your garbage as savings, it has no chance in hell being used for payments. Basic no-brainer stuff I’ve been repeating for years.

This guy is your typical bitcoin maximalist. Acts high and mighty because bitcoin has the highest market cap and is the #1 coin. Typically thinks everything besides bitcoin is terrible.

In reality, Nano has enough devoted supporters and followers that it isn't going to disappear or go to zero. Understand what this currency represents. It is the first instant, feeless, scalable, ecologically friendly, and decentralized currency in the world. People can now send value *anywhere*, *whenever* they want for free. Nano is the only coin that has all of these features.

You really think people 20 years from now are going to want to pay exorbitant fees and wait 30+ minutes for confirmations? No way. People two years ago didn't want to deal with that. Not when a network like nano is around and this space matures beyond speculation. Even while this market remains speculative, nano has immense potential.

fg1be2n,spirtdica,4,"Dash is pretty much like Bitcoin with a mixer built in. That's a simplification of course, but it is important to note that default DASH transactions don't look very different from a standard BTC transaction.  Transaction amounts are not hidden. This allows tracking heuristics, but I suppose it also relieves any fear about hidden inflation bugs. The role of Masternodes in the system is another difference I won't really go into. 



Zcash uses zk-SNARKs, which provide pretty good anonymity with really small proofs. But ZEC has 2 critical flaws. 



First, privacy is opt-in. Z-addresses are private, but t-addresses are totally transparent. Most exchanges only bother to support t-addresses. z to z transactions are rock solid, but t to z or z to t leaks data about the shielded pool. 



This problem is not wholly intractable; Zcash just needs to hard fork to make the use of z-addresses mandatory.  In fact, there is a coin called Pirate (ARRR) that does just that.



The second, bigger issue is the trusted setup. Zcash has what is called ""toxic waste"" that one must trust has been destroyed; otherwise unlimited coins could be created in the shielded pool. 



Monero's main advantages are that privacy is on by default, and that the code is trustless.

fg1nke9,bitvote,4,"thx for this. 

never been in a bear though? Hmm... in one way I get it. I think.

Bitcoin has always had a huge group of holders who are so far in the money that the recent drop - even 80-90% drops - don't matter much. 

For me, the 2018-19 price action wasn't a huge deal. I'd already taken 15x of what I put in off the table. And was also able to hold onto more than 80% of my btc and that portion was always hugely in the money.

So I get that part. 

But it's hard to know how much of the market is represented by 10x+ in the money BTC. I've never seen a good analysis of this. 

For the flip side, the 2014-2015 bear market felt very, very real. I worked at two major bitcoin/crypto companies. And there were periods of existential concern. 

There was confidence too. but there was a shadow of the bear during those years. We were getting pilloried - by almost everyone. And this wasn't just about standard risks from the speculative market, but massive regulatory risk that can be hard to wrap your head around today...  

And the mood in the daily was just ... different. 

If you're interested in doing a bit of archaeology, it might be fun to poke around the Jan/Feb 2015 daily threads. 

Anyway, on the whole I'd say we've lived through real bear markets. Full stop. 

I think the rest of your post is on point. This thing could so easily go back to $7k. In fact, I'd be a bit surprised if it didn't.

I'd also be surprised if we don't see a new ATH by end of 2021.

If you need BTC slightly quicker or need to pay in cash than https://coinatmradar.com or https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin but fees are at least 7% and higher

If you are out of the US than look into coinbase pro, bitstamp, or kraken

fg1f085,joeknowswhoiam,3,"&gt; Bitcoin cash cleared the back log in one 2.3mb block, something Bitcoin could never do as is limited to 1mb blocks or 1.4mb with seqwit.

Why would you lie about something [so easily verifiable](https://i.imgur.com/c9hu0yo.png), those are ~2.3MB blocks on Bitcoin.

Even if there was a 1.4MB limit (which there is not as demonstrated in this link), that's two blocks. 20 minutes on average on Bitcoin... not 5.5 hours.

When was the last time there were 5.5 hours between two Bitcoin blocks?

&gt; And also with 0-confg Bitcoin cash allows payments to still continue, another thing Bitcoin doesn't have.

BCH doesn't *have* 0-conf, it's not a feature, it is the state of a transaction with ZERO CONFIRMATION (i.e. no Proof-of-Work behind it). If you intend your users to trust this, and use this mechanism as the base of most of the retail commerce which require instant deliveries (coffee, groceries, certain services, etc.), of course you can pretend waiting 5.5 hourse for ONE measly confirmation is not big deal... you're already in the business of trust anyways...they can trust that it will eventually happen. So much for respecting Satoshi's conclusions in the whitepaper ""We have proposed a system for electronic transactions **without relying on trust**."". 

&gt; because lightning has failed to be simple enough and easy enough for average users.

That's your opinion and it's demonstrably wrong. [Thousands of nodes are interconnected and have capacity on LN](https://1ml.com/). Annecdotally I use it on a regular basis in an instantaneous and trustless way... two things 0-conf will always be incapable to achieve together. On LN the contract for my channels have confirmations (Proof-of-Work) behind them, it is immutable. Your 0-conf transaction can be replaced at any time.

Go ahead, install a decent LN wallet (Eclair, Phoenix, Lightning App, etc... [here's a nice list with many flavors, custodial to completely trustless](https://veriphi.io/en/blog/lightning-wallet-analysis)). It's generally as easy as sending bitcoins to it and opening a channel (for the ones that don't do it automatically for you). You must be stuck almost 2 years ago, when the first alpha wallets were released if you think any of this ""failed"".

fg1zrgi,notmyrralname,3,"FRESH MEAT!!!! Bring out your shill bags!!!

So, in one comment you’ve hit all the buttons that is sure to inflame r/cryptocurrency. 

Because, unfortunately, r/cc has descended into a pitifully hopeless realm of bitcoin and anti-corporate’s, completely void of rational and unbiased discourse. 

If a project is not proof of work or can’t be mined on the rig they’ve spent thousands on...”its a shit coin!!!” Will be the answer to ANY of your questions. 

If you ask about a company that seems to be gaining in power and popularity (even ones that are representations of real world adoption of crypto)...”its centralized and shit!”

If the crypto project looks like it helps or supports an established system, be it governmental or financial...”fuck banks and your coin is shit!!!”

And then of course there is coinbase. Though it is unarguably among the top 3 easiest to use on ramps for crypto...”they charge a lot. So fuck them!!!!”

You’ll never get anything like a level answer from anyone in here. Just two fucking extremes of idiocy. 

Having said that. I’ve been using Coinbase since early 2017. No problems at all. Start there. Once you get your feet a little wet advance from there. Don’t take anything that anyone on here says as truth. Not even me. Do your own research. And I DO NOT mean watch YouTube videos or search twitter.

Understand that anyone telling you “buy this coin” or “buy that coin”. The reason why is because they have a shit ton of that one. And THEY want it to go up in value.

Ignore them. 

Research projects that seem like they are working to solve an actual problem. Not like “our crypto currency is going to solve world hunger and eradicate cancer”. Those are the epitome of shit. If they can’t communicate a real problem that exists today then they are smoke and mirrors. 

Once you’ve looked at the problem, look at the solution. If the project is supposed to be a world currency, find out if it actually is functional as a world currency. Does the network (as it is) hold up to thousands of transactions per second. If no? Then it’s not a solution is it?

TL;DR believe none of what anyone in here tells you and you are on an ok track to start with regard to your first choice coins*
