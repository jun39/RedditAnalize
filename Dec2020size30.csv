I'm seeing [front page](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/the-hottest-debate-on-wall-street-is-buying-bitcoin-over-gold?srnd=premium&amp;sref=VcNkiTav) articles on Bloomberg legitimately debating whether btc can supplant gold. If you were to tell someone back then what the developments have been over the last few years they would have looked at you like a crazy man.

I remember back in the day the mere mention of bitcoin would illicit open laughter and mockery from coworkers and strangers. They don't seem to be laughing anymore. Incredible to see it grow and disrupt all these years. Good luck to all. If 2021 is anything like the last few bubbles it will be a true test of grit and character.",2020-12-01 13:44:03

ge87iif,Mnhjuytgb,28,"Bitcoin may continue to skyrocket but this is an absolutely terrible argument for it.

Stock market at an all time high? So what, it is often at all time highs.

Economic uncertainty? You must be young because literally every point in time is claimed as having economic uncertainty. 

Impending inflation? What impending inflation? Inflation has been exceptionally low all year. If it goes up that's more of a return to normal than anything odd.

Companies offering crypto trading is not the same as companies investing in crypto. That is just them finding a way to cash in on trading whether crypto goes up or down.

There are millions of machines running 24/7 to do completely redundant cryptography work. And apparently its ineffiency is a feature. 

And it doesn't yield much either. Bitcoin is a transaction infrastructure that's barely capable of handling a dozen transactions simultaneously, many of which are linked to organized crime. Moverover, it's a volatile, deflationary currency with high transaction fees. It's value is backed by nothing and all people seem to do is speculate.

gefz52j,Dr_A_Hedgehog,10,"So you asked this in r/bitcoin. You will be hit with a lot of hodl forever comments. Personally I would take 100k to 200k and purchase a reasonable place to live. Quality Real estate has increased in value continually and is not a bad investment. And transitioning to living in your own place with no expenses is going to supercharge your ability to to save for future investments and live a quality life going forward. If you really want to achieve financial freedom this can be a major step, begin doing research into buying a duplex/triplex or larger multi unit housing situation using an FHA Loan and the BTC funds as your down payment. This will allow you to buy an asset to live in for the next few years that can make you thousands per month in income. Congrats on the solid investment in btc and good luck in the future.

OR

Rent for $18k a year, keep $280k in bitcoin.  In a year you have $560k in btc, you can buy the house you wanted last year for $210k, take 25k for stuff, and still have $325k in btc.

gefkzgg,vuduchyld,9,"This is a great question.  Thought-provoking.  Also, great points below by u/hamberdler and u/SwagtimusPrime.  

Hamberdler mentions that plenty of sectors and individual securities might not be deserving of their market caps, and I think there is a lot of truth to that.  IF crypto is worthy of half a trillion bucks, that is certainly related to the fiscal stimulus pumped into markets by the central banks of the world.  Two reasons:

* The obvious one is simply that when lending rates are low, capital seeks a return.  Low interest rates push up values for all kinds of assets...crypto included.
* Additionally, in some sense, crypto is THE refuge from inflationary currencies.  This speaks to the original vision of Satoshi with the finite amount of Bitcoin.  This is obviously NOT true among all crypto assets.  With Ethereum, I think we can't quite know yet.  With others, we can pretty much see that supply is unlikely to be controlled.  

As an MMT guy, I've been struggling with some cognitive dissonance between MMT and crypto, but maybe that is the reconciliation point right there.  It's good for central banks of currency sovereigns to print money in the midst of a pandemic.  But it's also good for individual people to have some financial exposure to a category of assets that exists on a slightly different plane.  

Swagtimus also mentions the ridiculous value of the ghost chains.  It's a great point.  It looks like the top 10 on CMC makes up about $500b of the $570b.  Not EVERYTHING outside the top 10 is garbage, but the vast majority is going to end up being pretty worthless.  That $70 billion in market cap is equal to Colgate-Palmolive.

geemmqc,daithisfw,8,"These are two things I knew... two things I really thought about all the time... but still wish I had done more about.

1. College is fucking short. 4 years when you are young sounds like a long time, but it goes buy in an instant. I KNEW these years were going to be highlights of my life, I knew I was going to have a blast. I really tried to take advantage and live it up. And I really did. College was magical. However, it still had to end, and my only single regret was ""not doing more with it"" or not ""seizing the day"" with it more. It's weird. I feel like I gave it 98% and I loved it, but I regret even that 2% of downtime I could have used. Once you are an adult in the working world, you'll get what I mean. College is a fantasy world, really savor every minute of it.
2. Student Loans are no joke. Do your best to really avoid them as much as possible.
   1. I knew this, I'm a finance major. I had no choice but to pay my own way, it was my only chance at college. I got some scholarships, I chose the best school that I could afford, etc. I really tried to mitigate my loans. And still, they are my single biggest debt in life and I am paying them off many years after college. 
   2. What I wish I had done differently is that I wish I had really sold out in high school. Saved every dollar from working instead of pissing it away, busted my ass for YEARS to secure scholarships, as many as humanly possible. I wish I had made my debt much smaller from the start, because that pays dividends later when you are paying it down.
   3. Again, I consider myself fortunate. I did the right moves and was successful in college, got a great job and I could afford to not only pay down my loans but also to move out immediately and support myself fully. I am lucky (and my plans/strategy was sound) for that. But still, I regret not busting my ass even harder and avoiding more of this debt. My retirement would be looking much better right now had I done that.

Another silly one specifically for me. I wish I had known about the Bitcoin bubble that was coming. When I was in college BTC was like $0.05 per coin. Had I paupered myself and bought just like $1000 or $2000 worth of BTC, and then sold out during the 2017 bubble, I'd be retired right now.",2020-12-03 04:42:38

As a sincere question - have you actually thought about what retirement looks like? You're 30, what do you plan on doing for the next 55+ years of your life? Retiring to get away from something isn't optimal, you should be retiring to something. While that ""something"" can change over time, it's incumbent on you to come up with a vision that gives you a fulfilling life. 

I'll also mention that the odds of you not doing anything for money for the rest of your life are between 0% and 0%. Establish what your target standard of living is, price out insurance options on the ACA exchange, and go from there. I would maintain that it's pretty safe to assume that you'll net $8k-$15k from part time work. If you're in a position where you have a skill, really part time consulting may be a better option than Doordash for a host of reasons.

It's also critically important to recognize that **if your money is 100% Bitcoin you aren't able to FIRE with certainty or stability**. All of the withdraw strategies assume that you've invested in diversified, low-fee index funds. We don't know how BTC will perform over the next 6 decades (or whether it will even exist).

&gt; If you don't have firsthand experience with how traditional financial institutions (pensions, corporate treasuries etc) administratively permission the moving of assets, it's hard to understand why it's still very difficult for an institution to own bitcoin. Here's why: /1 
&gt; 2/ I worked at an endowment for 4 years, so I'll use the example I'm most familiar with. The Uchicago endowment had $8b and a staff of ~24 when I was there. The head of the endowment is the CIO, but he can't move money or assets by himself. 
&gt; 3/ when he wants to transfer cash or assets (let's say to invest endowment cash in to a VC fund), it follows a carefully controlled process to avoid theft or malfeasance. 
&gt; 4/ the cash itself sits with a custodian. The endowment must transmit and verify instructions to the custodian in a specific way to authorize its transfer. This is typically something like a document signed by multiple parties at the endowment and a phone confirmation. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 5/ This process is not all that secure given the dollar amounts in question, but it works because of the financial infrastructure plumbing. Wire transfers are reversible (short-term), and they effectively use ""whitelisting."" 
&gt; 6/ if the bank received instructions to send $100m to some tiny russian bank, that would raise red flags and warrant extra scrutiny. It's very hard to get away with massive wire fraud since banks will only wire money to other banks that follow the same international laws and 
&gt; 7/ aml/kyc their customers. This produces a clear and simple chain of transfers of that $100m, and the slowness of the wire system makes it difficult to move the money fast enough to hide the trail. 
&gt; 8/ TLDR: it's very very hard to successfully steal and keep large amounts of fiat by wire fraud. It happens...but it's a tiny tiny % of wires. In contrast, how would this same process work with bitcoin? 
&gt; 9/ a successful social engineering attack could result in an instant $100m win for the thief, with no reversibility or recourse. Unlike with destination banks, a new bitcoin address isn't obviously questionable, and bitcoin addresses of users change, unlike bank accounts. 
&gt; 10/ Could the endowment just custody the bitcoin itself? How? Let's say $1b of bitcoin is on a hardware wallet. Who controls the wallet? The CIO gets unilateral and total control of $1b? That removes all the administrative controls and protections. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 11/ you could implement an internal multisig scheme, but this introduces a long list of new risky attack vectors. For that $1b of bitcoin, what software is the endowment supposed to trust to run multisig, and why should they trust it? What hardware do they run it on? 
&gt; 12/ in 2017, we thought trezors were secure, then learned they could be hacked with a paperclip. It's trivial to install software or hardware keyloggers on most devices. Endowments aren't equipped to protect themselves from the most sophisticated spyware on the planet. 
&gt; 13/ this gets solved in two ways. A. Better authorization processes with crypto custodians and updating processes for that authorization at institutions, B. Investing in funds and third party products that hold the bitcoin for them. 
&gt; 14/ IMO, this is solved or close on the custodian side. We're a customer of @Anchorage for example, and they have an exceptional authorization process. Now, institutions need to get used to authorizing transfers on iphones with face ID and voice recognition.",2020-12-04 00:48:12

gehxv63,r_a_d_,2,"While in general that may seem true, implementing a bitcoin hardware wallet is hardly a trivial task in itself.  So the code would never be simple enough to leverage ""security by simplicity"".

My understanding is that Ledger took a very modular approach by implementing a library of secure functions that are available to the applications.  You can choose to only install the Bitcoin app, and that will only use the functions that are required for bitcoin.  So the fact that it supports other coins really does not increase complexity of the Bitcoin app other than forcing a more modular structure to the system.  This may actually make the system more secure as other coin apps may uncover flaws in the underlying software that the Bitcoin app did not.

Besides all this, you could agree or disagree on a theoretical basis, but practically the Ledger devices have proven to be very secure.  I've not heard of any case of an issue with the device leading to stolen coins.  It's always either by disclosing the mnemonic or approving a malicious transaction on the device.",2020-12-04 01:20:30

A network effect is described as a force that is proportional to the square of number of users.

_Users._

There's practically _no_ users of Bitcoin-BTC. People are trading it like any other commodity. In its primary interaction, it is indistinguishable from lumps of coal being bought and sold at an electronic market.

(With the obvious difference that a lot of people use coal for a variety of things.)

Therefore, the network effect of Bitcoin-BTC is effectively zero. The barrier to trading another commodity instead just doesn't exist, as it would have if people were _using_ it, as a currency.",2020-12-05 08:40:24

genhh09,LordAhi,22,"&gt;Your 12-24 recovery seed phrase most likely comes from the [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal: 39 (BIP 39)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).  BIP 39 is the use of a mnemonic phrase -- a group of easy to remember  words -- to serve as your back up recovery in the event your wallet  becomes compromised.  
&gt;	
&gt;These words are pulled from a [specific list of 2048 words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).  In this list, the first 4 letters are **unique** to each word.  
&gt;		&gt;To clarify “unique”, we mean literally the first 4 letters (**not** the first 4 different letters). For example the word “apple”, “appl” does not come up anywhere else in the [BIP39 wordlist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).  
&gt;		For words that only have 3 letters, think of an empty “space” as a letter. For example with the word “add”, there are no more letters afterwards and thus must be the word “add”. The word “addict” is in the BIP39 wordlist but you would have used “addi” for “addict”.  
&gt; 		n other words, there are **no two words** in this list with the same first 4 characters.  
&gt;  		at means if you have the first 4 letters, you know the rest of the  word by looking for those first 4 letters in the BIP39 wordlist. Some  wallets will even fill in the rest of the word once the first 4 letters  are entered.

gew273u,MobTwo,9,"Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. Bitcoin Cash has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements that Bitcoin Cash has over Bitcoin.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 300 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 300 billion will give you more than 60x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

gevuix7,bitusher,7,"&gt;What are the best hardware wallets, and why?

My current favorite HW wallet is Cold card for these reasons -

Their focus is on security and have many other features other HW wallets lack.

Most HW wallets are ""warm"" wallets and not truly ""cold"", cold card allows you to use PSBTs(partially signed bitcoin transactions so you can send and receive bitcoin and never connect your hardware wallet online

With tactile real buttons , its easier to use than most hardware wallets

------------------------

**Ledger nano S positives** 

1) One of the 4 most trusted HW wallet companies 

2) Inexpensive putting it in a similar price range as Trezor one 

3) Has a SE chip thus no need to use a passphrase unlike trezors (but you likely should anyways) 

4) Less expensive than nano X and doesn't have the potential bluetooth attack vector 

**Ledger nano S negatives** 

1) Has a SE chip thus is not as open source as the trezor 

2) 2 buttons are somewhat difficult to use compared to wallets like cold card and trezor model T 

3) Company was hacked due to an irresponsible customer data retention policy that is leading to a continuous phishing attack on its clients to steal their BTC . 

Better policy is trezors

When I ask about their interest in crypto, it comes back mostly that smaller retail just isn’t interested, and hasn’t been for most of the recent run. 

They’re not FOMO-ing or getting excited for a few different reasons, mainly:

1. “Cash is tight, I want to invest in safer areas”.
2. “I won’t get burned again by Bitcoin, lost too much in prev runs/crashes”. 
3. “It’s too expensive now, so I missed the boat I guess”.

It does depend on age as well, potential clients under 35 have a much better understanding of crypto potential, those over 45 are just totally clueless, or FUD victims 95%+ of the time. 

So 2020 has mostly been institutional obviously, along with HODLers adding to their positions. 

It isn’t anything like 2017, crypto is going to need more time to build a reputation as an investment that won’t suddenly dive 75% out of nowhere.

&gt;**Ethereum: The Everything Marketplace**

&gt;It's hard to believe how many novel financial services and applications found product-market fit this year thanks to Ethereum. Some cynics have dismissed the new projects as bubbles or toys (or both), but I'd venture to guess few of them have ever actually tested these products.

&gt;They're real, and they're spectacular.

&gt;There is so much to cover in the Ethereum (and broader smart contract) space that you'll find notes about Ethereum-based applications sprawled across almost every section in this report. Bitcoin may be primed for a big year due to its macro positioning, but it's Ethereum that has taken flight as crypto's most important platform...one that could power an entirely new financial system, and a more open, resilient internet. 

&gt;Ethereum may have even taken a permanent lead this year versus Bitcoin in terms of economic value transferred on its rails.

&gt;It's hard to ignore five-year-old technologies that process more than $1 trillion in real value transfers per year, a figure that has already eclipsed PayPal's. Ethereum has challenges ahead, but its dynamism is undeniable, and it will continue to be the platform to watch in 2021.",2020-12-10 04:44:19

2/ The funds in an insurance company's general account are usually invested very conservatively, as these funds are used to pay policy holder claims.

3/ By investing in Bitcoin, MassMutual has effectively signaled that Bitcoin is considered safe and liquid enough for the largest, most conservative institutions in the world to make an allocation.

Also, the biggest piece of advice. Trading gift cards is kind of shady anyways. There aren’t that many people who end up with gift cards they don’t want.

Knowing about the geography of the planet. Being able to buy the early works of Da Vinci, or Michelangelo. Backing Rockefeller and Carnegie when they are starting out. Buying a ton of Bitcoin at 6¢. Owning Apple and Google and Amazon shares. Rich and powerful!  

But everyone you ever meet will die. You will have children and lovers and spouses and friends, and you'll have to bury all of them. As we get older, our perception of time shifts, and that's why as adults it seems like the seasons are racing past. Accelerate that. Centuries will fly past in a heartbeat, and it will seem that the baby you saw born will have died in the blink of an eye. How can you possibly risk emotionally engaging with them knowing this?  

We're pretty good at generating, processing, and transmitting information these days, and we're only getting better at it. That means you're going to have to keep your immortality a secret, because it's the Holy Grail of mythology and science, and if word gets out that you're immortal, you will be hunted relentlessly. You will be taken into custody and examined meticulously, right down to the last bit of your DNA. You'll need to be very good at running and hiding, and you won't be able to trust a single soul.  

Who know what the long future holds for humanity, or this planet? There could be another Great Extinction event that wipes out 90% of life on Earth. You'll survive, but what else will? Maybe you'll get to see humans travel and colonize other worlds...if we can solve the FTL dilemma.  

Eventually the sun will explode...or just fizzle out. You might be lucky enough to have escaped this planet before the sun swallows it, but then you'd be adrift, unless, as I said, there were colonized planets.  

Even if there were, eventually the Universe will expand and fizzle out, in what science speculates will be the Great Freeze. There will be no stars, no planets, no life except your own.

gfu6uoc,bitusher,11,"**Some foundational Principles of security**

If you don't own much value in Bitcoin these principles are not for you. There is no one solution and most people have different risk profiles and make multiple trade offs in a risk vs convenience spectrum. 

1) **Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

2) Do not trust strangers on the Internet to help you setup your personal wallet. This is someone you must do yourself or have a personal friend or family member help you with in real life where they cannot see your backup seed. 

3) Buy your hardware wallet directly from the producer or amazon site under the producers name. Verify the integrity of the hardware wallet if you are extra paranoid :

https://www.ledger.fr/2015/03/27/how-to-protect-hardware-wallets-against-tampering/

https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005321449-How-to-verify-the-security-integrity-of-my-Nano-S-

http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/threats.html#reflashing-the-trezor-with-evil-firmware

https://digitalbitbox.com/faq

First update the firmware of your HW wallet before using

4) Never brag about your wealth to others 

5) Never invest in any investment scheme or get greedy thinking you can quickly increase the amount of Bitcoin you have with daytrading

6) Consider more secure means of backing up your 12 or 24 BIP39 backups in case of floods or fire -  
https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/

7) Setup your hardware wallet , transfer a small amount of btc to it, wipe it clean , and restore it to give you confidence that the backup was done right and give you experience in the recovery process.

8) Keep your Mnemonic 12 or 24 word seed secret and private and show to no one.  Never use premade 12-24 word backups , you create new keys and backups upon setup. 

9) The most secure , ""active"" wallet would be a hardware wallet integrated with a full node
HW wallet + electrum personal server and electrum is the popular way to do this

10) Consider using a passphrase
Use a passphrase with the hardware wallet (most the security concerns with HW wallets are solved with a passphrase.) keep the passphrase written down a separate from your seed words
https://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase

https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-passphrase-security

https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/passphrase

Make sure the passphrase is also written down somewhere private so you do not forget it! Do not keep the passphrase in the same location as your 12-24 seed backup words.

Here is a good strategy for most people with hardware wallets -

**Location 1** 12 to 24 seed words preferably on metal

https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/

**Location 2** same 12 to 24 seed words

**Location 3** 4-6 word passphrase unlocking your real wallet

**Location your head** pin for HW wallet and passphrase

Thus you have both the passphrase and seed word backup in 2 locations and can lose either one and if someone finds your seed words or passphrase alone they can only see your decoy wallet at most and under duress(torture) you can hand over one of your seed word backups or enter in your pin instead of passphrase and give the attacker your decoy wallet alone.

Every 6 months check to see if your backup seed words or passphrase written on paper or metal is disturbed or removed.(these need to be stored separately!) It is best to hide them in such a manner if you can tell if someone has tampered with them or found them so you are aware if either your seed words or passphrase becomes compromised.

Two sources tell The Daily Beast that the president has expressed  sympathy for the situation of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life  sentence without the possibility of parole. 

In his final weeks in office before Joe Biden’s inauguration, President Donald Trump is weighing granting clemency to [Ross Ulbricht](https://www.thedailybeast.com/from-silk-road-drug-kingpin-to-prison-lifer), the founder and former administrator of the world’s [most famous darknet drug market](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-most-important-trial-in-america), Silk Road, The Daily Beast has learned.

According  to three people familiar with the matter, the White House counsel’s  office has had documents related to Ulbricht’s case under review, and  Trump was recently made aware of the situation and the pleas of the [Silk Road](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-silk-roads-first-kingpin-murder)  founder’s allies. Two of these sources say the president has at times  privately expressed some sympathy for Ulbricht’s situation and has been  considering his name, among others, for his next round of commutations  and pardons before the Jan. 20 inauguration of his 2020 Democratic  opponent.

It is unclear if Trump has arrived at a final decision  yet, but Ulbricht has gained some influential backers in the president’s  political and social orbit. Behind the scenes, he has the support of  some presidential advisers, as well as criminal justice reform advocates  with close ties to the administration and Trump family, including [Alice Johnson](https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-frantic-push-to-get-trump-to-pardon-everyone), according to people with knowledge of the matter.

“I’ve  had documents forwarded to my contacts in the White House as early as  February,” activist Weldon Angelos, a former music producer and  ex-federal inmate, said in a brief interview on Tuesday evening. “In the  beginning of the year, \[Ulbricht’s\] family had reached out to us for  our support, and my organization and I have endorsed his full  commutation, and I am hopeful that President Trump will commute his  sentence in its entirety. This case has perhaps more support than I’ve  seen in any case of this kind.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story Tuesday.

“We’re very grateful for and  admire all President Trump has done for criminal justice reform,  especially passing the First Step Act, because that has freed thousands  of desperate and deserving people, some of whom I know. We’re praying  and remain hopeful that he will show mercy on Ross, as he has others,  and commute his sentence to time served and give my son a second chance  at life,” Lyn Ulbricht, Ross’ mother, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday  night.

Ulbricht was the founder and administrator of the Silk Road  darknet drug market, which used the Tor anonymity network to hide the  location of servers and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to allow users to  purchase drugs anonymously. The website was the first large scale  darknet drug market and spawned a host of imitators over the years, many  of which have since closed down or been raided by law enforcement.

Ulbricht  founded Silk Road after graduating with a master’s degree in computer  science from Penn State and continued to administer the site from his  home in San Francisco.

As the site gained in popularity and drew  media scrutiny, law enforcement officials from the DEA, FBI, ICE,  Homeland Security Investigations, and the Secret Service mounted a  lengthy effort to uncover the identity of the [Dread Pirate Roberts](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-bitcoin-tycoon-mark-karpeles-denies-being-dread-pirate-roberts), the handle Ulbricht used while running the market.

Ulbricht made a [series of errors](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/five-stupid-things-dread-pirate-roberts-did-to-get-arrested)  in attempting to disguise his role in administering the site, including  leaving a trail of personal information like email addresses and  nicknames on web forum posts asking for help with cryptocurrency and  darknet sites.

After investigators finally unmasked Ulbricht as  the Dread Pirate Roberts, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara charged  him with computer fraud, money laundering, and drug charges. In 2015  Ulbricht [received a life sentence](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2015/05/29/silk-road-operator-sentenced-to-life)  without the possibility of parole, in what many criminal justice reform  activists called an excessive sentence for nonviolent offenses.

Prosecutors [introduced chat logs](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/read-transcript-silk-roads-boss-ordering-5-assassinations/) at trial which they claimed showed Ulbricht [commissioning the murder](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-silk-roads-first-kingpin-murder)  of five Silk Road users for stealing from the site and allegedly  attempting to blackmail Ulbricht with his true identity. No murders ever  took place, and while federal prosecutors [in Maryland](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15840844/united-states-v-ulbricht/)  briefly charged Ulbricht with attempting to commission a single murder  for hire, they dismissed the murder charges with prejudice.

His  attorneys launched two unsuccessful attempts to appeal his sentence in  federal courts, and his supporters have focused on freeing him via a  pardon or commutation in the years since.

Those supporters have [pointed to the disparity](https://freeross.org/sentencing-disparity/) in sentencing among Silk Road vendors and participants. Silk Road’s largest drug seller, [Jan Slomp](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/largest-drug-trafficker-shuttered-%E2%80%98silk-road%E2%80%99-website-sentenced-chicago-10-years),  received the second stiffest punishment after Ulbricht with a sentence  of 10 years in prison. Others site administrators and moderators  received sentences varying from 17 months to six and a half years.

The movement to grant clemency to Ulbricht has picked up support from celebrities, like [British rapper M.I.A.](https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/1328159158219235328) and a handful of prominent Trumpworld and Republican Party figures, including Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and [TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk](https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1335340007624622081),  who recently tweeted that Ulbricht had received “insane  over-sentencing” and that the post-election period would be “the perfect  time to grant mercy to a family and young man who has become a victim  of our aggressive DOJ.”

On Tuesday, GOP strategist Andrew Surabian, formerly an official in the Trump White House, [posted](https://twitter.com/Surabees/status/1338926679100633088)  to Twitter that “Ross got screwed by the feds with an insanely harsh  sentence… Few people deserve clemency from u/realDonaldTrump more \[in my  opinion\].” A movie about the online drug market based on Nick Bilton’s  bestselling book about Ulbricht, *American Kingpin*, is set for release in February 2021.

Support  for Ulbricht’s cause is strongest in the overlapping worlds of  libertarian activism and cryptocurrency fans, both of which counted  Ulbricht as an enthusiastic member prior to his arrest.

Libertarian Party 2020 presidential candidate Jo Jorgensen campaigned on a platform that included [pardoning Ulbricht](https://reason.com/2020/09/30/as-dumpster-fire-debate-rages-jorgensen-quietly-presents-an-alternative/) alongside whistleblowers Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.""",2020-12-16 10:56:48

Turns out that it's been about a month since I sold half of my GBTC for ETHE. In that time, I've made 70% more (!!!) in USD from the ETHE than the GBTC, despite an ETH spot price increase of only around 25%. The premium then was \~40% and is now close to \~155%.

I have no idea durable this premium is at this point, and would be curious to hear if anyone here is tracking when inflows convert to new shares, but if ETHBTC *and* ETHUSD go on a tear in Q1 and Q2, then it wouldn't surprise me if the premium sustains or even increases.

Still, there's no doubt playing the premium game is very dangerous, so I won't make a recommendation on this either way. GTBC remains ""safer"" with a premium regularly oscillating 10% to 30% at present.

Just keep in mind that the day a Bitcoin ETF hits (which admittedly may take some more time), that premium will immediately drop to 0%.",2020-12-16 02:11:17

$3000 is basically double our ATH. Do you truly believe that's all that ETH is capable of? I wasn't around back then, but people thought $100 was a moonshot and we went to $1400 not too long after.

The fundamentals have literally never been stronger. POS went live without a hitch and purrs like a cat. There are so, so, *so* many developments and events on the horizon. I don't want to list them all because I'd type out an entire paragraph. 

But basically, this time around we have institutions potentially pumping us straight to Andromeda if more of them see BTC as an inflationary hedge. What's good for BTC is good for ETH.

gggghau,Nagosh,33,"Going to summarize my thoughts about the market and where it is going in the next few years. I've posted something similar to this a few times but since we have a lot of newbies I figured I'd be open to more input.

I believe that bitcoin is on that S-curve adoption rate, and we are currently in the middle of that S curve. This means that the next bubble will probably be the last big bubble. Not that it will never bubble again, but every subsequent bubble is going to be smaller and smaller and take longer and longer.

I think the current market fundamentals point toward this idea. Essentially, after this bubble we will be starting to hit market saturation, i.e. everyone owns bitcoin. With all the investment firms coming out stating that they plan on buying or already are buying, I think this is evidence we are in the middle of that S-curve. Adoption is happening. The time of ""early adopters"" is coming to an end. 

Of course it's going to be nearly impossible to predict the top of the next bubble, I believe we'll see a similar movement to that of 2017, about 15x from the top of the previous bubble. That would put us near 300k. With the recent devaluation of the dollar, this could put us even higher. Depending on the circumstances on how fast we get to this point, I will probably sell everything at 300k, but I plan on rebuying almost everything at the bottom of the next cycle.

A lot of people think it is absurd to have a price that high, or that something dramatic needs to happen, like the dollar collapsing. I don't see why this needs to happen. A simple conversion of gold to bitcoin is all that is needed for bitcoin to be that high. However, if bitcoin does take over gold's place, I don't think it will happen this cycle, and possibly not even this decade. Remember, 300k is the *top* of the bubble. I think it's going to pop hard just like every other time and will settle around 70-100k. Then it'll take another 6-8 years before overtaking gold, which will also signify the beginning of the next cycle. 

So, yeah, it'll probably take at least a decade before we can decisively know if bitcoin becomes gold. We are still early adopters, which means we are carrying on the most risk but also in position to reap the most reward from it. 

But I strongly believe that bitcoin is significantly better than gold (and, therefore, should be worth at least as much as gold) because not only does it contain all the same properties as gold but is able to take on some of the properties that have traditionally been assigned to banks. I'm definitely hodling through this next decade, and it'll be a wild ride.",2020-12-20 17:58:25

Ripple Inc. said it will defend itself against a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that claims the company violated investor-protection laws when it sold a bitcoin-like digital asset called XRP.

The suit, which hasn’t yet been filed, would be one of the highest-profile SEC actions against a cryptocurrency pioneer, just as the regulator’s chairman is departing at the end of the Trump administration. The SEC over the past few years has brought and mostly won civil lawsuits alleging startups trampled securities laws when they raised money by selling cryptocurrencies.

None of those companies, though, was as big as Ripple and XRP. Ripple had a $10 billion valuation in its most recent funding round in 2019, and XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.

ggnnsk7,princehints,11,"(The Wall Street Journal) - Ripple Inc. said it will defend itself against a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that claims the company violated investor-protection laws when it sold a bitcoin-like digital asset called XRP.

The suit, which hasn’t yet been filed, would be one of the highest-profile SEC actions against a cryptocurrency pioneer, just as the regulator’s chairman is departing at the end of the Trump administration. The SEC over the past few years has brought and mostly won civil lawsuits alleging startups trampled securities laws when they raised money by selling cryptocurrencies.

None of those companies, though, was as big as Ripple and XRP. Ripple had a $10 billion valuation in its most recent funding round in 2019, and XRP is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.

A representative for the SEC wasn’t immediately available for comment.

Ripple said it was informed by the commission on Monday that regulators soon plan to sue the company, Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen in federal civil court. The company and the officers say they plan to fight the claims.

“They’re wrong in matter of law and fact,” Mr. Garlinghouse said.

The lawsuit revolves around whether XRP, a digital asset that the company launched in 2012, is actually a security that should have been registered with the SEC. Registration involves providing the SEC and the public with disclosures about a company’s business model, risks and financial condition. The SEC reviews the disclosures and provides feedback to improve them for investors.

It isn’t known what the SEC is seeking through its lawsuit, though in similar cases it has obtained financial penalties and a requirement for digital-asset sponsors to provide ongoing disclosures to investors—just like the periodic disclosures that public companies provide.

XRP is similar to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but also different in key ways that sparked the SEC’s investigation. Bitcoin was an open software project launched by a pseudonymous creator calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto.

XRP, initially called Ripple, was created, sold initially and backed by Ripple the company.

Ripple has significantly altered its relationship to XRP, turning control of its development over to an open-source network of independent developers. But the company still holds about 6.4 billion XRP directly and has an additional 48 billion held in an escrow from which it periodically sells them to the public.

It has distributed 45 billion XRP since inception. That is different from the ways in which bitcoin is created and distributed.

The SEC has said neither bitcoin nor ether, another well known cryptocurrency, are securities. But the agency has been circumspect about granting other digital assets a pass to skirt federal oversight.

Mr. Garlinghouse, who has criticized what he says is a lack of regulatory clarity for many digital assets, questioned why the commission, and specifically the agency’s chairman, Jay Clayton, chose now to take a stand on XRP.

“That to me makes no sense,” he said. “It’s kind of preposterous.”

Mr. Clayton has said he is leaving the SEC by the end of the year. He has mostly taken a skeptical view of cryptocurrencies, saying many appear to fall within the legal definition of a security.",2020-12-22 12:30:48

gglvwjz,cutefuss,11,"in kpop scandal news, btob member ilhoon has reportedly been investigated for smoking the devil's lettuce (known academically as marijuana) regularly for years. my favorite part about this case is that he reportedly [bought weed with virtual currency](https://twitter.com/OH_mes2/status/1340982696026099713) (aka...bitcoin? probably?) to avoid detection. personally i think he's a genius, other people do not see it this way. i might be biased because ilhoon was my favorite member of btob back in my stanning days, but no one can confirm this.

some points of interest:

* btob have become known for their relatively squeaky clean image and for having strong vocalists. they started as a more theatrical/dance music focused group, but gained popularity by putting out vocally-driven ballads - their big break was [missing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bykFvnRzno) which was a smash.
* they rely heavily on the general public connecting with their music as their fanbase is decently sized, but not large enough that they wouldn't feel the impact of the public refusing to interact with their music.
* ilhoon is the only person in the group who can actually rap (i said what i said) and is currently enlisted in the military. as much as i hate to admit it they could probably get rid of him and be fine, but their rap sections would definitely suffer for it.
* weed is a big deal in korea and more famous idols than ilhoon have had their careers ruined/tarnished because of it. i'm sure there are people who want to legalize it there, but by and large this is going to be seen as something he should be punished for and be ashamed of doing.

all that adds together to equal the fact that it's extremely possible ilhoon will be kicked from the group because he bought weed with bitcoin for five years. there's a small chance he'll get through this by keeping his head down, serving in the military and 'reflecting', but only time will tell.",2020-12-22 03:12:21

Than you can buy bitcoin for 23,208.00 USD a BTC 

This would make sense if you were buying larger amounts because 
Even with the wire fee and exchange fee from INR to USD it would be cheaper. 

Though this answers your question as to why people are overpaying with their INR , many people in India are buying small amounts of Bitcoin with INR and the forex fee+ wire fee does not justify the savings of using a BTC/USD or BTC/Euro trading pair",2020-12-25 00:32:37

I recently started again after my short run in 2018 because I was in a world of uncertainty around the entire thing at that time and I wish I never stopped. I still made some decent money off it but I could have made a lot more. The biggest thing for me in mining was how to make sure I didn't walk away a loser. Most people seem to think that mining is only profitable when btc is at all time highs, and if you're someone who needs to cash out weekly then I guess it is, however even when bitcoin was worth 3k if you mined and and saved the coins until they were worth 20k again you still made good money across an entire year. What really matters is your perspective on it. Mining is more of a pay once and generate X amount for years. If you think you can drop $2500 on a rig and generate more eth than if you were to just buy it outright then the answer is clear. Theres other ways to invest $2500 of crypto and earn passive income but I haven't been able to figure that out yet. It's not like you have to generate your entire rig cost back to not lose money either.High end GPU's have been inflated since 2017 so even after a year of mining you may make your money back and still be able to sell all the GPU's for 90% of their MSRP.

ggztszg,DereksCrazy,1,"Why? The dollar loses value each year, even without bitcoin. It’s made to be spent and when the dollar is failing it’s good to have debt. I’m genuinely curious as to why you think it’s a bad idea. It’s dollar cost averaging in reverse.

Even if you pick the same day of the month for every month, you still do well.

Same loan of this type, if paid off today would look like this:

7 years ago price of BTC:
$946.92

So $6000 then would get you
6.33633253 BTC

Your payment would be

$71.43/month.

So do your DCA calculations for $71.43/month* for 84 months, and that costs you (starting on 12/25/2013 every month for 7 years) a total of

5.952963623543075 BTC

So your total gains over this period would be (after completely paying off the couch)
0.383368906456925 BTC

or (if you prefer dirty USD $9,242.64)

Not bad for $6000 you were just going to spend on furniture anyway, not to mention the upsides to your credit &amp; natural inflation from USD in doing this (which is why people do it without the bitcoin side in the first place). 

If your goal is to gain BTC this should make sense. It is DCA in reverse because you’re bet is the same, but your position is reversed because you have to make payments in USD. 


*Calculator doesn’t do cents — I put in $73 to cover fees too

&gt;Its like BTC has possession of the football 90% of the time. How can you win that game?

Possession is important in most football game styles, but having most of the time with the ball doesn't necessarily mean you'll score more goals than your adversary. In fact, let me remind you of Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan of 2009 semifinal against Barcelona (the same Barcelona with Puyol, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi, likely the best team of all time). They've had little possession of the ball in both matches, but were ruthless in their counter-attacks with the little time they've had it and eliminated from the Champions League the biggest candidate to win the trophy.

The analogy to crypto is: Bitcoin can keep having the ball from 2009-2029, but that doesn't mean that in 2030 Ethereum won't have already irreparably won the dominance game.",2020-12-28 04:41:29

I’ve noticed that r/investing  doesn’t allow discussion about bitcoin. I totally respect that decision and encourage you to continue keeping you subreddit as focused as you see fit.

I am a moderator for r/bitcoinmarkets and we have a similar rule that bans discussion of altcoins in our subreddit’s daily discussion. We have this rule because we want people in our subreddit to stay focused on discussion that members have real and personal experience with.

I’ve also noticed that some of your members may be straying from your community’s expertise by occasionally discussing bitcoin markets. Frequently, the information shared is inaccurate or misleading; All the more reason to enforce your very sensible rule against bitcoin discussion here.

If you find that you are getting a lot of bitcoin discussion and you want to keep that out of your subreddit please consider putting a link to r/BitcoinMarkets in your sidebar.

What kind of money is that? At least the VISA the merchant pays the fees but here in the cryptoworld the customer has to pay the fees, AND the merchant has to pay the fees to transfer it. We live in a world that its theoretically possible to send $1 in Bitcoin and pay $40 in fees. Think about the dark web markets for example.

Not recommending it based on short term price action of what? of 12 months? That seems very short sighted to me.

Bitcoin isn't going crazy.  This isn't retail FOMO driven.  Well, there's surely some FOMO, but it's minor compared to what's really pushing the price up:

This is institutional buyers building positions, and it's still only barely getting started.  We don't even have real ETFs yet.  One pro athlete getting paid in Bitcoin was enough to make front page crypto news.  One.  Institutional buying is barely even getting started compared to what's coming.

For hodlers, that's gooooooooooood news!!!

We could easily blow past 30K if institutional buyers have already been placed outside of the exchanges.  Grayscale alone could probably push us over 30K due to a buy they placed earlier this week since they're buying more Bitcoin than is being mined.  Supply can't meet demand without the price going up.

Good good good news!

I just wish it was easier to predict prices going forward, obviously.  We all wish we could do that.

ghjwo91,FiercelyMediocre,15,"First response: 

IOHK has been fairly transparent about the reasons things have taken longer than expected., and this could be is more of a criticism of them more than Cardano itself, but the writer doesn't seem to understand the difference (Charles is the CEO of IOHK not Cardano, lol). 

High leverage may be an issue, but it is already accounted for and could be solved with protocol parameter change, thus it is not a viable criticism of the protocol itself.

The commenter also doesn't seem to understand that 5 pools control over 50% of the hash power of the entire Bitcoin network. Oops so it looks like 100 pools producing blocks is already far more decentralized than Bitcoin as is. Again this can be controlled through parameters.

He concludes by saying the social design is flawed, but from the beginning has failed to understand that the protocol is designed with adjustable incentives to account for any social problem that may arise.

&amp;#x200B;

Second response:

The first part is false, Cardano is not based on the assumption that people do the right thing, but instead on game theory (an actual field of science/economics, I would highly recommend taking a class) where all participants can only be assumed to act in a self interested manner. 

I haven't seen the exact statistics on the post K increase pool behavior but K to my understanding is not the parameter that was designed to discourage sybil attacks, instead that is the role of pledge on the network. Arguably pledge isn't sufficiently effective right now but again it's an adjustable parameter, not a flaw in the protocol. 

I'm not sure what the overdelegation criticism is about, that seems to have mostly straightened itself out? I'm seeing very few pools in [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/) that are anywhere close to their pre K increase numbers (They had been &gt;200m ADA) Oops so it looks like the saturation levels are working as expected too.

Again the conclusion is that ADA is a shitcoin but all the criticisms are pretty hollow. It really comes down to whether or not you believe in the methods (research driven, formally verified code) used to develop the Cardano blockchain, which I personally do.

&amp;#x200B;

Third response:

Easily disproven at [https://pooltool.io/](https://pooltool.io/).

ghjek0n,Odds-Bodkins,14,"&gt;i can’t help but feel like it’s not at all comparable to 2017...

Absolutely agree. It's not comparable.

Yes, we have had many months of sustained bullish price action following a bear market and a final dip. But in 2017, ETH made a 7000% increase on the ATH at the start of the year, \~20 to \~1420. Bitcoin returned to its late 2013 ATH of $1000ish, and went close to 20k by the end of the 2017.

We have made good gains, but we're not yet knocking ATH's out of the park and doing 20x on previous ones. BTC hasn't even done 1.5x yet. If history is repeating, we're barely starting the run. There is also the possibility that we're not *in* another cycle yet, or we're not *getting* a repeat.

Personally I think that we are going to see much higher, and I think that the mania is ahead.

Today I was thinking about how so many people who have been through multiple BTC cycles keep expecting large short-term pullbacks and corrections, and they just keep getting bought up.

We're in a manic phase when people are just throwing money blindly in and making returns, to cries of ""the best time to buy was yesterday"". When the old heads have given up on their sensible short-term bearish pullbacks and are holding up their hands and saying ""it's all gone crazy"". When we have trolls in the daily and comments like ""he's just salty because he sold at $40k BTC / $4K ETH lol"".",2020-12-31 06:25:35

ghl1os8,BicycleOfLife,13,"Seeing a lot of the noise on YouTube talking about a correction right now for BTC. Although it doesn’t really matter to me as I plan on holding for years.

I have to admit, I’m not really understanding how a correction could happen in the short term, if even in the medium term. The scarcity is crazy right now. Even exchanges are drying up, and the institutional buyers are long term holds, like the strongest hands so far. 

There’s a part of me that things, ok, it’s smart to listen to the TA and prepare in someway. But the other part of me is telling myself, these guys have not adjusted to the change the institutional buyers brings. We are used to retail investors with weak hands, doing unresearched investments and the moment it makes a small downward trend they panic sell at a loss. Both the community and the new institutional investors are hardened traders at this point. You have a small group of new retail investors coming in like a school of baitfish and the institutions and seasoned traders will feed off them. This is a different time for bitcoin. There literally isn’t enough of it for everyone to even own 1 BTC, and that’s if it was perfectly evenly distributed. It’s not even close to evenly distributed.

We’ve all seen how the flow of money comes in, first it’s early adopters, next it’s institutional money, and then it’s the dumb FOMO investors. We aren’t done seeing institutional money, and the reaaaally dumb money has yet to arrive. I can tell this, because I’m not face palming at every post on here. 

We are getting to a milestone, but I really don’t think we are even close to done.
