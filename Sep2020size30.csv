g3j047w,Qwahzi,17,"I had some discussions on this topic recently. I'll copy/paste it here:

It depends on your timescale and adoption rate. It's highly unlikely than any single payment system (cryptocurrency or otherwise) will displace ALL existing payment processors, and it doesn't need to - it takes a LONG time to obtain that many customers. In 2019, 185.5 billion purchases were made via Visa, 131 Billion via UnionPay, 108 billion MasterCard, ~16 billion for Amex/JCB/Discover, totaling ~14000 TPS average. It's highly unlikely that any existing cryptocurrency can (or should) handle that load. Achieving even just Discover-level adoption (~44 million users) would be a huge achievement for any cryptocurrency, and at Discover usage rates that's ~95 TPS average

https://www.statista.com/statistics/261327/number-of-per-card-credit-card-transactions-worldwide-by-brand-as-of-2011/

It's better to start with more realistic targets: for example, achieving 100 million users for any one cryptocurrency. Even Bitcoin is only at ~8 million users per 2018 Chainalysis estimates. 2011 PayPal was doing ~57 TPS average, with 100 million customers, 2019 Discover is at ~95 TPS with ~44 million customers. Nano can handle that same load now, and even without protocol improvements Nano automatically improves roughly in line with Moore's law

Tl;dr, Nano doesn't have to be able to scale for the entire world from day 1, but it's doing remarkably well for a decentralized network vs centralized for-profit systems",2020-09-01 08:05:25

g3ndltu,noknockers,27,"I'd like to reflect back on an earlier, more innocent time. The time was late to 2017 and the narrative was that Bitcoin was useless because it had $30 fees. 

Ethereum fanboys around the world laughed and mocked the stupid BTC protocol for being useless as a day-to-day currency like their beloved ethereum was, as fees were too high and the general public couldn't use it. 

Now that ETH has become that popular, the same thing is happening. We're hitting bottlenecks.

g3oc7vu,paperraincoat,23,"&gt;Any thoughts? 


If there's one thing I've learned from Bitcoin, it's never tell people how to invest their money. I all but *begged* people to invest at $200, friends, family, coworkers. Most took a look at the chart, saw it sliding down from $1200 and were like 'dude, looks like I missed the boat, this thing is done.' I vividly remember a family member rolling their eyes when I tried to explain how inflation keeps people poor, like 'oh god, you've got to be kidding me, yes I know chocolate milk was $0.10 in 1960!' 


So now I have a dozen people pissed at me because they watched it climb 100x. Literally. If you had listened with an open mind about the stupid chocolate milk, you would be retired right now, and Bitcoin is a forbidden topic. 


There's another group that did invest in the low hundreds. Those people are.. also pissed at me because I didn't flat-out order them to sell at $19,500, assuming I could see into the future precog-style. So they're pissed because their insane six-figure gains are now more modest five-figure gains. Two people tapped out and sold around $5k on the slide down from $19k and are... now similarly pissed. 


And there's a third group of friends who remember me talking about Bitcoin, watched the meteoric rise, and then bought in on the way up to $19,500... and are now pissed. I explained to them that I sat on a 70% loss for almost three years, from my initial buy-in around $800 down to $200, and... they don't care. They're pissed because, I don't know, they're going to have to get rich slowly.


Through 2019 I got to watch the exact same thing happen all over again, just with the numbers neatly 10x higher than the last round. Same old FUD, gloom and doom, Bitcoin is finished, it's all over, mainstream media proclaiming it dead, I mean, just look at that chart! Sigh. I have no doubt, absolutely no doubt at all, for round three, the media will be talking about how Bitcoin is officially dead because it lost 60% of its value, from $310k all the way down to $180k.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eg4sMw-XgAQDkVC?format=jpg&amp;name=medium

Eth is money, Eth is influence, and soon Eth will be security.  This Eth should be going to you guys who held fast during the difficult times, who eagerly await Eth2, and who genuinely wish to see it succeed.  We need to remain vigilant of the influence this amount of Eth can have in the hands of those who may not wish to see proof of stake arrive quickly nor the end to proof of work with the merging of Eth1 into Eth2.

Yet on the other side of the equation, the tides are turning.  The disparity between the current and future potential of Eth and that of BTC is hard to ignore.  I have had several Bitcoin rich people reach out to me expressing their eroding confidence in the supremacy of BTC.  BTC has value, but should it really be the bar to which all others are measured?  BTC's dominance and influence on the market is eroding.  While we are frustrated with the ever growing transaction costs, it speaks to how truly valuable the network is.  It cuts through the bluster and the BS.

I do think BTC's dominance will continue to erode well below 50%.  This erosion will accelerate leading to a mass transfer of capital into Eth.  I can already see it's effect on market flow and behavior starting.

g3stmxm,abcq02,10,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity‚Äôs smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù think about the all the times you‚Äôve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That‚Äôs right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we‚Äôre using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I‚Äôve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I‚Äôm perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don‚Äôt want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I‚Äôve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you‚Äôll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don‚Äôt need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you‚Äôve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it‚Äôs difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan‚Äôs chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters‚Äô lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I‚Äôm talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have ‚Äúdelusions of grandeur‚Äù are due to my being ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. ‚ÄúToo long; Did not read‚Äù: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution.

g3tafw2,myles11myles,8,"Bitcoin may be the original of blockchain tech and began as a currency to purchase things on the darknet which Monero will probably take over after the fall of Empire dnm. In the real world, controlled by our governments, I don‚Äôt see it being sustainable as a global currency because of the volatility, hype and nothing really significant about it anymore. Any digital currency can be created and therefore, can overtake bitcoin. See tulipmania. Digital currency is the future, but I believe it will be stable coins. Nothing is stopping a group of wealthy fin tech corporations or governments from snatching up all the bitcoin and locking it away forever so no one can use it. Will be interesting to see where bitcoin is 20 years from now. 

Blockchain technology, however, is here to stay for awhile and will be mass adopted in the coming future. It is the new engine. There are so many uses cases to make our infrastructure more efficient and transparent, not all dealing with currencies. A lot of people are not understanding this huge difference between bitcoin and ethereum (or other blockchains). The high gas fees on ethereum is merely a small roadblock in development with any new tech.  L2‚Äôs and collaborations between different exchanges, dapps and bridges will only make ethereum more powerful as they continue to develop and update L1. 

For example, Apple computers and phones use intel chips, nvidia graphic cards, Qualcomm etc etc to make the system faster and better. Software and apps are built to run on Apple/Microsoft to create user friendly experiences with real world uses for mass adoption. People use their smartphones, but can‚Äôt tell you all the underlying technology that is running it. It is a race to see who can build it better, but at the same time, so many other factors go into who will succeed. Community, collaborations, core team members, company ethics, and if their leaders are capable of embracing and leading a team to execution and trust. 

This is why I believe in ethereum and OMG (and a few others) because at the core, they are trying to change the world and not just trying to 100x their token and watch people get rekt. They focus on the tech and especially, making sure the security is working. Second, they understand that technology to genpop is confusing and in order for new tech to be adopted, the UI/UX should be a top priority from the beginning. Third, collaboration and support for/from each other. The core teams don‚Äôt go around trash talking every new platform because of jealousy. It‚Äôs always based on facts and a conversation. Because in the real world beyond twitter, 4chan and reddit, healthy collaborations build empires. 

OMG is essentially a white label (the wallet is. Does that still exist?) payment processor built on top of ethereum that will be currency agnostic and can be implemented by anyone for batch transactions to save costs on fees. We are headed towards a cashless society and blockchain is moving it forward. One of the major problems I see right now is that exits take a week or so to execute. This may hinder its growth until OMG is widely adopted. Also, I tried to swap some OMG on uniswap and the fee was 11% while USDT and ETH were around 0.06%. And I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and swapped it. Huge loss. No idea what that was all about. Also, I feel all the new hype in crypto plus DeFi and yield farming is going to cause another crash.... people are trying to get rich quick and a lot of people are gonna get destroyed. So...hang tight again and prepare for that. 

Just my opinion right now, feel free to inform me otherwise, as I‚Äôm constantly trying to keep up with all the changes in this new environment. 

Sorry I think I was responding to someone else‚Äôs comment below about blockchain tech, but I feel it fits better on the main feed. 

Also, my friend and I are in the early stages of building a hybrid platform on top of eth (and trying to find ways to use OMG with it) and I was explaining blockchain to him. I setup metamask on his laptop and showed him etherscan, uniswap, and binance. We also went through a ton of blockchain websites. He is a UI/UX pro and he said to me that whatever we develop absolutely needs to be user friendly because all of the stuff I just showed him was confusing in so many ways that any nontechie would never be able to navigate on their own. So I pulled up the OMG CPE and made a transaction (you‚Äôre welcome for the rock, Vitalik). He said it was very easy to use for people who don‚Äôt understand blockchain tech and liked it. He bought his first OMG tokens. And then was sad today about the dip.  I said hang tight or dca. You‚Äôre good. They‚Äôre legit. BUT IDK THO. lol.",2020-09-03 14:20:30

On a 1-year timescale.... if you bought Bitcoin at any point during this year and it goes to 20k within the next year, you've made a minimum of a 60% return on your investment.

On a 3 - 5 year timescale it doesn't matter if you bought at 5k or 15k. We're all going to make bank and outperform the stock market by 20x or more.

If we're expecting Bitcoin to go to 100k in a few years, in the first scenario you'll 10x your money. In the second scenario you'll still still have more than 8x'd your money.",2020-09-04 03:43:18
g3wpabm,SonderDev,13,"Bitcoin‚Äôs value comes from it being the first crypto and thus it having the First Mover advantage when it comes to its users. It has little to do with mining. For whatever its supposed benefits, mining in net has created an ecosystem where fees are high, transaction rates are low, and crypto is further from Satoshi‚Äôs vision of a digital currency than ever before. And that‚Äôs without getting into the existential negatives like the environmental impact and pool centralization.

There‚Äôs a reason we hear this new narrative of it always having been about ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù. It‚Äôs because miners are ruining their coins, making them digital commodities rather than currencies as adoption is traded for speculation. It may work in the short term, but I believe such crypto are bubbles waiting to pop, as the world realizes through storefront‚Äôs like Steam removing BTC due to it not actually solving the decentralized exchange-of-value problem that Satoshi describes.

Digital gold isn‚Äôt a use case. It‚Äôs propaganda produced by Blockstream and the like to keep the bubble growing. If you want a government-less store of value, buy actual gold. How does it really make sense to say something can store value without being readily transferable? Is the $100 BTC sitting in a wallet really worth $100 if there‚Äôs a 50% movement fee? At some point the perverse incentives of the mining cartel have to matter, and that‚Äôs why I think bitcoin will fail. Do I want people to have this happen to them? Of course not. But it just seems like an inevitability to me and I fear for its users.

Now as for nano‚Äôs adoption. I believe we will see nano take off as online retailers recognize the potential to undercut credit cards. Why go through Amex and accept high fees and a chargeback potential when you could just use nano and have a feeless, one-and-done, international, instant exchange for the purchase. Consider that nano is unusually well-poised to work with existing card readers too (obviously this isn‚Äôt a thing yet, but the fact that it‚Äôs on the table and the vast majority of mined coins aren‚Äôt says a lot about its future).",2020-09-04 06:42:37

g3ztl0y,BitSecret,23,"I'll place my obituary here just in case.

On date TBD, u/BitSecret, loving contributor of r/Bitcoinmarkets and father of strong bitcoin conviction passed away at the price of $9999.99.

u/Bitsecret's account was born on  November 12, 2014 after being a r/Bitcoinmarkets observer for several years. He received his Bachelors of Bitcoin from Tradehill Currency Exchange in 2011 and a Masters of Bull from the Bitcoin School of Hard Knocks in 2013.  He practiced trading and Satoshi Dice gambling before settling into a life of a long-term hodler.

u/Bitsecret had a passion for cryptocurrencies. He would glance at the bitcoin price everytime he opened his phone while pumping every USD he could into Bitcoin and altcoins with the hopes of telling off his boss one day.  Through perseverance and luck, that day finally arrived one chilly morning in February 2019.  After calling a low price of $3000, u/BitSecret couldn't imagine his holdings going any lower in value so he insensibly put in his two week notice at his job. 

Beginning in March 2019, u/Bitsecret has sat in the corner of his living room eating Flaming Hot Cheetos and drinking macha staring at his phone chanting ""Go Bitcoin"" ever so softly under his breath. 

On Monday, August 31 2020, u/BitSecret made a strong prediction that Bitcoin will never have a 4 digit value again. Some say he was being delirious, other's say he just was just ignorant, but regardless of where he lied within this scale, he will be greatly missed.

A memorial service will be held on TBD at the daily thread of r/Bitcoinmarkets on [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) at 1 hour past 9999.99 on Coinbase Pro.  CryptoKitties or donations may be sent to a cryptoaddress provided by his new username.",2020-09-05 00:17:48
g42ygv4,monkeyhold99,18,"As you may or may not have read, back in May of this year Paul Tudor Jones (billionaire hedge fund investor) advocated for owning 1-2% of your portfolio in BTC (at the time the price was \~$9,000 USD). 

I finally had the chance to dive in a bit more into his analysis by reading here, just 10 pages:

[https://www.scribd.com/document/460382154/May-2020-BVI-Letter-Macro-Outlook#](https://www.scribd.com/document/460382154/May-2020-BVI-Letter-Macro-Outlook#)

Essentially Jones and his research team looked at different stores of value (Gold, fiat, financial assets, and Bitcoin) and gave a score in each category (portability, liquidity, trust, purchasing power) to get an overall subjective score. More specific scores for each category can be found in the chart here in Grayscale's recent valuation: [https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Grayscale-Valuing-Bitcoin-Sept-2020.pdf](https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Grayscale-Valuing-Bitcoin-Sept-2020.pdf) since the scribd link above doesn't have the full report. I'll quote the parts from Jones' report that I find most interesting. 

*In reference to the scores of each SoV:*

&gt;What was surprising to me was not that Bitcoin came in last, but that it scored as high as it did. Bitcoin had an overall score nearly 60% of that of financial assets but has a market cap that is 1/1200 of that. It scores 66% of gold as a store of value, but has a market cap that is 1/60 of gold‚Äôs outstanding value. Something appears wrong here and my guess is it is the price of Bitcoin. 

*On comparison to the price of Gold:*

&gt;Many of you know my fondness for analogues. Bitcoin reminds me of gold when I first got in the business in 1976. Gold had just been productized as a futures instrument (like Bitcoin recently) and had enjoyed a heck of a bull market, almost tripling in price. It then corrected almost 50% in nearly two years similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs 28-month 80% correction! You can see the similarities in the two charts below.  **But in the case of gold, it was a tremendous buying opportunity as gold went on to more than quadruple past the prior highs. The red line in the chart below is where we might be in Bitcoin today.**

I bolded this part above because if you look at the chart from Jones, it shows that he believes Bitcoin today is where the Gold price was back in 1977! At that time, Gold's price per oz. was \~$150. Gold would eventually hit a high of over $2,000 oz just a few years later. Applying this price increase to Bitcoin *could* see us at around $130,000 BTC in a few years.

The rest of Jones' report is pretty interesting. It's a short read, I recommend it. Some pretty bullish things mentioned in there.",2020-09-05 13:14:09

g40gp40,bitusher,9,"Some miners did , and others miners didn't. 

The 2 main reasons some of the miners resisted activating segwit at first was due to 

1) Bitmain and partners (ViaBTC) were using covert ASICBoost secretly which gave them an unfair advantage over other miners. They initial lied and denied this but 
Greg Maxwell reversed engineered one of their ASICs and found out that they were mining with this functionality and than disabling it when shipping out used/new ASICs to others. 

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html

The problem with covert ASICboost is that it was not open source and they had patents on it giving a monopoly on this feature undermining decentralization in mining. 

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9230

Segwit undermines the profitability of covert ASICboost because in order to benefit from it you are restrited to only including transactions within the first 1MB of block space and cannot collect the tx fees from the added blockspace that segwit supplies(essentially collecting half the fees thus cancelling out the benefits of AB). 

Nowadays almost all ASICs use rolling **overt** ASICboost which doesn't have patents on it and can be used with segwit just fine

2) The second reason is many of the miners wanted immediate and much larger increase in transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization. There were holding out and pressuring the community to increase the blockspace to be increased to 8 million units of weight (a ~7.4MB **max** blocksize) instead of the increase we settled upon as a community to increase to 4 million units of weight (~3.7MB **max** blocksize) that we now have .

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/consensus/consensus.h



 There are complex tradeoffs between both approaches but in retrospect we made the right decision as a community IMHO (especially as we can see we don't even use all allotted capacity increase today years later and we set a nice precedent that economic users are ultimately in control moreso than any centralized companies and we must reach a consensus before adopting changes)

Keep in mind the scaling debate moreso had to deal with control and how consensus is determined than any specific scaling proposal.

My feeling at the moment is that this is one of those 20-30% pullbacks we saw several times on the run up in 2017/18. Hindsight has shown that to have been mostly bark (ICO's) and little bite. Development then was no where near where it is now. Could I be wrong? Of course I could...the whole thing could go to 0 at any moment. Most of us recognize that. My personal feeling at the moment is that it wont, and I **HATE** writing out tangible predictions on here.

Now, the recent hype around defi feels similar in many ways to that of the ICO's back then. YAM this, SUSHI that.  A lot of us here (just me?) are wondering where the actual *value* of these tokens is coming from. I am far from the most educated person on the subject, but most of these projects reek of the ICO craze...lots of bark, little bite. Lots of people depositing assets looking for a quick 3 or 4 or (5? you rich degenerates!) figure bump. Paying insane gas prices trying to get their transaction through quicker than the next guy who is also trying to dump their governance tokens.

That said...there **is** real utility here in the space, if you can see the forest through the trees. It **isn't** all bark, there **has** been major development in the last 3 years, the eth2 deposit contract **is** coming. Ethereum is making bitcoin useful beyond what bitcoin itself is capable of. The developers can see the forest, and they are planting more trees on the edges making it grow.

Because Craig can't code, can't not contradict himself, and can't say anything remotely original or even thoughtful.

Nonsense. Everything he says is hilariously wrong. He's astounding ignorant, and only bamboozles those lacking coherency &amp; consistency in their thoughts because they are susceptible to his brand of overly-emphatic obscurantism coupled with belligerent attacks on shared antagonists.

g4dqg6s,rdar1999,5,"Interesting.

The first to have used such logic was Blaise Pascal.

Pascal was one of the inventors of probability, along with Pierre de Fermat, and wrote an interesting game theoretic approach to belief in God.

For Pascal, the question as to whether God exists was a matter of outcomes. As it is impossible to decide on His Existence rationally, one must *wager* on His existence:

Believing in God, if (a) He doesn't exist it is a waste of life in a false belief, but if (b) He does exist, then the reward is **paradise**.

Not believing in God, if (c) He doesn't exist all things stay the same, but if (d) He does exist, then the punishment would be **eternal damnation**.

So for Pascal it was pretty obvious he should believe in God, and he said as much. He should live *as if* God existed, for the inconveniences of such life represented a finite loss, and the wager has an infinite positive return with 50% chance. The positive return for not believing is just a finite return that has no importance (it is what you already have).

So, basically, you argue that waging that bitcoin will dominate is a rational choice, similarly to Pascal concerning God.",2020-09-08 06:40:01

g4gs5pr,MobTwo,6,"OP is a known troll (check his karma) so I take this opportunity to inform readers why Bitcoin Cash is so much more awesome with more potential. =)

Better Security ‚Äì BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations.

Improved Scalability ‚Äì BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

Supply Scarcity ‚Äì During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

Improved Confirmation Times ‚Äì Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

Higher Merchants Adoption - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

Low Fees ‚Äì One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

Tokens - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. You can get some free tokens by joining the discord chat at 1BCH.com

Better Privacy - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

Better Risk/Reward - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",2020-09-09 03:33:42

g4h1noe,luncht1me,4,"Okay, you sent to a BTC address in your Celsius Wallet ?

You're about to learn a lesson in using wallets where you don't have control over the Private Keys.

What I'm about to suggest, only has a hope if you sent your LTC to Celsius.

All you can do, is email CELSIUS SUPPORT, and ASK THEM to do what I'm about to explain. You've been barking up all the wrong trees. The only way to recover your LTC, is for the Private Key of that BTC Address that you sent to - which Celsius has the Key for - to be converted to a Litecoin Private Key and then that key can be used to send your funds back. Only Celsius can do this for you, since they own the private key to your wallet. If you owned the Bitcoin wallet you had sent your Litecoin to, you could attempt the recovery yourself. But, since Celsius is a Centralized Wallet, you must ask Celsius to do this for you. Good Luck.

The procedure in this case, is to use the Hexadecimal Format of the Bitcoin Private Key and convert it to a WIF Compressed Private Key for Litecoin. There's tools to do this online. This new Private Key will allow you to send the Litecoin from the address you sent it to, to a Litecoin Wallet THAT YOU CONTROL (you could send back to your exchange wallet, but it's much wiser to do things properly).

&amp;#x200B;

Please be careful. Learn what it is you're doing out there. It's a decentralized network, nobody can recover your money if you make fatal mistakes. The exchange can't help you because you already sent the money, they don't have it anymore. The devs of litecoin can't help you, cause it's a blockchain -- only the controller of the wallet the funds are now in can do anything with those funds. Fortunately for you, there is some hope but it all lies in the hands of Celsius at this point. Go plea your case. And maybe be a little more clear in your writing. Don't forget to include the LTC Transaction ID and BTC Address for support to investigate with. Would probably help to give support a destination ltc address to send your lost ltc to also.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, LTC is simmilar enough to BTC that this can be done. If you had done this with two cryptos that were incredibly different, your money would likely be lost permanently. Though, usually you can't send other crypto to invalid addressess, it just happens that LTC and BTC have a common thread between them where they can both be valid addresses on both blockchains.

And please, for the love of god DO NOT give anyone your LTC Private Key under any circumstance lol. Would you give someone your bank card, PIN and ID? Cmon now...

I really hope you spend some time to reflect on this, and educate yourself a little more about crypto. Maybe it isn't wise to be putting so much money into something you don't know much about. That's a lot of money to just throw around. You almost lost it all. Maybe you have if Celsius refuses to cater to you here.

So I am sceptical of the whole logic that stocks must go up because cash ain't giving return.

g4lbtr6,mc_schmitt,7,"Straight up disclaimer, I'm from the Quantum Resistant Ledger. To answer the title, ***yes***, but it's more about risk tolerance and opportunity cost.

[Google](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/google-tests-new-crypto-chrome-fend-off-quantum-attacks/) and [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/towards-post-quantum-cryptography-in-tls/) takes the quantum computing threat seriously along with the [NSA](https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/02/03/162433/nsa-says-it-must-act-now-against-the-quantum-computing-threat/) and [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography). I'd say these are folks that we could pay attention to.

For blockchain projects:

* QRL is natively post-quantum resistant ([Using XMSS, draft recommended by NIST \[pdf\]](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-208-draft.pdf)) by default.
* QRL will be bringing the option to be post-quantum secure to Ethereum wallets with [enqlave.io](https://enqlave.io) \- just needs an audit!
* ADA seems interested in it, though opted for ECC for more features.
* Monero is [doing research](https://github.com/insight-decentralized-consensus-lab/post-quantum-monero).
* IOTA has it, but will be [switching to ECC ED25519](https://blog.iota.org/dev-status-update-march-2020-e4fca1a4ffa2) as default for more features.

While quantum computers aren't going to break blockchains today, projects have a lot to do to prepare and it's not as straight forward as one might think. Even assuming every project flicks a switch and instantly reaches a consensus, integrates everything, tests, audits, and releases their fork which gives the ability for post-quantum addresses, there's still the time to migrate. Seeing as that most are their own bank (not your keys, not your crypto!), only the end user can do their migration, and it can plausibly take a while. I don't recommend it, but conversely, your crypto would be safer on a centralized exchange in this scenario as they have staff on hand to handle the migration! This is the same scenario with banks - which are centralized with IT staff on hand to handle a migration, so also wont have a problem.

How long will it take to migrate for blockchains (individuals)? Well, according to [Net Marketshare](https://netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22platformVersion%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22platformsDesktopVersions%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-09%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-08%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D), 26% of people are still on Windows 7 as of 2020-08, which reached EoL in [2020-01](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support). According to Microsoft there's security ramifications for still being on Windows 7, as well: ""Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020. If you are still using Windows 7, your PC may become more vulnerable to security risks.""

If it takes 2 years to migrate (lost estimate), then you're really looking at the time that ECC is broken and going backwards in time. In this example, if it's broken in 2022, and it takes 2 years to migrate, you should have had post-quantum addresses ready by 2020 to start the migration, and as a friendly reminder that's not including consensus, development, testing, and audits. As certain blockchain features that rely on ECC are more difficult or infeasible to do with post-quantum crypto, this can negatively impact the development and migration timelines. [Quantum attacks on bitcoin, and how to protect against them gave 2027 as an optimistic estimate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf).

Even with that under consideration, on any given year it's not a 0% or 100% chance of being broken but instead has a cumulative probability. It also doesn't take into account the value of what's being broken. One of our community members put [together a model](https://twitter.com/JSmith_Crypto/status/1159125977387208704/photo/1) that articulates this. Put another way, is a 1% chance too high, 50%? That's going to depend on each individual and individual project. For 300 Billion of value, I'd like to think 1% is too high, while for a dog house, I doubt I'd even care if it had a 99% probability of being broken - [some dogs might have a different risk tolerance, however](https://media4.giphy.com/media/DvyLQztQwmyAM/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47lktykd6q6o3v9z25962jhq1mnnlnhzpcqm6aabql&amp;rid=giphy.gif).

g4kya4d,67no,7,"This question gets asked every other week (here and/or on r/bitcoin), you can look it up yourself. There much more qualified people than me that have answered these question, but I can sum it up:

No Quantum Computers will not break blockchain.

The only thing they can ""break"" is public/private key encryption which is the key component for most blockchains, which makes it possible to derive the private key from the public key.

""Break"" in quotation marks is because:

1. Current quantum computers are WAY to weak right now and it will take decades until we have ones that are strong enough. The current ones are not only too weak but also prone to calculation errors that makes it basically impossible to use the required algorithm to ""break"" encryption.
2. Quantum computers can use [Shors-Algorithm](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor-Algorithmus) to solve a certain kind of problem, essentially you can find the pair of prime numbers X and Y from their product Z=X\*Y, which is the kind of problem that is used in most private/public key encryption algorithms.
3. It is theoretically possible to make quantum resistant encryption algorithms, and I only say theoretically because I have no idea if there currently are ones and I was too lazy to look it up right now, but it is possible.

[2016 DAO hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic#The_DAO_bailout) \- In 2016 faulty Ethereum smart contract coding (an issue with an application built on the blockchain, not the blockchain itself) led to $50 million in funds being stolen. The Ethereum Foundation disregarded ""code is law"" and forked the blockchain to rollback these changes. Essentially, the blockchain itself was bent to accommodate human error. An unforked version of Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, still exists but has a 100th of the market cap and is prone to 51% attacks. [Ethereum also had a premine,](https://www.coindesk.com/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine) meaning that a lot of Ether was generated at the push of a button.

g4vf6oq,[deleted],280,"So my mother became suspicious over time while I was vending - I had been telling my family that I was trading bitcoin and doing well (a half truth?) and she eventually stopped buying that. She took me out to dinner, we split a couple bottles of wine, and then she straight up asked me what I was doing. She had an inkling, because at this point I had been arrested before. I told her that I was selling cocaine on the internet. She very calmly told me to stop by a certain date. It was incredibly strange. 

As i‚Äôve said in previous posts, I was indicted far after I actually stopped vending - almost a full year. I posted in another thread about how I was actually picked up at a county probation office in a weird sting operation. My mother had driven me to that appointment as I had lost my license for a couple years due to previous drug charges. I remember we had plans to go to a diner afterwards and get some breakfast.

Well, I didn‚Äôt come out of that probation office very fast. The DEA brought my mother in at my request before they took me away so that I could tell her what was going on. I was cuffed and when they brought her in, she looked at me and went completely white - a complete ghost. She started bawling her eyes out and it was actually a really traumatic situation. 

The overall reaction from my family was mostly supportive. I have a sibling that‚Äôs actually a police officer and we don‚Äôt speak for, well, obvious reasons and haven‚Äôt for a while. But besides for that sibling, my family had my back. Outside of my immediate family though, i don‚Äôt think anyone really knew - and if they did, they didn‚Äôt say anything. I was released the same day I got arrested when i first got indicted, so i didn‚Äôt really need to say much. it felt like a dream. When i woke up the next day it kind of sunk in that I was pretty well fucked. I was allowed to fly back to the treatment center I was in, and all the guys there knew what was good and were super supportive and thought I was cool as hell for getting indicted.

The craziest part to me is the sentencing. When I got to court, I noticed that the clerk looked super familiar to me. I realized that the clerk was actually my best friend from high school who had gotten into law school and was now interning for the judge who was about to sentence me. Just a completely wild juxtaposition of roles. She called me after and we had a pretty deep conversation.

My family was pleased with the sentence - I honestly thought I was going away for 3 years and I was prepared to take that on the chin, but it went a different way and i‚Äôm grateful.

g4tvm25,gibro94,16,"theres so many things that are wrong with the statements youre making. What is the main innovation that Bitcoin holds over ETH?

I would argue that ETH is far more innovative than bitcoin, as it is continuously growing and has far more development and adoption than any other blockchain. The development of ETH is actually far more decentralized than BTC. ETH is developed by thousands of developers around the world. Some of them exist in teams which take on parts of the core development of things like ETH 2.0 phase 1. Vitalik is one of the founders of ETH, but he's not the leader in any sense. He is more involved in research and merely makes suggestions to development teams to implement new ideas. These development teams and the community vote on whether these upgrades are applied or not.

Miners of ETH 1.0 are actually far more decentralized than BTC. ETH is still accessible to the average miner and it has been for a while. The majority of BTC hash power comes from 2 mining farms in China.

Removing governance from any blockchain is a terrible idea. BTC still has governance. The aim is to have a balanced governance that would maximize the benefit of the users and the health of the blockchain over time. ETH is actively working on governance of ETH. But at this point in time it's important to have some centralized leadership in creating 2.0. Imagine creating a video game where all the developers didn't talk to each other and there was no collective idea, and every single piece of the code had to be voted on. It doesn't work unfortunately. The idea is to develop a platform that fosters optimal decentralized governance. But at this point ETH is actually already doing a great job at that. Another thing is democracy doesn't work when you have an uneducated population. In the case of blackchain the majority of people have no idea what they would be voting for.",2020-09-12 00:02:36

""An Analysis of Key Factors Influencing Integration of Blockchain into Shipping Companies in Taiwan""

&gt;Lastly, the ‚Äúhybrid chain‚Äù is open to specific organizations, but the consensus process is controlled by pre-selected participants. It is a partially decentralized blockchain. That is, the public can access and trade without verifying transactions and issuing smart contracts, which must be approved by pre-selected participants. Although the hybrid chain is positioned between the public chain and the private chain, in essence it still belongs to the category of the private chain. Its applied field has extended to Bitcoin, Finance Internet, **Vechain**. Ethereum, and Maersk global supply chain systems. These experiences enable shipping companies to employ blockchains in transportation services in order to effectively improve operational efficiency, transaction security, and promote competitiveness of shipping companies in the digital age.

g4wmaq7,a4mula,7,"Making precise predictions in technology is akin to reading tea leaves or throwing bones.  

Looking at technological trends is where most of the meat of looking ahead comes from.

The one trend that immediately jumps off the page at me is how we're transitioning from a resource based society, to an information based society.

Jump to 1980.  If someone were to tell the average person that an abstract concept, something that has zero physical presence (other than the electrons representing 1's and 0's) could have value, they wouldn't even know how to process that. There was software at the time, but it had no intrinsic value.  The hardware did.

Jump to 1990, and Microsoft has proven by then that information (in the form of licensed software) could be very profitable.

By 2020, we now realize that information is more valuable than any physical object.  With nothing more than a flashdrive with a few hundred bitcoin, I have something that is more valuable than a safe full of cash.  My personal information buys me all types of highly valuable resources on the internet, from this site to a myriad of google services.  

It's not just the monetization of information either.  There is a different type of value we take from our abstractions.  Think back to being a child (if you're old enough) before facetime or chat rooms or even the ability to make free long distance calls.

We placed a premium value on sitting down across from another human being.  Seeing them in the flesh.  The value of that has decreased significantly as the ability to interact with them through the abstract has increased.

So what's the trend here?

We're going from 100% objective reality, and we're slowing replacing more and more of that with abstraction.  Virtual Reality, and I'm not speaking of the headsets, but the ability to replace things that were once very much real, with things that exist only as digital ones and zeros.

So, I predict, that trend continues.  To the extreme.",2020-09-12 14:52:49

The entire point of solving the Byzantine General‚Äôs problem is to have a distributed system that can survive despite the active participation of hostile, immoral, dishonest or otherwise destructive people.

A Bitcoin network that cannot survive active participation by people who don‚Äôt like it or would harm it is not a very good network if we take the white paper seriously, nor is it remotely good money! The best money will be used and saved by everyone, including everyone you hate most.

The goal is not to have to continue to purge the conmen, crazies, French developers, etc, but to build a system that survives despite their participation.

g51pixn,IntestineFiesta,56,"It's not about gold, necessarily, as much as it is about being against reproducible fiat currencies. With a currency like a gold standard (or any currency that cannot easily be replicated, like Bitcoin which has a finite total supply,) inflation is essentially not a concern. It can only occur if someone finds a large stock of the resource being used as currency (like what happened to Spain during the colonial period,) which really isn't likely to happen often, especially not for cryptocurrencies, where the supply is fixed. 

With a government fiat currency, however, inflation is a constant worry, and can spiral out of control if the government puts too much money on the market. Fiat currencies thus always have the underlying risk that they will either be inflated out of value, or the issuing body will collapse, rendering the currency worthless.

Personally, I'm fine with fiat currency, since it carries many advantages to use one and resource-based currencies have their own shortcomings, but I feel like this description is a fair representation of the anti-fiat position.",2020-09-13 14:03:17

Imo, this shows the market is actually quite bearish. When bitcoin is moving up and people have very muted expectations, that's a bullish indicator.

Also, since OI is roughly the same as when it was in July and yet we are 15% higher, I think that implies our price increase is due almost entirely to spot buying and holding.

* $7-8k  - fair.  $7.5K would put ETH at roughly $834B market cap, which was the former ATH of total crypto market cap.  Seems reasonable, but ETH is far more valuable than the entire crypto space in 2017.
* $10-16K - good.  $14.5k would put ETH at 2x former ATH of entire crypto market cap. 
* $25-28K - parabolic bubble ATH.  If total crypto market cap were to hit $10 trill. and if ETH were at \~30% dominance like it's been before, then that would put ETH at $27.5K.  Sounds crazy but the peak bubble ATH always melt faces and this is the face melting territory.  it's possible.  

I think ETH alone will eventually see &gt; 10 trillion market cap which puts ETH at around $80k which I think we'll see in the cycle after this one.   We might have a sustained bull market this cycle, I think a double bubble may happen - here's why:  

Bitcoin has been leading the macro cycles with it's 4 year halving schedule, and BTC is probably on it's way to $100k territory.   I could see this cycle playing out and ETH not flipping BTC in market cap until ETH 2 phase 1/2 roll out.  If this happens towards the end of the BTC macro cycle, where ETH scales and has multiple massive supply black holes (staking, defi, 1559, insurance, ...) then we'll see a demand shock with a supply liquidity crisis that causes ETH to flip BTC and it will become free of the 4 year macro cycle onto its own cycle.  So we may see two peaks, or a double bubble if you will.",2020-09-14 16:49:30

The reason you couldn‚Äôt find a MSRP card last gen was because Nvidia charged more for the FE. 2080 ti msrp was $1000 I think but Nvidia said their FE cards were $1200.

Tomorrow, you somehow manage to buy just as many bitcoin miners, plus a few more, and get them all setup and running.

You'd be able to reverse bitcoin transactions you've made, for as long as you can keep this up.  The thing is, you'd make more money adding your bitcoin miners to the network, and mining legitimate bitcoin, than you'd ever possibly make, trying to cheat the network by reversing transactions you've made.  

This was Satochi's solution to the Byzantine Generals problem. It's more profitable to join the network, than fight against it.  If it wasn't about profit, but instead it was a state for instance, that just wanted to disrupt the bitcoin network, the cost is so high, it's unlikely that any state, or even a coalition of states, would be able to overwhelm the hash rate of legitimate bitcoin miners and keep the attack up for very long.

tl;dr this is misleading and suspicious.

- Why it was _quietly_ patched in Bitcoin Core 0.16.2 (no mention in [release notes](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.16.2/)), but got so public campaign for btcd and Decred?
- Why [CVE-2018-17145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17145) has its published date as Sep 10, 2020 while it was discovered and fixed in 2018? Why was not it published somewhere in 2018 after Bitcoin network had sufficiently upgraded? Why did it ""wait"" for so long just for this occasion?
- Why did they disclose it so early and did not wait until dcrd v1.5.2 and bchd 0.20 is widely deployed?
- If the vuln was originally discovered by Braydon Fuller and never publicized for Bitcoin in 2018, how did Khan learn about it and how did he decide to inspect btcd and Decred for it?
- Why own website? Perhaps the massive vulns with known/used exploits like [Heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) or [Meltdown/Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) deserve a website, but invdos?
- How the claim that it could ""shut down networks"" is backed up? Did they test it? How will real-world deployments (with other protections, of course not considered by The Media) stand against this in practice?
- Why Decrypt added this odd statement that ""btcd is an alternative Bitcoin blockchain node that doesn‚Äôt let its users send or receive payments""
- Why did not Decrypt reach to Decred devs for a comment? These are people who engineered both btcd and Decred, two insanely complex and robust systems, and who could tell so much more than security researchers who focus on a narrow area of code.
- Why did not The Daily Chain reach to Decred devs for commentary?
- Did Braydon Fuller and Javed Khan ""patch"" Decred like The Daily Chain put it in the _headline_ Decrypt claimed in text? I see that Khan submitted [#1599](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1599) and [#1603](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1603) to btcd. And note how both use Decred's code to fix btcd. But Decred was fixed in [#2253](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2253) which was submitted by David Hill, and this is even acknowledged on page 6 of the [paper](https://invdos.net/paper/CVE-2018-17145.pdf).

A large part of the interview was about to how to use Bitcoin in ways that preserve a user's privacy. It was... frustrating to listen to. Ironically enough, the episode was premised on not ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù Bitcoin with ideological purity tests or by requiring technical expertise. The host of this show is upfront about the fact that he himself is not technical at all - totally fine - but even if he‚Äôs not a tech wizard, it‚Äôs embarrassing for all that the host of the ""#1 Bitcoin podcast"" seemingly has/had a minimal understanding of concepts like address reuse and coin control.

At this stage of the game, it's irresponsible to discuss these topics and not mention Monero even once. Given Andreas' level of knowledge and the worldview he espouses (or at least used to, I don't follow him as closely as I once did), I find it extremely difficult to believe that he doesn't grok Monero. Granted that this was a Bitcoin podcast, I don't understand why Monero never came up, even in passing. 

A couple of (paraphrased) excerpts from the show:

@~46:00

**Host:** ‚ÄúI want to start transacting more. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm leaving this trail behind on the blockchain that people can track everything I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm not fully aware what my addresses mean and what that is telling people.‚Äù

**Andreas**: ‚ÄúBeing able to apply privacy enabling technologies of different types in order to be able to transact more often without creating venmo, without creating a public and obvious trail of everything you‚Äôre doing... that‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs not. At all.‚Äù ... Goes on to talk about his strategies to avoid tainting his Bitcoin, multiple tiers of wallets, cold storage, warm storage, hot storage, etc etc. 

@~58:00

**Host**: [After Andreas explains the concept of tainted coins] ‚ÄúEverything I‚Äôve done for the last 3 years is probably all tainted. Everything I‚Äôve done can almost certainly be tracked back to my purchases on Coinbase/Kraken. I haven‚Äôt [been considering any of the privacy steps you just told me about]. So what am I meant to do? Do I accept it? Do I need to do something with all my current Bitcoin? Or do I just accept that it‚Äôs tainted and develop a separate procedure for all my future Bitcoin? ... This is where I‚Äôm like ‚Äòoh god, this seems like a lot of work‚Äô  
**Andreas**: Yeah. Yeah. This is why Bitcoin itself is not a coin that delivers great privacy. Because it requires a lot of work in order to achieve not even great privacy, but just some privacy.",2020-09-14 21:46:10
g572ctb,MobTwo,19,"Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Everyone

- For the first time in human history, Bitcoin Cash allows you to be in full control of your own money. Bitcoin Cash is peer to peer money that cannot be frozen by the banks nor the government.

- With Bitcoin Cash, you place your trust in the laws of Math and Cryptography rather than putting your trust in people.

- Send or receive any amount of Bitcoin Cash, to anyone, anywhere, instantly and almost for free. No lengthy bank forms to fill in and no private information required from both the sender and recipient.

- Whenever you are frustrated with the long queues in the bank to make a transaction, imagine how much time you had wasted, and how many millions other people are wasting their time in the bank queues every single day. Bitcoin Cash saves time and money for millions of people every single day.

- Bitcoin Cash helps to connect the billions of unbanked people, with valuable talents and expertise, to the global economy, creating millions of new job opportunities and increasing economic growth for the entire world.

- Bitcoin Cash enables micro transactions so you can write articles or create video contents and earn money immediately by people who like your work.

- Bitcoin Cash has high volatility which could be seen as an issue or an opportunity, depending on your perspective. If something is $1 today and 20 years later, it is still $1, then there is no investment opportunity.

- Bitcoin Cash protects your purchasing power from inflation and hyperinflation, similar to gold and silver, because it exists outside the banking system of fiat money.

- Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money.

- New bank regulations with regards to bail-ins and bail-outs means the banks can confiscate depositors funds legally and anytime during a financial crisis and there is no recourse for you.

- Banks can shut down and disappear along with the depositors money but Bitcoin Cash has a perfect track record of being online 24 hours a day, every single day, and had been doing so since 2009.

- Bitcoin Cash payments, with CashShuffle and CashFusion, are private Internet money. This means you can send/receive money with anyone privately without having to give out your private information, useful in situations when you want to donate money to an organization without risk being implicated in the process.

- Bitcoin Cash is an insurance against corrupted governments. Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven.

- Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass financial censorships, restrictions and sanctions because it is unstoppable peer to peer money.

- Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.

- If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens.

Turns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up.

When you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the people‚Äôs hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash forever.

- Bitcoin Cash is programmable money which allows for smart contracts, tokens, oracles, dividends, anonymous bearer shares, and so much new innovations that wasn‚Äôt possible before. It is like the very early periods of the Internet age where it is a rapidly evolving technology and crazy amount of new innovations happen regularly and yet people barely know anything about the Internet at that point.

Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants

- Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe.

- Risk of chargebacks is nearly zero.

- No more worries about credit card frauds.

- No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users.

- No payment processing fee. As a merchant, you receive 100% of the amount paid to you by the customer.

- Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register App and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes.

- Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission.

How You Can Help This Peer To Peer Cash Revolution

- Spend Bitcoin Cash whenever possible. You can buy anything with Bitcoin Cash on Amazon today with up to 30% using the Purse.io service. You can pay for air tickets, hotels, food and other services using Bitcoin Cash today. Visit AcceptBitcoin.Cash or Map.Bitcoin.com to look for participating merchants today!

- Pay your employees in Bitcoin Cash to help build a closed loop economy. Request to be paid in Bitcoin Cash if you‚Äôre the employee.

- Help educate and spread the benefits of Bitcoin Cash to family and friends, or you can just direct them to this page!

- Make small donations to open source developers contributing their free time voluntarily to build applications and services for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

- Everytime someone tries to sell you something, ask them if they accept Bitcoin Cash.

We emailed Krugman for a comment on the quote and here's his explanation:

Well, two things.

First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.

But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.

And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics.",2020-09-15 09:33:25

For these people there is basically nothing that will help them escape the financial grindstone, like never ever.  Living from paycheck to paycheck is all that they can ever expect to achieve, and let's face it, there are even more people that cannot even achieve that.

Still, hope is a powerful thing though and putting a bit aside in bitcoin when and however you can offers these people the hope theat one day, if bitcoin suceeds they can escape that grindstone.

My mother has also gaslighted me on many occasions. My boyfriend has become a huge source of support for me because I don't talk to my family for the reasons listed above, so he suggested that we get a place together. Instead of her being supportive and understanding, she's been trying to make me stay by saying things like she's going to buy a house in Georgia and build us a forever home here in our current state (Colorado). She started investing in Bitcoin and she thinks that she'll get rich overnight and I'll just want to stay home.

Also, she texted me while I was in the middle of work, asking me if my boyfriend was willing to move in with us so she can ""get to know him"".

```
Projects such as Zcash, *Bitcoin ABC*, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT
did not include the vulnerable code at the time of discovery.
```

The above seems consistent with what I'am able to read from the public full disclosure. Keeping in mind this 2 important dates:

""time of discovery [for Core]"" == June 22nd, 2018

""time of disclosure [to Core]"" == July 9th, 2018

Now looking at the git history it seems that the bug has been ported to ABC over from Core by this diff of yours in the beginning of June 2019:

https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D3156 (June 1st, 2019)

So the bug was introduce ~12 months after the fix was disclosed (to) and fixed by Core.

Further more according to my reading of ABC git log history the fix (which is to remove ` CMainSignals::Inventory`) has been merged in June 30 2019 by Mark Lundeberg's https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D3477 around 1 months after the bug was introduced in ABC.

Unfortunately that meant that ABC put out a 5 releases that contained the actual bug (0.19.8, 0.19.9, 0.19.10, 0.19.11 and 0.19.12) the first bug free release was 0.20.0 which contained Mark's fix. Since 0.19.8 has been released on Jun 18 2019 and 0.20.0 on Aug
21th 2019, that meant that ABC users have been exposes to the INVDoS attack for 2 months.

g5dnzwe,Merlin560,63,"Pnf Update

[Chart Here](https://imgur.com/tnDAf7N)

Today the price moved up. to to the 900 box.  If you look at the link you will see where I drew the line across the ""long pole.""  The long pole happens when the price moves up four boxes beyond the break out point.

In PnF charting, this indicates a rise above a ""sustainable"" level.  They call it a long pole because it is like a pole standing on it own.  Without support it can easily tip over.  When it does tip over (they always do!) expect a drop of 50% of the length of the pole.  In this case the pole is 13 boxes high.  In the event of a drop, we should expect that it will fall 6.5 boxes.  @ $50 a box, the drop should be $325 from the top--in the 10,900 box.

So, in order to ""resolve"" we should see a low of around 10,575 (give or take a few dollars.)

The big drop we experienced over the past couple of weeks was a previous LPW from July resolving.

This higher to run, the more harsh the drop is going to be.  Its not a ""law"" that they have to resolve--but it does make sense that a run up in a pole would be ""traders"" as as such, the formation would not build a support level that would rise up to meet a decline.  (Damned day traders!)

This brings up some conversation about this charting method.  This method is not as exact as some algorithms--it is not going to say, ""the top is $10,913 and the target fall back is $10,543.""  This process is for looking at movements and trying to gauge where they go next.  Do not day trade with this--but rather look for entry and exit points.

For example I gave an entry point the other day at the breakout around $10,500 and I figured it would run to $10,800 (based on the formation width.)  

It broke and ran.  But it did not do it in a straight line--nor did it stop where I said it would.  If you are trading using this process, ""trailing stops"" are the words of the day.  Keep the stop 3 boxes ($150) from the top.  In our case you would stop back out at $10,750 and wait for the drop to continue to fill the LPW.  It works just like a ""gap"" in traditional charting.

In Bitcoin especially, you will see movements blow past targets--both up and down--and you need to expect them, and prepare your trade to survive them.  If you are trading, your goal is to make a profit up--and down.  This method allows you to set those mental and trailing targets in order to maximize your profit.

Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin:
https://youtu.be/p0ftZgCEZos

TO GET STARTED, you need to buy some bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange. I recommend the cash app for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Then withdraw your Bitcoin to your own non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your money and not where someone else is holding your money, like the cash app where you bought it from. 

Not your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it from. 
 
I recommend using Mycelium Bitcoin wallet for Android. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet

Make sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. 

Never sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work. Don't day trade Bitcoin. Just buy and hold forever. There's so many people ~8 billion and only 21 million BTC. Bitcoin to infinity. 

Bitcoin is the first truly scarce digital asset. Bitcoin is digital gold.

Spend Bitcoin here:
https://Purse.io - buy anything from Amazon using Bitcoin and name your own discount. I usually do a 20-25% discount. 

Here's repository of stores that accept Bitcoin:
https://www.acceptedhere.io/

When spending your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (It goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). 

Check https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your payment. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. (Hopefully Mycelium)

My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.

My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.

The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.

Basically my `legal-will.txt` and a `where-is-the-seed.txt` files are both clear-signed with my PGP key and are replicated in separate geographic locations.",2020-09-17 06:49:00
g5i9vky,satoshisbitcoin,43,"To put the MSTR acquisition in context

1) Only ~550 companies total could ever acquire the quantity they bought, and that assumes all coins are mined, none are lost, and all early/long term holders sell out

2) There are literally tens of thousands of companies globally with as many or more assets. 

3) There are hundreds of companies with 100x the amount of cash on hand

4) None of this even considers market of debt holders, who hold several tens of trillions of dollars in debt instruments which are yielding 0% return and lose value every day to inflation. 

Epoch #2 was driven by retail buying

Epochs #3 and #4 will be driven by institutional buying,  and the magnitude of money there is not comprehensible to most 

That is what MSTR represents the start of.

And to put an even finer point to it, the CEO has posts on twitter from 2013 talking about how bitcoin is a complete scam and will crash, while today he is full in. When people convert, they convert hard. Now imagine institutional money doing the same.",2020-09-17 05:18:55
g5jb8ol,brokerringfreight0,33,"According to the indictments, the two men set up fake websites that spoofed login pages for the currency exchanges **Binance**, **Gemini** and **Poloniex**. Armed with stolen login credentials, the men allegedly stole more than $10 million from 142 Binance victims, $5.24 million from 158 Poloniex users, and $1.17 million from 42 Gemini customers.

Prosecutors say the men then laundered the stolen funds through an array of intermediary cryptocurrency accounts ‚Äî including compromised and fictitiously created accounts ‚Äî on the targeted cryptocurrency exchange platforms. In addition, the two are alleged to have artificially inflated the value of their ill-gotten gains by engaging in cryptocurrency price manipulation using some of the stolen funds.

For example, investigators alleged Potekhin and Karasavidi used compromised Poloniex accounts to place orders to purchase large volumes of ‚Äú[GAS](https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027772571-What-is-gas-),‚Äù the digital currency token used to pay the cost of executing transactions on the [NEO blockchain](https://neo.org/) ‚Äî China‚Äôs first open source blockchain platform.

‚ÄúUsing digital crurency in one victim Poloniex account, they placed an order to purchase approximately 8,000 GAS, thereby immediately increasing the market price of GAS from approximately $18 to $2,400,‚Äù the indictment explains.

Potekhin and others then converted the artificially inflated GAS in their own fictitious Poloniex accounts into other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). From the complaint:

&gt;‚ÄúBefore the Eight Fictitious Poloniex Accounts were frozen, POTEKHIN and others transferred approximately 759 ETH to nine digital currency addresses. Through a sophisticated and layered manner, the ETH from these nine digital currency addresses was sent through multiple intermediary accounts, before ultimately being deposited into a Bitfinex account controlled by Karasavidi.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***One victim said he contemplated suicide after being robbed of his ETH holdings in a 2017 phishing attack. Another said he‚Äôd been relieved of funds needed to pay for his 3-year-old daughter‚Äôs medical treatment.***  
&gt;

Imagine being a 'crypto investor' hoping to make a small return to afford medical treatment while some Boris steals ALL of it because you clicked on a fake link... And due to excellent design there is no recourse.

Not one person has paid me to check about you.


You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?
in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).


When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.


immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.


after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.
Best solution would be to pay me $1091.

We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

if you are planning on going to the law, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me, because it's hacked too.

if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.
Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.

If you need proof, reply with Yeah then i will send out your video recording to your 8 friends.

g5o461p,na3than,56,"First, tell your friend to remain calm about the bitcoin. It's not going anywhere. If it takes days, weeks or months to figure out where it is and how to access it, it will still be there, 100%. In the meantime, prioritize getting access to his computer(s), phone and email accounts. Don't let the email accounts go inactive as that could destroy their history. 

Second, tell your friend that there are thousands of people on the Internet who are legitimately interested in and willing to help her, for free, and thousands who would love to take advantage of her situation and steal her father's bitcoin. Honest helpers will always be willing to provide their assistance via open channels, visible to the public. She should be highly suspicious of anyone offering to help via private messages.

Her father's bitcoin could be stored in several places--possibly more than one. There's no central place to go to definitively find all of a person's bitcoin. To locate it and (hopefully) access it, she's going to need to learn how Bitcoin works. She's going to want to start a notebook, and keep its contents confidential. As she gains knowledge she'll learn how to ask for specific help on public Internet forums without disclosing too much information. 

His bitcoin could be on an exchange. Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken and Binance.us are widely used in the U.S., but there are many, many more exchanges domestically and abroad. If she can access his email and browser history, search them for signs he visited one or more cryptocurrency exchanges.

If she finds evidence he used an exchange, she can try contacting the exchange's support staff with proof of his death (i.e. Certificate of Death) and request a transfer of ownership of the account in accordance with his will or probate. 

If he bought bitcoin through an exchange, he may have transferred some or all of it off the exchange, potentially many times. Support staff might be willing to provide a list of outbound transactions, or if she can manage to login to the exchange account herself she should be able to find this in his transaction history. The transaction history will likely only show destination *addresses*--not names or descriptions of where the address is. She will quickly learn to recognize what bitcoin addresses look like. 

She should record each address, amount and transaction date in her notebook. Each address will need investigation to find out where it is (another exchange, a hardware wallet, a paper wallet, etc.) and if the bitcoin he sent to it is still there or has been transferred elsewhere. 

This is important: although no one can steal bitcoin using only an address, **she should not share the addresses she finds with anyone, since doing so will reveal how much bitcoin he had (either still in the wallet(s) that created those addresses, or transferred from them to other wallets he controlled) ... and if those amounts are significant that could make her a target.**

There's a lot more to be said, but the important things for her to know are: 1) don't trust strangers offering advice over private channels, 2) the trail of transfers might be lengthy, so keep organized notes, and 3) don't share addresses, codes, keys or anything else she finds publicly.",2020-09-18 12:53:56

2. They should have had some kind of rate limiting in place for accounts that were clearly algorithms hitting the site thousands of times a second.
3. They should have sold them over the day having their stock sold staggered and available at simi-random times periodically. 
4. They should have required some kind of email verification or login account and limit order to 1 along with a requirement that accounts be older than a month for first day purchases.
5. They should have started by selling the 3090 which is clearly only for people who need the card for work or bitcoin mining in order to test this process as well as allow people scalping to do so on a card line that companies could afford the scalped price, though honestly they should just consider a bitcoin variant at this point to help prevent their gaming cards from being wasted in a warehouse somewhere. 
6. They should have been shipping these out to retailers and reviewers for the last month or pushed this off a month until you had the stock for the demand you knew these cards would have in this market.

g5oji57,pebx,24,"Sure, Monero has no fixed block size limit like Bitcoin has with it's 1MB (+SegWit). In Monero there is a dynamic block size limit starting with 300kB where everything is simple, miners just fill blocks with all transactions waiting in the mempool and get the base block reward + fees from all transactions they included in their block.

It becomes interesting when mempool is getting bigger and many blocks are becoming full, that's the point where dynamic block size comes into action. It is counted as the median (in kB) of the last 100 blocks and a miner can build a bigger block but having to pay a penalty from his base block reward. So the miner will only increase the block size if the mempool is full with transactions paying more than his penalty for increasing would be.

When subsequent blocks are greater than 300kB, let's say 10% to 330kB, even if there might be empty blocks in between, the median will grow becoming the new ""normal"" where miners have no penalty any more filling their blocks with 330kB of transactions, as long the mempool is filled with transactions. If it gets empty, median will fall and the game begins again. However, if mempool is still full, 10% now would mean 33kB to 363kB and there is no hard limit, a miner can also go higher as long the algorithm sucks up 100% of his base reward and he only gets the fees of included transactions (normal level is minimum to do so, ""low"" tx priority will not incentive miners to increase the block size, however they should be still included when block size is already increased since a miner gets no penalty but additional fees).

Details can be found here: [https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4562/how-does-the-dynamic-blocksize-and-the-dynamic-fees-work-together-in-monero](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4562/how-does-the-dynamic-blocksize-and-the-dynamic-fees-work-together-in-monero)

If you have enough bitcoin, you'll become a sovereign individual. They can't tax, confiscate or censor your payments. You will be free to live where ever the laws of taxes suit you the most. In this system only the super wealthy have a finance infrastructure to keep money out of the hands of the state. There are taxhavens everywhere, they've access to fancy lawyers and tax evasion companies, shell companies and what not (Panama Papers!).

With bitcoin this is possible for the average Joe. Within a few years governments will have to become smaller and will have to really serve their citizens, instead of the other way around. It's either that, or no taxes at all...

#### 19 July 2011

The original r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is accused of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) the story years later:

&gt;Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.  
This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.  
Theymos wasn‚Äôt much better - wouldn‚Äôt re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.  
After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops.

Now imagine that you walk into the office where the manager of the mine sits and you reach into your pocket and take out a spoon and say to him:

""I want to mine here for gold with my spoon""

He just laughs and says ""You'll have to dig with your spoon for 1000's of years to even get anywhere close to finding a tiny tiny tiny bit of gold. You're better off just working a normal job and buying the gold from us instead"".

g5yiez8,bitusher,20,"Moores cliff means old ASICs do not become obsolete as quickly. ASICs are already down to 5nm , to put things in perspective Intels most expensive retail chips are still at 14nm , there really isn't that much more room for BTC ASICs to shrink which means decentralization of mining . There are also many fundamental misunderstandings people have towards the advantageous and disadvantageous in industrial mining.

A few things you need to understand about mining -
Chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung as 2 examples are the ones that are commissioned to make most ASIC chips(not the full assembled ASIC miner) based upon designs from Bitcoin ASIC manufactures. These foundries are involved in diverse chip making and obviously aren't directly involved in Bitcoin or its politics but fulfilling large orders from whoever commissions them.
The most popular ASIC manufacturers for Bitcoin right now are Whatsminer, Innosilicon, Bitmain, Caanan, Ebit, and Ebang. Many more ASIC manufacturers exist but they come and go based upon merit in a highly competitive race. For example Bitfury used to be one of the best manufacturers , and now has very little market share. Bitmain used to dominate , and than made some poor design decisions (lead engineer left them) and now competes with at least 4 others for the most efficient ASICs. This is a highly competitive and changing ecosystem.

Large miners main advantage is economies of scale over smaller miners. If you are an ASIC manufacturer you have large advantage over others because you can premine off your newest hardware and sell you last generation ASICs to others. This does occur , but is simplistic view and not the full picture. The reality is ASIC manufacturers Sell their newest ASICs with partners for industrial mining , sell their latest hardware to smaller miners for a premium, and mine themselves, while at the same time selling older ASICs on the market. Why do they do this? Because ASIC manufacturing is highly competitive and they need to hedge their investments as quickly as possible and de-risk from regulatory concerns as well.
Amateur mining doesn't come with many risks of manufacturers who come and go (they are forced to make huge investments in ASIC orders and have long development pipelines fraught with risks)

Amateur mining does not have the overhead of employees , security, regulatory compliance, building costs, tax liabilities , etc...
Now here is what is interesting, this last generation of ASICs that went from 7nm to 5nm in size did not have the same efficiency jumps as previous drops. This is because 5nm is already at the edge of what can be done with silicone, we can possibly shrink down to 2-3nm but it gets extremely difficult as the gates start to get the size of a few atoms wide and quantum concerns and heat become a very big concern.

Why is any of this important?

In the past when ASICs went from 14nm to 12nm there was larger improvements in efficiencies which gave an advantage towards those who could manufacture and mine themselves and their partners. ASICs would become obsolete sooner 8 months to 1 year at times which makes it difficult for amateur miners to recoup their investment in an ASIC especially those that by the slightly older generation equipment.
As moore's cliff approaches (we are already there as I don't see 3-4nm anytime soon) this means that this latest generation of ASICs will have a much longer shelf life which means the variable above is much less important and the greater importance is a complex mix of what sort of electrical rates you can get - overhead costs.
Now remember what I said about the advantageous of amateur mining. Industrial mining has other advantageous too like economies of scale and specialization but many disadvantageous as well.
What this ultimately means is we are entering a period of commoditization in mining(the opposite of centralization). The economics force this direction. industrial miners will still exist but more and more amateur miners will enter the ecosystem. Eventually new companies will be also created that create products to recycle the waste heat (already exists , but prices will start to drop considerably for consumers)",2020-09-20 19:11:54

The network size has exponentially risen, and most importantly large quantities of people trust and value bitcoin, not just as a get rich quick scheme but because of it's underlying fundamentals.

Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin:
https://youtu.be/p0ftZgCEZos

TO GET STARTED, you need to buy some bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange. I recommend the cash app for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Then withdraw your Bitcoin to your own non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your money and not where someone else is holding your money, like the cash app where you bought it from. 

Not your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it from. 
 
I recommend using Mycelium Bitcoin wallet for Android. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet

Make sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. 

Never sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work. Don't day trade Bitcoin. Just buy and hold forever. There's so many people ~8 billion and only 21 million BTC. Bitcoin to infinity. 

Bitcoin is the first truly scarce digital asset. Bitcoin is digital gold.

Here's repository of stores that accept Bitcoin:
https://www.acceptedhere.io/

When spending your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (It goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). 

Check https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your payment. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. (Hopefully Mycelium)

It's only genuinely useful for some _very specific_ use cases, like cryptocurrency. It doesn't really have any application to voting that wouldn't already be solved by other computer science technologies in this regard. Blockchain is only immutable in so far as the system allows it to be - bitcoin is only immutable because the majority of the bitcoin network agrees it is. With voting it could be possible to create a practically immutable system, with or without a blockchain, but even then you would need to make sure that fraudulent votes aren't being cast in the first place. 

This brings up the larger issue, which is that electronic voting is really risky regardless of whether it happens to use blockchain or not. It makes large scale voter fraud significantly easier - and consider how much of a target elections are for manipulation already. And while there are plenty of security controls that can be implemented to mitigate this, look at how many enormous corporations with practically unlimited resources to pour into security have been breached in the past few years.

None of this is necessarily a flaw with blockchain itself - it is a tool that can solve problems in some situations.

&gt; I have read that one of the major downsides to BTC is the transaction times.

No, in the past merchants typically accepted 0 confirmation transaction and these days we have something better called lightning.

When I spend from my lightning wallet I get instant confirmations in a secure manner that is private and can scale. My fees are typically a fraction of a penny to send Bitcoin for this. 

 &gt; Or would there have to be a 3rd party involved?

No , Bitcoin is scaling in many ways , each have different trust models . sidechains, eltoo, statechains, onchain , payment channels and more. 

The 2 recommended lightning wallets in the FAQ are both easy to use and **non custodial**

&gt;Or would a fork of BTC have to handle these payment types?

Bitcoin will continue to softfork in upgrades(next one is Taproot and sig aggregation will come after that leading to more onchain capacity scaling and privacy) and will even eventually hardfork in an upgrade as needed (Year 2038 problem) but we are scaling just fine today

The biggest issue with bitcoin being used as a day to day currency is UX , volatility , and acceptance. Altcoins are all much worse than bitcoin in these matters",2020-09-21 01:34:51
g60dee6,Oax_Mike,24,"&gt;I'm not really getting any meaningful gains.

Reading stories about Zuckerfuck, Bitcoin LOTTO winners and real estate gurus jumping their Lambo filled with nekkid super models into the pool can really throw off one's expectations for what percentage of annual gains is reasonable to expect.

If you're earning an average of 10% per year, you're doing great.

To achieve much beyond that you're looking at greatly adding to your risk.

And that's fine, if you are not risk-averse.

But for everyone that's got AAPL or TSLA tattooed across their buttocks gliding across Lake Havasu on one of their 3 Sea-Doos, there's someone else who used to be a multi-millionaire who's now mopping the mall food court wearing an Enron shirt.

&gt;Where do you invest to maximize gains?

This is a bullshit question.

Maximize gains compared to what? Compared to what level of risk.

There is no magical place to invest your money where you always achieve some maximized guaranteed gain.

More risk, more potential reward, more potential loss.

g68wcmo,aaj094,6,"Too much comparison off late between Bitcoin price action and that of gold. For some good reasons too but it bears well to take note of key differences too:

Everyone in the world knows about gold due to its long history. So the price of gold mostly reflects the quantum of appetite that exists at any point for a safe haven asset. 

With Bitcoin the price reflects a bit of the above but much more so is dictated by the increasing audience for Bitcoin. There is no such similar increasing audience factor for gold.

And the reason the price of Bitcoin is so volatile is that the small current audience keeps trying to front run the expected future gains by periodically over extending their capital. This causes pullbacks as ultimately the small audience at any point have only a certain risk bearing capacity. Easy to imagine this by induction. If only about 10 people in the world knew about Bitcoin then despite their knowledge or belief of what it could reach to, they still could not expect to have a liquid market price that would reflect what they expect in the far future. They just don't have the capital or risk taking capacity between themselves that can consistently price Bitcoin to its farthest value no matter how strongly they may believe in it. High sustainable price will come only when Bitcoin is adopted widely and not just when few foresee the adoption that is yet to occur. It can't. 

Gold positions can also try front running a bit but to a much lesser extent because the expected future gains are not that high and the market cap also too high to be impacted by few extended positions. Naturally lower volatility.",2020-09-23 04:52:56

g699xtx,diradder,2,"&gt; Better Security ‚Äì BTC has a vulnerability called RBF [...]

In no way is RBF is a ""vulnerability"" and it exists both on Bitcoin and BCH. Being able to ""**R**eplace **B**y **F**ee"" is the result of miners having a free choice for which pending valid transactions they want to include in their next block. If miners see a transaction with higher fees than a previous one spending from the same addresse(s) they will economically choose the most profitable one and no consensus rule prevents them to do so (on both chains). It is true that the RBF ""flag"" on transactions only exists on Bitcoin though, it's an opt-in flag that the sender sets on transactions and the receiver can easily know if a transaction has it or not. Bitcoin participants decided to add it to the protocol it in order to formalize the previously described behavior, and invalidate transactions with lower fees as soon as one with strictly higher fees exists. [More information here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/faq/optin_rbf/).

&gt; Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again [...]

0-conf has never been ""safe"" so it would be hard to make it ""safe again"". It will also most likely never will be ""safe"" as long as users will value the immutability of the transactions they receive. 0-conf completely ignores the fundamental concept of Proof-of-Work which is the only verifiable data on-chain that give you an idea of how final your transaction currently is. Before the first confirmation, you just hope that a transaction will be included in a block (sooner or later), you can argue that probabilistically on a chain with empty blocks a valid transaction has more chances to be included, but you cannot be ""safely"" affirm a miner isn't withholding a valid transaction with higher fees and will include it in his block (for example), you have no way to punish them if they do this (just like you have no way to prove they had knowledge of the transaction with lower fees).
 
&gt; Improved Scalability ‚Äì BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x [...]

32 times 1.7MB is not equal to 32MB, it's equal to 54.4MB, a limit BCH is far from achieving. Actually BCH is also far from having proved its ability to handle 32MB on a regular basis, even during artificial short-lived stresstests [some nasty bugs and bottlenecks show their face](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1036245691050483714).

&gt; Supply Scarcity ‚Äì During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash [...]

People losing access to their funds isn't something BCH should celebrate, you don't achieve a higher value by stripping people from their funds and practically donating them to everyone else who didn't get caught in the mess the hardfork created. Furthermore, the coins in those addresses were most likely not lost for everyone, the exchanges which owned them most likely still have access to them, and might even already have dumped them (which would have been a good financial decision for them considering the ever decreasing price of BCH since the fork).

&gt; Improved Confirmation Times ‚Äì Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. [...]

They may use RBF on BCH too as explained above. And doublespends which use this RBF mechanism [do occur on BCH](https://doublespend.cash/). Furthermore due to its low hashrate BCH (and BSV for that matter) are getting gamed by miners who burst mine the chain, and when they leave to mine something more profitable they often leave BCH with no block for hours ([recently more than 5 hours](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-cash-stopped-producing-blocks-for-5-5-hours-find-out-why/)). This isn't an ""improved"" confirmation time, and it makes 0-conf even more risky.

&gt; Higher Merchants Adoption - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. [...]

Pretty much everywhere BCH is accepted, Bitcoin was accepted before and still is. You will surely find few anecdotal shops which support only BCH or only another altcoin, but overall there are more Bitcoin ATM, more exchanges supporting Bitcoin, more payment processors accepting Bitcoin and inevitably more places to spend your bitcoins. The number of places accepting Bitcoin (or BCH) isn't the only metric that matters though, usage is by far more significant, if you take a look at usage of one of the most popular payment processor (Bitpay) which support both currencies (and others) you'll get a good idea of which one is used/adopted the most and [Bitcoin is a clear winner](https://i.imgur.com/uOsPvcR.png) (Source: [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/stats/)).
 
&gt; Low Fees ‚Äì One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. [...]

BCH does have lower fees, it is indisputable (unless you compare them with second layers on Bitcoin, like LN, where fees in absolute value in satoshis are often 100+ times lower per LN transaction). But the cost of these lower on-chain fees is hidden is the much more centralized and vulnerable network that seems to struggle attracting both users and miners after years of trying. The gamble you make by using BCH for small purchases is acceptable certainly for many people, it's much less acceptable for larger sums and pretty much all the reasonable exchanges translate this by asking many more confirmation for any BCH deposit (some exchanges might be reckless and try to compete with more established exchanges by taking more risk, it's pretty anecdotal though).

&gt; Tokens - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. [...]

[Colored coins](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins) have existed on Bitcoin for quite some time, it's not a novelty. Usage, even when fees/traffic on Bitcoin was much lower never really picked up because of the inherent limitations of a non-Turing complete scripting language. When alternatives like Ethereum provide a similar concept with much more powerful (and costly) scripting capabilities it's a no-brainer why users/businesses choose the system dedicated to this kind of tasks, instead of using a deliberately more limited system that purposefully wasn't meant to solve this kind of specialized issues.

&gt; Better Privacy - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. [...]

Those mixing tools do provide some form of utility and considering the explosion in UTXO they would cause (in case of democratized usage it would also increasing the common size of transactions, unless people consolidate and risk deanonymizing themselves) aren't very practical on Bitcoin with its current limitation. These issues are being addressed through signature aggregation/Taproot/Tapscript on Bitcoin, which shouldn't have the same kind of issues as far as I know. Considering this, Monero still seems a better alternative to both of this if you essentially want/need privacy... and in this regard there is much more liquidity in exchanges for Bitcoin/Monero pairs than for BCH/Monero.

&gt; Better Risk/Reward - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

If that was a sound financial advice why would people choose BCH? There are plenty of other coins fulfilling the same goals, even some Bitcoin forks that have an even greater risk/reward ratio when you look at this... this really sounds like just a bad advertisement you'd use to convince gamblers, not people who actually see utility in BCH.

&gt; At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space.

How long will those ""effects"" last, it's been more than three years now that you and your friends have been singing the same song and the value of BCH hasn't ceased to decrease vs. Bitcoin in the same time. This BCH ""flippening"" has been demonstrated to be more elusive than even the Lightning Network and its outdated ""18 months"" meme... the latter at least got it's first release about 2.5 year ago and is currently in use/grows.

&gt; It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.

As you prefaced your whole copypasta (considering you post this same message every 2-3 messages you post on r\/btc... kinda start to feel like advertisement/propaganda at this point), this is just your ""opinion"". It could become a reality, who knows, but by all the metrics available now it's far from achieving this and it's not on track to do it either.",2020-09-23 06:46:30

&gt;There is no distribution of CP for the sake of distribution of CP going on in the BSV network to my knowledge.

It's a guaranteed way to get some CP that won't ever be taken down. And the precedent that's been set is uploaders probably won't get caught if they take a modicum of precautions.

For the ""**Hansa**"" bust, a security firm had found a development server the owners of the Dark Market were using. The real server was protected by Tor and not the development server. The security firm recorded the IP address and gave it to the police. From there the police took control of the site and apparently found archives of IRC conversations that included the full names of the administrators. The admin also made bitcoin transactions using an address that was found in the IRC chat logs. They traced one transaction to an exchange in the Netherlands and forced the owner of the exchange to cough up more information about the user who had cashed the bitcoins.

After taking over Hansa, police rewrote the site's code, they say, to log every user's password, rather than store them as encrypted hashes.  They tweaked a feature designed to automatically encrypt messages with  users' PGP keys, so that it secretly logged each message's full text  before encrypting it, which in many cases allowed them to capture  buyers' home addresses as they sent the information to sellers. The site  had been set up to automatically removed metadata from photos of  products uploaded to the site; they altered that function so that it  first recorded a copy of the image with metadata intact. That enabled  them to pull geolocation data from many photos that sellers had taken of  their illegal wares.

The police eventually became so brazen that they staged a fake server  glitch that deleted all the photos from the site, forcing sellers to  re-upload photos and giving Dutch authorities another chance to capture  the metadata. That ruse alone snagged the geolocated coordinates of more  than 50 dealers.

Police also tricked users into downloading and running a homing beacon. Hansa  offered sellers a file to serve as a backup key, designed to let them  recover bitcoin sent to them after 90 days even if the sites were to go  down. Of course the file was poisoned and when users opened it, their device would connect to a unique url, revealing the seller's IP address to the police.

\*\*Another security flaw was: Reddit/r/DarkNetMarkets **(now banned)**

Many users connected to Reddit outside Tor and openly discussed their use of those DarkWeb markets, allowing police to track them.

The one golden rule of Tor users sounds like the rules of Fight Club: ""Never talk about Tor outside Tor...""

**So basically, the cops did not break Tor, what they did is to capitalize on mistakes the Administrators of the dark web marketplaces make... And, they make a lot more mistakes than they care to admit.**",2020-09-23 04:18:47

g6d1eac,cryptOwOcurrency,42,"*A gift from yours truly, professional hopium writer.*

Reminder: Fundamentals don't matter until they do.

Ethereum can go a long fcking way on fundamentals before the price catches up. But when it does, it will catch up violently.

* Ethereum flipping BTC in transaction fees and volume wasn't enough for the price to catch up.

* The Ethereum network's top crypto exchange overtaking the top centralized crypto exchange wasn't enough.

* The Ethereum network custodying over 0.5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist (and rising) wasn't enough.

* A finalized, working Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 testnet wasn't enough.

* The Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract launching on mainnet next month wasn't enough.

* A credible claim that 2.0 Phase 0 will be launched this year wasn't enough.

The more comical and incongruous it becomes that Ether is valued so low compared to its improving fundamentals, the more violent the upward price snap will be when those fundamentals are priced in. You saw it over and over with Bitcoin between 2010-2015 back when it had fundamentals (lol), and Ethereum is no different.

* Maybe the launch of the Eth 2.0 deposit contract will be enough.

* Maybe the launch of Phase 0 and the subsequent Ether lockup and earnings via staking will be enough.

* Maybe the widespread adoption of Layer 2 payments and smart contracts will be enough.

* Maybe Ethereum attaining negative issuance with PoS, locking in a sound monetary policy, will be enough.

* Maybe EY, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Samsung or Overstock finally launching their fervently developed internal Ethereum projects as public, commercial B2B services will be enough.

* Maybe the ability for your gran-gran to send $15 to her nephew in Argentina using the Bank Of America app on her Kindle Fire (using Ethereum under the hood) will be enough.

It's all coming. I couldn't tell you when, but what I *can* tell you is this:

Whenever the market finally wakes the fuck up, whether it's in 1 month, 1 year, or 3 years, this shit's going hard.

Right now Ethereum is forgotten, dormant. Most non-ethfinance people still think that Phase 0 will be in development for the next few years. News flash, the code is done and this shit is launching.

After a multi-year rest considering its design space, the Ethereum dino is waking up. You heard it here first.

It's a mixture of frustration and being impatient. In the long term,  Eth is 100% going to be $10k+. I know it's a meme, but to me and so many others the technology and what it allows can ONLY be worth &gt;$10k. 

I have much love for BTC, but seriously...it has done nothing of importance or noteworthy in the past 3-4 years. Anything BTC can do, Eth can do better. The idea prevalent among old school bitcoiners was to adapt new technology that other cryptocoins were bringing to the table. But that was abandoned at the side of the road years ago.

g6dcu8r,cryptOwOcurrency,5,"&gt; Can you get me excited for phase 0?

Sure thing.

Once Phase 0 launches, nobody can say that Ethereum 2.0 is vaporware anymore, because look, here's a massive part of it - the backbone - and it's up and running in production. The discussion will shift from ""The Ethereum Foundation has never shipped and will never ship"" to ""But what if the later phases are delayed?"" That doesn't sound like a big change in rhetoric, but it's a huge blow to one of the biggest talking points of both Bitcoin Maxis and Ethereum Killers alike.

Also, when Phase 0 launches:

* A bunch of Ether will be locked up in the deposit contract, impossible to sell until they are transferable during Phase 1-2 of 2.0. This will be a straight up reduction in ETH supply for at least a year or two, putting a thumb on the scale towards a higher price if demand stays the same.

* But wait, demand might actually increase, because Ether will become a productive asset. Instead of just sitting there, you can stake it with no counterparty risk (unless you consider hardware/internet/client failure a counterparty risk). Alternatively, you can earn interest on something like Rocketpool. Even though beacon chain ETH won't be ""useful"" until the future, I would be surprised if it's a lot cheaper than 1.0 ETH on the market (Rocket Pool is planning to make beacon chain ETH tradeable IIRC). I'll say, if I can snatch up a bunch of beacon chain ETH at a heavy discount, I'm planning to do it for sure, and a lot of other people probably feel the same. Because upon Phase 1-2 launch, all that beacon chain ETH will become ""real ETH"" and can be sold at a premium price.

So with reduced supply (due to beacon chain lockup) and increased demand (due to beacon chain interest rewards), it might be enough to impact the price. It's kind of like a funny loan in a way, Ether is borrowing value from the future by promising payouts in the future. Beacon chain rewards don't in practical terms need to be ""paid out"" (just accounted for) until Phase 1-2 when beacon ETH finally becomes a useful asset (in other words ""real"", can pay transaction fees, and is freely exchangeable with 1.0 ETH).

Those are some of the reasons you should be excited about Phase 0 from a price perspective, my friend.",2020-09-24 08:53:06

For now, and Bitcoin is the market leader and has been for a very long time.

Helping Ethereum is **not** the problem, the problem is that it kills one of Tezos' best existing route to bootstrap greater network effect.

&gt;. but i wonder if perhaps it wont also increase the network effects of tezos

There are very clear reasons why this would harm Tezos' network effect and no good reason to think it would increase it.

&gt;. something unexpected could happen like ethereum folk might buy tezos so they can stake and wrap it

They wouldn't be staking it, StakerDAO would be. And then what? They're still not using Tezos, sooner or later, they look at it as being no different than some random ERC-20 that inflates and distributes 5% a year.

So, you can use a mobile wallet on your phone for easy portability. Hell, you could have a printed QR code and do litecoin transactions just by scanning that QR code if you really wanted (paper wallet). Of course, keep your main holdings in a 'cold' wallet, like on your home computer (or safely stored paper / hardware wallet). Just backup the private key somewhere safe. Hell, if you had the world's biggest brain, you could just memorize your private key and can do transactions without any kind of device (minus the device you'd use to broadcast the transaction from). Of course, don't attempt this, cause brains suck. But in theory you could do litecoin transactions this way lol.
* You can lose money on accident, but it has to be YOUR accident by sending LTC to a Bitcoin address that you don't control, or sending it to another Litecoin address you don't control, or losing your wallet and not having any backup. As long as LTC is in a wallet you control and have the private keys to, it's yours. Nobody can touch it. There's no such thing as a server exploit in blockchain (maybe in smart contracts on ETH, or chains still in development, but not LTC which is just a BTC clone). The only 'server exploit' is a 51% attack, where someone uses 51% or more of the entire Litecoin Network's computing power to make false transactions. But, this is stupidly expensive to do and can be undone once the attack finishes by rejecting the false chain (technical shit, not to worry about). This kind of attack usually targets large exchanges that have a lot of money and transactions, like Ethereum Classic recently had someone do this, where they sent ETC to an exchange during an attack, used that ETC to buy other crypto, then reversed the ETC transaction with their attack, thus stealing money from the exchange. Again, your funds are safe in this event, since the attacker and only reverse their own transactions (need keys to do anything with a wallet remember!), or prevent other transactions from getting confirmations (overwriting blockchain). They CAN NOT move anyone else's money that they don't have keys for.
* Sure, if someone has a litecoin wallet and accepts it, you can use it as payment. Or, you can go the route of say [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and load your litecoin on their wallet (centralized, not your keys!) and use Crypto Pay to make payments by spending your litecoin and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) handles the intermediary stuff (like if merchant wants dollars instead). There's many other payment gateways like this that will facilitate your crypto payment between you and a merchant, do some research see if there's popular ones in your country already.
* The only way Litecoin would not be usable, is if the entire internet globally just got destroyed. Even then, people have already sent Bitcoin transactions via RADIO and Satellite, and there is at least one Bitcoin node in space already today. Honestly, if the internet was to be crippled, cryptocurrencies would probably be one of the first online technologies to resurface due to it's decentralized nature. Even if the internet and all other means of conducting transactions just stopped existing, the Litecoin would still exist. You'd never lose it, you'd just lose access to it. As soon as there's a way to connect nodes to a network again, you can use your Litecoin again. Just to add to Crypto's immutability: Right now in China (which has some of the strictest currency laws), lots of people are using Crypto to move money out of China, which they couldn't do before - and China can't do anything about it due to the decentralized nature of crypto.
* In replacement of country's currency... Depends on your country. You might get prosecuted if they don't like it and you're under some military dictatorship. Depends on your local laws. And, depends how easy it is for you to conduct commerce in your country with Litecoin (again, via a payment gateway, or direct) and to on and offramp to your local fiat if necessary. Pretty sure Russia just made it illegal to do commerce with crypto, while also developing their own state crypto lol. You can still own crypto in Russia, but you best not get caught buying anything with it. If your country is still clueless about crypto and has no laws, then it's free game.
* It's decentralized. As long as you have a way to broadcast a transaction, and have your keys, Litecoin is always usable. If you lose your wallet / keys, you can no longer access your funds and nobody can recover it for you. You must control custody of your keys at all time, which is why you should back them up and save them somewhere safe. Even if your phone gets lost, stolen, broken and you had Litecoin on a mobile wallet -- as long as you had the private key backed up you can move those funds to a new wallet with new keys. Needless to say, NEVER give anyone your private keys cause then they can control your wallet and take your money.

Better Security ‚Äì BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations.

Improved Scalability ‚Äì BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

Supply Scarcity ‚Äì During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

Improved Confirmation Times ‚Äì Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

Low Fees ‚Äì One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

Better Privacy - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

This is unlikely to occur for these reasons 

1) local government officials greatly benefit from bitcoin mining

2) If this attack did occur the government would need to spend more more to attack Bitcoin than they would get from the attack 

3) Such an attack would be seen as totalitarian by many people and their would be severe degree of consequences

&gt;you say that China is quite a big threat to the existence of bitcoin?

A 51% attack isn't game over for Bitcoin. certain low hashrate PoW altcoins have been 51% attacked and they are still around. Some did not even drop any in price either. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM

&gt;but does the fact that they could do this if they want to concern you?

There are much bigger and more likely threats , 51% because the incentives , game theory , and cost to pull off(The beauty of Proof of Work) are lower on my list of concerns

1) lowers data costs for miners 

2) Creates standards for easier Bitcoin upgrades

3)  authenticated encryption to prevent hashrate hijacking

4) allows users mining to select their own transaction set to include in a block instead of the pool 

5) Eliminates incentives to create empty blocks

Do you account for the very, very tiny percentage of the world that actually have ever even owned Bitcoin?

The saturation of Bitcoin participants and ownership have just barely scratched the surface compared to where it will be if it even continues at this present growth rate (Which will likely exponentially increase in speed).

g6ok6ah,SenatusSPQR,3,"Speaking as someone who feels like he knows a thing or two about crypto: I feel like Lightning is on the one hand way too complicated and cumbersome, and that the solutions that try to fix this situation effectively get rid of Bitcoin's security model. So the way I see it, Bitcoin on layer 1 is secure in the sense that there's a lot of hash power, however it's not a currency because it's too slow and fees are too high. Layer 2 has far lower fees and is far faster, but gives up the aspects of Bitcoin that make it attractive in the first place.

If you actually want to have a cryptocurrency that you can eventually use as a common way to transact, I'd recommend looking into [Nano](https://nano.org/) in case you haven't heard of it yet. It solves the fee/speed problem of Bitcoin and keeps its network secure through having a different incentive scheme from Bitcoin. What I mean by this is that Bitcoin mining, due to concentration of viable places for mining and due to economies of scale, will be increasingly concentrated and thus less secure. Nano chose a different method, by aligning the incentives of those with the biggest investment in Nano with the incentives of the regular user.

Furthermore, while in Bitcoin you have to depend on the longest chain and probabilistic security in the sense that more confirmations = more security, all Nano transactions are instantly (within a second) cemented and can never be rolled back.

The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

Tokens - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. You can get some free tokens by joining the discord chat at 1BCH.com

Better Privacy - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

Better Risk/Reward - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",2020-09-26 03:46:16

g6pszu1,LogrisTheBard,9,"So I've been thinking a bit about what how I would go about making off with 150M in illicit Kucoin gains if I was in the hacker's position. To start with, the funds are on close to a dozen blockchains. Assuming I want laundered fiat money how do you get it using dirty funds? People always say Bitcoin is used for drug dealing but both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the opposite of privacy coins. There's a full audit trail.

First off there is the multi-chain problem. It will be interesting to see how far we can follow the audit trail of those funds before he finds an anonymous egress. Is he going to figure out some type of bridge to export those funds to another blockchain. Like tBTC to get it on Ethereum sure, but I'm not aware of a bridge to monero or something. Similar problem for the XRP, XLM, TRX, LTC, etc.

Even just washing the ETH and ERC-20 assets is a challenge at scale. Like is he going to start going down the local ethereum route to sell this stuff? Fine for a few thousand, troubling for a few million. You're not going through best buy gift cards at that scale. Just for ERC-20 assets tornado.cash might be fine if he's ok drawing that amount out over 30 years. If he wants the money in his lifetime however it's not a valid option. Secret Network? Too centralized still, the consortium of nodes would probably be willing to shut down once you deposit and reorg the chain to slash your funds.

If you can't wash the address how do you get it to fiat without KYC? You can't hit an exchange unless it's truly shady and I'm not aware of a exchange that has fiat + bank integration while being shady enough to not respond to an event this size and cooperate with law enforcement and provide details wrt the bank accounts withdrawn to. Even if the address is washed withdraws of a few million will probably raise some questions if done around the time the funds were anonymized.

Ironically once you get it to *any* electronic fiat that's where things get easier. Forex, private banking institutions, and straight up corruption would enable the laundering at that point. Drug cartels launder money using banks, not Bitcoin. Change my view...",2020-09-27 04:53:26

Network effect. Bitcoin had a head start over Monero.

&gt;Obviously it currently has higher transaction speeds due to a lower number of users...

Transaction speed is faster simply because Monero's block time is 2 minutes vs Bitcoin's 10 minutes. It has nothing to do with the amount of users.

&gt;but as I understand it monero is bitcoin + a few anonimity modifications to the protocol...

You understand wrongly. Monero is completely different. Different code, different protocol.

&gt;...computational power required for mining given the same transaction volume ...

Transaction volume doesn't really have anything to do with the computational power required to mine.

&gt;how much are you paying for anonimity?

In short, this sub downvotes unpopular comments with good questions and useful information, and upvotes non-comments that I then have to wade through to get to them.

I don't remember /r/ethfinance (and formerly /r/ethtrader) always being this touchy. In some ways it's like /r/bitcoin lite.

One big part of this is how this subreddit religiously downvotes any comment that mentions any Ethereum competitor. It discourages people from expressing potentially valid concerns about Ethereum (Ethereum is good but not perfect! shocker!), and so obstructs useful information flow from coming into this subreddit from elsewhere.

For example, /r/ethfinance users downvoted [this top-level question about Avalanche](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/j0m2v6/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2020/g6w3vdy/?context=1) enough that one of the replies called it out. Yet there are plenty of highly upvoted top-level non-comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/j0m2v6/daily_general_discussion_september_27_2020/g6vuqtl/) (sorry dave) that I have to waste my time on if I'm trying to find the ideologically useful comment threads like that Avalanche one.

I'm starting to prefer the discussion threads on /r/cryptocurrency in some respects because I know that despite the hate boner the users (and mods?) have against Ethereum, at least I will get contrary opinions that help me think critically about my Ethereum investments. Because in cryptocurrency, if you're not constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the risks of your investments, you're prey to the market. And nobody wants to be prey.

We need to be encouraging people to ask critical questions about the Ethereum ecosystem, not downvoting them. That's how this whole ""antifragile"" thing is supposed to work. Every crap experience someone has with Ethereum is a data point that we can use to improve the system and truly build the financial network of the future. Our ears need to be wide open to this kind of stuff.

All of that said, I just went into Reddit settings and hid score counts and disabled comment collapsing so I can better see unpopular opinions here, and speak my own without worrying about ""number go down"". When this subreddit learns how to vote on posts based on their signal-to-noise ratio instead of with their peepee, I'll consider turning the filter back on.

It is not restricted to any country or region so it will never be threatened by a digital fiat. 

As this progression continues, sell pressure will mean less and less, because those selling will be met with equal buying pressure as more and more individuals and companies hold some portion of wealth withing the Bitcoin ecosystem. But it is critical to understand that this takes time. Currently a large player can impact the price because their portion of the whole is still in some cases relatively large and triggers additional buy and sell orders and FOMO when they make their move. This ability to influence price will diminish over time if things continue to progress as they are. But again, it will take time.

I used to spend a lot of time in this forum but it's kind of gone downhill .. and I would agree that the sentiment here, as I've checked in, seems overly-bullish given the current arch of the market cycle.  But to compare sentiment to ""new paradigm / return to normal"" seems completely tone deaf.  There is no euphoria in the general market right now as I can see it.  I spend more time now on Telegram and other crypto forums and the mood is hope coupled with skepticism.  The world is in a very unsure place and there is no flood of the new Bitcoin rich.  The crypto markets are nowhere near any moon stage comparable with prior cycles.  

To me this looks like the slow grind out of the prior bear market with likely many more head fakes in front of us.  There is no guarantee, of course, that we see yet another boom cycle.  But my sanity check has always been ""Can I see Bitcoin and other crypto projects being major players in 5 years time?"" My answer to this is still a resounding 'yes'.

g6zxn6m,MoneroArbo,8,"FTA:

&gt; Bitcoin will always remain a separate species thanks to the following two forces:

&gt; - Its decentralization.
&gt; - Its monetary attributes.

Yet bitcoin is arguably weak on both fronts

First, monetary attributes. The truth is, bitcoin has a fungibility problem, yet fungibility is one of the core attributes of sound money. If you don't think bitcoin has a fungibility problem, let me ask you, would you swap bitcoins from the recent Kucoin hack with some fresh clean bitcoin you just got from Coinbase? Would you do it for a 2% fee? 10%? How much would somebody have to pay for you to take that trade? That's a fungibility problem. Cash doesn't have this issue. Private blockchains don't have this issue.

As for decentralization, while there are a number of ways to measure and think about decentralization, the fact is that bitcoin mining and mining hardware production are both highly centralized. Other measures of decentralization, like say node count, are in no small part due to the size of the bitcoin network. If a competitor were to supersede it, and I'm not even saying that's likely, it would garner more stakeholders and likely become more decentralized in the processes.

Don't get me wrong. Most alt coins are indeed shit. But some are done in the spirit of bitcoin while offering things it doesn't, and even if they don't supersede bitcoin they may come to take up a stable and significant portion of the market. I don't see any reason why they would trend to zero unless bitcoin has added all the capabilities of its competitors so that there's no room for other projects to differentiate themselves. But I think that's exceedingly unlikely. The bigger bitcoin becomes, the more resistant it is to changing.",2020-09-29 06:37:52

g6z4ll0,MobTwo,7,"I did a thesis on social networks for my postgrad studies and in it, I argued why Facebook will win the social network race. It's easy to see that now but back then, Facebook was lagging behind at 3rd place, while Friendster was #1 and MySpace was #2. Unfortunately, I don't have special powers. What I can do, however, is using certain information to extrapolate forward what is likely to happen.

So what are those information?

If you ever used Friendster during that period, you may realize that at a certain point, their site took much longer to render. They can't scale and user experience became really bad. You had to wait 1 minute for the webpage to even show up. Even though Friendster had the largest network effect of all 3 social network platforms, they gradually declined over the years. You don't hear much about them anymore today.

MySpace and Facebook was better in its user experience and MySpace was doing really well. So how did they lose to Facebook?

In my opinion, I think the reason boils down to how Facebook opened up their platform and lower the barrier and empowered anyone to create applications on its platform. This means that instead of Facebook's small team trying to build stuff, they made it so that anyone can become a developer easily on their platform. Suddenly, people started building games and all the other stuff on Facebook (which attracted more users to Facebook and that attracts even more developers). Suddenly, Facebook has few million developers, building stuff without salary, for Facebook's users. It took MySpace few months to catch up to this but even so, they already lost the lead to Facebook.

Bitcoin with their horrible user experience and high fees is like Friendster and they will inevitably lose their spot. I think more developers and businesses need to be aware that they can build smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash easily today using CashScript and other tools. A good place to start is https://developer.bitcoin.com/

Users can easily mint tokens on Bitcoin Cash today for their business ideas and creativity. And if you're a darknet vendor, you want to use Bitcoin Cash's CashFusion for better privacy and anonymity. These empower users and I think it's great, though probably we can keep doing more. We still have work to do for sure.

I'm also going to publicly say, just as I had done so for Friendster/MySpace/Facebook, I will extrapolate (based on existing information) that Bitcoin Cash will take the number 1 position eventually. Sometimes, markets take longer to price things correctly, but they will almost always happen eventually.",2020-09-29 02:55:52
