gapynxt,SenatusSPQR,3,"Sure. The new sort of .. mantra? Is that Bitcoin is a store of value. Throughout history, stores of value have arisen from things that are useful in other ways. Typically, they are useful as mediums of exchange.

Bitcoin is not a particularly good medium of exchange, thus it will inevitably be a worse store of value over the long term vs cryptocurrencies that are good mediums of exchange. It's obvious that Bitcoin is becoming an ever worse medium of exchange, because of the increasing fees, and ever increasing transaction times.

The price of Bitcoin might actually still go a fair bit higher, simply because of hype, but that's not sustainable. So in the long run, I don't think Bitcoin will further increase in value.",2020-11-01 03:36:10

gaq8gt8,sednax,2,"If you want to have a 1:1 backing of wrapped Kin and stellar kin then you need to store exactly the amount kin that you mint and burn. Yes the question indeed is how to store the stellar kin on ethereum. If you can just see what wrapped Bitcoin does: they store it in a centralised wallet managed by a custodian. You cannot store secret stuff on the ethereum blockchain, so the secret key to the stellar kin cannot be saved on a contract.

It's literally the wrapped Bitcoin project but then for stellar kin. Their solidity contracts even allow for multiple merchants (entities where you can convert) and custodians.

Bitcoin isn't in a parabolic phase yet. It's still in the early stage of a bull market. So there are gonna be dips along the road. So there's no big risk in keeping some cash on the side.

Or what I'm doing, since I'm not keen on holding on to dollars right now, is put your cash in a gold ETF. It might go down a little in the short run, but gold is pretty solid to go up, especially with the dollar losing value, and the world in a recession.

Lmfao 😂 I was looking for electrum in the app store and found exodus and I wasn't sure if electrum was something safe to download on my computer lol I only have the 1 gaming computer and the 1 laptop strictly for college 

This shit is pretty scary which is why I'm trying my best to research and learn as much about it as I can before I go all in on it or if going all in is wise or not because honestly if it's safe I would absolutely use crypto exclusively I mean coinbase is about to drop a visa/mastercard debit card that I can use my crypto anywhere visa/mastercard is accepted so if I understand correctly I can use it on Amazon and I'd try figuring out a way to get my paychecks in bitcoins instead cause I like the idea of my money being unhackable lol

gaqkxoo,jcoinner,1,"You're on the right track. Read and learn. Start with small amounts before going all in with serious amounts.

altcoins are mostly all scams because they are mostly controlled by one or a few people. There's always some story about why it's great - kinda like penny stocks. Mostly it's all gambling because none of them have the security, track record and universality of Bitcoin. 

Ethereum - maybe a bit harder to say but it has some serious faults and if you are just concerned with storing value and sometimes buying stuff you can do without it. There's a truck load of scammy stuff don on top of Ethereum and if you start down that rabbit hole you'll most likely have even more confusion, headaches and lose your money in the end.

Bets bet for ease and security is to get a Trezor, Ledger or Coldcard and use that for  Bitcoin savings. You can use the software they provide but flexibility and privacy can be improved with Electrum (in conjunction with device). I've been using Electrum since 2011, both alone and with hw device. I've been paid in Bitcoin for dev work since 2013 and mostly live off it. Services like bitrefill.com really help with buying stuff using gift codes at popular stores.

This guy has been interested and trying to learn about blockchain and CBDCs for a while but he’s clearly getting fed all of the bitcoin maxi nonsense about how only Lightning is the future of digital payments (I haven’t heard much about stablecoins or Ethereum).

If only someone could inform this guy (and Raoul) about stablecoins and all of their different flavors. Lightning is cool and welcome but it sure as shit isn’t going to be for everyone (everyday payments with a volatile coin is not going to be desirable anytime soon, especially if there’s a chance it’s worth 10% more tomorrow), and sure and shit won’t be here sooner than L2 private stablecoins (Aztec, etc.).

**DRM = Digital Rights Management = ""piracy"" protection**

The large conglomerates absolutely hate the fact that customers have options to  copy stuff and edit stuff and in general do anything except pay money to consume content the way that ""content owners"" want them to. They have for ages. 

Like, back in the 80s movie studios tried to get VCRs banned by law because they knew that being able to record and watch stuff whenever you wanted would cut into their profits. (Funnily enough they sued SONY because they made the first commercially viable VCR, and SONY is now one of the key-proponents of DRMing stuff to hell and back haha. And, like a decade or so ago, SONY put actual hidden software on ALL their Audio CDs that installed itself on customer computers *without their knowledge* and modified the operating system in a way that would make it impossible for the consumer to copy any of their music onto that computer ever again and on top of that collected customer data and sent it to Sony. That was a huge scandal back in the day. How quick the tables turn.)

**Block Chain Technology?**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a tech person and I really don't know how to explain blockchain technology properly so it makes sense, but I'll try:

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the premise behind blockchain technology is that there is a decentralized network (most often on a peer-to-peer basis, think torrents) and there is a sort of ledger that everyone can access to check whether transactions that are made are legitimate. Like, you buy something off of someone else for a given value of 'money' (read: specific data blocks that are completely unique) and that transaction is recorded for everyone to see.

That makes it technically impossible for someone to scam somebody else. Once the transaction has been noted, the guy who spent the original ""data blocks"" cannot spend the same data blocks again.

I believe that the theory behind blockchain based DRM  is that you don't buy the direct music or movie file anymore, but instead you buy a license to access it, and the fact that you have bought it is noted in the decentralized ledger. The program you wish to consume it  from checks the ledger to see wether your device has bought legitimate access. 

The goal they have is to prevent actual copying of mp3 files or videos or even tv broadcasts, meaning they absolutely hate the fact that your computer or phone is capable of uploading and re-uploading stuff to file sharing sites while they don't get a cut of the profits unless the content hoster is able to realize that it's originally their property. They also absolutely want to get rid of youtube. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the problem is that Blockchain DRM doesn't actually work. Like, not unless the only way to access the content is a closed system (like for example only being able to listen to Bangtan songs via a specific app, say WeVerse Music or whatever they want to call it.) That's why JYP, SM and BigHit have partnered up with SK Telekom to make their own private ""content streaming service"" that will supposedly be based on blockchain technology. The company they all have stakes in that is developing it is called [Dreamus](https://www.dreamuscompany.com/). 

But even that's not really a way that will completely avoid piracy. Like it's got the same weaknesses that all DRM protected streaming services have, be they blockchain based or not. Like, if you're watching a movie that you rented on whatever platform, you can simply run a program that captures both your devices' audio and video (probably at a loss of quality which is negligible to most consumers) and the resulting file will not be copyright protected anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Blockchain-based fan-reward systems** have been tried before. It involves the fan buying a specific kind of blockchain-based currency (like BitCoin, but you can only redeem it in a specific marketplace like you see in freemium video games for example). If you buy an album with the currency, you'll save a couple dollars because you're a loyal enough fan to buy their currency. *But* the agency will only allow you to buy the currency in bulk. Say, you have to spend an actual 50 US Dollars to get ""50 SM ENT rubies"" but the album you want only costs 25 SM Rubies which means the remaining 25 US Dollars remain in the SM ENT Eco System and you cannot spend them anywhere else. 

The currency is worthless outside of the SM ENT Eco System, so you cannot exchange the remaining currency you have for actual dollars again leaving you either the choice of buying something else from SM (and possibly having to buy another package because what you want actually costs 30 and you only have 25 remaining SM ENT rubies) or leaving the ""money"" unused in their system. 

You'll also be able to get SM ENT rubies through fan-interaction like sharing group pictures and amassing likes and similar stuff, leading to more fan interaction, leading to more profit for the agency.

It’s important to note that while Monero transactions are larger/take longer to verify than “normal” Bitcoin transactions, attempting to use Bitcoin privately is more expensive, requires more storage (larger transactions than a Monero transaction), and takes far more time and effort.

Monero has setup ways to scale L1 moving forward, such a dynamic block sizes, and have made massive strides in reducing transactions costs, sizes, and verification times.

gatpyn3,mmstick,4,"You've basically described most alt coins since summer. Tezos went to $4+ and is now down to $1.9. Cardano went to $0.14 and is now down to $0.096. Stellar went to $0.11 and is now down to $0.077. These things happen regularly each year in crypto.

The whole alt coin market is down right now because people are stacking Bitcoin + Ethereum (which appears to be overbought right now). Eventually it will do as it always does, and some of that Bitcoin + Ether will get sold to reinvest back into alt coins, causing a significant rise in alt coin values. We are in the calm before the storm.

Now's the perfect time to buy because most people are distracted and don't see what Algorand is doing right now. It took Ethereum several years before it started getting hyped. If even a fraction of Ethereum's market volume was redirected to Algorand, the value of Algorand would rise significantly.

gay2p6l,IceTeaSupreme,8,"&gt;the idea that inflation is desirable is an idea that gets thrown around so much

If by ""thrown around"" you mean repeatedly stated in macroeconomic theory, and concluded repeatedly in economic research... then yes, it is ""thrown around"" a lot.

&gt; Inflation is only necessary in order to sustain the massive government debts we have come accustomed to

Inflation is necessary to ensure that people spend and invest their money rather than hoarding it. And yes, it is also useful for controlling debt. It's called monetary policy.

&gt; If we had 0% inflation

If we had 0% inflation, people wouldn't have pension funds, they'd have savings accounts.

&gt; 2% deflation

If we had 2% deflation I sure as shit wouldn't invest in anything, it would be extremely difficult to find investors if deflation was at 2%.

&gt; it would not change regular consumption at all

That's an unsubstantiated statement that goes against all macroeconomic theory. You're going to need to back up that statement with some seriously rigorous research if you want anyone with a basic education in economics to take it seriously.

&gt; only impact investments to become selective and investing in companies that have an actual chance of profitability

So you agree it would make investors extremely conservative in investments.

&gt; looking at the current landscape with hundreds of unprofitable unicorns  with next to no path to profitability, that is a much needed change

That being said, when there is a sizeable pullback, I expect us to re-test 12-12.5k for an SA flip, and I will be adding aggressively if/when we do. If we never see that level again, I'm okay with that too.

I've been hearing more and more about exchanges' supply of Bitcoin dropping drastically as institutions gobble them up and many whales remove their coins from exchanges.  Scarcity could become a real price driver if this continues.

gbhjewn,SlowMotionOcean,9,"The election ""event"" isn't over just because the media called it. Trump has closed Biden's lead in Arizona from 64000 to 20000, on track to win Arizona (one of the earliest called states. Going to be a big shocker when he wins it.) Huge protests in every state capitol are being planned and Trump supporters are on the road now.

Trump released a statement that he won the election and is not backing down. He wants the supreme court to throw out all ""illegal"" (his words) votes cast in Pennsylvania after 8PM on election day. That would restore his lead and possibly lead to a Trump victory. The upheaval following that after the media called Biden would be unprecedented.

We could even be headed into a Constitutional crisis.

There are really only 2 points of view on this, the first is that Bitcoin is going for a ride, the second is to trade purely on TA and disregard news. I lean towards the second one, although news (COVID lockdowns) can precipitate a state change, the technical levels that will be visited are predetermined by market trends on a much higher time scale. When the COVID lockdowns happened, Bitcoin again bottomed at 4000, it didn't tank to 1000 or 100. And it quickly recovered. The only thing we can infer from political happenings is that we are in for a period of high volatility, which should lead to increased near-term trading opportunities.

gbsr2my,jarederaj,13,"##Minor MoonMath Update

HTTPS://www.MoonMath.win


October was a big month and we have a lot to talk about now that November looks like it might be bigger. First, let’s get some small business out of the way.

The MoonMath table added a couple of years. You can see columns for 2018, 2019, and 2020 now. Shorter timeframes have been removed, so of all the previous short-term columns now you can only see the 90 day.

[The previous MoonMath update](https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/f8gz6d/major_moon_math_update_the_pre_halving/) made a few pessimistic predictions about shitcoin markets, and basically pegged where we’re at now. I did not predict the dramatic drop in price that we saw as a result of coronavirus earlier this year. In retrospect, I probably should’ve known that the macro economic cycles of the world are actually impacting bitcoins price now. However the price was like 9k or 10k when I wrote the last update, and that’s about where we were a month ago.

In the last MoonMath update I concluded that the end of this year will mark the beginning of the next parabolic move up, at least one order of magnitude. Overall, we’re probably ahead of schedule from what I thought would happen. Consequently, I’m skeptical that we will see a bull market through all of 2021. Alternatively, there’s a scenario where we continue to move up through all of 2021, 2022, and into 2023. In that scenario, I don’t really think that we see much of a bear market through the next having. We also see a proportionally muted bull run when it is compared to what we’ve seen in previous years (Consider that a move to 100k is, proportionally, only 25% of what we saw in the last bull run). Today, that’s a very low probability outcome, but all this makes sense if we really are seeing institutional onboarding.

If rumors prove out, we will see that all large fund managers will want some level of exposure to bitcoin in the near future. That’s hard to imagine today, but for the first time it’s actually possible. Smart money will not drive the boom and bust cycles that we’ve seen from Bitcoin enthusiasts who are native to this Market. When smart money talks, that bullshit walks.

Here’s a list of observations that you can stick in your pipe and smoke.

* Bitcoin scored a 33 month high to round out October
* Despite the new high, Bitcoin volatility is actually lower now than it has been historically
* Bitcoin continues to be an uncorrelated asset, and it is breaking away from trends in the S&amp;P 500 as well as VIX (Exposure to uncorrelated assets is ideal to fund managers)
* 70,000 bitcoins left wallets that had more than 100 bitcoins in October. However, wallets with less than 100 bitcoin more than made up for the needed demand",2020-11-10 13:39:35

From a perspective of good/bad (which I think is how most people in this thread are taking the question), it really depends on your motives. Deflationary currencies are generally bad for GDP and macroeconomic incentives, but good for the owner (you). The flip side is that you *do* live in a macroeconomy, and a deflationary currency is likely not going to be as useful as you want it to be (it'll serve well as your savings, but you're likely to feel conflicted about spending it).

This can be solved by considering bitcoin a commodity, like gold; not a currency, like dollars.",2020-11-10 12:52:38

gbwvhqz,alexiskef,10,"So, about 3 weeks ago, I posted a comment on an upcoming book by Matthew Leising, ""Out of the Ether: The Amazing Story of Ethereum and the $55 Million Heist that Almost Destroyed It All"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/jdb6hp/daily_general_discussion_october_18_2020/g97767w?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

The book was released on September 9, 2020. I just finished listening to the audio version. I wanted to share my initial thoughts with the ethfinance community.

I will start with what I liked. 

""Out of the Ether"" is a full (and I mean FULL) history of the Ethereum blockchain, from its conception to the present day. It is written in amazing detail. It covers, in great detail, the personal stories of a lot of the founders of Ethereum.

A great part of the book is focused on exploring Vitalik's life before Ethereum, and even before Bitcoin. It goes so much into the past, that it even details the personal histories of his parents, his early years as a child, and his school years. It follows him on his travels around Europe (especially in Spain), and then covers the Miami era also in great detail. From then on it covers the Zug house, the initial founders, the token sale, the EF, ConsenSys, Quorum, EEA, and much more..

What I did not like, is that the title of this book is rather misleading. Or, to put it more correctly, this book is more about the history of Ethereum and much less about the DAO hack. The author dedicates around 15% (and I might even be generous on this number) of the book on the DAO hack.

If I had to guess, I would say that the author, worked on the book (focusing on the full history of Ethereum) at the same time Camila Russo was preparing to publish her own book on the subject. She managed to publish 4-5 months earlier, so he had to change the title, or rather, had to try and give the book a slightly different point of view by trying to make it look like it was focused on the DAO. 

In my honest opinion, that ""different point of view"" did a disservice to his book. Having finished both his and Russo's books, I honestly believe that his is the most detailed one and the best-researched one. 

ps: His book, as well as Russo's, faces the same problem in the closing chapter. Ethereum's pace of change is relentless, with so many things happening at the same time. It is very difficult (for both writers) to draw a line on how much stuff they are willing to report on before they go to press. Leising tries to end the book with a brief mention of ETH 2.0, but IMO this is done in a hasty and mostly inaccurate way. Why spend a whole chapter talking about Burning Man (for example) and only a couple of pages on ETH 2.0?

Lastly (and this is not a spoiler, as the book hints on that from the first chapter), the author does indeed come up with a name for a person that might have been (partly or fully) responsible for the DAO hack.


Anyway, this is my very first attempt at reviewing a book, so forgive my bad English and syntax. I just wanted to give my honest opinion to all ETH-head here.",2020-11-11 15:32:03

gbudzmi,VictorCobra,7,"It looks like Bitcoin might be aiming for a blow-off towards 17.2k before a larger retrace. Even if this doesn't happen, I'm curious to see how much time is spent in this range. I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8CWCkJLe-Is-Bitcoin-About-To-Explore-A-New-Range/) chart shortly before the breakout above 13k. Dominance was [rejected](https://www.tradingview.com/x/vEj6wF6r/) at the long term downtrend. I'm curious to see if the market is closer to Phase 5 than I [originally suspected.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL2/OqRPhuXV-Mapping-The-Crypto-Market-Cycle-Part-8/) In that case, we might just avoid the next long period of sideways. Alts have begun moving up again, which would mean the market is close to entering Phase 4, or is already entering Phase 5.

As I assumed, if we are in Phase 3, Bitcoin would test a level between 13.8k and ATH, but not touch the ATH quite yet. This has already happened. Looking at [monthly closes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hrKU0d3f/), it's possible Bitcoin is actually further along in the cycle (monthly ATH if November ended today). In this chart ([zoomed out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NLgyKSIG/)), I've drawn a couple of speculative scenarios for Bitcoin. This shows $200k by 2025, but the yellow scenario takes longer to get to $100k. I believe Bitcoin may only retrace 50-60% in the next major bearish cycle, due to maturity and liquidity. This is shown in both scenarios.

The obvious answer would be one of the FAANGM stocks as they have roughly $500 billion in cash on hand. The pick among those would be Microsoft since they seem to have the most ties to Ethereum these days. As to when, you would have to imagine it’s once ETH has officially scaled and has legit enterprise use cases, which I would imagine is a couple years out, so my guess would be 2022. But crazy to think if a CEO had the balls/foresight to do it now, they could fund an entire blockchain division for years to come with staking rewards haha.

gbyvm31,jessquit,10,"I've never met Roger, but here's what I've seen of him during my years hanging around Bitcoin.

Roger has always been extremely consistent in his messaging: the power of Bitcoin is its use case as cash - a way for people to transact person to person with no financial middlemen, without the possibility of financial censorship, by using a token that is simultaneously a hard asset and a currency for casual transactions.  In short, if you have to put it in a bank to use it - even if you call the bank a ""hub"" and your account a ""channel"" - it's no longer disruptive or empowering. And especially, if you have to exit crypto for fiat in order to purchase something, then it's disrupted *nothing.*

Roger's message, you will realize, is also Satoshi's message.

Roger, like Satoshi, understands that to truly be disruptive, cryptocurrency has to be a means of exchange in its *native, bare-metal form.* And he's been on message for about a decade now.

Roger has also demonstrated his ethos here and elsewhere by sponsoring this uncensored Bitcoin forum when all other platforms became curated / censored by special interests. Since the creation of rbtc I've seen any number of toxic trolls post all manner of hateful and dishonest crap targeting Roger, and he allows it to stay up because he walks his talk.

Roger is a human being and has his flaws and bad moments like all of us. Like most of us he can get hot tempered or occasionally say something inadvisable.  But overwhelmingly he has been a principled spokesperson for Bitcoin as Cash since long before the block size debate was even a thing.

I disagree with Roger sometimes regarding his politics, which I often find naive - but these are unimportant quibbles in the grand scheme. The bigger picture is that Roger never silences disagreement with him. And for that he has earned a tremendous amount of respect from people who interact with him over time.

There's an old adage that we often repeat around here: ""you know you're over the target when you start picking up flak."" Roger has been picking up flak for the better part of ten years now. I'm honestly amazed he sticks with it sometimes.

Because humans only follow alphas or the herd, once you weaken the alpha, you weaken the following and weaken the ecosystem.

Think about your life and about the lives of people around you. Why are the bad (and charismatic) guys often so popular in school? Why do the bad guys always ""get the girl""?

Because an evolutionary instinct tells other people (especially girls) that a strong leader, even one that is exploiting them is a good thing. Because in the past, having a strong leader meant survival and having no leader / wandering leaderless without purpose meant certain death.",2020-11-12 05:44:56

gby9a01,zk_snacks,7,"Bitcoin is older and has more boom/bust cycles under its belt than Ethereum, so it’s not unreasonable to look at what BTC did last time as a very rough guide on what’s possible for ETH in the coming moon phase. 

BTC’s previous high was about $1k, and its last one was $20k. That’s 20x from one peak to the next. 

For ETH, the last high was $1.4k, so if the last BTC cycle is similar to ETH’s next one, that means that the price could go up to $28k. 

Personally I think that $28k sounds a little high, but half that at $14k is a realistic possibility in the next ETH cycle. 

That would still only be 1/10th of the last ETH cycle gains too.

* If selling around 10-20% of your portfolio of crypto-assets would give you life-altering money, please consider it seriously
* Life is a marathon of ups &amp; downs, not a sprint. Always think about downsides and protect yourself ... for the future you''s sake
* If you've been in crypto for &gt;12 months and still have debt, you're being reckless. Pay it off.
* It is boring, but buying a property should give you peace of mind for life... i.e. it is priceless security. If you can, do it. Be ultra-conservative about any borrowing
* Another 'boring' idea is to have \~1 year of overheads in the bank... especially if you are a trader or running a startup
* Securing yourself allows you to continue to take risks in life and pursue things that truly excite you. You will be liberated to consider possibilities &amp; options that others can't
* If you are a trader, trading from a position of strength will make you better
* Bitcoin may go to $50k, but that doesn't matter - you will never regret setting yourself up for life
* Enjoy yourself, but try to avoid large displays of wealth. No reason to paint a target on your back or attract the wrong kinds of people
* Avoid believing that your wealth makes you extremely smart. It doesn't. Stay grounded, remember where you started and treat everyone as equals
* If investing outside of crypto for the first time, be extremely cautious and conservative until you build up knowledge &amp; experience
* Invest in yourself (your health, knowledge, etc.) Your health is your most valuable asset
* Remember to give to those less fortunate than you

&gt; What do you think is the biggest problem with Bitcoin?  Is it scaling? Is it fraud? Is it centralization of mining? It's that we don't have enough anonymity! We don't have enough privacy and we better fix that before this gets too popular.  Adoption of a platform with insufficient privacy is extremely dangerous.  If you're the only one doing anonymous transactions you're not anonymous.  What we need is ubiquity of privacy. This should not be an option I check in my samurai wallet that says use TOR.  It should be default.   On every wallet on every time.  There should be no transaction that is not confidential.  Here is the interesting thing, if you ask the banks if whether they want anonymous transactions, they absolutely do.  Their distributed ledger technology is built with anonymity.  They are using range proofs and zero knowledge solutions and mixers and confidential transactions.  They are trying to build confidential and anonymous systems for settlement.  Why?  Because they can't trust the mofo across from them that run the competitive bank.  Because if they know what's happening on the network, they will front run every transaction, they will pump and dump every asset.  Why? That's what they do every single day.  And of course since they cant' trust each other they understand the need for privacy.  They will build their private blockchains.  They will build their clearing and settlement networks and they will make absolutely sure they have confidentiality, privacy, anonymity, encryption, deniability.  They will achieve their secrecy, the question is will we get ours.  Will we assert our human right of privacy?

I think the BCH community handled this relatively well, apart from the insults thrown around in this sub.

The dismissal of Bitcoin ABC was reluctant but in the end decisive, similar to how CSW got ejected - with the difference that Amaury does not seem to have a billionaire friend that can prop up his coin (but we will see on Sunday).

If anything, the open discussion culture has shown that BCH was willing and able to defeat a bad actor twice, while at the same time we seem to be open and not overly resentful.

gc6at0f,theymos,7,"Bullish factors:

* The Paypal news attracts a lot of attention, and BTC definitely has momentum right now.
* I see a low-interest-rate environment for many years to come, which will push money into risky assets like BTC. A big chunk of BTC's current value is just as a ""generic risk asset"", which allows it to absorb the large amounts of risk capital that's floating around out there. I think we'll see the same asset price inflation we've seen over the past decade, and maybe even to a greater extent -- this is good for BTC.
* Due to massive US deficits combined with Fed QE, we might finally see some moderate USD inflation (~3%), which I think would be BTC-positive due to BTC's ""digital gold"" characteristic. (Over the next 5 years, I see ""mild stagflation"" as the most likely macroeconomic situation.)
* I'm not sure that we're entering a particularly turbulent geopolitical environment, but I don't think that we're entering a particularly *calm* one, either. A moderate amount (but not *too* much) chaos is probably BTC-positive due to its extra-governmental, independent characteristic.

Bearish factors:

* I doubt that the Paypal news will end up being as good as it seems, since Paypal is so highly-regulated. Right now the BTC isn't even withdrawable, so it's just a speculation tool like Robinhood, not *real* BTC support. In the future I could easily see their custody provider Paxos being hacked, or BTC trade being seriously restricted (eg. significant ""taint analysis""), etc.
* I think that the Biden administration will be very anti-Bitcoin, and there's a lot they can do just via executive control over the various agencies to make holding/using BTC incredibly difficult, if they want.
* IMO long-term mean-reversion is always a very powerful force, and it takes a lot to overcome it.

Over the next couple months, I could see BTC exceeding $20k due to momentum, but I don't really believe that such prices will last long-term. I think that it'll eventually settle in $10k-$14k, after a lot of the usual volatility. Over the next few years, I think that economic conditions are overall favorable for BTC (though with much risk), and I could see $20k being *stably* reached in that time. I would not buy at $16k, but if I did and the price crashes to $10k, I probably wouldn't sell at that point. IMO any point below $12k has good long-term potential.

BTC is incredibly risky and volatile, of course. I would not be completely shocked to see either $30k or $5k. Long-term holders should make sure that their BTC holdings haven't gotten away from them.

gcdxiy7,bitusher,62,"The country of China does not control that hashrate

~50% of the hashrate takes place in Chinese pools which come from some ASIC miners outside of china 

Your question relates to a 51% attack. In order to maintain the 51% attack they need to devote those resources continuously which is extremely costly.

1) Bitcoins game theory is such that such an attack is very expensive to perform and its more profitable to secure Bitcoin than attack it 

2) A 51% attack cannot steal your bitcoins sitting in a wallet , but either create a temporary DDOS (block new transactions confirming or block or 2 of double spends before they are caught 

3)Other PoW altcoins have been 51% attacked before and strangely enough the market barely reacted. A short doesn't guarantee a profit in such a scenario

4)Freshly mined Bitcoins are not spendable for 100 blocks which means a race condition would occur with a lot of new hashpower coming online.

5) The attacker should have 60-70% of total global hashrate to be on the safe side to avoid a reorg on their chain. Having 51% of the global hashrate does not mean you can find 51% of the blocks within a given day.

------------------

The chinese government seizing all local ASIC farms is unlikely to occur for these reasons 

This is unlikely to occur for these reasons

1) local government officials greatly benefit from bitcoin mining

2) If this attack did occur the government would need to spend more more to attack Bitcoin than they would get from the attack

3) Such an attack would be seen as totalitarian by many people and their would be severe degree of consequences

gce77fb,schwagnificent,8,"To say that a hardware wallet has never been hacked and no one has ever lost money with a hardware wallet is dishonest.

When an exchange gets hacked, it is big news because tens of thousands are exposed at once.  

Every time someone misplaces their seedphrase, or someone steals it or hacks into where they have it stored and accesses it, people have lost money.

But in the latter case, no one hears about it except in rare circumstances.  It’s not newsworthy.  

Now most exchanges, I would not trust any significant amount of money with them.  Coinbase is a reputable business that relies on maintaining security to keep its reputation, and I’m sure there are others who are equally reputable.  

The likelihood of your money disappearing from coinbase is extremely low.  Obviously can never be zero.  The likelihood of the average person not properly securing their own passphrase is also not zero.  There are plenty of individual examples of “lost bitcoin”, just like there are examples of exchange hacks where people lost money.  

IF you are 100% confident in your own ability to securely store your passphrase so that you can always access it and no one else could ever access it, then that’s great.  A hardware wallet is probably the best option for you.

For Greyscale, BTC is their business. For MicroStrategy, BTC is their money.

Greyscale has made a janky Bitcoin ETF-like investment by being a public company with the sole purpose of holding BTC. This allows their stock price to track Bitcoin's price without having to deal with the legal required for a true ETF.

MicroStrategy is holding BTC because they are a company with large cash reserves and their CEO was tired of watching their reserves melt away at 7% per year. He did an evaluation of every possible investment and concluded that BTC was the most liquid asset with the most potential for growth and least likely to suffer long term devaluation. 

If the ecosystem develops to a point where large holders of BTC can earn interest from lending, or locking up funds, then these firms may chose to do this and become neo-banks in the Bitcoin economy.

gcj1z1c,bitusher,48,"**Statistically Lump Sum investing will outperform DCA investing.**

DCA is usually the best advice for those that don't have the capital upfront.

For investing in any assets = realty, stocks, bitcoin, or gold the best advice is to make a solid plan after doing your research up front, diversify with uncoorelated asset classes that are properly hedged and invest all up front. This is especially true with Bitcoin because no one can predict the price and most appreciation happens on a few days each year that are unexpected so the quicker you own BTC , the quicker you get exposure to this appreciation.

This being said you should not be investing at all in Bitcoin unless you have paid off all your high interest debt and have at least 3-6 months of fiat in an emergency fund to cover living expenses.

Lump sum investing outperformed DCA investing 68% of the time according to a Vanguard study -

https://www.fool.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx

2 reasons -

1) stocks (I suggest an index fund like SPDR ) and BTC have an inherent upwards bias so the sooner you invest the quicker you can accumulate appreciation

2) Inflation drag - fiat uninvested will be slowly losing value due to inflation

------------------

This is especially true at what many consider the start of a bull market. If this was right after a bubble popped like in late 2017 than DCA would be prudent. 

Now let me suggest why you shouldn't lump sum with the full 1 BTC in a single purchase. Education is really important and perhaps you should make a smaller purchase first and learn more before going all in.",2020-11-17 04:56:02

gcp2jgz,cryptOwOcurrency,41,"The date is December 3rd, 2020. Bitcoin has not only hit its all time high in the 19,000's, but breezed past it easily. News outlets all over the country have picked up on the ""big story"" of Bitcoin hitting ATH again.

""But what's this?"" that one news anchor who is the 'money guy' asks, ""It looks like it's not just Bitcoin this time.""

Camera cuts back to the main news desk.

""What do you mean?"" says the main news anchor, looking skeptical.

""Ether has hit its all time high, too!""

""Ether? You mean that thing that did cryptokitties years ago?""

""It's not just cryptokitties, now. Ernst &amp; Young, Microsoft, Amazon, all of the huge tech players are getting in on this one. This is the play of the lifetime. Tesla, Uber, even $MU can't touch this one!""

Everyone gasps when he says that it's even better than $MU. Then the 'money guy' anchor walks up to the screen.

""They're creating a whole new financial system! This shit is going to the MOON! Here's &lt;news network&gt;'s Coinbase referral code, get $5 for free!""

(referral link shows on the screen)

""And if you have any Bitcoin already, you don't even need to open an exchange account. Just wrap them using REN and Uniswap them for Ether, all using the new permissionless Ethereum DeFi services!""

""Wow, it sounds like I need to get me some of this Ether,"" says the other anchor from the main news desk.

""Get it before it's gone!"" says 'money guy'. ""It already went up another 10% to 2,600 while we were having this conversation!""

(the news anchor at the main desk pulls out her laptop)

""I'm putting my life savings into it right now!"" she says. ""And my mom's life savings, too!""

The live price display behind 'money guy' keeps incrementing and incrementing on-air. Before long it's like watching the presidential election, televised across all networks, except that the price is going up way way faster than the slow-ass vote count.

We had our pullback, but not down to the point where it resolved the long pole.  It did get down ""close enough"" a couple of times and it bounced up.

That said, based on the past seven years of activity, the ""normal"" formation is to see it ""pop up--then fiddle and diddle for a few days to a week, before it starts up again.  Don't be mislead by the high numbers.

I expect we are in that kind of atmosphere now where it will not simply keep skyrocketing without pulling back and resolving for a couple of days.

Just to bum everyone out...we do not get to another official break out until we exceed $18,500.  But we don't break down unless it goes under $15,800.  So, aside from the play on numbers...what we see in between there is ""noise.""

And to make everyone comfortable, the current trend line is down at $10,700.

gd0k7ka,PolitelyHostile,60,"Markets run on predictions. Even a stock price is based on the prediction of the companies future earnings. 

Inflation is targeted at 2% because that balances things like unemployment and investment for reasons that I don't understand well enough to explain.

If money is deflationary (basically anything non-fiat will have deflationary periods) then that encourages people to hoard their money. So instead of putting money in the bank(which drives the economy because they lend some of that money to someone new), people actually earn value by holding their money (ie stuff gets cheaper, so why spend money on it today? wait for prices to decline) so that discourages the production of new goods and services

Another way to explain deflationary money is that as the economy grows, the money supply needs to grow so the new goods and services have a medium of exchange to be traded with. If money supply stays the same then the same amount of money is being used to trade more goods/services so now prices go down. Which as I said, discourages production and economic growth. People loose jobs. 

There's just so much 'behind the scenes' math that goes into keeping the economy stable. I probably gave a crappy answer but its very complicated yet people who read a couple memes think bitcoin is flawless cause something something government. 

Also foreign countries could hoard and dump gold to mess up the value of the dollar. Countries wouldn't have the same control over their dollar value. For instance in Canada, we actually prefer our dollar to be worth a bit less than the USD because it increases our exports and helps our economy. It forces companies in Canada to also buy canadian products because of cost savings.",2020-11-21 13:12:13

gcy933f,Shortupdate,37,"I posted these ideas as a reply to another comment further down, but thought it deserved its own comment thread.

The [ByteTree terminal](https://terminal.bytetree.com/bitcoin) tracks miner first spends. This can very roughly serve as an on-chain proxy for estimating sales by miners. We know the first time a miner moves coins. They may not necessarily be selling them the first time they move them, but the proportion of sales to other reasons to move coins will likely remain roughly constant over time, so it is at least a way to get in the ballpark.

On that basis, it appears that the miners have been [strongly selling](https://i.imgur.com/gMmPcSM.jpg) into this market.

[Glassnode](https://studio.glassnode.com/) tracks a lot of different metrics, and one they track is exchange inventory. The [balance on exchanges just keeps going lower.](https://twitter.com/ColeGarnerBTC/status/1328879882978406402?s=20)

The total number of BTC on exchanges hasn't been this low since May of 2018. The peak was in late February of this year (right before the big crash), when there were approximately ~2,973,000 BTC on exchanges. We are down to 2,374,000 BTC on exchanges now. That's a 20% reduction in exchange balance *and volume has increased over that same period of time*.

Miners are selling off faster than coins are being produced and exchanges are selling coins that are moving off-market.

This is exactly what supply shock looks like.",2020-11-21 01:00:17

Either way its an investment that is very wise because it acts as a hedge as an uncorrelated asset class in a diversified portfolio(stocks/land/fiat)

Or you can use Bitcoin because its a useful money. Here is what I find useful about Bitcoin -

1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com

2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha

3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools 

4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value

5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure

6) **Sovereignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking 

7) **Micro transactions** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet

8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth

9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet

10)	**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily

Here's what I reccomend you should do:

Go to college and obtain a Biochemistry degree. It'll take you about 4 years to do so. Assuming you live in the United States, you can obtain a loan quite easily. Next you should do a masters in the area of stem cells and cloning techniques. I would recommend that you do well during your undergrad to be able to attend a good college for your masters. Do research. Lots of it. Especially in the field of cloning. Obtain your Phd. You'll be about 8 years in at this point. Now this part is a bit illegal depending on the jurisdiction you're in, but here's what you're going to do:

By this point in your career you will have learned that most cells can be transformed into other types by changing the soluble protein composition in their cytoplasm. For example, skin cells can be transformed into neurons, stem cells or embryonic sells. That is what you will do, you will take your own skin cell and transform it to a embryonic cell. Allow the cell to divide onto the morula stage and up to the blastocyst stage. You will then pay for a surrogate mother with the money you earned during research. Implant the blastocyst into her. Some of the cells will have differentiated into the trophoblast and the blastocyst will implant itself onto the endometrium. After 9 months the child will be born. This child is your clone.

They wish to provide an alternative to cash, one which is more traceable for tax and law enforcement, and one that reduces waste (source: [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/Understanding%20CBDCs%20Final%20-%20disc.pdf#What-is-a-CBDC](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/Understanding%20CBDCs%20Final%20-%20disc.pdf#What-is-a-CBDC) Page 15).

Bitcoin aims to create a completely impartial monetary system that cannot influenced by local politics (Country wide politics is considered local in this case). Bitcoin is not affected in the slightest by CBDC other than by the fact that CBDC's will be marketed as the official and safer alternative when it is not even the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The price of bitcoin is rising due to scarcity and demand

Yes and no. Scarcity is fixed, demand is growing, so value goes up due to demand going up, but there are other factors to consider when comparing to FIAT:

When you own $1, you own (example numbers) 1% of your countries economical wealth. But when inflation occurs, your country is producing the same amount of goods and services, but there are more dollars to represent that economy, so if $1 = 1% of economy (which would make the economy worth $100), and the US prints $50 more dollars, your $1 is now worth 2/3rds of what it was worth before. Bitcoins are becoming worth more dollars, because dollars are becoming less valuable.

Fiat became popular because for those who want to be seen as patriots, their money usage represents their economy and a good economy produces a powerful currency. Inflation is not part of that contract and usually serves to make a poor economy look better for short term benefits.

Bitcoin is popular because its value is not inflatable and so its value is based on its own merits: How well does it fit the needs of the global population compared to other alternatives (AKA What is its demand).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the people that get rich, won't be selling. So you are rich in bitcoin.

When you invest in the housing market, you might become rich, but you'll be rich in houses. I say this not to be facetious, but to help you start a thought process as to why Bitcoiners would keep their money in Bitcoin and not cash out.

I'll add, that someone who is poor, that suddenly gets lucky and inherits a house might sell that house, take some money out, and re-invest any excess in another house. For Bitcoiners in the same position, they might just cash out a healthy amount of their bitcoins in order to improve their lifestyle, but leave any excess in Bitcoin to grow further.",2020-11-23 00:33:04

&gt; This cycle is NOT the same, this bullrun is not FOMO...there will be no 80% correction
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone is waiting for the FOMO. It’s not going to be like 2016. The big boys have come to play. They don’t FOMO. They dominate. The positions they take will be colonial. They have long time horizons and they are not buying bitcoin with paychecks. This bull run will cause suicides.
&gt; 
&gt; When dumbass traders realize what they had in their hands that they sold for a measly 2-3x. Working class wholecoins will start to be few and far between. Because buying a whole coin will require you to sell your house. This next 4 years is not just “the next cycle” it’s the next phase. 
&gt; 
&gt; Where governments will have to respond. Where criminals are going to step up their game. Where publicly declaring that you have a whole bitcoin could be dangerous to you and you’re family. This bull run is not going to be a retail FOMO extravaganza. 
&gt; 
&gt; This bull run is the beginning of the fall of fiat. This bull run will cement Satoshi’s white paper as one of the most important documents in human history.
&gt; 
&gt; There will be no 80% correction. There will be no fall from $300,000 to 50k. Grayscale is not a weak hand. MicroStrategy is not a weak hand. Fidelity is not a weak hand. 
&gt; 
&gt; The institutions that are buying bitcoin couldn’t give a shit about “when Lambo”. They get lambos for free. They control governments. People expect that hyperbitcoinization will occur with government adoption. The companies that are and will buy in the next year, are the ones that have governments in their pockets. 
&gt; 
&gt; They will be no 80% correction.

&gt; 
&gt; Edit: Adding these good points by u/gunshotaftermath
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.	Most of the new buyers are institutional, including major funds, as well as of course the big players we've been hearing about in the past three months (microstrategy, greyscale at $10 billion, etc), and many of the new funds are looking at 5+ year plays
&gt; &gt; 2.	Fiat is a lot more uncertain right now, with both US and Canada printing their way out of this recession. A trillion doars printed in a month is not normal. 
&gt; &gt; 2.	Google searches for Bitcoin is only at 10% of what it was in 2017, suggesting most retail buyers this time around are more experienced and less skittish. 
&gt; &gt; 2.	Major institutions have been emerging in the past few months. PayPal would be the largest international bank by user count, Coinbase has a Bitcoin debit/Visa card coming to the US, Square, and now two Crypto banks have emerged in Wyoming.

gd8su0j,ThomasZander,27,"Thank you for this video.

Some corrections:

*    The portraying of the 15th as having ""those supporting the Bitcoin Cash Node"" is something I reject, and most industry players with me. There was simple the people that work in Bitcoin Cash which rallied against the IFP. Everyone together to stand strong. Not behind BCHN, but behind the beliefs that make up BCH, which is much larger than one node implementation.

*    The BCH/BSV split did not include a hashwar. One side said they wanted to do so, but at the very first block after the scheduled upgrade both became incompatible with each other. Any hash thrown at it was irrelevant for the chain, no reorgs were possible within 10 blocks.

*    The point you make where you write:

&gt;    It is in your hands, you have been entrusted as the steward of the project []

This is a misunderstanding of a decentralized coin. There are no stewards, there are only selfish actors working in their best interest. There is no centralized control, as [we have clearly seen](https://read.cash/@TomZ/why-did-abc-lose-53bb307f) that anyone that may be perceived to be the central control can lose it very quickly as soon as they turn against their people. The people are ultimately in control, not some stewards.

If you will, the split was not between to nodes, it was between one team and their belief they were leaders. And on the other side were the people that actually make the coin that did not recognize that leadership.

So when you say later in the video that BCHN is the new leadership, you have misunderstood and have not read the BCHN statements as they are expressly distancing themselves from being ""leadership"".

The closing message of people focusing on adoption: loud and clear, and fully agreed.

gdc5eqh,apooptosis,20,"""Bitcoin climbed back above $18,000 last week to flirt with record levels, a spectacular rally driven by a new group of buyers seeking the opportunity for big profits.

The digital currency traded as high as $18,965 on Friday, according to CoinDesk, about 4% below its all-time high of $19,783 set in December 2017. It has surged more than 50% in the past month alone.

The rally has attracted a wide cast of characters, from the Wall Street billionaires Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller to momentum investors who aim to ride winning assets higher and losing markets lower.

Their participation, in turn, has fueled more buying, which mirrors a similar dynamic playing out in stocks such as Tesla Inc., which investors keep pushing higher with little regard for fundamentals. As in 2017, when bitcoin became a cultural phenomenon, much of the hype has traveled by word-of-mouth.

Lately, bitcoin has even been a winning topic on sports radio. Gregg Giannotti, co-host of the “Boomer &amp; Gio” morning sports-talk radio show on WFAN in New York, has been talking up the cryptocurrency on the air after investing $10,000 earlier this month.

There was a strong response to the bitcoin segments, Mr. Giannotti said. “As soon as I brought it up on the air, it started,” he said, adding that old friends wrote to him, sales people wanted to talk about bitcoin and listeners jammed his Twitter feed. “It struck a nerve,” he said.

Bitcoin, a form of money that exists only digitally, started in January 2009 during the depths of the financial crisis and was positioned as an alternative to government-backed money. It operates across a network of linked but independent computers that can’t be controlled by any one party, such as a central bank.

It was designed to have a fixed supply that would make it resistant to inflation. With central banks pledging this year to push up inflation, more investors have been willing to test bitcoin as a hedge. Its potential, however, has been difficult to gauge because inflation hasn’t reached the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% in years.

Aiding this interest has been the increasing number of mainstream platforms that facilitate bitcoin trading. The combination of accessible platforms and bitcoin’s potential as an inflation hedge is what is primarily driving the cryptocurrency this year, said Dan Morehead, chief executive of Pantera Capital, a venture fund that has been investing in the sector since 2013.

“Paper money is being debased, and bitcoin is not,” he said.

The last time bitcoin attracted such attention—in the fourth quarter of 2017, when it nearly quadrupled to approach $20,000—the industry wasn’t prepared. There were few outlets for trading beyond startup exchanges, and bitcoin had little practical value. The momentum washed out, new investors disappeared, venture capital dried up and the industry went through a wave of retrenchment and layoffs.

Much of that has changed, bulls argue. For one thing, the regulatory landscape is much clearer than it was in 2017. State and federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have laid out rules for the treatment of cryptocurrencies. That has led companies such as CME Group Inc., CME 0.93% Intercontinental Exchange Inc. ICE 0.16% and Fidelity Investments Inc. to offer services for buying and selling crypto assets.

There are also retail-oriented platforms catering to interest in crypto trading. Volume has surged at Square Inc.’s SQ 2.25% Cash App, which has allowed customers to buy and sell bitcoin since 2018. In the third quarter, customers bought $1.6 billion of bitcoin, up from $555 million the year before.

In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL 0.93% unveiled a service that allows its users to buy and sell bitcoin directly in their accounts. It became available to all U.S. users on Nov. 12 and will expand to Venmo and some international markets next year.

Grayscale Investments, a private fund manager that sells 10 over-the-counter trust funds focused on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has benefited from the new interest. The firm reported Tuesdaythat its assets under management had risen to more than $10 billion from $5.9 billion at the end of September.

Despite the recent growth, the bitcoin market is still tiny compared with other assets, which contributes to its volatility. Pantera estimated that trading volumes on PayPal and on Square’s Cash App alone would exceed the amount of new bitcoin being created daily.

With hedge funds and other professionals also buying, supply will become even more constrained, according to Pantera Capital’s Mr. Morehead. “The only way supply and demand equilibrates is at a higher price,” he said.

That dynamic is part of what attracted Mr. Druckenmiller. He sees bitcoin as similar to gold, he told CNBC in an interview earlier this month, but because of bitcoin’s smaller size and volatility, he believes it could outperform the precious metal. Mr. Jones told the network in May that he put about 1% to 2% of his assets in bitcoin, calling it a “great speculation” that he believes will emerge as a new asset class.

What do you see as the future for bitcoin? Join the conversation below.

Neither Mr. Druckenmiller nor Mr. Jones responded to requests for comment.

Still, bitcoin’s history shows exactly how volatile and risky it can be for investors. Its price fell as low as $3,867 on March 13, when global markets cratered, a drop of more than 60% from the beginning of the year. Bitcoin lost about 50% of its value in January 2018 after the spectacular 2017 run, eventually sinking to as low as $3,122 by December 2018.

Those risks haven’t deterred investors such as Wayne Sharp, a retired investment adviser in Columbus, Ohio, who bought her first bitcoin in September, investing $10,000. She said she was swayed by arguments about bitcoin’s value as an inflation hedge, as well as the respectability conferred by investors including Mr. Jones.

She acknowledged the purchase was speculative but said she is tired of watching safer, “value” investments fall behind momentum trades. She put a small amount of her wealth into the cryptocurrency and said she might buy more down the road.

“I figure what the heck, just go for it,” she said.

gdc33d1,_Pohaku_,19,"When it boils down to it, fees aside, trading is a zero-sum game; if you profit by X amount, then someone else loses that amount. And vice versa.

As there is no predicting whether the price will rise or fall over the next hour, then in theory if you do a lot of trades (by number, not value) then you should roughly break even (fees aside).

The factors that should change this are:

a) If you make logical decisions about when to buy/sell based on what the current direction of price looks like, you should profit a little;

b) The fact that in the long term, bitcoin has been rising for years should mean that you are more pre-disposed to profit than loss;

c) Luck.

I have attempted to trade/profit a few times, yet despite the objective truth of (b) and my best efforts to implement (a), I get fucked in the arse by (c) every time.  I've tried to trade out of my bitcoins maybe five or six times ever, when I saw the graph starting to drop off horribly. Every single one of them resulted in a near-instant (within minutes) recovery of price and I bought back at a net loss.

The latest was yesterday. From £14300 it took a dive. I watched it go sub-£14k, then to £13,800, then £13,600 in a very short time. I sold at £13,250, intending to buy back more coins as soon as the drop seemed to level off.  The bottom was £13,223, maybe 60 seconds later.

Liquidity seems to be the problem from what I hear. Honeyswap too. A clone that is cheaper because of using the xDai network but still not touching Uniswap. Look even more removed just a DEX - we can look to Bitcoin still being #1 all these years. Or how Ethereum is the #1 smart contract platform. Even Litecoin sticking strong as a top 10 ALT even after Charlie Lee sold everything 3 years ago. Being first has staying power. 

Trading wise: I'm not particularly familiar with what makes something 'Micro Cap' but being ranked #35 and being still under $1 Billion is fairly small. BNB at #10 has a market cap of $4.8 Billion (oof, what a regret I have not buying that...) meaning UNI can 5x and still be a reasonable valuation. BTW - Somewhat ironically circling back to my point above... BNB was the I believe the first ""trading discount"" coin and its still sitting in the top 10 after 2 years. In terms of total 50/50 moonshots it feels like a less risky pick. The promised V3 and fee change proposal presents a pump and dump scenario that I'm hoping to take advantage of. 

And before I get told I'm just shilling a airdrop. I will say I did buy some extra and as such have my own skin into the game on this. And outside of ETH and shitty alt coin dust this is the only other crypto I own of any meaningful position. This includes not owning actual BTC. I would never suggest a buy of something I haven't bought myself.",2020-11-26 02:39:44
gdp8l10,DanConway650,15,"Crypto breaks your heart every time. Until it doesn't. Let me state a few unoriginal thoughts, that I didn't come up with, but resonate with me.

1. Holding when the long term indicators are green and the short term price action is ripping your face off is how we ""earn"" the eventual payday. That's how we all ""get lucky"" in the eys of friends and famiily when we reach multiples of the previous ATH. 

2. Ethereum keeps progressing on all fronts. It isn't perfect, but every day it gets stronger. Just surviving each day makes it stronger, in fact. Same for Bitcoin. But the progress on Ethereum is astounding to me and couldn't be more bullish. I don't even have to understand it all. Vitalik mainly baffles me. But I know enough to see that smart people are hacking away, arguing with themselves sometimes. Even when I'm sleeping, the protocol and the greater Ethereum community is moving forward, getting better. Sometimes one step forward, two steps back, but the arc is upward and to the right. 

3. We saw a lot of dips in 2017. Sometimes it felt like we'd never go to the moon (boo hoo), but we did. I just can't believe we won't pass our ATH again in the months and years ahead. These crypto boom/bust cycles are just too strong and it's going to pop like dynamite before too long. I think the fuse has been set and this bull run is real and we will see an explosion upwards in the months ahead. 

4. My next sell point is $2600. I'll sell a good chunk then because at that amount it will change my life (again). I believe this is the smart play. If you are going to be in this risky space, you might as well play for the big reward. Selling on short term action in the meantime is just insane, unlesss... you need the money. But taking profits for profits sake before the big win just isn't much fun to me. I'm sane with my other investments, but with crypto I enjoy being a madman. That means I think we will 10x from here. I don't want a 40% gain, I don't want to double my money. I want lifechanging money because I was among the first to see the potential of this thing. 

5. It's not easy being a retail investor. We aren't the mathletes (at least I'm not), we aren't the smug skeptics, we aren't the value-investing Buffet freaks. We are the dreamers and the ones with the ""insane risk tolerance"" who dream of making it big. These bull markets are for us, because we fund this thing. Stick with it until you get your reward, unless of course you ever start to doubt the fundamental value proposition.

It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy /r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.

&gt; Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship which led to thousands of redditors being banned from the /r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc

&gt; Why do some groups attempt to discredit /r/btc?

&gt; This subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, **truth** is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship.

The banned users became naturally Bitcoin Cash fans, so Bitcoin Cash is the dominant topic in this subreddit.

gdsjegs,MobTwo,3,"There is no way that a logical person/business prefers to pay higher fees for a slow unreliable service when there is a cheaper better faster alternative Bitcoin Cash. Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 300 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 300 billion will give you more than 60x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the long run.",2020-11-28 04:11:12

gds8nav,Justiful,2,"Without a wall of text I will just say the average ""investor"" in BITCOIN is playing the most high risk strategy possible buy high, sell low (Yes that is the right order). It isn't even fair to call that investing. They are Gamblers. They just don't realize it. The house is the institutional investors skimming off joe average blokes inexperience.

As for investing in bitcoin. My 20% example is ""low risk"" compared to buying high and selling low. But if it was an institutional investment it would be considered HIGH RISK. They would want say 7.5% guaranteed return per year with built in risk mitigation. Something like 85% guarantee on their investment ensuring they don't lose greater than 15% of their funds in a given cycle. Or Options to increase investment or reduce investment by some percent of the total value at some predefined percent of total investment price. 

Institutional investments have lower returns because they have some variation of risk mitigation/reward. Be it bonds/funds/stocks. They all have built in systems to reduce risk. You need a license to sell stocks for instance. That is a form of institutional risk management. One that costs individuals money to use (broker fees). Bitcoin is the wildwest. Anyone can sell bitcoins. There are no institutional safeguards built into the system to prevent fraud or abuse. Everyone is their own broker/bank/financial adviser/fund manager/security guard. Removing the safeguards increases profit potential while increasing risk.",2020-11-28 02:44:53

gdxore0,Tricky_Troll,25,"#Daily hopium dose:

Ethereum usually charges when Bitcoin goes sideways but goes down relative to BTC when Bitcoin goes up or down sharply. Bitcoin is looking like it may not want to pull back sharply back to $14K and the 20 week moving average. I say this because when bitcoin does pull back in a bull run, it usually does it quite quickly, as new buyers freak out and dump their recently acquired Bitcoin. However, while many saw this pull back coming, it hasn't been very big. Possibly because most holders right now are looking longer term and don't want to sell their Bitcoin right before we break ATH. Also, has anyone else noticed a sudden disappearance of the phenomena which was the mega pumps/dumps in BTC price ever since BitMex got shut down? Hmm, funny that 🤔. So this time around, there are less leverage longs to get liquidated causing a flash crash and no suspicious exchange owners looking to intentionally liquidate these longs.

Based on the above, it wouldn't surprise me to see Bitcoin range sideways for a few weeks or months until the upwards momentum builds up again. In the mean time, Ethereum 2.0 goes live without a hitch and people get impatient with Bitcoin and look elsewhere to make gains. --&gt; ETH 👀

Put only 20% down on the house. Interest rates are at historic lows and you'll make more in the markets.

Don't buy additional real estate. At a valuation of 200k, your current apartment represents roughly 10-15% of your portfolio, which is sufficient exposure to one undiversified asset class. Test the landlording waters to see how it goes before investing more.

Keep your current 75k cash as your emergency fund. Its about 2 years in expenses and is already conservative, no need to increase it.

75k more into bitcoin to get to 100k if you must, but your rational is weak for investing in it. ""Truly believing"" in something doesn't make it a good investment, it makes you ideologically possessed.

Invest 1.35m into the market via ETFs asap, not DCA. Its shown to produce better outcomes/higher returns, but is easier said then done when we're at historic highs. This will yield about 95k per year at 7% returns. Use this money to invest in real estate later if you want.

Here's the kicker: Bitcoin's ledger is stored... in over 10,000 computers all over the world.  People keep copies of the ledger and they share information with each other so that everybody's ledger can be up to date.  

Thus, your Bitcoins exist in the two ledger copies I keep, and my best friend's copy and so on.  

Your wallet generates private keys and corresponding ""receive addresses"".  It helps you keep your private keys a secret.  Your wallet helps you to generate spending transactions, and then it digitally signs them, using your private keys it holds for you.  Your wallet keeps track of your overall balance of unspent Bitcoins.  (Some wallets have more features, but those are the basics.)  

Your wallet starts with a unique master seed and generates a deterministic sequence of private keys from that seed.  As long as it starts from the same exact seed, it will generate the exact same sequence of private keys.  

So, if your dog chews up and ruins your hardware wallet, your Bitcoins still exist in over 10,000 copies of the ledger (called the ""blockchain"").  You then buy another copy of that hardware wallet, enter the same starting seed, and the wallet re-generates the same private key sequence and the same addresses -- you're right back where you started.  

Is this not total genius, whoever designed all of this?",2020-11-30 10:34:19

I'd be prepared to help you, I love thus stuff.

First thing to know is that knowing about Bitcoin is not necessarily knowing how to trade Bitcoin. You don't have to know how to trade and in fact you really shouldn't trade or look at charts, just accumulate it because it is going to become world money and it is grossly undervalued at the moment.

It does take a little effort to get started but I guarantee you it is absolutely worth it and you will not look back. I can guide you at what to look up and and help to avoid scammers and nonsense.

My website will be a good resource.

The first article in the menu is what you need to start with...

And also explore the site from time to time ... There are many articles I have written to make it easy for people to learn. It's all for free. I don't get paid for my efforts and I have nothing to gain from you. I just love Bitcoin and want to see it succeed because it is important to humanity.",2020-11-30 10:01:11
