He told me he would sell it to me for $150, so I instantly went to the closest ATM, got $160 and told him to keep the change. Next day he came in saying ""did you know those are selling for like $800(Bitcoin craze) ?!"". He was a good sport about it though and still sold it to me for the agreed $160",2020-02-01 06:07:24

fg3jfyg,fixedelineation,1,"This a huge misunderstanding of how EOS works. If one block producers validates a transaction it becomes part of the chain. It can‚Äôt be removed. There is a possibility of black listing, though that possibility exists with bitcoin and many other coins as well.  We saw the attempted blacklisting of transactions fail on EOS because a BP was asleep at the wheel. For some reason It was a bigger scandal than the successful freezing of stolen funds a few months earlier. 

That‚Äôs all ancient history though as that aspect of EOS is gone now. There is no evidence of censorship or indication that the chain can be stopped. If you have some I‚Äôd like to see.

The huge advantage EOS has and why discussions.app can thrive on the platform is that users can access the EOS chain without having to own any crypto. The transactions are covered by The Novusphere, who can afford to do so only because individual transactions only have a temporary cost.",2020-02-01 00:03:07

fg3jqb7,forestball19,1,"Using my Sir Whitehall identity, I had no difficulty using my hypnotic powers to rob banks - which in this modern day and era, translated to making a poor employee transfer money to Bitcoin, then transferring those digital to an exchange, trade it for one of the anonymity coins and the transfer the whole lot to one of my private wallets. 

In fact, all went well for a few weeks - until the day I met her. I was visiting the North Capitol Bank and enjoying a rather tasty beverage while my victim did the money transferring, when a young girl clad in a pink and white costume waltzed in, singing ‚Äúthese boots are made for walking‚Äù. As soon as I saw she wore a mask, I knew she was one of those annoying heroes I‚Äôd done such a great job at avoiding. Until now. 

Without flinching or showing any sign that I‚Äôd seen her, I threw my mental probe at her, whispering: ‚ÄúHear my voice, heed my bidding.‚Äù

The girl immediately stopped singing and moving. ‚ÄúYes, Master. Oh sorry - I mean, Yes, Daddy. Do you like it when I call you that?‚Äù She began moving again as I could no longer pretend to ignore her. This was impossible. My hypno powers worked on anything with a brain - even animals fell sway under my voice. 

I cleared my throat and in a loud voice commanded: ‚ÄúFreeze!‚Äù

- ‚ÄúDo you? Should I come warm you, daddy?‚Äù she answered, obviously unaffected and in a voice that made me blush, wishing I wore a mask. 

- ‚ÄúWill you stop calling me ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äô, at once!‚Äù I snapped while getting up and ready to escape. With a few soft spoken whispers, I made three bank employees attack her while I ran for it, my escape line being: ‚ÄúAnd for the record, I am not that old!‚Äù

I saw the girl dodge a chair that was thrown at her, then heard her merry voice answer me: ‚ÄúYeah whatever. Boomer.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Over the course of the next few months, she increasingly crossed my path and thwarted my plans. Always taunting me and saying very improper things - and I learned that she carried two katana swords on her back, which she wielded with expertise when the situation called for it. I always managed to get away - but at the same time, she always managed to stop me from getting any money for my trouble. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Today it will be different. I have set a trap, and although it will not result in her demise, it will show her that I am not to be taken lightly. 

I already hear her approaching. Today‚Äôs song is ‚ÄúI Like Big Butts‚Äù. I smirk while slowly picking the spoon from my afternoon tea. The small local bank I have chosen for this scene to play out seems mostly empty. It is not, of course, but only I know that. 

- ‚ÄúOh hey, Big Daddy! Fancy running into you here, wanna see what I have learned?‚Äù she greets me. 

- ‚ÄúAs I have bothered to learn your name, Miss Poole, it would only be fitting that you learn mine. Sir Whitehall. And actually, I have been expecting yo-‚Äú

- Ugh okay, yeah - Sir White balls, then. Anyway, I watched a video on a website with a lot of pop ups and lemme tell ya, the girls in those videos were fricking agile! And holy shit could they do stuff on a pole that would castrate a grown man, if you know what I mean!‚Äù While talking, she dances to one of the counters and jumps up on it with what the young nowadays refer to as ‚Äòswag‚Äô.

- ‚ÄúI do, in fact, not know what you mean. Nor do I intend to find out,‚Äù I answer calmly, while whispering words of command. 

Five bank employees run at her with ropes. Two customers draw their guns and point them at her. I take a sip of my tea, which tastes quite excellent.

Miss Poole reacts almost casually - first doing a backwards somersault while drawing the gun at her hips, and as she lands she shoots the customers with guns before I can react. Apparently, her gun shoots tranquilizer darts. They fall quickly, sleeping before they hit the floor. Then she moves like water, avoiding the bank employee‚Äôs attempts at catching her with their ropes, and somehow she manages to steal the rope from one of them, and as I watch in awe, my tea suddenly tasting bitter, she catches all five of them and binds them up. 

- ‚ÄúAaaand where was I?‚Äù she says with a cheer while walking towards me. ‚ÄúOh yeah. Subtle or not so subtle hints at adult stuff. But that idiot writer is getting close to the 1,000 characters limit, so I don‚Äôt have much time for sass,‚Äù she sighs. 

Writer? Character limit?

- ‚ÄúOh and my big reveal here would be that I‚Äôm actually Gwe-... nah, you ruined it. Hadda go call me Miss Poole, even in your thoughts. The fanboys definitely know who I am by now. You coulda called me Pinky or Dildo, but no, you had to ruin the surprise the surprise ending. Even ForestBall is annoyed by that.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUhm... ah, what?‚Äù I manage to stutter. 

She reaches for her mask and takes it off. Shoulder long blonde hair, dyed pink at the tips. Piercing blue eyes and a pretty face full off adolescent ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a shit‚Äô attitude.

- ‚ÄúSo, Big Daddy. The story‚Äôs over now. How ‚Äòbout we just say ‚Äòdick‚Äô and go grab a beer, huh?‚Äù

Confused, my brain just surrendering, I answer dryly: ‚ÄúYes. Why not.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúCome on, big daddy. Say it.‚Äù 

I sigh and as I get up, say: ‚ÄúDick‚Äù.",2020-02-01 00:06:25

But aside from the halving of new supply, hype could definitely pick up as articles are written about the halvening and could lead to a self-fulfilling rally. Many people, including institutional investors, are paying more attention to bitcoin now and are looking to allocate for the long-term. They're likely to buy on any weakness, and to attempt to front-run potential hype.

And I think the author's analysis of the 2016 halving's effect on prices is too narrow. Sure, there wasn't an immediate bump after the halving, but that's because there was a roughly 80% rally the previous month. If I have to suffer through an 80% rally in April, only to see a retracement in May that makes higher lows, I won't consider the halvening a bust.",2020-02-01 02:54:41

You will see no technical debates on /r/bitcoin and you won't see all the possible information there.

Just follow nullc account and other bitcoiners and you will notice the only time you get to learn anything is when they post here.

Yes it's mainly focused on bitcoin cash supporters (who are by the way bitcoin supporters, just read the whitepaper ) but that is because they have been banned from participating in /r/bitcoin.

Unfortunately the people who believe bitcoin cash to be a scam come in here only for self amusement and not to actually add in discussion.  Now this is of course not 100% of people, but when people invest their money into something they will have natural instinct to attack anything they fear might bring their value down.

The main differences between the two camps in my opinion is /r/bitcoin wants to increase their wealth via investing in a ticker symbol and /r/btc people want to build a protocol where even a man in Asia makes $2 a day can participate in the network.

Not only are these numbers miniscule, they reveal the precarious state of crypto. Governments could close the fiat exchanges with only modest political cost.

fgatl9l,chernobyl169,1,"&gt;  the miner did nothing suring segwit2x

Precisely. They did nothing when faced with community outcry, and went along with whatever Bitcoin Core and Blockstream said to do. Here we are again, and in a much more precarious position: on a minority fork.

&gt; If the miners had balls in 2017 we would be in a much better position.

They didn't, and they don't today. Majority hashpower is mining BTC, not BCH. The only thing keeping BCH alive is opportunity cost - it is more profitable to honestly mine BTC than it is to attack BCH, for now. The halvenings this year very likely could shift that balance, and relying on a miner cartel to protect your finances is probably a worse decision than relying on a government cartel to do it.

The bottom line is, the *announcement of intent* undermines the coin itself. Whether the dev tax happens or not is now totally irrelevant; Jihan played his hand and said ""if you don't like it, leave, you can't stop us"". The last time we heard ""if you don't like it leave"" from miners, we did and BCH was born...",2020-02-02 23:55:54
fgau03q,swgellis,1,"Decentralized currency based on math. The network is run by tens of thousands of computers and miners all over the globe. If Asia and Africa disappeared tomorrow the network would still be running. No one person controls the network. Through the power of cryptography every transaction on the network is verified and then permanently placed onto the bitcoin blockchain, which is about 280 gigabytes of data at this point. In this way bitcoin transactions are immutable. Nobody can fake them and nobody can modify the chain. If you try to modify the chain, the rest of the worldwide network rejects your change because it‚Äôs inconsistent with their chain files. Long story short, decentralized currency that can‚Äôt be controlled by anyone. Oh, and did I mention it has a hard cap of 21 million coins? There are more than 21 million millionaires on earth, but there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. It can‚Äôt be counterfeited and it can‚Äôt be faked.

fgarekp,ebaley,1,"&gt; Even with segwit blocks dont average above 1.4mb size. And it obviously wasnt enough because **we've had acute fee crises**, and there are long periods of time where average fees are over $1, which the Bitcoin wiki used to say that Devs dont expect fees to ever exceed $1. Shows what they know.

Have we? The fees were nowhere as bad at 14K last year. By 2040 fees will be essential since almost all the coins will have been mined. Ironically bcash was formed because Bitmain wanted the juicy fees that Segwit would deny them.

&gt;""as hardware and bandwidth become more affordable"".

What the hell difference would that make to the average user? Tell me.

&gt;Why do you think I dont accept it? I've moved on from using bitcoin. What i don't accept is morons pretending that bitcoin hasnt been crippled.

Watch your mouth or I'll block you. Get a credit card. They're quite good. Or a Bitcoin debit card.

&gt;In what universe is that a meaningful statement? Thats like saying the only reason people buy Tesla is because of Ford.

Inane analogy. You know fine well people buy alts because they hope to make returns that early Bitcoin adopters made. Few are buying for tech. A negligible amount would be enough for testing.

&gt;Paypal uses a centralized ledger denominated in whatever fiat currency you want. They dont have to have their own unique currency to offer electronic cash.

So YOUR definition of cash is anything that specialises in payments. That's not either of the dictionary definitions.

&gt;Hashrate and liquidity are both only functions of the current level of adoption, and have absolutely nothing to do with the merits of its technical or economic design.

Trust in a money is important. You could declare silver the new gold tomorrow but good luck getting people to join you.

&gt;So its a natural ponzi without a middleman. So what?

You post shit like this again and we drop it. It is the best SoV and safe haven with no central party in existence. Name a better one or GTF. 

&gt;""The original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi mentions ‚Äútransaction‚Äù 69 times, ‚Äúcash‚Äù or ‚Äúpayment‚Äù 18 times, ‚Äúgold‚Äù 2 times, and ‚Äústore of value‚Äù 0 times. ü§îü§îü§≠
https://www.np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ewy1o2/the_original_bitcoin_whitepaper_by_satoshi/

I don't give a shit what he supposedly said. Nobody will use a money that cannot keep value.

&gt;Its literally the first sentence of the whitepaper that outline's bitcoin's design. What better evidence can there be of bitcoin's original intentions and goals?

The genesis block. Nothing about payments. It was central banks he was worried about. Not about buying his groceries. I doubt he had trouble doing that.

&gt;Any crippling of BCH would be only due to loss of marketshare vs before the split with BTC. If BCH retained the BTC ticker and the 99% of crypto users who just defaulted to stay with BTC with no actual thought, bitcoin would still be electronic cash instead of being crippled and relegated to a lowly ponzi scheme.

Btrash however and now it is just another altcoin. And call Bitcoin a ponzi again and I won't respond. Spectacularly stupid.  Criticize it technically if you wish but monetarily it is fantastic.

&gt;But any value was subtracted from the post fork BTC that corresponded to the BCH.

What difference does that make? Why should bcash be worth more than a dollar?


&gt;It wasnt free because you had to have bought or mined BTC to get it.

Please. Who was buying it at these prices if most got it for nothing or no effort?

&gt;Its so amusing to see what a house of cards the Core narrative is based on. You have absolutely nothing of substance to offer, and instead give demonstrable lies.

All you are offering are evasions and non-sequitors. I ask you something then you try to divert.",2020-02-02 23:41:58

Price may be influenced by content and length.

**Other Important Info:**

\- I charge 5$ extra for outfit requests. I also charge an additional 5$ PER any alterations to makeup or hairstyle or shoes.

Currently I usually start shows in just a low cut tank top/Tshirt and

panties or lingerie or i cycle through different types of lingere each day. If you want a little more, I offer

lots of different lingerie, sports wear, or normal clothes and shoes. But im always wearing something sexy.

\- I also Charge a 5$ increase per 10 mins on group shows as they require more organization and prep on my end.

\- I do not start my shows naked.

\- I have a standing rule that I call 'Three Strikes, you are out' Which means, I do not keep clients on my list

who pry, or make repeated contact but no payment, time wasters or rudeness. I understand things happen and

sometimes arrangements don't work out.. But i also think three chances is plenty. If after three chances you

find yourself unable to contact me and are unsure why, In all likeliness you have been blocked. This also applies

to clients who have paid before/have become regulars. The only way to become unblocked is to submit a payment

through my ad, (including your skype ID) and then i will unblock you and contact you for a show to avoid wasted time.

\- I also BLOCK without warning for the following reasons....Calling without payment, Unsolicited pictures,

dishonesty about payment, and asking for free shows, pictures etc. If you find yourself unable to contact

me after having done any of these things, Please follow the steps above in my 'Three Strikes, you are out'

Rule to become unblocked. Although you may earn the privilege to be unblocked, previous offenders are kept

on very short leashes and second time offenders are never forgiven. We are all adults, so act like it.

\- I always show as online on Skype because i am signed in on multiple devices to make reaching me easier.

If you message me I will get back to you as soon as possible. I however, do not always respond, as i may be

in a show or unavailable. The best way to reach me is messaging me immediately when you are ready to pay for

a show. I can't guarantee times and i don't really work on a schedule.

\- If you submit a payment without talking to me first, the show will be given at a time convenient for both

me and the client.

fg7bjps,Angry_AGAIN,1,"&gt;  I assume that runners will prefer to have a SIN
A Sin. Period. Having a Real Sin is problematic since this can backfire. In fact - using a ""real"" sin from the Sinner Handicap is something a Runner should avoid like the Pest. It can be used if a char plays Corp Slave by Day and Runner at Night plot but im not a fan of this.

A Real Sin should only be used if there is absolut no other way around - like international traveling. A Char with a low level Fake Sin could use his Real Sin to pass thru Airport/Suborbital Security Checks. But this is a scenario any ""professional"" should avoid.

How and why a Char uses a SIN is a case to case question. But generell speaking,  as a Runner you dive into the Shadows and leave no trail behind, you change your SIN's like Magazines or Ammo Types. Your Fixers and Contacts dont care about a SIN, you pay them with Certified Credsticks(Bitcoin Wallets/PaysafeCards and so on) 
But you need a SIN to participate in the 6. world - so you buy a Fake one, a low level  SIN with a hacked Wallet is enough to buy shit at a Wedding Machine, get yourself a Taxi or Bus ride.

You are sick of living in a Slum? Rent a better Appartement but this means a better Sin that matches the typical security checks for tenants, now you cant use this ""better"" SIN for Runner Stuff ... or you risk burning a Sin with a Home attached to it... so a new SIN shows up.. and the circle goes on. 

&gt;Or do you use your real SIN in your everyday life to maintain the appearence lf a regular citizen

This is funny, because a Runner is or should be trained to avoid such things. Not only because he avoids to use his SIN everywhere - he switches his ID often and operates outside the System. This leaves some sorts of black holes in his Sin Metadata Trail that identifies him as an irregular citizen. But again, deckers are your friends and higher level SIN's are filled with fake Meta Datas to appear ""Real"" Just Asume you buy not only a Fake Identity - you pay a network to keep your fake Person alive. - Btw i assume this since there is no SIN Level degeneration and it makes sense for higher level SINs.


&gt;and use your fake SIN during runs because they are basically throwaways?
Yes but they are also not so easy to obtain and they are costly, so a ""good"" runner trys to avoid a SIN Burn and this brings him back into the Shadows. Sure with a level 3 Sin - he could by his new LMG in a Store but this would include the risk that this SIN will burn up and so he visits the Crime Mall and pays double the Price for an Illegal Gun without question ask.",2020-02-02 05:22:32

Best streak: W6

Last pick: Djokovic -4.5 - L

Today:

NBA (basketball)

Time: 00:30 GMT

POTD: **Brooklyn Nets ML** @ 1.79 / -127

Nets have recently turned things around after a string of sub-par performances, they've now won 3 of their last 5 games and are on a 2-game winning streak at the Barclays Center. The continuance of this resurgence is vital for Brooklyn's playoff ambitions as they look to safeguard their 7th position in the Eastern Conference.

Unfortunately Kyrie is out again for at least a week with a sprained medial ligament in his right knee - an injury he picked up against the Wizards on Saturday. He averages 27.4 points for the season and had just dropped a season high of 54 points against the Bulls the night before picking up that injury. Brooklyn have a horde of gifted players to fall back on though and the team's performance rarely suffers from the absence of their star pointguard. One of those talents is Spencer Dinwiddie who averages 21.5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game. 

The Suns have even bigger injury problems of their own. Their star pointguard Ricky Rubio is currently nursing an ankle injury as he was ruled out against the Bucks on Sunday in a game they lost by 21 points. Another pointguard Ty Jerome also didn't play as he was suffering from left calf soreness. Power forward Dario Saric is suffering from an ankle injury while influentual big men Aron Baynes and Frank Kaminsky also remain sidelined, with hip and knee injuries respectively.

Something that the media gets wrong about Bitcoiners-- it's not that people aren't perfectly fine with alternatives existing (especially the less scammy ones that don't make Bitcoin look bad by association or spread lies about Bitcoin to promote themselves), the overwhelming majority are perfectly fine with that... it's that a lot of people were sick and tired of relentless altcoin promoters flooding their events and venues long ago, heck-- even before most of the media even heard of Bitcoin.

Eth going back to $1000 for one which isn't quite its all time high and the entire crypto marketcap returning to the late 2017 800 billion range.

Very simple really. All this bitcoin maximalist nonsense and the hype of having one BTC when having the same value now in even ETH will make getting 50 ETH a no brainer.

BTC is digital gold and purely a store of value. Nothing else really. ETH and smart contracts is why 2017 happened in the first place. ICOs is what brought all the money in. BTC was all  speculation mania and people cashing out their scam, shit coin etc.. profits for something reliable and trustworthy.

I feel people are quite naive right now and seem unaware while its important to see BTC succeed and go up in value.

Compare and contrast this with when BTC futures were introduced at a the top of the market. Yes, BTC futures were possibly used to help get the market ""under control"" during the bull top.

&gt; Second, he not only disclosed what he did, despite not needing to, he also warned others that based on his experiences, the market would eventually consolidate and a multiyear bear market was possible, he did this when other real scammy founders were hyping and pumping and dumping. Now the acolytes of those real loser scumbags come here to try and discredit Charlie by accusing him of the exact opposite of what he did.  
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Charlie has more skin in the game than anyone. He was never as invested as people imagine founders to be (because they're used to ICOs and premines that put massive percentages in founder's pockets at the outset), but his investment is his time and energy. No altcoin has achieved as much infrastructure as Litecoin has with so few resources, and that's mostly due to Charlie. Not trying to downplay the actions of the community, other LTCF employees, volunteers and supporters, but I've seen communities and individuals as dedicated and invested as our strongest members fail to get even basic infrastructure after years of concerted effort for their favorite coin while Litecoin secures the biggest exchanges and other infrastructure almost from day 1. I can't imagine anyone who's really a part of this community even taking umbrage at the idea that Charlie's role at getting the coin so well supported is massively outsized.  
&gt; 
&gt; Other coins are jealous of our success, particularly on infrastructure. Some of the accusers were probably fooled themselves, some are actively trying to undermine Litecoin, often by accusing litecoin of doing what their coin actually does. In all cases, you have to do your own research. Don't rely on what I'm saying, check the history. I won't hold your hand through all of it, but here's Charlie letting people know in early december 2017, before the market topped off, that hard times were coming: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/940357341723082752  
&gt; 
&gt; That's a standup guy, and one with a lot of perspective and wisdom. You can choose to listen to him or to listen to the trolls. Beware, you may well start to resemble whomever you listen to. If you listen to the trolls, check the mirror daily for signs of mouth foaming and seek medical help as necessary. If you listen to Charlie, you might start to understand the world of crypto better, and that can be jarring, because outside of a very small number of coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin, there are scams aplenty.",2020-02-04 02:12:19

I wouldn't put much stock into this offer unless a large fund ""strongly urges"" them to sell (see the Stubhub sale). But hypothetically, if ICE buys them out, I'd expect the following to happen (Disclaimer - this is all wild conjecture based on what I know of them as a company):

1) eBay's outdated tech stack would be revamped and made more user friendly... that'd be great. I don't know anyone that likes how glitchy and weird eBay's listing functionality gets sometimes. Of course, this would mean we'd likely see more competition. Easier to sell means lower barrier for entry.

2) The seller standards would get a lot stricter. ICE has experience turning less-than-stellar financial securities marketplaces into well oiled machines, and they do that by updating infrastructure and figuring out what's losing the most money. I know that in our bubble we'd all like to believe that buyer scams/returns are the bane of eBay's existence, but it's much more likely that buyer confidence is what's holding back growth. I'd expect them to crack down on sellers and do the best they can to get eBay up to par with the level that people trust Amazon.

3) Lots and lots of marketing. Making the whole world aware that ""new"" eBay is better than ever, and they can finally trust it again. With this, I imagine would come higher fees for us.

4) Extremely advanced payment systems that hopefully abandon Paypal. ICE's bread and butter is financial trading systems. They've got the experience to roll out something awesome for payments. Something that would hopefully be easier for both buyers AND sellers.  They also own ""Bakkt"" which deals with Bitcoin, so we might see some of that as well.

5) ICE is also involved in data services and analytics. We could end up with some pretty sweet market analysis tools to help recognize price patterns on certain goods. This might just be wishful thinking, though.

Think critically for a second guys, the mere fact that a big investment group with funds dedicated to investments in the cryptocurrency space decided to invest in one of the companies supporting the most popular coin is in no way an evidence that their investment (through a VC) gives them ANY form of control over Bitcoin.

&gt;Many in the cryptocurrency space like coins like Bitcoin because they are not only not inflationary, but deflationary. There's a limited number minted and many are permanently lost. Governments can't print more at a whim. With stablecoins, it's still pegged to the very assets many want to escape. Which might be what you want, depending on the use case.

Fixed supply assets are volatile, rendering them pretty unsuitable as currencies. You can't buy a house with something that can moves 10% in 30 mins. These things aren't going to ""suddenly"" stabilise someday either due to their structure. 

&gt;It's also decentralized, meaning governments can control exchanges (for now) but not the coin itself. As long as there are miners or stakers or whatever else they come up with, you're free to do whatever you want with it with no third party telling you what you can and cannot do. That's pretty unique in history.

Yup that's cool, but at any time regulators could theoretically forbid fiat and payment gateways from doing business with exchanges, as a result the secondary market value of cryptos would plummet severely. They'd still be around, but would likely be extremely low value, and a huge amount of interest in crypto is tied to trading (99% last check)

Also for the decentralised part; in the real world it has it's uses (mostly within inafrastructure and tech) but a modern government is extremely unlikely to ever create fully decentralised national tender for obvious reasons, lack of control over inflation, inability to mitigate crises, etc

&gt;And there's also a large sort of prepper/hedging side of things. With the massive global debt and negative interest rates and stock market in what looks to be bubble territory, many see it as a potential hedge against a crash or even global collapse. I also own some silver for that same reason. And beans. Lots of beans. ;)

While cryptos may increase like gold in a recession, I wouldn't count on them too much in any sort of prepper post apocalyptic scenarion, need stable internet/electricity for that. Oh there will be recessions, but a full on global systemic crisis like 2008 is much less likely. That was the most severe since 1929 and major currencies barely moved. Since then we have put a metric shit-ton of controls, regulations, laws, measures to squeeze as much risk out of commercial and private banking (and shadow banking) as possible. Not to say it can't come from a diff angle, just it's less likely to have the same impact as 2008",2020-02-06 08:07:03

That gave those who controlled the money supply power. The gap between physically held assets and the IOU's (dollars) grew wider until they simply didn't have enough to ever pay it back without bankrupting the state, so they left it entirely and even made ownership of gold illegal for a while. It's only after the last financial crisis that gold and silver were once again recognized as legal tender.

fgnen9u,baltakatei,3,"&gt; What's the best option?

## Short answer: Whatever the software the certificate authority you trust requires.

## Longer answer:

The short answer takes care of you unless you don't have a trusted certificate authority.

Why might you not need a trusted certificate authority? I'm going to push back with a question: ""Who do you imagine will be verifying what you sign and for what reason?""

1. Is it a client using Microsoft Outlook whom you are trying to impress by differentiating yourself from other bidders via a üéÄ icon appearing whenever they read emails from you?

2. Is it an IT manager in your corporation who wants to mitigate the risk of malicious email tampering?

3. Is it an IT expert hired by your lawyer to defend you in a lawsuit by establishing useful facts for your case?

4. Is it yourself so you can prove the existence of data for any reason in the future without relying on a third party?

5. Is it a remote client who fears man-in-the-middle attacks yet trusts a certificate authority?

If you're in case 1 then you should follow the instructions [Microsoft](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/independent-certification-authority-b06cfc76-56a1-4a74-b2dd-91a55de79cdf) (or whichever corporation the client is dependent on) provides. This is my conclusion after a few hours of searching and thinking.

If you're in case 2, 3, or 4, then you really don't need a certificate authority to vouch for your identity. Just physically talk to them.

Case 5 is like case 1 except the client hasn't identified a trusted certificate authority who will dictate what programs to use. See the short answer.

**If you're open to dropping your requirement of having a certificate authority then keep reading. Otherwise, see the short answer at the top.**

I'm biased towards using software that respects the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition_and_the_Four_Freedoms) that the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is based on. So, in my opinion, answering your question boils down to two choices:

1. Use a one-size-fits-all program like GnuPG.

2. Use a [set of simpler tools](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce/status/1214590620682969088).

### 1. Choice one: One-size-fits all

GnuPG is a complex program which can do the following:

* [email signing and encryption with Thunderbird](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/),

* [document version control with Git](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

* [remote login with OpenSSH](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/gpg-subkeys-ssh)

* [password management with Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)

### 2. Choice 2: Simpler tools

These are programs recommended by a sysadmin (?) I follow [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce) used to host PGP key signing events at [OpenWest](https://openwest.org/) ( a Salt Lake City open source conference ). In the past year he has redirected people away from using PGP and instead towards [simpler programs](https://twitter.com/AaronToponce/status/1214590620682969088) that ""do one thing well"".

* https://github.com/signalapp/ - Send text or files with public/private keys via graphical user interface (GUI) and developer-hosted server.

* https://github.com/FiloSottile/age - Encrypt files with public/private keys via command line interface (CLI).

* https://github.com/skeeto/enchive - Encrypt files with public/private keys via CLI.

* https://github.com/tarsnap/scrypt - Encrypt files with password via CLI.

* https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign - Sign files via CLI (signatures compatible with signify).

* https://github.com/aperezdc/signify - Sign files via CLI.

* https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole - Send text or files with password via CLI and developer-hosted server.

For example, if your goal is to be able to prove that a certain email existed at a certain time then you might export the email to an EML file, use `minisign` to create a signature file for the EML file on your own computer, then archive the files in your long-term backup system. You might go a step further and use [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) to prove the file existed using the hashpower of the Bitcoin blockchain in case whoever is doing the verifying doesn't trust your backup system's integrity.

## Summary

There's a tension in your question that I'm not sure can be relieved without pushing against some of your requirements. This tension is your soft requirement that the solution involve a trusted certificate authority to vouch for you and the fact that you're posting on /r/GnuPG. To me, GnuPG is software built from a herd of cats all in mild-conflict with one another but generally tending towards making software that follows the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Definition_and_the_Four_Freedoms). A general principle of the Four Freedoms is that software should serve people and not the other way around. Not freedom-friendly certificate authorities that charge you to trust them not to revoke your public key (see [whatever Microsoft recommends](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/independent-certification-authority-b06cfc76-56a1-4a74-b2dd-91a55de79cdf)) are all I could find after several hours of searching for alternatives to GnuPG for your question.

Without a need for a certificate authority and with my free software bias, then finding the best option turns into a question of what kind of free and open source software to use (few complex tools vs. many simple tools).

Otherwise, if you trust a certificate authority then you'll end up doing what they recommend.",2020-02-06 07:54:01

fgqec03,jimjacksonsjamboree,16,"The term you're looking for is ""fungible"". Gold is a commodity as it has production value. Historically, anything can be used as a currency, but for the last thousand years or so, hardly anyone considers anything other than a government backed note to be currency, because for something to be a good currency it has to be stable, and crypto is anything but stable. Many actual government backed ""currencies"" fail this test due to hyper inflation and other fuckery. Those economies almost always revert to bartering or using another country's currency because an unstable currency isn't really a currency.

It's pedantic to say ""bitcoin is a currency"". Anything is currency. Bitcoin is just another valueless thing that people have gotten together and decided is valuable. It's not any different than an IOU. In effect, it's bartering. Which is why I said it's just another thing to barter for.

Bitcoin backers can say it's currency all they want but it's a really poor currency. It's treated much more like a commodity by hedge funds and people who actually do economics for a living. The CFTC has classified it as a commodity and it is regulated as such.",2020-02-07 05:55:39

We've got a clear path ahead, some runway to work with.

If bitcoin goes up a bit more we could start to see some very positive media coverage. Sparking a virtuous cycle where increased attention leads to new money entering the system which leads to more bullish PA --&gt; more news coverage --&gt; more new money...

Bitcoin was created in stealth by developers who had no clue what reaction the world would have towards it. Governments and central banks are directly threatened by it.

Imagine what it must have been like. The best parallel I have found to it, is the signing of the declaration of independence. They were putting their names on it and they did not know if they would end up hung, but the possibility was very much there. 

Bitcoin also has this aspect, they had no clue what would happen. They must have understood that they were running some very serious risks against some dark forces. 

Any new project takes the open source nature of Bitcoin and dresses it up in a slightly different way. The difference between bitcoin and altcoin is infinitesimal when compared to the difference of Bitcoin and no bitcoin. 

Bitcoin throws off people from its wagon because the ride is supremely bumpy and filled with near death experiences, real and imagined.

The long term thought that went into it is severely undervalued. The last of the Bitcoin mining will occur in 2134. That is, Satoshi thought to extend the issuance many generations into the future. This tells you that Bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg, and all of the pre-work and failures that came before it were needed to come to this profound and world altering creation that was orphaned in its infancy by its creator.

Taxi medallions reached a peak price of over $1,000,000 just a short time ago.

Ask yourself--which provides more utility? What would you rather own long term? What do you think others would choose, if given the choice? Why is Bitcoin different?

And we think $100,000 is absurd.

2) yes it is. taproot requires as much onchain space as a basic transaction while MAST requires more, so it's cheaper

3) no it is not. taproot uses the same security assumptions of schnorr (which is slightly more secure than ECDSA) 
The crypto in schnorr has already been reviewed a long time ago by a lot of people, long before Bitcoin was even a thing

4) I'm not enough expert on the subject to have a conclusive opinion but to me this implementation is good

5) not ""jamming features"" would be worse since having them separated would add a lot of complexity, and we really need schnorr + taproot.
schnorr and taproot are really linear together so there is no point on having them separated and they are clear and optimal upgrades on what we have now.

besides we already have signature aggregation and eltoo postponed for a future upgrade so there is no bundle of features.

MAST to the on the other hand is suboptimal and there is really no merit in implementing it no matter what.

schnorr can be used without taproot so there is really no problem at all and these concerns hold no water

all in all, people with a little knowledge about the upgrade could not possibly have this kind of concerns.

this is not an honest email, it's the writing of some one trying to spread FUD

It was 100+ degrees around his house when he died and he didn't have an A/C unit.  His body decomposed quickly and pretty much melted into the floor.  The mattress he had died on was obviously removed... and so was the floor under it... and then the dirt under the subfloor needed to be excavated... I could never get that smell of death out of my mind and had to deal with it for the 30 days while I packed up his belongings.  While cleaning out his house I found 3 suicide notes in envelopes next to several empty pill bottles... also a book on different ways of committing suicide earmarked.  Most of his belongings had to be tossed out as everything smelled like death...  I wasn't in a good financial place and was living in an old RV parked on some abandoned property.

optional privacy on a transparent chain is generally a bad idea, as those transactions stand out like a sore thumb and are a red flag for chain analysis companies:

fh6rptm,iveyballer,9,"Please correct my logic if I am mistaken, but there is no possible way that the halving could be fully priced into BTC right now. It is true that some amount of investors may be accumulating BTC in anticipation of the halving. However, the main reason that the price increases so much is because the mining rewards are reduced by 50%. Miners account for the majority of sellers on any given day because they sell their rewards to pay for their mining operations. When their rewards are cut in half, their effective sell pressure is also cut in half. If all things stay the same, this will result is less sellers to buyers than currently, which makes the price go up. This built in mechanism is also necessary for miners because their operations are at risk if their revenue gets cut in half over night. They need the value of their tokens to increase in order to fund their operations with less mining rewards. 

TLDR: bitcoin halving isn‚Äôt priced in. the halving actually needs to occur before it moves the market. Miners will have 50% less rewards to sell on the market.

fh9bi9q,rjmcoin,3,"I've become a hard sell.

I was all over the map when I first got the crypto bug in Dec 2017, right when everything went nuts.. again.

Augur, Komodo, 0x, Litecoin, EOS, Lisk, IOTA, ZenCash, Verge.. everything was so exciting. Every white paper seemed to make sense and every project had a cool story and I thought for sure everything was going to skyrocket.. as it was.

Screw Bitcoin, everything else looked better.. built on Javascript or C++, hey that sounds good, there are lots of developers, those will moon for sure! It's all about who can get it done first no doubt!

Time goes on and I get whitepaper fatigue. I couldn't stand to see any more talk of ""revolutionary approach"" to ""disrupting a Trillion dollar industry"" to ""rebuilding the global financial landscape"".. with a leadership team of 4 and 14 team members..

Then through the channels I ended up on Cardano, and it wasn't even the whiteboard video, I found that later. They didn't have a whitepaper (fun fact: they still don't have a whitepaper) but there was a lot of sciency stuff and long mathy papers nobody understands. I was attracted to the depth of the research and figured this must be something good if they are going full academia on it.

I can't remember for sure but I think this was the first video I watched, and I probably watched it 3 times.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fNLSjAgHg

Then I watched this one 2 or 3 times

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_QLfnucgh0

Then I watched this one probably 5 times

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fNLSjAgHg

Then I watched the whiteboard video.  Only twice tho I think.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw

Pretty much after this, I found every video related to Cardano and everything else, literally everything else in crypto, feels weak. Cardano was purpose built to address or complete solve every issue with Ethereum and Bitcoin and through numerous videos we come to understand the whole picture of Cardano, and why every other project will falter on their own merits. (of course on the understanding that Charles properly understands his own proposition in comparison to the competition.)

With this foundation, and the subsequent 2018 and 2019 persistent updates, we get to see the clear vision and plan of attack for Cardano. From conception it was never to take on big money head on, it was always going to go after the most difficult financial markets possible and if it could survive there, it would naturally percolate up and force big money to comply to work with these emerging markets.

Everything about this project is a breading ground for success and opportunity. Everything. Cardano is going to succeed, because it has the most complete vision of how to succeed.

It's amazing they are doing everything so fast.

There is literally nothing more exciting in crypto.",2020-02-11 08:30:30

fhclqgy,Academic_Crypto,3,"I want to bring some attention to OKEx quarterly Bitcoin futures.  This product has been going nuts for the duration of this rally from 6ks. A lot of people look at BitMEX and their funding rates and futures premiums, but consider this, currently OKEx March 27th futures are trading $70 above MEX's March 27th futures while the USDT spot market is trading $60 below the USD spot market. This means that relatively speaking the OKEx quarterly future is trading at a substantial premium to the MEX equivalent. 

To be specific, the OKEx quarterly is currently trading at about a 460USDT premium to spot with an expiration date just 44 days away. That contract also lead the rally today and has in the past month been a frequent leader of bullish price action. I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/eqrje6/daily_discussion_sunday_january_19_2020/feximks?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) a few weeks ago where I documented that large orders on OKEx futures are 5/5 on calling tops and bottoms. 

Futures premiums can be thought of as a premium that people are willing to pay to borrow money / trade on margin as opposed to making the same spot bet. The following plot is the derived borrowing rate from the OKEx futures premium in the past 8 months or so [(Image)](https://imgur.com/5bCOiyU). As you can see, the current implied borrowing rate has exceeded 0.1% per day and has been going parabolic in the last month. This means that by longing OKEx futures, users are essentially taking an extremely high interest loan to be long Bitcoin. 

Also interesting is the historic trading volume on the quarterly futures [(Image)](https://imgur.com/BJ3Rnu8). There have been 4 times in history that the contract has traded with high volume. (1) The ATH run, (2) Summer 2018 when the [large OKEx liquidation w/ socialized losses](https://fortune.com/2018/08/03/okex-losses-among-counter-parties/) took place on that contract, (3) the run to 14k and (4) now.  These periods of excitement tend to align with the expiration of the quarterly futures. For example last Summer the quarterly expired on June 14th and the volume immediately dropped and never really recovered.

It is unclear to me if this means up or down, but I am wondering if we will soon see a blow-off-top in the implied lending rate of the OKEx future and if their volume will die off once this march 27th contract expires.",2020-02-12 08:59:30

&gt; His innovation is blocked.

&gt; Then, his own bicycle.

You can't blame Amaury, or any other Bitcoin Cash developer, for having to fork Bitcoin to bigger blocks. That's on BTC Core's refusal to scale.

Bitcoin Cash isn't someone's ""own bicycle"". It was a huge group effort by devs, miners, exchanges, wallet / app devs, etc.

---

You see a pattern of endless forks due to developers.

But developers alone cannot create a successful fork. There must be a huge community need and economic pressure or at least incentive for it to result in a persistent, valuable coin.

See BCD and endless other forks of Bitcoin - many probably created by teams for hire just to sow confusion shortly after the time of the Bitcoin Cash fork. Where are they now? Bottom of the bargain bin.

The market doesn't follow our time preference. It can stay irrational longer than many of us can stay solvent. None of that means forks are useless.

Without them, Bitcoin would already be deader than a dodo because instead of creating Bitcoin Cash, we would've all left to go elsewhere - if there had been a better alternative.

In one hand you have slightly worse market prices, on the other you have to deal with several fees and exchange rates before even starting to buy ADA.

fhilft3,Academic_Crypto,19,"I just want to give a run-down on what happened in the market in the last half day or so. I didn't read this whole thread so there is a chance someone else already caught it, but in case they didn't here is my take.

About half a day ago BTCUSD pushed to $10,500ish, a lot of alt-coins were having some pretty big rallies, and a large player on BitMEX tried to short the top. They started with a few 5M market sells to create momentum and then a steady stream of smaller market sells for about 3 hours. In the following [(Image)](https://imgur.com/S24amZK) we can see that Open Interest (OI) and Open Value (OV) spiked a lot during this dump to \~$10,100. The reason for this is that the selling was entirely new short contracts opening while the buying side was a combination of shorts closing and longs opening resulting in a net positive increase in OI and OV. 

Now lets shift gears and look at OKEx. I found a great plot of the BTC Basis of the OKEx quarterly future over the last few years [(Image)](https://imgur.com/LFPDZNo). This plot is showing the price of Bitcoin on the left-y-axis and the premium of the quarterly futures contract on the right-y-axis in USD. What you can see is that in the past few weeks, that futures contract has sustained a premium higher than it has ever had before by a very wide margin, being 5-10x higher than it has been in the past on average. Another thing that makes this so significant is that the premium of the futures contract represents a price of borrowing money from the current time until the contract expiration, and so if the borrowing rate is constant,  the **premium should decrease linearly** as the expiration of the contract draws closer, but this particular quarterly futures has been **growing linearly** which implies that **the borrowing rate has been increasing quadratically**. This is an [(Image)](https://imgur.com/5bCOiyU) of this value that I calculated explicitly for the last few months using 4-hour time windows which clearly shows this parabolic trend. OKEx futures are also hitting record open values according to this [(Image)](https://imgur.com/eRTio1U) and have been hitting new highs every day. 

Now getting back to the recent price action. OKEx has been running this market for the past few months, and when a price movement has been initiated by BitMEX it has generally failed unless OKEx and other asian exchanges such as Huobi and Binance were in agreement. The large short by BitMEX was no different. After the short position was opened on BitMEX, OKEx drove the price back up and caused the shorter to cover [(Image)](https://imgur.com/S24amZK) around $10,250, driving the price back up to $10,500 which was probably break-even for the shorter. Once OKEx bullied this BitMEX guy out of his short, they closed their long [(Image)](https://imgur.com/1dDG0Hl) which dropped the OV on the quarterly future from about 76,500 BTC to 70,000 BTC and traded 9.5k BTC in contracts in just under 3 minutes. Notice how the volume traded on OKEx was very different between the first and second dump where the first dump was mostly arbitraged to them from the BitMEX selling and the second dump was initiated by sellers on that product. Not shown is that open value was stable on the first dump for OKEx and dropped on the second whereas open value increased on BitMEX for the first dump and was stable on the second. 

What I take away from this is that OKEx has probably been a huge factor in the market pumping in the last few months, and this is the first sign I have seen of open value decreasing there, or significant selling coming from there. If OKEx stops buying and switches to taking profits then I suspect this is the top. Their quarterly futures contract is still incredibly over extended and near all-time-highs in a number of scary metrics including BTC Basis and Open Value.",2020-02-14 05:50:43

fhj0uom,micropresident,7,"&gt;Regardless of the hard work done by  members of BU to create useful software for Bitcoin Cash, and its  continued commitment towards peer-to-peer electronic cash for the past 5  years, ABC will unfortunately never allow any of BU‚Äôs work to go into  the BCH protocol willingly.

This is your assertion, and it doesn't match reality.  It is very much invalidated by nChain getting multiple proposals in, as well as Mark Lunderberg getting his proposals in. Tobias Ruck just landed a proposal in the ABC code base. Additionally, the SegWit recovery patch was landed by another third party.One BU change was landed under a name that more closely matches the rest of the opcodes (OP\_CHECKDATASIG)

1. OP\_DATASIGVERIFY Andrew Stone was invited to review and participate in the specification for OP\_CDS. Instead, he refused to participate and chose to ignore the very real and reasonable feedback he was given by Amaury, Chris Pacia, and Clemens Ley. OP\_CDS was ultimately landed and was based on Andrew's work.  He could have been a co-author on the spec but he refused to participate.

The rest of the BU proposals can be dismissed almost immediately as making no technical sense:

1. Extensible Script doesn't make any sense due to needing to hash the unrolled script at every node to verify the TxID.
2. OP\_UNIQUE provides no value as a consensus level change.  This can be done off-chain indexing service.  There's no point in excluding transactions with a particular set of data if you index only the first transaction that contains it.
3. OP\_GROUP was reviewed multiple times as well, and is a very specific solution to a very general problem.  OP\_CDS has opened up more options for this than OP\_GROUP did.  What remains is to test larger scriptSig limits and push limits -- but nobody has taken the effort.  If that were done, real, miner-verified, tokens might be a reality on BCH.

&gt;Secondly, BitcoinABC does not take a collaborative approach to  development. All decisions and features are dictated by BitcoinABC.

Real world evidence contradicts this assertion, as given above.  Bitcoin-ABC has no obligation to include ridiculous proposals in its codebase.  What's interesting is that you are tacitly asserting that Bitcoin-ABC has control over the BCH protocol.  How is that possible?

&gt;Through its financial strategy  Bitcoin Unlimited has been able to maintain its independence and  financial sustainability and has therefore remained in a strong position  to support Bitcoin Cash. BU‚Äôs officials and membership have continually  made good decisions that have allowed BU to provide long-term support  for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

Bitcoin Unlimited's contribution to Bitcoin Cash has been a net negative.  I started participating in Bitcoin Cash development around August 10th of 2017 after the split.  I had no opinion of any actors in this space.  As soon as I got involved it was clear that Tom Harding, Andrew Stone, Thomas Zander were toxic and spiteful, but it was unclear to me why.  As I learned the history of the big block movement it became clear what was going on.  They were red with jealousy over the fact that Amaury Sechet had accomplished what they could not -- **a functioning hard fork**.  This cohort of individuals are the lead developers of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic respectively.

They have repeatedly done everything in their power to tear Bitcoin ABC and Amaury down over the last 3 years.  When called out, they deny, attack, and reverse the role of victim and offender.  This article is another example of the leadership of Bitcoin Unlimited having a victim mentality.

But what exactly are they a victim of? They have, by their own admission, more BCH than any other development team (despite having only the negative contribution of wasting other people's time and creating controversy).

Reading between the lines here, I believe Craig may be expecting some trouble ahead for himself legally as the ""Issuer"" of Bitcoin. He mentions ""whatever happens to me"" in this article and this also appears to be a common theme within his Coingeek China conference video.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClANV8QAeQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClANV8QAeQw)

He makes a number of references to Ghandi, Rosa Parkes and Mandela among others - the common thread being people who have been imprisoned for their beliefs/actions and for trying to bring about a better World - I believe Craig may be a similar case.

If you consider that he originally avoided being associated with being the ""Issuer"", by using a pseudonym for years (probably because of legal implications for being a money issuer) then it makes sense.

Craig only came out as Satoshi when he absolutely had to - due to the protocol having become bastardised by others. This would also explain his reticence to come forward and his hesitation around the time of the signings - he was basically forced into a corner. This also suggests what he was likely being blackmailed about around the same time.

It looks to me that Craig has now definitively faced the threats and slurs in order to bring about his vision of a better World......whatever the personal cost, even if it endangers his own personal freedom.

No, he won't give up his bus seat!, No he won't bow down to bullying and threats!

The last thing you wanna do is lose the majority of your money.

A couple of things to keep in mind when/if you begin trading:

\-The market is very fair and usually the trades that *can* have a ridiculously high return rate typically are more risky and have a lower probability of success. While trades that yield a lower rate of return *typically* have a higher probability of success.

\- Fully understand how to manage risk aka don't make a trade where if it goes wrong you lose $100+ in a $500 account. Keep your loses small.

\- Keep in mind the word I said a few times in the first point; *probability.* It's all probabilities, there's no such thing as a guaranteed 100% winning trade. Sometimes you'll have an A+ set-up and things just go against you. It happens. So that's why you have to know how to manage your risk.

\- Spend as much time as you can learning how to manage risk. I've mentioned it this many times, because learning how to ***lose*** is the most important thing when it comes to trading. How much are you willing to lose per trade? How much are you willing to lose per day? Per week? It's a business and winning won't put you out of business, but losing will. You need to know your risk tolerance and how to properly lose without it driving you crazy emotionally or putting your account out of business.",2020-02-17 15:00:01

fhwfcno,iamDanger_us,7,"Yes this is a scam. If you try to withdraw the bitcoin the site will tell you that you have to deposit a smaller amount to meet a minimum withdrawal threshold. You send the money and then it belongs to the scammer. There are 5-10 posts like this here every day. You probably should not have used your real email address, but worst case you might get targeted with more phishing attacks now.

&gt;not my real password (it does share numerical value with other pws i use though)

Don't use the same password for any two sites. Don't even have passwords that share common elements between those two sites. Implement a password manager (like lastpass, onepassword, or bitwarden) so that you can have strong, unique passwords for every service you use.

I understand what it's like to be strapped for money, but definitely keep your wits about you. Most people don't just give away anything that valuable *through unsolicited slack/discord/telegram/twitter/whatever messages*.

Edit: I missed that you uploaded copies of your ID. **You might want to sign up for identity theft monitoring.** If you can't afford that, you can contact all three major credit bureaus in the US and request that they freeze your credit so that nobody (including you) can open new accounts. The downside is it's an extra step to undo the next time you go to get credit somewhere (and you have to put the freeze back in place, etc).",2020-02-17 13:36:55
fhvkvkx,itsmyst,7,"These types of ""mistakes"" seem so seductive with present knowledge.

It's complete crap in my opinion.

It's the same difference like that story that comes around every time bitcoin hits a new high. The guy who spent X millions worth in bitcoin to buy a pizza. If only he'd had held on to those bitcoin's - he'd be set for life! Certainly he wouldn't have sold when bitcoin hit $1, or $10, or $100, or $10,000....

Between 2013 and today Netflix stock has made COUNTLESS new highs. Sure maybe if you didn't sell when you did you would have held on a little bit longer...but it's 99.9% certain you still would have sold it for a comparatively crappy price compared with n Netflix's present day valuation.",2020-02-17 09:13:36

fhw4c1y,nullc,7,"By taking a bunch of money, stashing it in a competing cryptocurrency to insulate it from their failure to perform, and then just slowly funnelling it into their pockets BU poisoned the well for that kind of funding.

You don't think that most people who gave funds to BU for development wouldn't rather have given it to ABC now that BU is doing almost no development and arguing that none is needed because Bitcoin was essentially done when it was first released?

What's to stop ABC from doing the same if they're given a lump sum?",2020-02-17 11:20:48
fhwijqp,landmindboom,6,"Unless crypto, as whole, goes away... It's a virtual certainty that 2017 will look like a little bump before the real spike.

Look at the trading volumes since then. Think of all the new exchanges. Think of how much easier it is to buy and trade since then. I can buy BTC on the same site I buy stocks now...

Every day, boomers retire/die and millennials enter the investment world. Every day, the world gets more and more fed up with the ""establishment"" banking/finance/monetary system.

This is a world where Uber became the biggest taxi company without owing a taxi. Tesla grew to a larger market cap than Ford and GM combined in a few years (based on largely speculation about what they *will* become). 

The investment world is **hungry** for new tech investments and **just waiting** for an extended stall or drop on Wall Street to have the motivation to move to crypto.

I predict a big recession is coming. And when it does, Bitcoin can legitimately get to $100K+ very quickly, carrying with it a bunch of top 100 alt coins big gains.

The stock market can't grow like this forever. And it's continued growth is the only reason I'm not 100% in on crypto. (I'm not alone.)",2020-02-17 14:21:56

Someone super rich like Nick Belziran brings 100k and he expects it to be seized.

So he insures the money or something from federal theft

Then he takes it through the airport and documents the process.

It would be great if he could legally destroy it somehow via remote means so if/when it is taken, no one can benefit from it (but destruction of federal notes is a crime, but something analogous to a cashier's check, or an actual bitcoin).

fhwh6r6,nodecache,6,"The key, I maintain, to what's happening, is btc.d and the multiyear trendline of support that was breached almost two weeks ago.  In a real bear market, bitcoin thrives on a relative basis and alts get slaughtered.  Decent argument that there's a leg of prehalving bitcoin movement that slaughters alts too, my assertion is that that is what already happened in late 2019.  If I'm right about us being past that stage, btc.d will continue to trend down and we'll see more price action that looks like early 2017.  

Right now we've got 3 sizable green candles pushing btc.d back up towards the two year trendline.  Not really surprising since there were like two straight weeks of red candles before that.  The question we might get to test soon if more green candles appear is: has old support become new resistance?  Will btc.d bounce down from that trendline?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/JLcsa8jG/

If that resistance holds, I don't care what's happening with fiat, AFAIC, we're in for a good year.  btc.d being down isn't some universal good thing, but at this stage of the cycle, it is, for the entire market including bitcoin.  It's just at that place in the circle of life where the whole ecosystem benefits from some leadership churn.  If that resistance doesn't hold, then my theory is crap.",2020-02-17 14:02:02

The same way you find anything in normal life.  By looking around.

I'm guessing you're very young, and maybe only ever had authoritarian institutions taking care of your needs?  That sort of upbringing really seems to have infantalized a whole generation.  You can't even date without some app spoon feeding you pretty pictures, right?

I'm from Generation X, one of the DIY generations, where we rejected centralized corporations and governments, and figured out how to do our own thing, independently.  We formed interest groups and used those to help us all find what we needed.

If you want to trade Bitcoin, find a Bitcoin group in your area, or online.  Or just ask around in whatever communication venues you normally use.

Or just sell something and ask for Bitcoin.

This is what Bitcoin is made for.

If you want centralized babysitting, then stick with national currencies which have normal banks that can help you do all this.",2020-02-18 02:13:26
fhxnke4,Big_Bubbler,1,"   
   My first impression is that monetizing protocol development is not the same as monetizing projects built on top. [Bitcoin.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=lbaqmB7JK9t246H6AYo60CFyv7J8MTU4MjA0MzQwN0AxNTgxOTU3MDA3&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoin.com%2F&amp;stzid=UgzwflxZz3HSXqnMcYJ4AaABAg&amp;event=comments) is a business. ABC is a non-profit team trying to make peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people. I think that's the priority and further delays on the ability to scale for massive worldwide adoption (go viral) may have tragic results if we get the chance to do that and we are not ready.  

 I think Roger may have said he thinks we have been progressing on protocol development fast enough? If so, I heartily disagree. We are moving so slowly we may miss the window of opportunity, I do not care if ABC does the code work, but, I think we need scaling (massive) sooner rather than years later.  

If anyone wanted to fund ABC or any node it would have been easy without the need to use a censorship-based platform like Patreon. They have options out there.  

I love Roger and know he generally means well. He has a business and maybe he has to protect that by avoiding too much controversy, but, he consistently fails to stand up for Bitcoin when it is under attack by one of these community splitting social engineering attacks until it is too late for his support to be much help at keeping the community together. Luckily C Wright wrote him a nasty letter before the BSV fork that eventually made his decision easier that time.  I

 do agree the process is horrible and Amaury should not be choosing who gets funding. I do not think the limited funding should go to BU or [Bitcoin.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=lbaqmB7JK9t246H6AYo60CFyv7J8MTU4MjA0MzQwN0AxNTgxOTU3MDA3&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoin.com%2F&amp;stzid=UgzwflxZz3HSXqnMcYJ4AaABAg&amp;event=comments) or any business that is already monetized. I think we need it for protocol development. After we pretty much finish the protocol, if miners still want to donate their rewards, we could support things on top of the underlying infrastructure. I also think we should have more accounting and accountability. So, ya, this plan sucks, but, it is better than no plan and the opposition has no better plan yet. 

 BCH is under attack from anti-Bitcoin forces all the time. They see this issue as a major opportunity and we need to get the community together to stand up to the attack fork they are currently developing. They will have plenty of miner support from miners pretending to be pro-BCH miners and they will pretend their fork is the real Bitcoin as they always do.   

If they get their way we will split and/or we will block BCH miners from being able to work as a group to automate donations to the developers. Remember, this is BCH-Miners trying to donate to BCH developers. It is not a great or total solution, but, people who oppose miners donating to developers need to rethink why they are doing that. This is the miners money and they should be allowed to donate it as they see fit. 

I also want to add that I think this needs to be voluntary for the BCH miners. I agree a vote will be gamed. I think creating mining pools specifically created or designated as volunteering to donate would allow the pro BCH miners to vote by joining the pools. If there is enough of them to mine BCH without help, the vote succeeds and those pools donate. Miners can come and go if they don't like how their donations are getting spent.",2020-02-18 01:52:08

fi4nfm6,TheQuaffle,3,"Some interesting crypto history for anyone who wasn't around back then. Back in 2013, there was a whale who would post on major bitcoin forums all the time. He used it as a way to manipulate the markets. He would say stuff like ""Hey, I'm about to pump 5% on Mt. Gox.""

He did it over and over, posting screenshots for truth. Every time, the manipulations got a little more extreme. ""At 13:22 GMT, I will pull the 2k BTCUSD wall"". Stuff like that. Made people lots of money.

On BTC Pizza Day, 2013, the whale announced his biggest plan yet. He was going to open a 14k BTC short in anticipation of a big BCore announcement he had insider information about. Further, he said he was working with a Mt. Gox insider to cause a short term flash crash to $212/BTC. Turns out he had quite a following, because literally thousands of people sold and set their new limit orders to 212. It was quite a meme number back then. One poster called bullshit. Everyone hated on the poor dude for days. It got so bad that he was literally banned from a couple forums for saying that there wouldn't be a flash crash.

Well it turns out the whale *did* have an insider contact. That's a story for another time. The short version is that he used his contact to do the exact opposite of what he said. He knew he could manufacture a short squeeze and used all the good will and trust he had built with the community to pull off the heist. He bought everyone's selling as the price dipped 10%. Then he set off a buying cycle that liquidated millions of dollars of shorts. Literally millions. It was the second biggest change of crypto capital until the ICO boom. (The first biggest of course was the Mt. Gox hack).

Analytics years later showed that over 98% of Mt. Gox users lost at least 10% of their stack, and 20% lost everything. Only a handful of people profited, including the whale, a few insiders, and the one man who was banned from the forums for his skepticism. That one guy ended up quadruppling his stack through contrarian trading, outperforming even the whale over the next few months. That user's name? Vitalik Buterin.",2020-02-20 05:38:23

fi4xtw2,what_mustache,2,"\&gt; If Bitcoin replaced the whole worlds central banking system, it would use wayyyyyyy less electricity, and would also have no employees 

Wow, this is just really, really wrong.  Does bitcoin offer mortgages?  Small business loans?  Financial services?  ATMs?  Can a poor person without a phone and dataplan walk into a grocery store and pay for food with bitcoin?  No.   Bitcoin cant possibly replace the world's banks.   

And the part of the banks that store monetary value uses a fraction of power of bitcoin.  The fact is that banks have incentives to use less power.  **Bitcoin's value is built on power consumption**. It's exactly the opposite of being green.

 \&gt; There‚Äôd be no bank collapses because bitcoin is less of a Fiat currency then pretty much every other paper currency in existence 

This is also fucking stupid.  Bitcoin's stability has been a fucking joke.  And how many times have we heard about some bitcoin wallet getting hacked?  And in the US we have the FDIC.  Banks collapsing isnt exactly an issue we deal with day to day, and the dollar is so much more stable than bitcoin that you cant compare the two.  And fiat currency has the advantage of being smoothed out by monetary policy to balance out swings in the economy.

fi8gh42,nodecache,2,"Posts like this are my least favorite part of ethereumland.  There's no real need to manufacture rivalry and hostility between btc and eth, they have different lanes, they could even be friends.  But instead of mocking the tiny number of big name bitcoin maxis for not understanding that, more and more people around here just want to act like them and become ethereum maxis.  It doesn't really affect either coins' utility (for now), but it's making these communities far less bearable (which could eventually impair network effect, something both btc and ethereum have done fantastic jobs at building).  I come here a lot more often than go to bitcoinland, but I do wonder for how much longer that will be true.  

Money is, and has always been, trust (not in 3rd parties in this case, but trust in a system to deliver predictable results) and memory.  Bitcoin excels at both.  It's never going to be a decentralized global supercomputer, which is great, that means that lane is clear for eth.  But not everything needs to be a decentralized global supercomputer.  Gold's mcap is bigger than MS/Google/Amazon combined (for now), not just google cloud/azure/aws, but all the diverse businesses under the same companies too.  And gold is pretty hard to own in some parts of the world, so digital gold's global value could be much higher.  

&gt; And before anyone even thinks of trotting out the ""digital gold"" and ""store of value"" schticks ... üôÑ ... please go ahead and point me to the location(s) in the Bitcoin Whitepaper where the phrases ""digital gold"" and/or ""store of value"" are used.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll wait...

Oh noes! if it's not in the whitepaper, I guess we can't use it that way... because... why?  Bitcoin is permissionless, you can use it anyway you want to.  Online poker isn't in the whitepaper either.  

But yeah, hey, let's pit he two biggest crypto communities against each other, because that won't hurt the decentralization revolution at all.  Why waste our time trying to grow the pie and eat away at wall street's sphere of influence when we could fight each other to the death over the current slices?",2020-02-21 08:04:40
fi7xqbd,Peter__R,2,"With BCH maturing, I would _love_ to see more of the ideas we're exploring written up as complete papers, put through an academic peer review process, and then published in an archival scholarly journal.  

- The number of people following GitHub repos, private Telegram channels, or this subreddit is small.  There is an entire world out there ready to get more involved in bitcoin R&amp;D but they don't even know where to look.  Peer-reviewed papers that turn up on university library or Google Scholar searches become ""hooks"" to bring new people in.

- The publishing process acts as a quality control filter.  A paper published in a peer-reviewed academic journal comes with a sort of ""stamp of approval"" that, while no guarantee that the content is correct, crazy ideas and low-quality work are filtered, and published material is framed in a scholarly context and with relevant citations.

- Writing a complete paper forces the author to convincingly explain the background around their idea and the motivation behind it.   The background, motivation and related work is usually ""obvious"" to the developers working most closely on a given topic and so in their less formal communication it is often omitted.  But this makes it difficult for people less in-the-know to understand why certain decisions were made and what's been tried before.  In other words, formal published papers creates a useful documentation trial.

- Increases the credibility of the work.

- University publishers have mature processes so that papers don't get lost.

A good example of a topic that more people should be writing papers on is difficulty adjustment algorithms (DAAs).  Tom Harding recently wrote a paper on his real-time targeting (RTT) idea (https://github.com/chain2/chain2/blob/master/specifications/rtt.pdf) which will be published in Ledger along with the transparent peer-review in the next few weeks.   Tom's is a great example of the type of paper I'd love to see more of.  It describes the problem with traditional DAAs in the presence of a changing hash rate thereby motivating his solution, and then it gives a clear presentation of his idea so that other people can reason about it and discuss. The paper then serves as a stepping stone for further work on the topic.  

I know there is active work being done on a new non-RTT DAA for BCH.  It would be wonderful to get that work written up in a paper of equal quality, allowing a greater number of people, if not to get involved, at least to understand the problem, the background around it, and so feel they have a stake in its solution.  Slowing down a bit to carefully write up our ideas and put them through peer review will help take BCH to the next level.",2020-02-21 05:19:19

I have never met a money launderer, I've never met a someone I suspect to be a money launderer. The number of people that have enough money for KYC to matter is diminishingly small compared to those that are just average folk. Even fewer are actual crim/drug/warlords.

The only measurable impact is the inconvenience it adds for the swathes and swathes of regular people just going about their lives.

Regulation is only a good thing if it protects consumers, this kind of regulation already exists.

fig5wsy,tim0901,9,"&gt;He's no expert on blockchain.

No, but even without being one he's able to easily show why electronic voting is a terrible idea.

&gt;As to answer your anonymity question you can do some form of zkp or other privacy protocols to anonymize voting.

Which people who aren't incredibly knowledgeable about cybersecurity won't understand, removing trust of the system.

&gt;dont trust blockchain. You verify.

You have to trust the system in an election. That's the point. And if you are able to verify that the system is trustworthy and entering votes as people intend, then the votes being cast are clearly not anonymous.

&gt;For average user a block explorer/UI that shows a ""you have voted X candidate with your key"" is enough .

Such an explorer would have the same trust issues - how do we know it is accurately showing what is in that blockchain, and not just what it claims to have put in there? And being able to find your vote in that blockchain and verify it's integrity defeats the anonymity of the election.

&gt;Attacking a big blockchain (i guess  you mean 51% attacks) is financial suicide otherwise bitcoin/ethereum  would have been 51%  attacked everyday.

Bitcoin/etherium have far less money riding on them than an election of a big country. A 51% attack on the US presidential election would be worth trillions of dollars, far more than the entire net value of all cryptocurrencies in existence.

Besides, there are far easier attacks you can make on bitcoin than this, like hacking the exchanges and stealing people's wallets, and the exact same is true for an election blockchain. The use of blockchain does absolutely nothing to improve the security of the overall system, because there are far easier attack vectors to choose from. It's like installing a $1M lock on your front door, only to leave the window next to it wide open.",2020-02-23 03:33:09

Fuck you, Haartz, and to hell with your paywall. If you don't want it read except by subscribers, don't put it online. Simple.

Rant (I have to say this every time because there's always ""that guy"" who yammers about ""you just want it for free""):

Internet advertising often contains malware and malicious redirects. Even YouTube ads have been known to contain bitcoin miners. No ad can be considered safe. You should use ad blockers and Google cache to avoid internet ads. THIS IS NOT THEFT. This is reasonable and prudent action you should take to keep your devices safe. 

Content creators will not try to protect you from the ads they serve. They claim they can't, but that's only because they don't want to try. They (and their shills!) will at the same time *expect* you to compromise your security for their dollar. That *is* unreasonable and you should *not* accept it. Use an ad blocker like ublock origin and adblock plus, and never whitelist a site (even to support the content creators) unless you absolutely must in order to use its functionality and are locked in to that specific site.

Again, ad blockers are not theft. Neither is using Google cache. Hacking is a crime, though, and if we aren't going to hold content creators responsible for the damage malicious code in the ads they serve can do, we owe it to ourselves to prevent it in any way we can.",2020-02-23 11:07:59

fihczkr,kobeee,5,"To just get a baseline understanding of Blockchain and Cryptography, I really like Dan Boneh. He's a professor at Stanford and has a lot of lectures on Youtube that help breakdown everything. He also has an online PDF that is the first part of his 'course' on Cryptography - http://toc.cryptobook.us/book.pdf

When I first invested in early 2017, I definitely just jumped in hoping for some gains and was adding coins to my portfolio left and right trying to chase gains. As I did that though, I educated myself on Cryptography and Blockchain in general and tried to understand the history of Bitcoin and how it came about. Once I had a baseline understanding of all of that it was much easier to read whitepapers and different articles on Cryptos and understand what their goal was. 

I've consolidated since then and only hold 6 coins right now, but my main source of information is the internet. I'll start off on reddit or youtube and I listen to what people have to say and from there I take it into my own hands. I read any articles I can find to see what progress each team is making and how practical or likely it is that they actually reach their end goal and what the chances of adoption are. 

The emotions that come from market fluctuation are very real. There are times when a coin I own pumps and I feel vindicated and want to put my whole life savings in it and there are times when a coin dumps and I start to doubt all of my research. But at the end of the day if you put the time into understanding this space and what you're investing in, you should be confident in your investments. With how I believe this space will evolve over the next decade, even if only two of my coins succeed, it should cancel out all the losses from my other investments. I hold for the long term and try not to worry about short term fluctuation. I was lucky enough to make good money by investing before the bull run towards the end of 2017, but lost a lot during the bear market. I just kept DCAing and now with the resurgence of the market, I've slowly started climbing back into the positive.

fik4rkz,recycled_ideas,1,"Yes, depending on the bank, and the amount of money, and the jurisdiction anyway.

It's kind of hard to store large quantities of money onshore though, and storing money in a tax haven is pretty difficult for an average person, which means that these enterprises tend to work in cash or sometimes bitcoin.

Now the problem you've got is that you've got money, but if you spend any of it on anything big someone is going to ask you where you got it from.

So you need a way to earn money that appears legit. That you can pay taxes on, and show to any inconvenient federal or state investigators.

Traditionally this was done with low yield cash only businesses with limited paper trail. Laundromats were a favourite because so long as you make sure you actually use an appropriate amount of water and electricity there's nothing tying the money to a particular customer.

You then have a business income that you can declare and pay taxes on and most importantly spend.

In the modern electronic world, this is a bit more difficult and Kickstarter probably actually has enough protections in place that it might be too difficult to actually do, but that's the general principle.

You take money you earned in a way you can't admit and convert it to the proceeds of a ""legitimate"" business.",2020-02-24 00:45:32

fik5m3z,Amichateur,1,"&gt;But here is why I think Bitcoin has another flaw

So why?

&gt;long term it will get harder to get people interested in it, always at the start there are the people who flood in but getting more in constantly gets a lot harder.

Still waiting for the ""Why""...

&gt;As I‚Äôve said value in Bitcoin isn‚Äôt difficult to understand you can say what it can do but the question always is is it doing those things on a level that makes it certain to succeed and IMO it‚Äôs not.

Still waiting for the ""Why""...         (expressing a belief or opinion w/o reason is not ""why"" but ""what"" - it is religion.)

&gt;Also I believe

Still waiting for the ""Why""...         
(a belief is not an explanation for a belief)

&gt;from the past based on speculation Bitcoin is an echo bubble economy

oh a new word....

&gt; driven mainly by large wallet holders and not utility or new members,

... you believe...

&gt;and sure the prices will rise, sure we will have FOMO, sure people will get rich as long as they have enough BTC but the market will go repeating price collapses and for a currency to work it has to have faith and the more price bubbles and collapses occur the less likely new people will enter.

So you ""think"" Bitcoin has another flaw ""because"" you have various ""beliefs"". Sorry, but this is ""not convincing"" to put it moderately.

As long as you don't realize it, you are the one lying to yourself. You should think pragmatically and leave your ideologies alone.

Hint: Bitcoin has continuously become less and less volatile, and this trend is going to continue. You seem to have missed that, too. But your ""beliefs"" are too strong I guess.

&gt;You show me an economy that runs without debt

Most economies until 19th century. Long time civilized mankind used gold based, not debt based, currencies.

Plus the micro-economy in the ""Wunder von W√∂rgl"" in Austria that worked well before it was declared illegal by the bank and debt based system.

&gt;in fact you show me a person who has no debt.

I know many individuals without any debt, incl. myself. And I never had. And I am not from a rich family at all. I am very surprised about your question. You really have a very biased, ideologically backward directed and clised view of reality.

&gt;This is one of the biggest jokes about Bitcoin people blame banks and the system but forget no system is perfect

How is irrational behaviour of some people a proof that Bitcoin cannot work? You are completely illogical and mix everything together!

&gt; and they forget they also have debt otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be trying to get rich quick with Bitcoin.

Again completely wrong, see above.

So all you have proven here - and this very convincingly - is just how baseless all of your points are. Thanks for this eye-opening comment!

&gt;So yes I think a deflationary society would lead to a dystopian society.

Why ""So""? ""So"" is what you say after having given an argument. You did not. You just expressed your baseless beliefs, one after another. Do not think you get away with this cheap trick - not all people here are that stupid.",2020-02-24 00:54:53

&gt;After [the halving event](https://cryptopress.news/returns-on-bitcoin-may-be-100-in-2020-without-considering-halving/), Bitcoin is going to witness a 50% reduction in supply.

They worded it more accurately in the following paragraph:  

&gt;...the [May halving](https://cryptopress.news/bitcoin-halving-will-it-save-prices-in-2020/) would reduce annual supply inflation from a rate of 3.7% to 1.8%.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful.  The ""supply"" of Bitcoins could mean the total number of Bitcoins mined at this point in time.  The ""supply"" could also be used in the context of ""supply and demand"" where supply refers to Bitcoins that people are wishing to sell at that point in time.  

Then we have the **rate at which new Bitcoins are being mined**, on average.  This ***rate*** is a number of Bitcoins per unit of time.  This ***rate*** is going to be cut in half.  Not the ""supply"" nor the ""supply"" -- the rate.

fikc945,queenofmoons,1,"Well, Freecloud is officially the Crypto-Libertarian Pseudorepublic of Freecloud, and so I think can be firmly assumed to be outside of Earth's fully automated luxury space communism system, and that people there can spend whatever they like, assuming someone else will take it. 

The whole money/no money thing is kind of fraught. I like it in the setting because it's a big play that the future is different, and that a major way of conceiving of the world, and the anxieties it creates, is simply absent. But then comes the part where you have to imagine what that actually looks like outside of the confines of a government starship, where money *already* doesn't have much use, you run into the fact that currency is so useful that even the most aggressively centrally planned command economies have always made use of it, and even plans to produce Star Trek-esque social cornucopias, like the work of the Soviet, Nobel Prize-winning economist Leonid Kantorovich, had a role for money and prices. 

Which doesn't mean that heterodox economists haven't envisioned *really weird* currencies- expiring currencies and currencies backed by some prosocial activity or baskets of currencies that are used in different classes of transactions- to try and take advantage of the fact that money itself is deeply weird, being a dimensionless token of collective trust. And it's totally possible that 300 years of work on the subject could get you to a place where whatever weird accounting units are passed around are so peculiar, and so divorced from daily experience, that it seems sensible to say that the Federation, or Earth, or whatever, doesn't use money.

But it's easy to imagine that that doesn't preclude a *person* from having money, and from some people engaging in activities that tend to need it or going places where it is preferred. Kim Stanley Robinson has talked about 'capitalism at the margins', where a utopian economic system would keep the well-being of people and biosphere far from the exploitative grasp of market robber, but if people want to play the capitalism game by betting on asteroid futures or whatever, well, have fun- just don't be expecting that you'll be able to use the proceeds to privatize a health care system or that we won't tax the bejeezus out of you if you start buying up all the hasperat in the Bajor sector and actual sentients are going hungry. Maybe that's just accounted for latinum, fungible across polities for the same reasons gold was, or maybe there is a Federation credit, but a Federation credit is more like a bitcoin than a dollar- that is to say, rare and weird and not useful for very much...

...unless you're outside the cornucopia, like the Fenris Rangers, and expecting to having drawing privileges on the Federation Santa Claus machines is unlikely...

...or if you're a person who just *doesn't like when the world works that way*. Here on Earth, we have people who imagine (threaten?) they're going to live on glorified oil rigs if someone dares to suggest a national health service or some monopoly pruning, and presumably some of those fortunes and adherents of those philosophies found somewhere to fly off to.",2020-02-24 02:06:09

There is no connection at all between market price and value provided in Bitcoin. It is 99.9% speculation. In fact, all the metrics show that use of Bitcoin has gone down over time.

Of course, anyone can sue at any time for any reason-- it doesn't have to be valid to waste a lot of your time and money.  Besides, Craig is already slinging threats that the existence of Bitcoin is something he can and will litigate. Saying nothing won't guarantee safety for Gavin-- though this further highlights the conflict of interests this situation has created: Economically, ""Wright won't sue me if I say nothing"" and ""Wright will pay me to say nothing"" are pretty much equivalent.

In my view, ethical conduct requires that whenever someone makes a public endorsement of something at that moment they also create an implicit obligation to make an equally public and equally effective withdrawal of that endorsement-- and whatever consequences go with doing so-- if the situation or their understanding changes.   If they don't want to deal with the risk that a vexatious @#$@-head might engage in spurious litigation when an endorsement is retracted-- then they must not make the endorsement in the first place!

It might be scary, embarrassing, and frustrating to have to pull an endorsement but thems the breaks.

A couple months back, because Andreas reported getting invited to get see Craigs' proof and that there was an NDA, I wrote him and asked if he would mind sharing it with me-- specifically because I was interested if there was anything in it that might be keeping people like Gavin silent. Andreas responded and said he couldn't discuss it at that time, then followed up a few weeks later pointing to his testimony in the Kleiman case... so apparently that's why he can't comment on it.

fiv3cxj,Tricky_Troll,14,"I‚Äôd just like to share something I posted in response to a comment further down this thread. It‚Äôs my thoughts about current price action in response to someone with a bearish outlook and a little advice for any newcomers and some general advice. Also, I know my writing isn‚Äôt as articulate as others in this sub like DC but here goes anyway:

I‚Äôm not totally convinced. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I see where you‚Äôre coming from and like your reasoning here but for me there‚Äôs just one major issue for me which makes me skeptical of this. I‚Äôm talking about the halvening/ETH 2.0 ü•ì chain launch. Now many people might say ‚Äúthe halvening is priced in‚Äù whatever the üê¨ that means. But I disagree. The halvening changes the fundamental supply and demand of bitcoin. With equal demand and half the supply of freshly mined (and usually immediately sold) bitcoin means that the price must go up in response. Now sure, the price may rise before the halvening due to hype making the resulting pump from a supply and demand shift less significant since it was already ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù (I assume that‚Äôs what people mean by that). But the price hasn‚Äôt doubled in the 6 months going up to the halvening and that‚Äôs what‚Äôll be needed to offset the change in supply and demand when it comes. So expecting the price to drop before then is a bit crazy IMO. 

*Side note: Many people say that if the price of BTC is below X when the halvening kicks in then miners will stop mining because they are unprofitable and the chain will die in a death spiral as miners cant mine profitably so they stop mining/sell bitcoin to offset costs resulting in a further price drop and so on. This is üêÆüí© as the mining difficulty will adjust and there will always be someone who has super cheap power (I was mining ETH for free for a while in my university dorm since we didn‚Äôt pay for power!)*

On top of the bitcoin halvening price action, I think that ETH‚Äôs ratio gains will continue as ü•ìchain and ü•©ing is on the horizon. Especially considering it will come shortly after the halvening, I think we‚Äôll be stealing some of bitcoin‚Äôs thunder.

Now this is not to say that I think the price can only go up. Quite the opposite, short to mid term price movement will continue to be an enigma which nobody can accurately predict. However, I do think that macro trends can be predicted with a reasonable level of accuracy. Just don‚Äôt get caught up in the day to day or the week to week. Whether you blame this pullback on Coronavirus/traditional market fears or if you put it down to crypto just doing crypto (my money is on the second one), I think the best thing anyone can do (**especially new comers**) is to look at the fundamentals of a project, buy into the best ones and hold long term. Don‚Äôt trade, you may think you‚Äôll be good at it but trust me you won‚Äôt. You‚Äôll lose money trading unless you have years of experience (unless you‚Äôre trading big macro movements such as selling BTC back near 14k on its way to 20k and not FOMOing back in when you see it go up another 50% because you‚Äôre not buying back in for a year or longer. But in this case you need balls of steel). Don‚Äôt use leverage. HODL your own keys, don‚Äôt use an exchange. I feel like anyone who does this will be sitting pretty 10 years from now.

Sorry this kind of deviated off of what I was replying to but I‚Äôve been wanting to say this for a while now since we have had some newcomers arriving and the bull hype is returning.",2020-02-27 06:38:02

fiuwo2i,babies_eater,8,"Markets moving so I guess it's time to post again.

Last time I said I'd wait for a long around 9k as it was an area I was expecting support. [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/f6na58/daily_discussion_thursday_february_20_2020/fi8hi8q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Clearly we dropped straight through this Area, and then some. I actually pulled my buy orders yesterday because of Corona's effect on traditional markets.

Reasoning:

* Current (infection) numbers don't indicate impact - much less economic impact which will gradually roll-out into the economy.
* Order book liquidity drying up in securities (asked a securities finance colleague), currently the market is risk-off minded. (--&gt; crypto is very risk-on.)
* Move into safe haven doesn't happen immediately. Sure gold is up a bit, but not on par with the rout in the market.
   * Window of opportunity is if/when stimulus packages enter the economy, then store of value assets will flourish.

*Conclusion: This market action will reward the patient trader who avoids catching falling knives, but time moment of increased fiat inflows and/or market confidence restoration.*

TA: Currently I'm eyeing the low 8k's as a point for reversal. (8250-8000) This may take some days/weeks to get there, though being bitcoin we may get there before March. I think the current drop is fear selling being bought up by Market making algos, though without a rally they will abandon ship when we roll over for another leg down. (Chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/I307f40v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/I307f40v/))

**TLDR for those with the attention span of a toilet brush:**

1. Short-Term --&gt; Corona bad &gt; **Bitcoin Dips Bad** \&gt; **Fiat Bags Good**
2. Medium-Term --&gt; Stimulus bad &gt; **Fiat Bags Bad** \&gt; **Bitcoin / Gold (etc.) Good.**

Bitcoin is all about economic security.  Satoshi always said the cap would eventually be lifted and block increases would be phased in.  But some people overtook the protocol and disallowed the increase.  Greg Maxwell of BlockStream Core was the sole person to veto the increase, he had a lot of power at the time.  We don't know if he was working for some government agency or oligarch bankers to destroy Bitcoin or what. They pushed the narrative that by having small blocks it makes Bitcoin ""more decentralized"" which is basically a bunch of BS. Having small blocks introduces developer central planners and is anything but decentralized.  Small blockers say they want the blocks small so they can all run their node, which they think gives them some sort of power over the system, but in reality its complete brainwashing.  Satoshi himself said [it would be silly for users to run nodes and nodes should be run in giant server farms as the system scales.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6269#msg6269):

&gt; The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.

==================================================

Bitcoin Cash Node version 0.21.0 is now available from:

  - &lt;https://bitcoincashnode.org&gt;
  - &lt;https://github.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/releases/tag/v0.21.0&gt;

This is the first release of Bitcoin Cash Node as a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0. It is based on Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0, with minimal changes necessary to disable the Infrastructure Funding Proposal (IFP) soft forks. For exchanges and users, this client will follow the longest chain whether it includes IFP soft forks or not. For miners, running this client ensures the `getblocktemplate` RPC call will return a block with version bits that vote ""NO"" for the IFP soft forks. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin ABC, `getblocktemplate` will *not* automatically insert IFP white-list addresses into the coinbase transaction.

Minimal changes from Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0 to Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0:

 - All *IFP soft fork logic*, signaling logic and the *hard-coded whitelist* have been **removed**.
 - Rebranding from Bitcoin ABC -&gt; Bitcoin Cash Node.
 - Qt GUI settings are automatically copied from Bitcoin ABC (on first use of Bitcoin Cash Node).

_Note regarding BIP9 and `getblockchaininfo` (below): BIP9 is inactive due to no available proposals to vote on and it may be removed in a future release._

----

All other upgrade changes from ABC 0.21.0 are untouched and included below for reference.

----

## This release includes the following features and fixes:

- The RPC `getrpcinfo` returns runtime details of the RPC server.
At the moment it returns the active commands and the corresponding execution time.
- `ischange` field of boolean type that shows if an address was used for change output was added to `getaddressinfo` method response.
- Bump automatic replay protection to Nov 2020 upgrade.
- Re-introduction of BIP9, info available from the `getblockchaininfo` RPC.
- Various bug fixes and stability improvements.

New RPC methods
---------------
  - `getnodeaddresses` returns peer addresses known to this node.
  It may be used to connect to nodes over TCP without using the DNS seeds.

Network upgrade
---------------
At the MTP time of 1589544000 (May 15, 2020 12:00:00 UTC) the following behaviors will change:
  - The default for max number of in-pool ancestors (`-limitancestorcount`) is changed from 25 to 50.
  - The default for max number of in-pool descendants (`-limitdescendantcount`) is changed from 25 to 50.
  - OP_REVERSEBYTES support in script.
  - New SigOps counting method (SigChecks) as standardness and consensus rules.

Usage recommendations
---------------------

We recommend Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0 as a drop-in replacement for ABC 0.21.0.

Regressions
-----------

Bitcoin Cash Node 0.21.0 does not introduce any known regressions compared to ABC 0.21.0.",2020-02-28 03:22:48

fiysakv,Corp-Por,4,"1/ This report, which is specifically about 2019, came a bit late, we're over 15% done with 2020 already. How come?

Does this mean there will be a 2020 Marketing Proposal forthcoming?

Anyway, glad to see this report, there's some good and some not-so-good in it, in my humble opinion.  Excuse my verbosity in advance, but I have to go through many points here.

I'll start with the good: there's a healthy dose of self-criticism, an awareness that not all plans turned out as expected, and there's an open admission. That's a good start, I think, a sign that things could perhaps improve.

But then there's plenty of things that worry me as well, starting with how 785k(!) can be spent out of a 490k budget (the disparity!) -  Anyways, it seems that storytelling is important to you, and I think your post tries to tell a story.  Stories, memes, are a big part of crypto, as you note in your post, but we must never mistake them for the fundamental, the base reality as it were, that is the confluence between technology and economy that creates this new phenomenon known as *digital scarcity.* That is why we're here. Or at least why I'm here.

&gt;Bitcoin gamified time-stamping. Decred gamified decision-making and formed a digital collective, a technology-enabled experiment in human organization.

I think we should be careful to make such a distinction, because it can make it seem as if DCR something completely different from bitcoin, something like an *appcoin for organizing labor*, as if that was its primary function. The primary substance of DCR *is still precisely* that ""gamified timestamping"" you attribute to BTC!  The labor-organizing stuff is all *to support the primary function*, which is not different from BTC's. This should be stressed. If I was a prospective investor and read a statement like: ""BTC is a store of value, DCR is a social experiment in organization and decision-making..."" which one of the two do you reckon I'd be inclined to invest in?

We need to be careful to always present those *secondary* features as supporting the *primary*. We should never forget that without that primary base: of ""bitcoin"", of a store-of-value, the whole structure is meaningless and would fall apart in a second.  (Almost) nobody would invest in this if it were only a ""social experiment in labor organization"".  

Example: saying that that DCR's primary function is the ""being paid by the blockchain"" would be like saying that the raison d'etre for a State are the taxes and the public employees. But that would be completely in reverse: the whole point is the citizen and their freedoms, and the public sector is only there to serve the tax-paying private citizen!

Here's further proof: Imagine if we remove all the ""social experiment"" stuff you love about DCR, what are we left with? Something like bitcoin, something still very useful and extremely valuable. But now try to imagine if you take away the ""store-of-value"" aspect from DCR, and leave all the rest: what is left?  A purposeless kickstarter, or I don't know what.  Something like the now defunct Devcoin, a coin only some of us oldtimers will remember.  So it's clear that all that stuff is secondary, and it serves only to add to DCR's store-of-value proposition.  Without that, it's nothing.  Nobody would ever invest in it, perhaps a bored philanthropist or two.    

---

&gt; TL;DR Positives &amp; Negatives

A problematic aspect of this part of the post is that it attributes all the failings and successes to this amorphous ""decred"" entity, as if it had its own agency. So you say: ""Decred poorly coordinated multiple efforts..."" - you attribute it to ""decred"", this ""entity"", and not to any specific group or individual(s).

In no part of the blog post do you ever attribute any ""negatives"" to a specific group, or to yourself, for instance. Not saying you should blame yourself: but if everyone who works for DCR and got money to do X, has always the ability to say ""decred has failed to do X"", there will be no personal responsibility. E.g. I get a budget of 400K to manage from Pi... it doesn't go well... I then say ""decred has failed to do X, Y, Z"". Sure, we can say that I guess... but there are also roles, there are moneys that were distributed to various people to oversee certain sectors, so there must be also some personal responsibility, it's not good enough to attribute the failings to ""decred"".  

It goes without saying that you could also attribute some successes to yourself and to the marketing team.  The ""DAO"" meme is nice and all, but in reality, this is still people doing things and some people have more responsibility than other people.  Nobody here really reinvented the wheel of labor.

Which brings me to the next point, you write:

&gt; Some contractors dramatically out deliver their costs, while others have done the opposite.

You mention certain contractors did not do their part. Can you elaborate on this? Were they billing for work that wasn‚Äôt done? Were they lying? What kind of action was taken? Have such individuals been removed from the project? Perhaps there needs to be an audit of who does what?

&gt; Events spending = 335K USD

Having proposals for individual continents - so you want an Asia prop, an Africa prop etc? Is handing off large sums of money to a few individuals to hold a few events in parts of the world we have no oversight on? How do we know these things help grow the project? Don‚Äôt you think something like this could spiral out of hand quickly?


As we see here with some people who billed a lot without working, and the website being late: the blockchain doesn't automagically solve issues related to labor in general. The hierarchies do not magically disappear ""because blockchain"".  People still need to be told: ""hey, you're late..."" or ""hey, you're billing but not doing much"" - which means a 'line of command' is still required.  Maybe with programmers it isn't, but ""marketing"" is not something people do out of passion, for the most part.",2020-02-28 08:23:37

fj1bc5x,nnnko56,3,"Although there is some valid criticism in these 2 posts, I have to admit that my first reaction  was to simply dismiss its content entirely because of the level of misunderstanding and misconception they present. It's a challenge to filter out every statement. Plus the sheer volume of text, makes it difficult to address in an efficient manner. And finally, I would have hoped that someone following Decred since ""2014"",  would know that critiques about what others should do/say or not do/not say is unproductive and unfit for this project because there are no mechanism to force actions  from sovereign individuals.

However I'll address a few element that I believe are most at odds with reality.

*1 -  ""We need to rethink this whole ""social experiment / digital commune"" direction. We need to go back to the fundamentals, the roots: it's a store-of-value with better 51% protection and PoS that serves as a 2FA, and self-funding to support that primary function.""*

There are many problem with this statement.  First you are confusing primary properties of money: scarcity, security, store of value; with extended functions of money like transfer/exchange of goods/services or organizing value/contributions within a group.

Then you are assuming that it isn't already the case. We've had quite a few discussion in the chats about the properties and what Decred **IS** and I don't think you will find anyone in the project who disagree with ""**store of value**"" being the primary element we want to push and be the main narrative for what **IS** Decred.

However, if we do want to speak about marketing, we also have to put our marketing hat on. That primary element is useless as an introduction to Decred for someone who don't even know what is a store of value or why they should care about it. Yes the objective is to get them there, but if you were around when Bitcoin first started, almost all the coverage in the media was about ""internet money"", Bitcoin was a bizarre thing that intrigued people and pushed them to look into it. Then there was the ""be your own bank"" narrative which is also quite a stretch but that's marketing for you. It's only recently that the ""store of value"" started, but even now I would argue that the ""internet money"" and ""be your own bank"" narratives are still pulling in more newcomers than ""store of value"".

So from a marketing statement, it all depends who you are speaking to.  If you want to pitch to a bunch of coiners or bitcoin maxis, sure the store of value as an edge to bitcoin is the most powerful one.  If you want to get wider media coverage and articles on that subject however, you can forget it, it's an unappealing pitch at best. The ""work for the blockchain"" story is the kind of ""be your own bank"" visibility that you want for broad visibility.  And Yes,  people who are drawn in will take the same path that I did early on with bitcoin and perfect their understanding of Decred and why they should care of its fundamental properties.

&amp;#x200B;

*2 - ""A problematic aspect of this part of the post is that it attributes all the failings and successes to this amorphous ""decred"" entity, as if it had its own agency. So you say: ""Decred poorly coordinated multiple efforts..."" - you attribute it to ""decred"", this ""entity"", and not to any specific group or individual(s).""*

I think you are missing quite a few details about how the project operates. Maybe I'm the one who's wrong because I'm merely a stakeholder and not a contractor, but it's my understanding that before this marketing proposal, known contractors were billing the treasury in arrears for work done. Their work being reviewed by other contractors to make sure it's ""on par"" but once they are contractors,  there is no direct management of these contractors and what they do. It's their own responsibility to self-manage. This proposal was not to give a 400K$ to Dustin so he could manage marketing contractors, because I'm sure he or anyone else would have refused that kind of responsibility. I felt it was presented as ""In 2018 contractors billed the treasury for X, let me put out a breakdown of things that are being billed already so it's transparent and people have an idea of what to expect and can start interacting more directly with contractors""

So who is to blame in that context? Well from your viewpoint, maybe we should appoint more gatekeepers to manage these budgets and be accountable for their decisions... If you want to assign specific blame to persons or groups that's pretty much the only way. But I don't think that's where we want to go.

From my viewpoint: Am I to blame for not following the marketing efforts as much a I should have? Are you to blame for waiting 15% of 2020 before offering feedback on marketing efforts of 2019? are contractors to blame for not reviewing closely enough work being done by some peers? That's for each of us to reflect and act upon. If you are in a system where you can't direct or decide what others do, everyone has to do it for themselves and adjust. Pointing fingers at the mirror is useless.

Also, we have to consider that the structure, accountability and transparency we all want around the project isn't an on/off switch. It's an incremental process that started with no way of managing the treasury at all. Now we have a full-featured proposal system, a contractor management system to submit invoices and process payment, and work is well under way, to fully remove that lasts gatekeepers around treasury spending so that invoices are linked to budgets and proposals  with stakeholders having the final say on monthly payments from the treasury. If we want to get there we can't stop half-way and start appointing directors or managers for the sake of speeding up accountability when the goal is to eliminate these structures.

If we wanted we could convert Decred to a private company and call it a day....  It is a lot harder to achieve what we are doing in decentralized fashion,  but it's the only way it's worth achieving IMHO.

In that sense I feel Dustin is receiving a lot of personal critiques for things he simply has no control or oversee of. I read that report as his personal observations and opinions because he does have a better vantage point than most of US. But I will also form my own opinions and act accordingly on the next proposal.

&amp;#x200B;

*3- ""Maybe it's new and fascinating to some, but it has little to do with the blockchain. That's something we had since like... the 90s!? open source projects, like GNU/Linux for instance, are exactly that, a collective working from all over the world, judged solely by the quality of their contributions. I don't want to sound sarcastic but I'm tempted to say: welcome to the Internet, Dustin! Plenty of people work remotely together these days all around the world, this is nothing new.""*

You'd be receiving money upfront, under no performance criteria, no sunset clause, no impositions as where or how to spend it... And those really paying for it - which we all know would not be the miners, since their profitability wouldn't change, but the holders, who'd see the devaluation of their assets via inflation being diverted to something different than before, in a sort of ""breach of contract"" - have absolutely no say whatsoever.
