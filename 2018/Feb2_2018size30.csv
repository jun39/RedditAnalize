dtj7gp8,Centillionare,235,"Another great thing that I hope will happen is Ether being on top might help normies understand market cap versus coin price. 

If Ether is $2,000 it will have a higher market cap than bitcoin at $9,000. So all the people will hear “Ethereum passes Bitcoin” see the prices and want to figure it out. ",2018-02-01 04:25:14
dtiw0ed,ChoosyBeggor,193,"I love how a log chart managed to make a 40% correction look like the price barely changed.

And by the way, the people posting about bitcoin seem to have no ability to even consider the fundamental drivers of the price. They literally stare at graphs and decide it will keep moving up and to the right.

No, look at the market cap of bitcoin. It would have to be worth 2 trillion dollars to get the same % gain from the previous major high ($1000) to now. If you want to get the same gain as from 2014 low to the peak, then bitcoin cap would have to be worth 13 trillion dollars.

Going from a market cap of $5 million to $50 million is one thing. Going from $160 billion to $13 trillion is another. If bitcoin were worth that much, then it'd be an asset class that take up 2/3 the space that US treasuries take up. That's unfathomable even if Bitcoin had no competition.

The easy growth is over guys, you need to manage your expectations. Bitcoin produces no income, it just sits there, and you hope someone else pays more for it. You'd be better off investing in something that actually creates stuff and grows.

Think about an economy with people investing in two assets.

One economy invests in bitcoins. The other invests in companies. After a hundred years, the bitcoins are still bitcoins. But look at what US companies managed to produce in the past 100 years.

**Edit** There are many logical fallacies being thrown around below. I'll address the most common here:

1. ""That's what they said about bitcoin at $100, $500, $1000, etc."" 

This argument is basically saying that past predictions about the popping of bitcoin's bubble were wrong, therefore, bitcoin's price will go up higher (substantially) in the future. This is not a logically sound argument, it is not at all a reason for why Bitcoin's future price will be higher. Imagine a guy gambling at the roulette table, he puts everything on black, wins, then puts everything on black again, and wins again, etc. His wife keeps telling him to stop because sooner or later he'll lose his money (he's at a mathematical disadvantage in the game). He tells his wife that's what she told him before he won x, y, and z, and therefore, he will continue to win. This reasoning is flawed.

Now this is not to say that bitcoin will not go higher, but if your argument is that past predictions were wrong, therefore the same trend will continue until $x, then you are not making a logical argument and you don't know what you are talking about. And because you don't know what you are talking about, you don't actually know what you are doing, and you're at the mercy of forces and knowledge beyond your comprehension. Be humbled by this fact, not continue to arrogantly and ignorantly repeat ""but the haterz waz wrong b4"".

2. Bitcoin is a great technology that will continue to valuable and adopted in the future, therefore prices will rise. 

This is a better argument but let's say that it is true, what about competition? The first MP3 player was not the iPod, it was something you probably know nothing about. What percentage of the music player market does that first MP3 player have now? What about the first computer? What about the first social media network? The first video hosting website? The first search engine? What percentage of their respective market do they possess?

Blockchain technology is the future. Great. But what percentage of this future will belong to Bitcoin? Bitcoin has been rapidly losing market share to competitors, Ether is now almost 2/3 the size of bitcoin by market cap. So let's say the market cap for crypto coins does ""go to the moon"". Will it be at the expense of bitcoin? Bitcoin no longer lead Ethereum, Ethereum has been on a huge spike these past few weeks, Bitcoin the opposite. Look at what new coins are based on now. Once Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin market cap, there will hardly be any arguments left for Bitcoin being the leader. So what then? Will Bitcoin be the Nokia of the crypto world? Once a powerhouse, and then left with almost no market share? How many technologies can you even name where the first iteration became and remained market leader?",2018-02-01 01:27:04

dtjlloz,kikimonster,176,"I think you're missing a piece of history. This sub was originally the haven of those that were dissatisfied with the direction of the development of bitcoin. It's been around for years, bitcoin Cash is only 6 months old. 

Those that didn't like the changes blockstream was putting out have rallied around BCH, and coincidentally already resided here in this sub. Anything that keeps it from being merchant adoptable was removed and IMO a more streamlined bitcoin has arisen. 

RBF does nothing if fees are low and everything is added in the next block, and only adds a risk of double spending. One could argue a lot of what was added doesn't make sense if fees stay low.

I just see too many mechanisms dependent on a crippled bitcoin on one side.

dtjjh4l,dontcensormebro2,105,"* I am more in favor of Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash and am more in favor of technological innovation over block size increase.

I take issue with this statement.  Are you really implying that blocksize increases require no technological innovation?  Sure going from a 1 to a 2 or an 8 is one thing, but there are much bigger plans than this.  I don't know if you were paying attention, but there has been research into this identifying bottlenecks in the software.  Parallel mempool acceptance and identifying how to make asynchronous which was previously synchronous is not innovation?  Graphene, etc.  So confusing

It's like designing an engine.  An engine is to provide power and efficiency.  That doesn't mean you maximize efficiency at all costs.  Both sides have a cost.

I'll be honest, your ad hominems against Roger are disappointing. Why are you so focused on him?  None of the beef you have with him has even one shred of anything to do with Bitcoin Cash as a useful currency.  It screams rbitcoin propaganda machine.

dtjng3c,etherael,94,"The word you're looking for is sabotage, not innovation. 

There's hulking great scads of innovation happening all around the cryptocurrency ecosystem, BCH with graphene and fungibility enhancements and on chain scaling throughput increases to keep it an optimal currency whilst maintaining the model proven through several years of experience, ETH with raiden and sharding, Nano and hashgraph with a completely new underlying distributed ledger technology not just iterating on the foundations of the past. 

And then over in the corner a fucking terrible cancer of a company financed by the traditional financial powers that be against whose interests any change in the global monetary status quo lies, and what are they doing? Spending *years* lying about technological underpinnings of the project, hiring astroturfing campaigns to push out their complete nonsense and confuse the legions of people who are being bought on board into a white hot space and simply don't know any better, and desperately trying to distract them from even grasping the underlying facts of the issue, censoring anything they can get their hands on which contradicts their idiotic narrative, and generally doing exactly what you'd expect a group employed to sabotage a world changing project like this would do. 

There is nothing bitcoin friendly about bitcoin core. They are disingenuous saboteurs out to destroy the transformative potential of the technology. Nothing more, nothing less. And the fact they manage to pull the wool over the eyes of even intelligent people like yourself and distract you into looking at character assassination campaigns and questions of human trust in a trustless system really highlights just how fucking disastrous their impact has been. 

No matter how you spin it, sabotaging on chain transaction throughput to advance the business model of a single company isn't innovative, 14kbps hasn't been a throughput rate to be excited about since the early nineties, and Blockstream, u/nullc and all his cancerous cronies deserve every last ounce of criticism this sub slings at them and much more besides.

dtit75y,DCinvestor,93,"Markets eventually realize fundamental value and utility.  Especially when it is derived from real world usage, increasing functionality, and difficult to replicate network effects.

Ethereum clearly has all of these, and they will only strengthen during 2018.  Developer and user network effects are multiplying rapidly.  And network functionality and capacity could grow by orders of magnitude.

Bitcoin used to have some of these characteristics, but let's face facts: it does not anymore.  It is difficult to sustain a network effect without actual / growing usage.  Lightning and Rootstock don't appear to be providing the answer either.  It's harsh to say that it's just another store of value coin, but at least it was the first.

""Store of value"" is a narrative that was created when BTC stopped being used regularly peer to peer, due to rising fees.  What you see these markets starting to say right now is that they care about utility, not about marketing narratives.
