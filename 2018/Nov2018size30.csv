&gt;In 2017, bitcoin production and usage emitted an estimated **69 million tonnes** of carbon dioxide equivalent, the researchers said

&gt;As the currency becomes more common, researchers said it could use enough electricity to emit about **230 gigatonnes** of carbon within a decade and a half. One gigatonne is equal to one billion tonnes of carbon.

And that right there tells you this is BS. They are projecting that it will exponentially increase every year for the next decade in a half...",2018-11-01 02:18:22

e8t0ls8,Chode_Gazer,568,"While that is arguably true, what these Bitcoin miners are doing is unbelievable.  I work in utility-scale power distribution systems, and I specialize in medium voltage transformers.  Let's say a decent sized project would have 3-4 tansformers, each with a 10-12 week leadtime. Typical project timelines range from six months to a year, concept to completion.  These yayhoos are buying upwards of 75 transformers at a time, and demanding 3-4 week deliveries (staged). The projects move so damn fast that they end up buying from multiple manufacturers and used equipment dealers, and hiring multiple contractors to slam them together.  They like to buy old/failed projects and facilities that we're equipped with a shitload of utility power so they can avoid that process and get the jump on the competition's timeline.

It's introduced a whole new element to what I do, and I can only imagine what the utility sees. This undoubtedly introduces and undisputable impact on carbon emissions, and so much so they'll probably get their own damn category someday.",2018-11-01 04:09:19

e8sz3cm,SlowFoodCannibal,163,"In some ways, you're my twin.  While I'm equally comfortable leading and following, I've been called a ""natural leader"" since I was a kid and have been placed in many leadership roles throughout my life.  I've enjoyed a long and very successful career in tech and currently manage the best technical team on the planet within an awesome large and growing company.

But while you are a ""big white male"", I'm a ""small brown female"".  And I've been painfully aware of many situations where I've been overlooked or treated differently because I do NOT look the part.  

Lemme tell ya - it fucking sucks to experience that.

At the same time, guys like you who are aware of the unfairness and want to address it are invaluable in making a difference.  Don't step aside for others - promote them and give them a seat at the table!  You are in a unique position to help.  Unlike protesters with signs or posters on reddit, YOU HAVE POWER.  USE IT!

Seek out and hire qualified women and POC.  Make them comfortable within your organization by studying what diversity and inclusion really mean and promoting a supportive culture.  Mentor the best of them and help them rise through the ranks.  Make a point of publicly declaring your commitment to fairness and equality - this is where your leadership really matters because others will follow you (who knows, maybe if James Damore had been under a strong and influential manager like you he would not have developed the resentment that lead to his stupid ""manifesto"").  Don't start executive meetings with informal discussions of potentially exclusionary topics, like football or golf or Bitcoin.  Instead stick to neutral topics like where people took their vacations or how their kids or pets are doing.  

Develop close alliances with women and POC in your executive layer, become part of their support system and promote their interests within the organization.  When others ignore them in meetings, call on them and ask their opinions.  Don't be afraid to let your alliances known...stand with your allies.  Let some of your light illuminate their potential to others who might not otherwise see it.

Some of what I'm describing to you are behaviors that have been practiced by ""big white male"" executives who have made ME one of their allies.  I've seen what they've done to promote my interests and I've deeply appreciated it.  Including the big white dude I currently report to, who I have come to genuinely love.  

If you do these things, not only will it help others but you will become even more successful in your career because you'll have built a network of loyal, talented folks who promote your causes just as you promote theirs.  Then use that increased success to help even more people. 

Don't ""step aside"" - step up!  We need guys like you.  

(To be clear and to hopefully stop the nasty PMs, I am not advocating being a one-man ""affirmative action"" machine by ignoring talented white men or practicing ""reverse discrimination"".  Diversity includes white men!   Assemble truly diverse teams and networks of talented people of all stripes but SEE and recognize the dynamics that favor white men and work to level the playing field by dismantling those dynamics where you can.)

tl;dr I call a massive steaming BULLSHIT on the claim that bitcoin mining is what is gonna put us over the edge for global warming.... We spend WAY more energy on just keeping cool.Now lets talk about industrial HVAC and add that to the equation ..

The power on the grid, is already on the grid.. the fuels expended and energies converted to meet the demand are already working WELL in excess of where they could be with more efficient loads.

Oh and I wonder how many dinosaur squeezings are burned on a daily basis to charge all those electric cars.

I am not saying to abandon our A/C's or or Teslas. I am saying the load we draw from the grid is already massive and bitching about bitcoin's drop in the bucket is wasted effort. The load on the grid is the load on the grid. It is what we do to satisfy that load, that matters most.... More Solar, More Renewables, and less bitcoin boogie monsters please.

Today I'll spend most of my day in *Radiant Orchid* and *Prism/Spectrum* (the two main rooms). Tonight we'll have th Blockchains LLC [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/9t6yha/daily_general_discussion_november_1_2018/e8u504d/). *These are the talks I'll attend. I'll provide updates throughout the day. I share a quick impression and encourage you to watch the sessions yourself. Also available on the [blog](https://www.belgianboy.com/devcon4-day-2/).*   

### Building self-sustaining ecosystems through governance  
Presentation on 0x’s governance model regarding grants, and core protocol development in the future. Their solution includes the electing of a committee for more complex decisions.  
### High-stakes decision making: how to maximise your impact
Nothing blockchain/ethereum related. A presentation on effective altruism, and their organization, [Effective Giving](https://www.effectivegiving.org/). I thought it would be similar to Annie Duke's poker lessons, but that was only half of the talk (by Liv).     
### Melonport will not exist by Devcon 5.  
Jenna from Melonport about how they’ll open up the development and governance of the protocol. I’m not sure if I really understood what they’re all about, changing the dev team for a “technical council”? Their product sounds cool though.     
### The Social and Economic Fabric of Decentralized Space Development    
Yalda from [Space Decentral](https://spacedecentral.net/) talks about opening up global collaboration on space projects. They'll use Aragon to raise funds, reward contributors, choose projects, and more. I don't know the space (pun intended) so I cannot comment on its viability.    
### Decentralize, Democratize, or Die  
Easily the best talk I've attended so far. If you only watch one talk, check Cory Doctorow's from EFF.    
### Open Financial Systems &amp; the Road to Socioeconomic Mobility
Skipped this one, was too hungry. The food is truely great.  
### MakerDAO: A New Hope for Financial Reform 
High level talk about MakerDAO. Big audience. Easily one of the most exciting projects built on Ethereum.    
###  How will nations remain relevant in the 21st century?
~~Casper~~ Kaspar Korjus from the Estonian eResidency program with a high level overview. I recommend reading [last year's New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/estonia-the-digital-republic) instead.
###  Unscrambling an Egg: Decentralization and the Zcash Foundation
Check this if you want to learn the difference between the Zcash Company and the Zcash Foundation. Or why you'd start a 503 non profit. 
###  CBC Casper Design Philosophy
Insight into the CBC philosophy and some breakthroughs on sharding. Too complex for me (I speak four languages but I'm afraid I'll never understand Vlad), check it for yourself.
###  Human Centered Identity: We are more than keys.
I had high hopes of this talk (uPort), but I didn't really learn anything new. It's interesting to see the development in self-sovereign identity.


## Meta lesson from DevCon  
- Literally nobody is talking about price. I haven't heard a single talk about ETH in dollar terms. Not even *one* nervous joke (as opposed to a banking event I attended earlier this year, where the host made ""fun"" of Bitcoin). It leads me to question my time spent on /r/ethtrader and the asymmetry between negativity here (a few people causing major confusion) and development in the real world (thousands of attendees here and hundreds of thousands of people involved in the ecosystem). I don't know. I get the feeling that ""all will be well for those who wait."" I mean, if we got to $1400 on speculation, think about where we could get with the additional infrastructure (and dApps) being build.  

- I'm still waiting for the killer app idea. I've attended many sessions but so far I haven't had that ""this is earth moving"" moment. Of course, I'm looking at a non-linear beast through my linear eyes. ",2018-11-01 17:51:44

e8t5fz6,StillNoNumb,53,"This. Usually, over 99% of each block is paid for by ""mined coins"", which are generated from an invisible pool. However, this invisible pool is also limited; in total, there can only be 21 million Bitcoins (of which 17 million have already been mined), so every few years the mining reward halves. The next time this happens is (predicted to be) [May 20th, 2020](https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com). On that day, Bitcoin mining rewards will almost cut in half; which will probably also drastically decrease the electricity put into mining.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, this doesn't mean the electricity used by Bitcoin isn't going to waste. Because there's (currently far less than 1% of the mining rewards, but in the future likely increasing) transaction fees, the incentive to mine will probably never go to zero.

e8vm8g8,KillerHurdz,65,"Great debate guys, really. This is going to be my go-to video for anyone who wants to learn about where we are and how we got here.

We do have something to contribute here to the discussion as well:

Today we had our second stress test and it allowed us to learn even more about how each of the various node implementations handled transactions at the mempool level (required for functional 0-conf).

We found that any time there was a block around 3MB or bigger, all of our nodes failed to keep up with the transaction throughput and actually ended up missing &gt;99% of broadcast transactions. This effectively killed 0-conf in all of our apps until the mempool was cleared.

Here's a breakdown:

Node | Max Mempool Size | Mempool Acceptance
---|---|---
Bitcoin Unlimited 1.3.0.1 | 64MB | FAIL
Bitcoin Unlimited 1.5.0 (maxlimitertxfee=1, default) | 64MB | FAIL
Bitcoin Unlimited 1.5.0 (maxlimitertxfee=0, custom) | 64MB | PASS
Bitcoin Unlimited 1.5.0 (maxlimitertxfee=0, custom) | 300MB | PASS
Bitcoin ABC 1.7.2 | 64MB | FAIL
Bitcoin ABC 1.8.2 | 64MB | FAIL
Bitcoin SV 0.1.0 | 64MB | FAIL

Note how not only was BU 1.5.0 the only implementation that could properly maintain a working mempool but that it actually required us to update the configuration (setting maxlimitertxfee to 0) for it to actually process all of the transactions we were expecting to see. 64MB was more than enough to keep up with each node's mempool acceptance throughput.

Amaury explains in the debate/interview here that BU has been focused on dealing with the bottlenecks that we expect to hit first as we scale while ABC has been focused on the hardest-to-solve bottlenecks that will need to be solved further down the line. This completely explains the results we're seeing since SV is a fork of ABC.

It's unfortunate that we've seen people criticizing others for being ""anti-scaling"" (yes, actually we've heard that a lot this week) while simultaneously operate nodes that can't even handle a fraction of our theoretical 32MB max...",2018-11-02 07:33:29

Closed with some strength, but after hours we're seeing pullback following Apple's earnings report. CGC, CRON, TLRY and some other names mirrored the drop seen with AAPL stock afterhours.

**CGC**

* Weak bounce. Need 4-hour consolidation like we discussed yesterday. Watch the $40 resistance level still. Potential lower high and bull flag of consolidation, but a bear break of $35.85 would indicate that potential bull flag is less likely to be true. We're currently seeing an hourly equilibrium range of $36.39 to $37.77, so pay attention to how that plays out.

**APH**

* Little more red today, and a bearish candlestick. Resistance at $16.77, rejected from $16.64 (our new resistance), so we still have a lower high. This was healthy consolidation, and we also see a potential bull flag here as well, and we might be seeing the beginning of that inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.

* Hourly time frame range of $14.85 support, and resistance of $15.54.

**ACB**

* Lower high seen on the daily. Starting consolidation at this point, but not a convincing higher low. Hourly range of $8.63 support, and resistance of $9.12. Once again watch how the hourly breaks to anticipate the 4-hour time-frame play.

**CRON**

* 4-hour time-frame doesn't have much consolidation. Little bull move at the end of day.  We're looking at supports of $7.54, $7.22, and resistance at $8.48. Anything less than $8.48 is still just a lower high. So no ""right shoulder"" seen with CRON like we've seen in other names.

**TLRY**

* Weak bounce on the daily, and potential bear flag even. 4-hour time-frame showing sideways consolidation. Tightening range on the hourly.

e8uqvzg,Alter_ego_of_mine,39,"At the beginning, the project had some mishaps. The ICO was very poorly executed. ICO’s smart contract literally failed for a lot of would-be investors (myself included). In the early days, the website was a mess too. Things got better over time. Communication level got better, AMAs were conducted properly, etc.

Like most crypto projects, TKY is polarizing. Some people go so far as to suggest that it is a scam. Someone argued the other day that it will operate with fiat and not TKY. According to this fellow, Thekey was an elaborate scam to fund the future Ebaonet blockchain that will toss aside TKY. S/he argued that despite Catherine’s multiple confirmations at each AMA that TKY is the only settlement tool. So this line of thinking considers Catherine and her co-founders as outright fraudsters, ready to tarnish their reputation and face civil and criminal prosecution in jurisdictions that were allowed to participate in the ICO. People somehow think because it is crypto and ICOs are not regulated like IPOs, you could get away with fraud.

As you have your naysayers, you also have overly exuberant investors in our beloved TKY community. They refuse to see anything wrong with the project. So, for every FUDder, you have a moon boy.

To me, the truth -and the project’s future- is somewhere in between. Having studied Thekey for months, the only downside I see is token velocity. TKY’s current setup has no velocity-slowing mechanism. Too many tokens that are too readily available means that the token circulates too fast within a network. That is proven to keep the token price very low. The well-known velocity formula goes MV=PQ. [https://investmentbank.com/token-velocity/](https://investmentbank.com/token-velocity/)

I wish the answer lied in high future demand for the token. Supple and demand curve is obviously favorable for a project like Thekey because there will be a little over 5 bn tokens for over a billion Chinese citizens after the launch. That’s good on paper but not enough.

Then the next logical question is, is the token velocity problem addressable? You bet! Lots of projects are going down that road. Some recently decided to create a dual token structure for instance. They created a smart contract settlement token (like gas) and converted the original token into a staking token where you either earn dividends or just because you collectively remove them from circulation, you reduce velocity. In that structure, the gas token may move as fast and easily as it wants within the network. That won't negatively affect the price because value accrues at the staking token level. CPChain is a recent example of that.

So, there is no reason why Thekey founders wouldn’t address token mechanics in the future. They don’t seem to pay any attention to that for now but that’s got to change after the mainnet if you ask me. That will also coincide with the timing of Chinese regulatory relaxation. Local exchanges will be licensed and open again. That will allow Chinese token holders to ride the wave as well non-Chinese ones -which I assume is the largest investor demographics at the moment.

On the bright side, Thekey has patented or patent-pending IDV solutions. Someone asked the other day if Tencent can be a threat to Thekey. It might be but then again you can say that for any disruptive or groundbreaking startup. Why is Microsoft not a threat to Bitcoin? Why is IBM not a threat to Ethereum? You can go on and on. In reality, large corporations are notoriously slow. And when they finally join the race, they are often too late. When Google noticed this fast-growing agile startup called Facebook, it was too late. FB was already gaining momentum and network effect. Hence, Google Plus’s catastrophic failure.

We need to remember that Thekey’s parent company was already chosen by the Chinese government for IDV. Tencent, Alibaba, Huawei and other tech giants don’t have access to citizens’ data held by the government. Thekey does.

For any crypto project I have invested in, every single community worries about future price. Telegram and Reddit chats are filled with price predictions. That’s completely understandable of course. Yet, what really worries  me is whether blockchain itself will be adopted as fast as we hope and whether any given project I invested will gain momentum. Smart money is no better than us, the ordinary folks either. Multiple venture capitalists invested in Augur more than 3 years ago and literally no one has used it since its mainnet launch. They are scratching their heads, trying to figure out what's not working. Same goes for a ton of other projects. People are building virtual highways to collect toll and they manage to attract no traffic -at least for now.

I see no such risk for Thekey. I see zero chance for the Chinese government to make a U-turn on IDV. I have no reason to think that they may ditch Thekey as their chosen project either. If in the future I see signs to the opposite, I'll be the first to change my mind, believe me. There is nothing worse than emotional attachment and sunken costs fallacy.

Once Thekey goes into daily use, they can implement velocity sinks so as to drive the token price up while maintaining IDV cost unchanged. That won’t bother the government but make the founders and early investors incredibly rewarded.

That’s what I think the future holds for TKY. In 3 to 9 months, we'll have all the answers.",2018-11-02 00:38:37

e8uuhzi,onewalleee,39,"#We must never allow political violence to take root in America

The MSM has ignored most of this violence, in some cases even defending the movements responsible. If it bleeds, it leads, except when it is the blood of AntiFA's victims? 

There are over 25 attacks included within.

Let's make sure our fellow citizens make an informed decision.

**Sharing**:

- Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/294694962
- BitChute: 
https://www.bitchute.com/video/33w76lMBQ9Qx/
- MP4 Video: https://uploadfiles.io/qshv8 (if you want to upload it somewhere yourself)
- Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/onewalleee/status/1052922083230007297 (if you just want to retweet)

I researched all of the attacks in the compilation to ensure they were unprovoked. I read witness statements, watched hours of surrounding videos, spoke to a couple of the victims, read AntiFA after-action reports/threads, etc. I made a good faith effort to ensure that in every case it was clear that at least one of the following criteria applied.

**Criteria**

- prima facie unjustified, a person literally doing nothing wrong (most of the couple dozen attacks satisfy this criterion but proving it within the context of the video would have required lots of boring video no one would watch)
- people being cruelly beaten because they tried to stop a crime: either violence against another innocent or preventing a robbery 
- disproportionate force used against people who are not a threat, for example, folks on the ground covered up (even unconscious in one example) or running away

The compilation is deeply disturbing &amp; I've watched it change people's minds. The problem of course is that it's hard to get people to watch a video when they know they won't like the implications of it.

For that reason I've also written up textual descriptions of a subset of the attacks that don't require much or any additional context to know they are absolutely unacceptable. 

People have a harder time ignoring a block of text than they do just refusing to click a link. So I encourage you to share the video and to copy &amp; paste the descriptions as needed. 

----

**Text Descriptions**

These are just a few of the victims who are doing absolutely nothing threatening, or who clearly no longer pose any threat (if they ever had):

- 0:28 - man in a red shirt holding a microphone and peacefully reporting. He is attacked by a terrorist wielding some sort of bludgeoning instrument. After he tries to run away, a horde of AntiFA terrorists try to stop him from escaping and someone strikes him with a flag pole
- 0:46 - man is calmly speaking to a group of people while extinguishing a fire they started. Says he supports their right to protest but not lawlessness. Two AntiFA thugs sneak up behind him, steal his hat, and hit him, then attack his friend who tries to secure the property forcibly robbed from him
- 1:23 - man is already unconscious and face down in the street. An AntiFA terrorist  hits him with a flag pole. (I remember from my research at the time that AntiFA militants who claimed to be there were justifying it by saying something to the effect of “this chud was yelling ‘build the wall’”)
- 1:45 - man in a green hat. His back his turned, his hands are up in a non-threatening way. He is asking police for help. A group of people attack him from behind, drag him down, and kick him on the ground 
- 1:57 - guy in a reddish shirt. He is standing around peacefully talking to a group (asking people to calm down) when an AntiFA terrorist emerges from the ranks &amp; ambushes him with a bike lock, cracking open his head
- 2:44 - man in a grey sweatshirt, having a peaceful discussion. AntiFA terrorist sneaks up behind him with a pole and attacks him
- 3:15 - a Bernie / Hillary voter brings American flag to a rally to protest AGAINST fascism. AntiFA terrorists decide he must be a fascist, try to steal his flag, and, when he holds onto it, hit him in the head. He needed staples to close the head wound (including a [local news source](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/08/he_brought_an_american_flag_to.html) because it might not be clear why the struggle started)
- 3:28 - woman in a “Make BITCOIN Great Again” hat giving an interview to a journalist, defending the right of the crowd to PEACEFULLY protest. AntiFA thug sneaks up and pepper sprays her at point blank range for no reason

-----

**Caveats**

- I didn’t record the footage myself, I  _personally_ don’t mind if you share it or use parts of it, with or without attribution
- If you’re aware of any dramatic video footage containing one-sided attacks that fit the criteria &amp; are very violent (not harassment or mutual shoving) please let me know
- I made a good faith effort to ensure the criteria were met, and thus excluded the VAST majority of footage I could have included. If you think something was included mistakenly, let me know so I can investigate &amp; remove it
- No amount of left-wing terrorism can justify _elective_ politically motivated, extrajudicial violence against law-abiding citizens. Do not become the monsters you resist

e8wo7hh,45sbvad,39,"I don't usually post short-term predictions, however the conditions I'm observing are worth noting.

Yesterday we broke out, upward, from the consolidating flag pattern we've been in for nearly a year. We will need a day or two, and ideally a small rally to really settle this.

I'm predicting extreme volatility in the next 96Hours. I am a long term permabull; and right now looks better than we have in over a year.

Everyone who bought in for short term gains in the past 24 months have either sold or are holding on for the long-haul. Those who were nervous about their losses had many rallies throughout the year to sell into; as well as those who wanted to take profits.

What is the likely behavior of someone who holds Bitcoin now? They've either already realized massive gains and are holding for long term; or they are unfazed by their paper ""losses"" and chose not to sell into any of the relief rallies we had this year; will they be so quick to sell at $7 or $8k when they could have sold as high as $12k during the first relief rally.

The only people who have no gain or loss are people who bought in the past 6 weeks; or people who bought during a short window about a year ago. The people who've held through the craziness of the past year aren't likely to sell soon.

The main resistance I see right now is simply traders from the past 6 weeks taking profits until the chart very clearly walks into some bullish TA patterns.

I believe the majority of coins are held by Bitcoin owners who can weather a storm down to $4k and won't quickly sell until we are well past $20k.

e8w1d1u,bitvote,37,"re Tether FUD. 

I think people may be missing an essential factor in the analysis: Core Tether stakeholders are very wealthy folks. Not just from Tether. They were deeply embedded early crypto folk - they've likely got big money from Bitfinex, from Tether (it's almost certainly a very profitable business) and from their personal crypto holdings (the drop from $20k to $6k means very little to a person who started a bitcoin _business_ in 2012 - unless they totally fucked up absolutely everything, they're set for life just on their bitcoin holding). 

Point being: these stakeholders - the group of individuals and orgs that own Tether - have too much to lose by Tether being a fraud. 

Worst case imo: The billions backing Tether are really there. but some regulatory slaps on the wrist may be coming.

But this story is analogous to big banks, when you are making _so much fucking money_ you just start pricing in $100M fines as a cost of doing business. and you are thrilled to be able to continue operating and raking that money in. 

Big banks are obv a master of this. 

The idea that Tether is some kind of Madoff level ponzi is 5 std deviations away from reality imo. The basic incentives of everyone involved just don't point to that kind of ponzi. 

And when I say everyone, I include all the regulatory agencies that are investigating Tether. If this were a total shitshow, they'd have shut it down ages ago. 

So... this Tether FUD sideshow should, at least by all reasonable folk, be permanently put to bed. Even more so now that we've got half a dozen stablecoins sprinkled across the regulatory continuum - from fully above board (Cirlce/Gemini) to decentralized (Maker). 

And beyond Tether ponzi FUD. I think it's worth addressing stablecoin hate. 

People who uniformly demonize stablecoins are missing something absolutely essential about the promise of crypto-assets. We are at the most nascent stages of developing tether-crypto assets. But this trend is massively important. 

The ability to tie a decentralized crypto asset to an equity, to a debt instrument, to _any_ financial instrument. and to even go beyond traditional financial instruments - a stablecoin that tracks not just the _price_ of something, but a coin that tracks anything that's objectively measurable in the real world. 

That is a revolution. 

No doubt it takes some vision to see why this is so. But it opens up an entire new universe of economic/social activity - it requires us to stretch our imagination in ways that few people are capable of. But when you see it, the power of the vision is like seeing the face of god. 

To close: 
(1) Tether FUD is almost certainly overstated. 
(2) stablecoins represent the beginning of our ability to link crypto-assets to crypto-exogenous events. And that is a very big deal imo.

* In November it can be configured to follow any chain. IE it supports the ABC rule set, the current rule set and it will support the SV rule set.
* They have baked a safe, Nakamoto Consensus voting system into their software and provided a [guide](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/dev/doc/bip135-guide.md) showing miners how to use it. This bypasses all this insane politics coming from both the ABC and the SV team. It restores devs to their rightful role of being technical experts that code software and make recommendations. It means the entities with actual skin-in-the-game (the miners) decide on what rules to activate in the best interest of Bitcoin (BCH). Miners are, after-all, the people that actually provide the service. They are the block producers. Without their blocks and their hash rate security there is no Bitcoin. We, the users, give value to their mined coins by holding them when we believe the Bitcoin network is working well. Miners are thus incentivized to make good decisions when it comes to consensus upgrades. If they get it wrong, they lose users and thus their mined coins lose value and their capital investments (e.g. mining hardware) yields less profit.
* They are an experienced development team. They've been making node software since the very beginning of BCH and even before that, on the legacy BTC chain too.

Is OMG pumping? Are these all shitcoins then? Nano pumped but retraced and has done nothing since. Even Vechain had good news after good news after good news last month and NOTHING happened with the price. Most of the pumps we've seen in this market have been by pump and dump groups or because of significant hypey news like getting added to Coinbase. You need some god damn perspective. 

It's a bear market. If you sell your ICX, where are you going to put it in instead?  VEN? Well that hasn't been going up either? Oh lets put it into Binance coin, oh wait that hasn't done anything since august. Let's put it into TRON, oh fuck that's been literally flat since August too. Honestly ICX has actually been performing admirably relatively speaking for the past few months. On the USDT pair on binance, ICX was consistently the best performer for a while other than XRP. 

Like, I can understand your frustration with ICX if everything else was booming and ICX remained stagnant but there is no lost opportunity holding ICX right now.

&gt; How many of you are participating in any ICON ICOs? Honestly? I'll bet very few of you. The rest of you are just hoping others will to pump your bags. Well, if you don't feel any FOMO, then other people won't feel it either.

The global marketcap has been stagnanat for nearly 4 months. Nobody has real FOMO for anything. There is no new money coming in right now. Be patient. Out of the top 100 coins, there's probably less than 5 that have significantly diverged from the rest of the market and made real gains. Everything else is moving up and down together. My whole life revolved around Crypto last year but I have not even logged into a exchange or open a wallet in 5 months now. 

&gt; Even if the ban is removed, Koreans still don't care about ICX so they won't rush to buy it. Any buying will come from Westerners who cause a mini pump on Twitter and the likes. It will probably dump after it pumps for a day or two.
Investor sentiment is low in the entire market. 

It is irrelevant whether or not Korean speculators and crypto kids like ICON or not. It's quite literally irrelevant. I don't know why people bring this up. No chinese bitcoin forum or anything was talking about Antshares (Neo) at any point in any significant amount last year when it had its largest pumps. No chinese or south korean forum or people I spoke to even knew what Waltonchain was and it did just fine. Koreans don't give a shit about fundamentals and invest in whatever is the flavor of the month like ripple or EOS. ICON will not get Korean's attentions until it is significantly up the tier list in the top 100 or they're forced to learn about it through ICON's adoption. The Koreans I've spoken to are done with Crypto in general, they consider it a 2017 trend. It's all about hype and trends in Korea and nothing based on fundamentals or potential. I know I am generalizing *alot* but they are known to be a trendy culture.

&gt; ICON, which has a bad rep amongst crypto enthusiasts due to their delays, ERC-20 bug, and price that plummeted.

Sure maybe it has a bad rep for idiots on /r/cc, but among the smarter and wealthier investors I've met during the past year and a half, ICX is very much on their radar and they have been accumulating. These investors don't give a shit about a delay, and no sensible investor cares about the ERC-20 bug, they don't even remember it. These things don't *matter*. ICX goes into their cold storage.

&gt; We saw the massive gains early January when ICX pumped to $12, and we have all been desperately holding our bags waiting for a pump again. That's the truth and reason for our frustration.

Basically your entire argument in a nutshell. Are you even listening to yourself. This is literally the ENTIRE Crypto market right now. Have you checked the rest of the market at all?

So go ahead and sell, what are you going to put it in instead when literally every chart on Coinmarketcap looks the same? You're going to be grasping at straws chasing pumps in this market. You'll literally be gambling at that point. Your greed will destroy you. 

ICON is a solid, *solid* project in this space.

1. There was an agreement on the 6 month forking schedule with a 3 month cutoff and the changes (CTOR plus DSV) had been discussed for a long time. There was no contention and nChain even supported them in a published statement last year.  A week before the cutoff nChain suddenly decided they would do everything possible to block these changes.  The timing felt like sabotage to me.

2. Nchain never gave good reasons for this.  There was either just no explanation or fake explanation (dsv causes loops etc)

3. The Bangkok meeting was held as an emergency effort to avoid a contentious upgrade. Nchain chief didnt listen to other speeches and walked put. Other nchain people essentually refused to discuss anything technical. 

4. CSW banned everyone who disagreed with him from slack and Twitter and created an echo chamber of misinformation.

5. Propaganda (wormhole etc) was deliberately pushed 

6. CSW threatened to 51% attack business and exchanges. Even now he is threatening to censor transactions, etc

I think oftentimes we get lost in the action of the moment, and neglect to step back and take a wider view of markets. Hopefully this post is interesting in light of that.


I know I'm sporting a bear flair right now, but at my core, I'm a Bitcoin bull. I think most people here are, and I think our reasoning for being so is incredibly sound.


Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, world markets have been running through no man's land - a time of unprecedented central bank intervention. The reasoning was simple - the credit freeze spooked the fuck out of every business the world over, and made them paranoid and extremely risk-averse. To combat this, the Fed injected tons of money into the market ecosystem via TARP and the various QEs, intending to make the market environment seem safer and convince businesses to take on greater risks (risk-taking, of course, being the engine of economic growth). On the surface, this worked brilliantly. We've experienced a precedent-shattering bull market, unemployment rates reached historic lows, etc. But if you dig a little deeper, I think this intervention actually completely and utterly failed. Let's analyze what has ACTUALLY happened in major markets over the last ten years. Businesses, still shell-shocked from 2008, seem to have taken safe and easy routes to make money post-2008 - via things like stock buybacks, M&amp;A consolidation activity, etc. Companies were able to buy the outward signs of growth in the easy-money, zero interest rate economy, boosting their share prices easily while not taking on much risk at all. In this way, Fed policy failed - it did generate nominal returns as stock prices went up, but risk-taking behavior actually seems to have gone DOWN. Capital seeking greater returns than the passive growth of the whole economy was forced to look for bigger returns by chasing tech startups, real estate, and riskier niche assets like crypto. There was more money chasing big returns than there were things actually worth those big returns, which left us with wonders like [Juicero, the venture-backed wi-fi juicer company](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16243356/juicero-shut-down-lay-off-refund), the [California housing crisis](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/qvmgem/california-has-a-hidden-homelessness-crisis), and [utterly useless, exit-scamming shitcoins like Oyster Pearl](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/new-crypto-exit-scam-sees-oyster-pearl-developer-create-more-prl-tokens-to-sell-immediately/), respectively. Right now that very same risk-seeking capital is LOVING weed stocks, which are in the process of topping out right now, so check out /r/weedstocks for some cheap laughs. **TL;DR: The Fed's low interest rate policies did not create sustainable risk taking or long term growth. They just fueled market consolidation via balance sheets getting bigger, and sent capital on the fringes into weird corners of world markets, where it inflated all kinds of fun bubbles (crypto included).**


Now, the Fed is raising rates, the ECB is playing chicken with Italy, and the US &amp; China are engaged in a pissing contest over balance of trade. Each of these three are all spooky things that could cause a recession. As we watch US equities markets correct, any one of these dams could burst and become the catalyst that brings markets down. Rate raises could easily kill off some of the US's ""flagship"" companies - [Sears recently filed for bankruptcy](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/business/sears-bankruptcy/index.html) and [GE is looking dangerously close too](https://wolfstreet.com/2018/11/02/what-general-electric-does-to-avoid-question-when-will-ge-file-for-bankruptcy/). In Europe, the populist [Matteo government is threatening a repeat of the 2012 Greece crisis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/italy-eurozone-debt-new-budget-matteo-salvini-five-star-a8566671.html) - but Italy is in a LOT stronger position than Greece ever was, making the outcome possibly dangerous enough to the Eurozone to spark an international crisis. Add the specter of Brexit and the really [shaky foundations of Deutsche Bank](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/967943/deutsche-bank-latest-s-p-global-ratings-Germany-shares-crisis) to the mix, and you have a tinderbox waiting for a match. And don't even get me started on the [US v China trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war) - imagine the absolute chaos that would happen if the PRC manipulated the yuan in an ""unfriendly"" direction. The Chinese government is a *real* whale with *real* power, and they could dump their US Treasuries too to add insult to injury and ruin one of the biggest safe haven assets the world financial system depends on. **TL;DR: There are three really big, somewhat probable ""catalyst"" events that could send world markets into a nosedive.**


The really insidious thing about all of this is that the central bank emperor no longer has any clothes. If unprecedented intervention doesn't prevent the next crisis (or worse, creates an even NASTIER crisis than 2008), it's quite possible that the faith in central banking as a cure-all for crises will be shaken or totally undermined. I'm of the opinion that all that injected capital didn't make our markets stronger - it just subsidized risk-averse behavior and didn't adequately penalize companies for their lack of risk taking. It created paper growth (inflation) and not real growth. Laughably, it also subsidized the creation of [never-profitable behemoth companies like Uber](https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-results/uber-narrows-loss-but-still-a-long-way-from-profitability-idUSL1N1V611I), so it'll be interesting to see how those companies end up in a time of crisis. **TL;DR: The Fed [inflated the USD roughly 17% over the period 2008-2018](http://www.in2013dollars.com/2008-dollars-in-2018?amount=1), for minimal (if any) gains in market strength.**


And that's where Bitcoin comes in.


When the markets finally do get rekt after their 10+ year artificial inflationary orgy, it's *possible* that people will wake up to the fact that we live in inflationland. The illusion of stability and safety will be shattered once again, as will the illusion that central banks can do anything to control or ""tame"" the inherent wildness of markets. Consequently, it's possible that people will lose faith in the greenback as the *de facto* global arbiter of value in this scenario. It's not going to be easy to watch paper ETF gains melt away while companies nominally beat earnings, or watch long term bond holdings start trading way below par. The defeat of the ""central banks are all-powerful"" narrative will send shockwaves through global markets, which will realize that *no one is in control*. Bitcoiners have been adjusting to the realities of a system where no one is in control for some time now, so they'll have a head start. **TL;DR: When markets get rekt, everyone will realize that central banks are just whales, after all. They make waves, but they don't make the ocean.**


Bitcoin (and probably a handful of other non-inflationary cryptos) will benefit the most from this scenario if it happens. An inflationary world where no major currency can be trusted to hold its value long-term will send money scrambling for things with fixed or limited supplies. Precious metals and other commodities will probably also benefit in this environment, as people re-configure their investments to be as close to tangible assets and cash flows as possible. The tail risk of being financially ruined in an inflationary world is worth hedging against, and remains my dominant reason for holding 10% of my net worth in crypto at this time. I assume many of you folks believe the same.


**Whether you're here to hedge against the inflationpocalypse or just to get rich, I wish you all the best of luck in acquiring as many BTC as possible. It's a long road ahead.**

e90z0f6,Der_Bergmann,57,"Hi, this was me --

I didn't expect my tweet to become so popular. If I had, I would have formulated it more careful.

I entertain a very good relationship to German speaking Lightning protagonists, including the head of Fulmo and Christian Decker from Blockstream. I only know them as passionate, friendly, helpful and smart people, which have been nothing but thankful for me criticizing LN. So I would be very sad seeing my tweet abused for politics.

In my tweet I was wrong about having lost every cent. I did not. The only person ever bought something with LN opened a direct channel with me and closed it before the shutdown of my node. So I think this is safe. I received a few tips with LN, maybe a few Euro, and currently I have no idea if I have them or not. Theoretically it should be possible to restore the channels, but practically - I have no clue.

Despite being a ""big blocker"" since 2015, I always investigated LN. I fully recognize its huge potential of being an ultimate scaling solution while securing 0conf and increasing privacy. However, I also think that LN has fundamental properties which will push non-engineerical users to trusted third parties. Most importantly, that you need to be always on and that you need liquidity to receive payments. I also see risks of it becoming permissioned by regulation of LN nodes, and some fancy ways of introducing fractional reserve. But a good outcome of it could be the creation of what David Chaum wanted to build with DigiCash, being an alternative and support to onchain transactions.

Anyway ... I wrote [a German book about Bitcoin](http://bitcoin-buch.org/), the onliest in the world that intensively covers the blocksize wars, the multi-channel censorship of Dragon Den's, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash. The head of Fulmo did help me to bring my book in a bookshop, despite being not happy with what I wrote about the blocksize wars. I thought I needed to say this.

While the Bitcoin Uber Maximalist Saffaiden Something sells his ""Bitcoin Standard"" only against fiat money, I sell my book on my website against BTC, BCH, ETH and EUR. I implemented LN for fun and curiosity, without a middlemen, on a VPS, very basically, in a bad, insecure way, and I was fully aware that I risk to lose everything I receive with it. Right now and for my use cases it is expensive, complicated, insecure, slow, confusing and hardly used. But still, I'll keep it and am excited about every payment that is done with LN. I just hope I still have incoming liquidity ...

This brings up so many questions for Twitter though:

1. Why can verified accounts change their display names? If I verify as ""*Pathe UK*"", why should I be able to change my name to something else and keep the verification without any further checks? I'm no longer ""*Pathe UK*"" - so the verification means nothing.
2. Why isn't 2FA mandated on all verified accounts? The chances are someone running the Pathe Twitter account got lax and was phished, but 2FA would likely have prevented this.
3. These scams have been pretty mainstream since the Bitcoin craze a year ago; why can a tweet that is *so obviously* a scam get promoted? I'm not asking for total human review; but I don't think automatically scanning promoted tweets for similarity to known scams, and then flagging them for manual moderation, is a lot to ask.

e92tm03,samuraikitsune,50,"Let me tell you the story of the bravest fool I have seen!

I go into a raid on Customs, running a scoped Mosin, MBSS and some meds in my pocket and a handful of spare ammo.  Its my first raid of the day and I expect death to approach swiftly as I warm up for the day's actions.  Technically second but I spawned into immediate death as a scav on factory so I don't count it.

As the game starts, I get the military checkpoint spawn.  Dangerous but acceptable so I book it towards gas station, taking a moment to climb the side hill to see if scav boss was present.  As I surveyed the area, I see the hellish glow of the orange grinning mask near the barrier side of the gas station near the bus.  As I scope in to start this shenanigans off, I hear the sound of bushes rustling and look down from my perch to see a juggernaut of a player sprinting head long into the battle.  Its clear murder is on his mind as he immediately  passes the blue fence to start sweeping for enemies.

He immediately engages scav boss and his cronies with a loud, unsuppressed SA-58.  Clearly this man has prepared as he fires for longer than a 30 round could sustain.  With his thick armor and prodigious firepower, he makes short work of the scav boss, durability for tactical movement.  It shows as after he has taken down the lot of guards, he begins to limp towards his kills, not realizing scav boss is not among them.  His first mistake.

As it turns out, Scav boss has gone around the gas station and flanked him, firing, what I would guess, is half a mag into this mighty man before he turns around to dispatch scav boss.  The pumpkin headed man falls, before the car, after the fences and with nowhere to hide while looting.  His second mistake.

 Unfortunately, he and I were not the only factory side spawns and he is set upon by a man wielding an AK105.  I would assume these rounds are not BP or BS as he unloads a full 60 in the direction of our Rambo before being taken down by precise return fire.  After dispatching this foe, he goes about looting the guards instead of further securing the area.  His third mistake.

As if trying to prove armor still has value, the spawns from the opposite side of the river have finally worked their way over and engage this survivor, trading blows and losing soundly against the man with more than enough ammunition to take on the scav population of Tarkov from observations.

the grueling process of taking on, almost the entirety of the Customs spawns has taken him into the 30 minute time zone.  Its clear he has medded up and morphine himself as he is back to walking normally amongst the bodies, collecting their gear but remaining within cover now that he has fought so many.  Still taking his time and being methodical, he goes to loot the AK man who has slid down the hill into the bushes.  which are out of my view but not from a player scav who has managed to also wander up and put at least 2 rounds from his 133 into the man.

Despite all this hell, the man stands up and unloads on the player scav, but with the AK.  It appears his endless supply of ammunition is now spent and he is relying on the weapons he has acquired.  Now, with only 15 minutes left, he makes his way to the true prize.  The untouched, unmolested body of scav boss.  Without checking his surroundings further, he goes prone to loot the body.  His last mistake.

Now in perfect view for me, I fire the only shot I have fired this entire match.  The round screams from the gun, prayer to the heavens for Sergei Mosin to guide its path.  Before this Rambo, this action hero legend can react, he suffers a terminal case of 7.62 to the skull and breaths his last.

Knowing he has done all of the looting and all of the killing, I make way to his body.  His treasure trove is immaculate and I liberate him of his gear and the scav boss' golden TT.  His pockets appeared unmolested as he had only just started to loot when I fired but I found no bitcoin.

Surveying his equipment, the armor was zeroed out set of fresh Gen IV Full protection armor, his Altyn was a shattered mess, most likely even before I shot him as it had diminished into the single digits and I opted to leave it in favor of a Fast MT from his dead opponent earlier.

To all who fought that man, let it be known that someone watched you tangle with a true Tarkovian and to the level 40+ who died so ignominiously, I apologize.  I'm not sorry for what I did, I'm sorry I had to do it.

&gt;The problem is that some are trying to interpret Nakamoto Consensus as *de jure* true, instead of as *de facto* true. But Nakamoto Consensus is a product of engineering, and not a product of an enlightened morality or law.  
&gt;  
&gt;The longest chain is the longest chain. It is the provable product of the most accumulated proof of work. Nothing more. It is only proof that *this* portion of total hashpower considers it to be the valid chain, and that these miners have expressed their agreement by working to extend it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nakamoto consensus doesn't tell us anything about how that chain is valued by the market. We all take Bitcoin Cash to be the most valid chain, and BCH miners show their agreement with the consensus rules by extending the chain. But of course that doesn't change the fact that the market sees Bitcoin Cash to be worth less than 10% of Bitcoin BTC. Now, *we* expect this to change, but it's still the situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;If everyone stopped moralising, stopped trying to say how things *should* be, and just looked at how they are—how Nakamoto Consensus actually works—then this would all appear far simpler. Nakamoto Consensus will give us what it gives us.

Have heard through the grapevine (brokers) there's been a shit-ton of OTC buying as of late and that's pretty bullish to me, in the short-to-midterm.

Equity markets have been getting rocked as of late (all of Oct) and Bitcoin has remained, to my absolute dismay/shock, stable. Not sure how to best interpret this, but to me, this suggests any institutional traders (mainly Asians) who would have otherwise gotten margin-called to post cash already exited the market some while back, and there really aren't any large spot sellers left.

2. From here you would need to sign up for a different exchange, let's say Binance (which is where you will exchange BTC for Nano (NANO)).

3. Once that is done you will send the BTC you bought from Coinbase to your Binance account

4. When that is sent across you will go on Binance and find the NANO/BTC pair (let's you swap BTC for NANO and then buy from there.

Note: 
-keep in mind it might take a few days to sign up with the exchanges. (Also as a side note always activate Two Factor Authentication (2FA) google it if you dont know what that is for security.)
-after you have your NANO you can keep it on the exchange or you can put it in a more secure wallet. Have a look online if you are looking to move it elsewhere.

e923bcg,yuropman,36,"I think you should scrap your new prestige system and build another one. Let me explain the problem with the current prestige system:

You have no real freedom of choice when to prestige. Anything apart from the following and you have lost coins that you will never be able to get back:

1. Prestige with 2 or 3 blocks

2. Prestige with 8 to 15 blocks

3. Prestige with 128 to 255 blocks

4. Prestige with 32768 to 65535 blocks

5. Prestige with 2^31 to 2^32 -1 blocks

6. Prestige with 2^63 to 2^64 -1 blocks

And so on.

This is because you can only prestige a limited number of times (you can only prestige when you unlock a new coin). When e.g. Soulcoin is your highest coin, you can have prestiged at most 5 times - once for Bitcoin, once for Powercoin, once for Spacecoin, once for Realitycoin and once for Soulcoin. It is possible that you prestiged less than 5 times, because you can unlock more than one coin per prestige.

You have to make the most of those prestiges. The first prestige has to happen with 2 or 3 blocks (1 coin) or you're losing that coin forever because you go straight to the second prestige and unlock Powercoin.

The second prestige unlocks at 4 blocks (2 coins). But you can wait until 8 blocks and get 3 coins. If you reach 16 blocks, though, that prestige is lost forever.

The third prestige unlocks at 16 blocks (4 coins). But you can wait until 128 blocks for 7 coins. If you reach 256 coins, that prestige is lost forever. 

If you prestige at 16 blocks, you've lost an opportunity to get 3 additional coins that you're never getting back.

Until Soulcoin, the difference between ""prestige on unlock"" and ""prestige right before double unlock"" is 26 coins (57 vs 31 coins). With entirely possible prestige choices like first prestige on block 16, second prestige on block 65536, you can get to Soulcoin with just 20 coins and then you're expected to climb to the same level as someone who has 37 more coins for upgrades.",2018-11-05 06:45:14

&gt;Cryptocurrency is a brilliant solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

Our money is already digital, in the form of bank computer records, and no one is worried that these records will suddenly disappear.

2. Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit.
3. ""no one is worried that these records will suddenly disappear."" LOL tell that to the people in Italy, and Greece who are having their money basically stolen from their accounts.

Edit: Also, for the people saying ""its just an email address"": Nothing is free. You don't get Q as soon as you sign up, you ""reserve"" yourself some Q for a later date. Their website suggests that they will slowly release the Q to you, after you complete additional tasks. Nothing. Is. Free.

e96f8r8,jtoomim,30,"Satoshi wrote many things other than his whitepaper. Satoshi clearly had a vision for how to scale Bitcoin, and it wasn't Lightning Network or Sidechains. It was to scale on-chain, with SPV wallets to make lightweight access to the blockchain available to users. What we now call full nodes was not something that Satoshi thought the network needed many of.

&gt; It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.

&gt; The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.

&gt; But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster.  When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.

[Aug 12, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg8810#msg8810). 

&gt; The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. 

&gt; The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node. 

&gt; I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.

&gt; At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.

[July 14, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=286.msg2947#msg2947)


&gt; The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

[July 29, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306)

&gt; The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

[Apr 12, 2009](https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4)

&gt; A higher \[block size\] limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK.

&gt;CSW makes other people do all his thinking and debating for him, so he can keep on conning. He is a master at the craft. All so the investors in nChain keep on investing. nChain then invests all over the BCH spectrum and then of course they have to invite CSW to all these conferences.

&gt;That's why you will not hear Roger Ver say: ""He is Satoshi"" or ""He is not Satoshi"" but ""Person A still believes he is Satoshi"". It's always money. Always. I can ask Roger a thousand times to explain why he is doing business with CSW and nChain but he will never answer. The stakes are to high. Apparently in the BCH community there is use for a con man that has indeed fooled some people in to believe he is Satoshi.

&gt;Then there are the Bitcoin Core hijackers who have proven to be quite effective at manipulation themselves. They love the fact that CSW is active in the BCH community and is such a controversial figure and probably do whatever they can to make CSW look as legitimate as possible on the sub here just so they can ridicule BCH later.

&gt;The big problem for 99% of the user space is that we don't have all this knowledge so we are stuck with proxies. People that we trust that we have to believe. That's how so many of us got bamboozled by people like Greg Maxwell and others. We just could not understand all of it, and then it's easy to fool us.

&gt;Keep fighting the good fight and never lose your integrity Vitalik. Like Pirate Rick said: When something is wrong, you speak up! And in crypto, well apparently being wright and wrong .... is sustainable ...

It sounds like he was sort of a unicorn in that he did relatively well during pre-clinical but got caught up on the boards (step 2? probably?). Unfortunately for him, prevention is not an option at this point. **I would aggressively pursue PSLF** and pray that it works and is honored by the federal government. It sounds like he is a public school teacher and would qualify for that. 10 years of payments (with the option of income-based repayment) and the rest would be forgiven. PSLF is truly the only viable option. 

Other than somehow finding some insanely high paying job without taking out more debt this is really the only option. Hell, even a full-time physician would spend YEARS of 6-figure income to repay those loans, let alone an unqualified person with no advanced degree. **The interest alone is $30,000/year or $2500 per month**, and that is without even touching the principal.

e9bu87l,Traditional_Detail,68,"I am a close friend of Kevin's that wrote the script he mentioned and I'd like to clear some things up that I've read.

&amp;#x200B;

**Safeguards**: Everyone should know that protecting yourself from SIM swapping attacks leading into account breaches is much easier than the procedures outlined in the episode. The best (and conveniently, easiest) prevention you can utilize is to use a two-factor authentication app instead of a phone number. These apps (such as Google  Authenticator and Authy) are free, supported by most services, and will save you a lot of hassle. As for other ways of online protection outside of SIM swapping, the best thing you can do is simply exercise common sense. Not using a password that's one of the most commonly used passwords in the world is a good start.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sincerity**: Kevin knew who Alex was and the reach of the Reply All podcast before any recordings took place. Feel free to verify this with Alex himself. Alex said who he was and what he was working on up front. The reason for the attitude shift is because during the first call, there were others listening. Kevin wrongly tried to be the tough guy in hopes to impress everyone. I talked to him right afterwards and he immediately expressed regret as to how he carried himself. I'm not sure how much value my word has here considering that I'm his friend, but the honest truth is that the second conversation and apology were completely sincere.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harassment**: Again, I realize that as Kevin's friend, you may take my word with skepticism. Neither I nor Kevin condone any sort of threats. We both think that SIM swapping is disgusting and vile. He doesn't even sell active accounts. As Kevin said in the episode, when he saw that Lizzie's account was seemingly used, he left it alone. About a month later, the password remained unchanged and the account was deserted. Snapchat sends login notifications and logs users out when someone else logs in. It's easy to tell if you've been compromised. Lizzie essentially admitted that she brushed away the signs, and Kevin could only assume that it was inactive. Only then was it sold. The threatening messages are sickening and likely came from the person that purchased Lizard for a large sum. Kevin just cracked, sold, and forgot about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Miscellaneous**: Lizzie was/is at no risk for giving out her Bitcoin address. They are designed to be public. Individuals that SIM swap are to be called ""hackers"" in the loosest sense possible. It is extremely easy to SIM swap in many cases (which is why telephone companies need to work to address it ASAP). Setting a PIN number is not a reliable means of protecting yourself. Those are easily brute forced, too. You can search for any available public information of yours at data breach websites such as [https://weleakinfo.com/](https://weleakinfo.com/) (paid) and people search engines such as [https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/](https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/) (free).",2018-11-09 10:07:28

I am an American that speaks, reads and writes Chinese, and while I want to see my portfolio increase 20 times, 50, times, or hell even 500 times, this is just some sensationalist recycled OLD NEWS. I don't see any posts that link to an actual Chinese source. Do the authors really think that everyone here is stupid and thinks China is nothing but a bunch of villages, tanks, and The Great Wall?

**I'll just recycle and post what I said 10 days ago:**

Alright, let me shut this m%&amp;$%$#er down before shit gets way out of hand.       

TL;DR - This is a clickbait title, and merchants in China are NOT legally allowed to accept bitcoin and crypto in exchange for a product or service. Nothing changed overnight just because one Judge Judy in a city of 15 million in China made one decision to return property to a person. There are very few places where crypto can be used in China, and IIRC only Hainan Island is one of them. People are totally lost in the mystique about what actually goes on in China / Asia as a whole.

I saw all of Katherine Wu's tweet train from yesterday. Although I speak, read and write Chinese, I'm a lazy guy and didn't care to translate the whole WeChat / Weixin article myself.

Comparable purely hypothetical scenario: Let's say I'm in Kansas where, to the best of my knowledge, selling non-medical marijuana is illegal. Two medical weed dispensaries, Dispensary A and Dispensary B are buying from the same supplier of marijuana, Weed Farmer C. In 2015 both of them sign a contract, unbeknownst to each other, that guarantees they get so much weed from Weed Farmer C. In 2015 Weed Farmer C guaranteed he would give 60% of his weed output to Dispensary A, and 55% to Dispensary B. He is unable to keep up because this is 115% of his overall weed output and in 2018, both Dispensary A and Dispensary B file lawsuits because they don't get their promised product after they pay money to Weed Farmer C. They get put on Judge Judy and Judge Judy orders Weed Farmer C to pay both Dispensary A and Dispensary B 1000 USD apiece, and 50% of his weed production each.

Now Bitcoin in China is not as heavily policed / restricted as weed in America, but I think you guys get the point. It has simply been ruled that bitcoin is not legal tender, but is recognized as a form of property. Does that make sense at all?

The person who made this article took facts way too far out of context. Your local city judge in America is not the president of the united states, and your local city judge / arbitrator in China (no matter how big or influential the city) is not the president or a member of congress of China.

No one is downplaying proof of stake, the issue is that proof of stake doesn't yet exist in any form as a way of reaching fault tolerant consensus, and that the semi-proposals that are being researched have not yet established that they are actually more efficient than proof of work when everything is factored in. For all anyone knows, proof of stake may just move the energy consumption away from raw processing power which can be measured directly, and towards indirect forms of energy consumption in order to actually acquire the kind of Ether needed to stake.

Kind of like how people say Bitcoin wastes so much energy because it's very direct, simple, and straightforward to measure the energy consumption, but don't factor in how much energy is wasted by humans in terms of labor, infrastructure, and other expenditures needed by traditional financial systems. A similar concept applies to proof of stake; people will need to compete for ether and then freeze it in order to participate in the staking; it's very unlikely that the competition to acquire that that ether will require less energy consumption than just doing raw proof of work.

If anything, one benefit of proof of work if Bitcoin is adopted at a larger scale is that it will create huge incentives for people to find and even invent incredibly efficient forms of energy and computing.

Others said that Bitcoin had a different use case. Ethereum is a full superset of Bitcoin's features except it has greater base layer security, more nodes, and many more developers building on it. Ethereum is not just about cryptocurrency as we see it today, it's about a facilitating a better internet through decentralized finance, storage, messaging, and computation. 

The current -and early- incarnation of Ethereum dominates cryptocurrency by all metrics except for market cap. There's nothing for it to prove. People definitely don't realize this. If you look at the Telegram or Discord for any Ethereum project people join up and ask if ""this alt has a wallet yet"" not realizing that they're dealing with an ERC20 like with the majority of projects out there.  


Bitcoin ossification is presented as a strength rather than a weakness, but in its current incarnation it's an unsuitable L1 for just about any scaling solution except for LN in that there is (at least so far) no way to have an L2 that is cryptographically secured by the base chain and has aligned economic incentives (i.e. adds to base chain security.) Just think about how RSK is still being hyped in the same way as colored coins and still nothing meaningful has been delivered after all these years. Right now the principal use case for Bitcoin is trading on trusted centralized exchanges where most buyers never touch the chain - they just have a digital IOU on a centralized database. Unless you're going to cold storage, why bother using the chain anyways? It's not Ethereum, so there's not much you can do with the network.

Beyond this, the Bitcoin proof of concept was just about decentralized trustless value transfer. This was revolutionary, but if you're betting that's where all of this ends then you're saying that this technology is of limited worth in the end and all the developers working around the clock today are wasting their time.

Start sifting through the Devcon4 talks - the goals and aspirations of this project are far loftier than anything else in the space. If I fault those working on this project on any one particular thing it's not communicating this vision clearly, but that's improving as of late. Ethereum is our shot at an internet that lets users take back control of their own data instead of us spending our days working and playing on platforms that make their money from selling our private lives.

So, given the subreddit where I'm talking, the short term market is what it is. Cryptotwitter is egregiously stupid. People earnestly try to argue that projects with no support and no development are ""Ethereum killers."" I don't know what'll happen in the short run, but given the scope of the long term vision for Ethereum and how quickly we're advancing, you'll be glad you set some ETH aside in cold storage as more and more people recognize all of the above over the next few years.",2018-11-09 04:40:36

u/Kain_niaK made a post emphasizing not to burn any bridges within our own community as a result of these on going PoSM attacks. - I cannot emphasize how important this view is.

I would assume one thing we can agree on is that the Bitcoin Cash community would like to see a decentralized global monetary system that is not subject to the corruption we’ve come to accept that comes with traditional monetary systems.

No matter the outcome on BCH, we all have the same goal. I think that is important to remember.

It seems this new attack is an attempt to separate the community from the inside (trolls posing as supporters - promoting a divisive narrative), this strategy was outlined by Cobra-Bitcoin.

e9fh2iy,bat-chriscat,25,"Just read the whole thing. On the Bitcoin maximalism and Lightning Network, please see Brendan's countless arguments with BTC maximalists and Lightning Network advocates on Twitter. I will not rehash that horse here. 

However, here are some further reasons why we utilize BAT and not a more general purpose crytocurrency:

1. User growth pool (UGP) so that we can give tokens to users and bootstrap the system;
2. Have a say over the basic properties of BAT, like total supply, non-mineability, etc. Even ETH's basic properties may change (capping supply is still up for vote), which makes its future and stability very uncertain;
3.  Part of the grand vision is to see BAT technology accepted as a web standard for digital advertising and online micropayments. Digital advertising has no standards and consists of a mashup of various web technologies that were never intended for digital advertising (&lt;img&gt;, cookies, etc.). Note that it's not called ""Brave Attention Token"" but ""*Basic* Attention Token"" for neutrality's sake. It needs to be about attention qua attention, not about Bitcoin or gas for trustless/decentralized computations.
4. Branding and perception. Basic Attention Token is about attention; Bitcoin and ETH are not. This matters deeply to mainstream advertisers and publishers who live and work in the real world. Advertisers and publishers are happy to work with a new rewards program or ""Air Miles on the blockchain."" However, they are extremely uncomfortable working with general purpose cryptocurrencies, especially when they have questionable histories in the public mind (see [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace))). 
5. Decoupling: Creation of an attention economy that's insulated from the whims of a more general purpose cryptocurrency. One does not, in principle, want to be tied to Bitcoin qua Bitcoin events or ETH qua ETH events. For example, what happens in Bitcoin mining politics should be completely irrelevant to the attention economy. 

&gt;Is Basic Attention Token a middleman (1)?
This one is easy — yes. In section 4 of their terms of service:

This signifies a misunderstanding of what BAT is trying to achieve.

BAT is obviating the need for many of the columns in the Lumascape (these middlemen). [See here](https://www.google.com/search?q=lumascape&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDic7OqcreAhUQ3FMKHUufCkAQ_AUIEygB&amp;biw=1385&amp;bih=772). It obviates the need for them by moving all of the logic and services they provide onto the client—i.e., where they ought be from a technological point of view. The forest of middlemen we have today is a result of building things the wrong way from the get-go (i.e., server-side digital ad tech) and applying bandaids over bandaids without ever resolving the root problem. BAT helps clear away technologically unnecessary middlemen who introduce needless inefficiencies and *harms* into the system. 

For utopians: Brave is a ""middleman"" in the sense that it helps connect advertisers to a network of users and publishers. It is not a pure DAO. But even CryptoKitties, a genuine dApp, takes a fee when you play CryptoKitties in order to pay their developers. If you don't find CryptoKitties' ""middleman"" status problematic, then you shouldn't find Brave's.

&gt;Does Basic Attention Token Track? Basic Attention Token’s organization does indeed poll data from Brave Browser users. Voting data comprises of the websites a person visited, and how much time they spent on each site. Using this data, Brave calculates payouts.

**Egregiously false**. All of this done behind Zero Knowledge Proof protocols (in this case, ANONIZE2), which *mathematically guarantee* anonymity. A statement like this is pure negligence.",2018-11-11 02:31:52

e9i41cs,ente_,236,"A small note on bitcoin transactions, screenshots and ""anonymity"", or pseudonymity: you seem to try to hide your bitcoin addresses, with blacking out all but the first few letters. Still, you leak too much info in that screenshot. The first three letters (excluding the leading '1') will most often be enough to pinpoint any address in the blockchain. You show even more than that. Then, with showing many used addresses, even the first letter (after '1') would be enough to identify them, by looking for related address groups matching the letters. You indirectly give hints to narrow down the time they were used too. Now, you also show significant data with up to 8 digits on the amount of bitcoins in single addresses. With that, it's one simple query in the blockchain to find several of your addresses. Finally, showing the full summed up balance, one could probably find a set of addresses loaded within a month which add up to that exact sum.

I don't think it matters too much here, or in most posts where someone leaks too much info. I try to warn, so they don't rely on failed anonymity for whatever reason they tried to achieve it.

2) Don't trust any of this software on your computer or cell phone . Use another computer , linux usb live drive, or VM instance

3) don't use online web wallets to claim , only use offline wallets

--------------------------

Start with the highest value split altcoin first -

e9jiwfh,almkglor,45,"Not a developer but I do have some ears near them.  The below are very likely to get into the next ""really major"" release:

1.  Schnorr signatures.  Multisig becomes as cheap (in terms of signatures needed) as singlesig.  Also some nice techniques such as Scriptless Script become possible.
2.  `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`.  This will allow Lightning to switch to Decker-Russel-Osuntokun ""eltoo"" update mechanism instead of Poon-Dryja ""punitive"" update mechanism.  The main improvement will be that ""toxic waste"" (i.e. old channel states which could cause you to lose money if they get out, or if you accidentally use them (i.e. restore from backup)) do not exist under eltoo.  Routing is slightly more difficult under eltoo.
3.  Taproot.  This will let you select either a signature (single or multisig with Schnorr) or a script (which itself may require signature, or signature plus some data) to spend a coin.  The interesting thing is that if you take the signature path, then the script is never revealed and nobody else becomes aware of it.
4.  Dandelion.  This will change transaction propagation to make it harder to trace who first broadcast a transaction on the Bitcoin fullnode network; privacy improvements on the blockchain currently can be bypassed by just figuring out which fullnode first broadcast a transaction, so further privacy improvements kinda need this as a prereq.

The below have more problems and might not make it to the next ""really major"" release:

1.  Graftroot.  This will let you sign a script.  The script can then be used to spend the output.  You can sign multiple such scripts, and once one of them is revealed and the script fulfilled and the output is spent,  the existence of the other scripts becomes moot and nobody knows that they existed.  Or you could just sign a transaction normally, and hide the existence of the other scripts.  However, there are some complications in the interaction of Graftroot and signature aggregation (I'm not qualified to discuss them, sorry; it involves math I don't know).
2.  MAST.  This lets you create a script with multiple possible branches, and only reveal one of them.  Has a lot of overlap with Taproot and Graftroot, so it's actually not being very promoted anymore.
3.  Signature Aggregation.  This will let you spend multiple outputs while only creating a single signature, by using Schnorr multisig to combine the public keys for each output.  Has some complications in the interaction of Graftroot and signature aggregation.

Mining a 32MB block is fine of course but doing 0-conf at those doesn't seem possible in our testing.

The current approach by the ABC and BU teams has been to resolve scaling issues before updating the *default* max block size. In contrast, the Bitcoin SV development roadmap increases the default block size first before it's actually capable of handling it properly. We've heard people argue this point but I'm not sure if they've actually tried doing 0-conf at these levels as currently only Bitcoin Unlimited 1.5.0+ has been able to handle 0-conf on blocks &gt;3MB on our systems, and even then it required a custom configuration by our team to get it to perform how we expect.",2018-11-13 14:05:38

All these will change though, eventually. But it's just a tough climb. Kudos to brainblocks for trying to make a cheap fiat gateway happen but it's really not their fault if they have to charge 3-5% fees for it.

* Fact: Craig lived in Australia during the Satoshi period.

This marketplaces exists quite long already, but what is new is that they have now a bank licencse which enables them to install Bitcoin ATMs in Germany. In the past it was not possible to install Bitcoin ATMs in Germany because only banks are allowed to do this. Now, we might see the first time Bitcoin ATMs in Germany.

Edit: After reading various sources it seems that they plan much more than just installing ATMs. For example, they also want to become a full exchange like Kraken or Bitstamp. Only with a bank lisence they are allowed to do this. They can start with all their plans mid 2019, cause an authoriy needs to agree to this.

e9p2gm2,imBobertRobert,80,"Mining cost is really dependent on a lot of things. 

If you're a Joe schmoe with an average gaming setup in the middle of suburbia, you wont break even ever. 

If you're some min-maxing venture capitalist with a keen eye for crypto currency, with a warehouse getting lowest-possible electricity and 2,000 Bitcoin ASIC machines, then you can probably break even for quite a while even now. 

The profitability comes down to a lot of issues, and for most people even just one issue means they shouldn't bother mining. 

1. Electricity. Bitcoin mining is wildly inefficient as far as power consumption goes. This is exacerbated by the fact that being in the wrong state or city can make or break your profitability, let alone the efficiency of your equipment. 

2. Cost of startup. Those ASIC mining rigs are damn expensive and can take years to pay off for some of the entry level ones. Unless you can get a discount buying in bulk, and are able to choke down thousands and thousands of dollars of capital until you break even, you shouldn't mine. Dont even think about mining with graphics cards for straight bitcoin, that hasnt been profitable in 5+ years. Other cryptos you can only mine eith graphics cards, but those are still price-inflated since the last bitcoin bubble and are far less energy efficient per dollar compared to an asic machine. 

3. Difficulty. Bitcoin mining gets more and more ""difficult"" to mine as time goes on, and as more people start mining. This means that your profitable rig from 2 years ago might not make a profit anymore. It's also difficult to calculate where it's going to go in the future, so even a $50,000 ASIC setup might never break even if the difficulty gets too crazy for it. 

4. Inconsistent value. If the price of bitcoin is trending down, you wont make as much even if you sell right when you mine it. Even if the difficulty didnt change, if the price becomes too low you might not break even. 

5. Other cryptocurrencies are way more profitable. This is like buying a Lamborghini and complaining about fuel economy. The best way to mine bitcoin is usually to mine other, newer cryptocurrencies and convert it directly to bitcoin on an exchange. Hell, some mining pools do this for you automatically. Besides, some currencies like to skyrocket outside of what bitcoin does, so it could be more worthwhile to  hold onto some as well. 

Bitcoin is pretty unpredictable and while it's fun to watch, it's hard to invest well with it. Personally I think it's best to mine other coins on the side with a personal gaming computer (that i already have) and only run it when I'm not using it. That way I can still make some passive money that barely breaks even (not like I use it to pay the Bill's anyways) and sit on incase bitcoin ever decides to rebound. It worked for me last year, and my $200 worth of bitcoin from a few years ago became well over $3000, and some random coins totalled another $6000. I would never ever ever recommend buying bitcoin to sit on, it just seems too risky. ",2018-11-15 03:38:44

EDIT: Speculation that Coingeek is lying in wait with hashpower and will reorg the ABC chain, Ryan wants it

EDIT: Roger confirming that [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) does have 4Eh online, roughly 1/10 of Hoover dam power consumption

EDIT: ABC chain 6 blocks ahead at this time, Craig Wright coming on livestream LOL

EDIT: Coingeek mined a 27MB SV megablock, Krawisz on livestream, Craig inbound

EDIT: Thanks for the silver!

EDIT: Vitalik joined to congratulate, he says SV's 128MB blocksize is absurd, Naomi Brockwell waiting

EDIT: Ryan claims that Coingeek still could be pre-mining a reorg but this is dismissed by most

EDIT: Lots of celebration and laughter, ABC still 6 blocks ahead

EDIT: 2 quick SVpool blocks mined 8MB and 0.7MB blocks, still 4 blocks short of longest ABC chain

EDIT: Aaron von Wirdum arrived, claims BCH forks are a problem, deadalnix also live on stream

EDIT: deadalnix explained CTOR, questions from audience

EDIT: Ryan successfully argued Aaron about the failures of BTC

EDIT: deadalnix says he thinks Coingeek will bring 2Eh online for a 51% attack soon, ABC 3 blocks ahead

EDIT: Yep, Coingeek mined a 30MB SV block, *SV only 2 blocks behind now*

EDIT: 8MB block from [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com), ABC lead back to 3 blocks

EDIT: Naomi here and congratulating, still lingering concerns of possible attack

EDIT: Haden feeding chickens, Chris Pacia online now.

EDIT: SVpool and coingeek mined 2 blocks, *ABC only one block ahead now,* mempool down to 46k

EDIT: Naomi and Kain discussing liberty and attacks on privacy

EDIT: Discussion of payment network limitations, ABC needs a block, *SV chain even length*

EDIT: chains even, discussion is happening, mempools are emptying out, mining is neck and neck

EDIT: Craig Mason discussing forks and blocksize, Emin Gun Sirer arrives, says Craig is mostly a media guy

EDIT: Emin says SV is waiting to launch guerilla attacks but there are countermeasures in place

EDIT: Good points from Emin about reorgs, ABC could reorg back SV attack with 4Eh

EDIT: ABC 3 blocks ahead, suggestions from Chinese blogger about SV ""shadow mining"", waiting for reorg

EDIT: ABC blocks very small, mempool is empty, SV blocks are large (18-32MB)

EDIT: BCH trading suspended on Binance?

EDIT: ABC 9 blocks ahead again, hardly any onchain transactions likely due to the hard fork

EDIT: Ryan is back shilling for a 51% attack, claiming that ABC will need to change PoW due to an SV reorg

EDIT: Craig Wright rant being re-broadcast, no commentary

EDIT: ABC chain pulling away with a 12 block lead

Also Ryan X Charles says [moneybutton.com](https://moneybutton.com) is replaying all BCH transactions on the SV chain. Seems like an attack but he thinks this is a good idea.

e9ss0ge,ApexEunuch,56,"Because of D601 Bitcoin Cash's difficulty adjustment is a moving average over the last 144 blocks (which takes around 24 hours to mine). This means that when bitcoin.com's temporary hashpower goes back to BTC after the announced 24 hour period the ABC chain will have a much higher difficulty than the hashpower available. So it will take much longer than 10 minutes between blocks on the ABC chain during approximately 24 hours. Meanwhile the SV chain will keep producing blocks every 10 minutes on average as normal (assuming they keep the same hashpower as now).

Therefore I expect the reverse situation tomorrow, where SV is 45 blocks ahead of ABC. Unless bitcoin.com's purpose was to buy time for Jihan or someone else to add a lot of hashpower to ABC tomorrow today's movement of hashpower from BTC to BCH was pointless. I doubt SV will give up after just one day so they will quickly catch up to the amount of work on the ABC chain.

Some background on Craig’s claim of being Satoshi, for the uninitiated:

1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)
2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)
3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)
4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 
5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)
6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)
7. He faked a bitcoin trust to get free money from the Australian government but [was caught and fined over a million dollars](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445140/Exhibit-12). 

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
2. He is not [technically competent](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/96u1ft/invested_15000_in_crypto/e44er19/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=btc&amp;utm_content=t1_e6gehy3) in the subject matter
3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)
4. He [called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space
5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014

e9v9i7c,Kirk_Kerman,86,"It's complicated, but essentially people spend a huge amount of computing work on trying to get semi-specific outputs from hash functions, and once those input-output pairs are verified, the cryptocurrency network automatically rewards the person who discovered the pair with some tokens, which in this case are Bitcoin. 

Hash functions are computing functions which give a unique output to every unique input, and put out the same output every single time for that input. Further, it's effectively impossible to take an output and find the input that created it.

Based on that fact, crypto networks will give a ""shape"" of an output, and every mining computer then does extremely intensive mathematical work trying every conceivable brute-force input until it finds the correct one by pure luck, at which point every other computer in the network verifies the input/output pair and the network itself awards the currency.

You can be upset that it happened, but you can also be encouraged that this idea was powerful enough that people would defend it. Not just with thoughts and prayers (ugh) but actions and resources. And it's because of one simple reason:

Bitcoin is Worth Fighting For.

People need the power that comes from controlling your own money. Some people need it desperately. And it's painful to see it set back, to watch it manage to swerve and hit every single obstacle in its path, but the damn thing keeps going forward, because bitcoin is worth fighting for. I don't see another coin with the same potential to become a true decentralized global currency, even today, even now. I suspect things are going to suck for a while still. My gut says we're not going to see another big breakout until the next halvening, but just keep plugging away. Even though it may not feel like it we're closer to the dream today than we were yesterday. The road to a global, decentralized, permissionless digital currency was never going to be a straight line, but we'll get there in the end.

Because Bitcoin is Worth Fighting For.",2018-11-17 07:12:26

What is the best article to learn more about this nonsense.  I get the concept of a secure currency that doesn't exist physically, what little money I have is exactly that really, but always viewable by my credit union and the government.  What I don't understand is where the new currency actually comes from in the crypto schemes?

e9vaie0,sacwtd,48,"So crypto currency depends on the block chain. It's literally a ledger of accounts, in blocks, that are all linked together. I want to send you some money, I record it in the block and now everyone knows I have some less and you have some more.

But we have to do this in a way that I can't then change the ledger and take the money back. So lots of computers around the world all keep a copy of the same ledger, so we can all agree that it's right. But we want to control how fast these blocks are made so that everyone stays on the same page.

So every block has to have a math problem solved to make it valid. The math problem is one that is hard to solve, but easy to check. For Bitcoin, you take the hash of the block, the hash it again, and the result has to be less than some number, the difficulty. If it's not, you change a nonce value and try again. Statistically, this takes a while. If the network starts solving them too fast, the network adjusts the difficulty.

Why would anyone do this? Whoever wins getting the block solved first out on the network gets awarded transaction fees plus a few bitcoin that are created out of thin air for the block. Over time, the amount of Bitcoin any block produces goes down. There will only ever be a fixed amount of Bitcoin created.

At  5000 km from the center, which is 1/3 of the way down through the lower mantle, the temperature should be 2600 C, the pressure  60 GPa, and the rock's density 4.6 kg/L.  

Since the density of Bitcoin, as specified in the whitepaper, is adjusted every 2 weeks to approximate that value, and the coin is digital gold (melting point 1064.18 C, boiling point 2970 C at 1 atm), we can deduce that, if it were to sink to that depth, it would have sufficient liquidity to separate from other altcoins in its pure metallic state, as it was designed by Satoshi.

Character matters.  

Adam Back &amp; Blockstream programmers were smart &amp; talented, and they infiltrated, hijacked, and sabotaged Bitcoin.

If a smart &amp; talented person is untrustworthy, and you let them into your home, then their intelligence &amp; talent become weapons pointed at your head.

Bitcoin has lost years of development because of repeated infiltrations from toxic actors - Blockstream, and now CSW/BSV.  All it takes is one terrorist bomber to take down a plane full of geniuses.  

Given the repeated &amp; crippling infiltrations from toxic actors, I think it would be prudent for the BCH community to pay closer attention to character, rather than welcoming everyone no matter what.

It is not for humans to stare at a screen and react emotionally to numbers changing. Yes, I know, losing money affects your real life and can have detrimental effects. To make peace with losses, you must accept that every day is a new beginning. Not for trading, but for life. Every minute on this earth is precious and worth fighting for. Forget about trading and go after the passion you feel, the girl you want, the goals you aspire for. I have gone from broke to multi-millionaire to more broke than I was before. After much regret and depression, I've come to terms with it. Every experience is better than no experience. Even if you did not gain monetarily from this, you gained something. You have a story to tell, a memory to look back on, an emotion that you've never felt before. It's all part of the cycle of life and it manifests in different ways. There is no trading advice here, just a sobering message that no matter how much money you make or lose, when you are old and dying none of it will matter. You've won't remember the job you had, your accomplishments, the money you made. You will remember peaceful and serene moments in which you were whole and not thinking, laying in bed with a beautiful girl, hanging out with friends you felt true brotherhood with, looking into the eyes of someone you trust and having a heart to heart. Yes I am drunk right now, but it doesn't invalidate my message. Every minute spent worrying about price and charts is a minute wasted in the cosmos of life. HODL is the best strategy not because it produces the most gains but because it allows you to be free of the prison of charts, trading, and analysis.

Top that off with the last year and a half completely tarnishing the crypto name for investors and average people looking to make a buck. Why the hell would anyone ever get back into this?

With Bitcoin, the need for a middle man was removed. It enabled the ability to have true P2P electronic cash.

        ""height"": 557319,
        ""hash"": ""000000000000000001ae1a2eeda841d099e85b00b29a8f84bdd4f58e380338de"",

        ""branchlen"": 2,
        ""status"": ""valid-fork""
      },
    ....

Block 557299 had two children. Both of those children had children. One of the grandchildren of 557299 was sterile, generating the orphaned block 557301 with hash ....2f70 shown here. The other branch of the fork had more children, and eventually won the orphan race.

This is far from the only orphan race that BSV has had, but this is the first one that took 2 blocks to resolve. Since the Nov 17th stress tests started, SVPool alone has had [5 orphan blocks](https://pool.svpool.com/). They represent about 25% of the BSV hashrate, so if their orphan rate is representative of the network, it would predict about 20 orphans overall, or an orphan rate of 4.6%. An orphan rate of 4.6% is consistent with an average block propagation latency of 28 seconds: `1-e^(-28/600.) = 0.04559`. The 354 blocks produced on SV in the last 3 days have had an average blocksize of 5.018 MB. An average of 28 seconds for 5 MB indicates an average block propagation speed of 0.18 MB/s. This number is quite poor; in comparison, we noticed about 1 MB/s during the Sep 1 stress test. The low performance is likely due to mempool desynchrony issues with Bitcoin SV due to CPU saturation from the single-threading of net_processing.cpp code and the INV_BROADCAST_MAX bug.

It is not my belief that this chainsplit was due to malicious miner activity. I believe this happened on their own due to poor management of the stress test transactions.",2018-11-20 02:55:30

Sure one can cite regulatory actions or what have you, but such observations often end up mistaking correlation with causation.

This boom and bust does, however, match up well with the famed Wall Street Cheat Sheet of market cycles. In that vein, as far back as February, r/ethtrader OG ~~u/~~ Bitcoin Schmitcoin (who know prefers tweeting @BTC_Schmitcoin) foreshadowed the distinct possibility of BTC retracing back to $4,400 in this context, bringing ETH down with it at the end of a market cycle.

In light of these observations I am skeptical of price - at this early stage of the game anyway, and particularly in over-extended markets like this one. Instead I prefer to track developer activity in the space - which based on news from Devcon4 seems more active than ever - as a more accurate gauge of ETH’s worth.

The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had ~~four~~ five major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.


The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)

This makes it more difficult to integrate into wallets, exchanges, and other applications. It also means the scaling issues of bitcoin are magnified to some extent with Monero.

Currently Monero relies on scheduled hard forks to upgrade the network. As we've seen recently with bitcoin cash ABC/SV, contentious hard forks can be harmful to a coins reputation and value. As long as there is broad consensus among the community as to the direction of XMR, we won't have problems. However, if Monero grows to the size of bitcoin we should expect conflicts the same way bitcoin faced them. Governance is one of the problems that other crypto projects (Dash, EOS, Cardano) see as a problem they are working hard to solve.

That's about 200 MW of datacenter capacity which all came online at once. Given that most Bitcoin datacenters are in the 2 to 20 MW range, and that building something of that size requires a year or longer, I find it quite surprising that all of that hashrate would come online in one week. It was like they flicked a single switch exactly 1 week before the fork. Hashrate rentals are a far more parsimonious explanation for this data than actual hardware.

Stacked chart version: https://imgur.com/ygDmqse.png

Line graph version: https://imgur.com/OeWlXKr.png

The stacked chart indicates that SVPool's early hashrate (Nov 1-8) came from CoinGeek directly. This is not a surprise, since CoinGeek owns and operates SVPool. They probably decided that it looked better to have their 2.7 EH/s of hashrate split between two pools instead of all in one place.

Mempool did not exist until 11-10. I suspect that CoinGeek wanted to split its hashrate up further because they knew that a blockchain with only three pools (two of whom were owned and operated by one person) is not very reputable.

Data source: https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/minerhashratesv (xls download)

Spreadsheet I made from that with graphs: https://toom.im/files/sv_hashrates.xlsx

Edit: Some people are claiming that they could have just moved hashrate over from BTC. However, CoinGeek &amp; Co repeatedly claimed that they were all-in on BCH and did not have any BTC hashrate, and also claimed that they did not rent hashrate. Either way, they appear to have lied.

ea6pc00,froggleblocks,41,"Trying to predict this, like trying to predict almost anything to do with cryptocurrencies, is a fools errand.

However it is easy to track how the decoupling is going, use this site: [https://enroyd.com/xrp\_correlations/](https://enroyd.com/xrp_correlations/)

The graph shows the 30 day correlation between XRP and BTC price movements. Values above 0 shows the degree to which XRP is moving in the same direction as BTC prices (either up or down in tandem), and values below 0 shows the degree to which XRP moves in the opposite direction of BTC prices (so when BTC goes down, XRP goes up, or vice versa). Values around 0 shows that when BTC price moves, XRP stays steady, or alternatively that when XRP moves up or down that the BTC price is staying steady.

When we get a sustained period of the XRP correlation being in the range of -0.25 to +0.25, we can start to think that XRP has decoupled from BTC. The question is 'how long' should this period need to be - IMO I think on the order of 2-3 months would be a very strong signal that the XRP market is largely decoupled from the BTC one.

There is also one other very obvious signal that prices have decoupled, and that's if the market cap of XRP overtakes the market cap of bitcoin. IMO that is probably still 12+ months away.

**Edit:**

Just to clarify, there should always be some degree of correlation between the major cryptocurrencies, assuming they are genuine markets that trade independently (and not heavily manipulated behind the scenes, which may be a bit of a stretch to assume for cryptocurrencies). This is because there are events that can weigh down (or boost) the sentiment of the market across all currencies, just like there is in the real world - then there is bad economic data, shares in IBM, shares in Ford and shares in JP Morgan are all likely to go down at the same time, because they're all linked in some way to the real economy and so when it does badly, they all get negative sentiment. But other times, only shares in IBM might go down if there is bad news specifically about the tech industry while the other stocks remain unchanged.

So announcement of a cryptocurrency ETF might rise the prices of all cryptocurrencies in tandem and that's fine. Or resolution of whether XRP is a security or not via a court case will likely increase the price of XRP and have a small halo effect on to other cryptos (or perhaps depress the prices of other cryptos as people sell them to buy XRP).",2018-11-22 04:50:02

eaa82lw,EvanVanNess,93,"&gt; ETH: Vitalik says in every interview that he is not controlling Ethereum anymore and that all recent major decisions were made without his involvement. And how he is happy about it.

He's purposely trying to stay out of all governance decisions, particularly ones that are non-technical.  This has been happening for years.  He's 100% engaged in helping Eth 2.0 become reality
 

&gt; ETH: Majority of ether holders and redditors are for issuance reduction to 1 ETH, but developers have decided otherwise.

Citation needed, and it needs to be much better than a coinvote that no one participated in where you could only use MEW/MyCrypto.  In fact, everyone I know was in favor of reducing to 2, and regardless, there should be a risk-aversion when it comes to issuance reduction.

&gt; ETH: Issuance reduction requires changing one single line of code, but it's just too risky. Seemingly, more risky than creating from scratch completely new Ethereum 02.

The vision has always been that we'd build Eth 2.0, because Ethereum is about creating a decentralized version of the internet.  Ethereum has a much bigger vision than Bitcoin and if it succeeds should be worth magnitudes more than Bitcoin which focuses only on 21 million with tons of uncertainty about whether it is possible to have a secure network.  I actually wrote on this general topic here: https://www.evanvanness.com/post/180338466391/bear-markets-are-useful-for-examining-theses

&gt; ETH: Issuance reduction is just a several months away, but the goalpost is shifting again and again.

It's coming imminently.  It didn't happen already only because there was a consensus issue in the upcoming hardfork.

&gt; ETH: Now we are told that POW will run along POS, ""for a foreseeable future"".

It's been part of the transition plans for a long time.  Maybe 12 months now?

&gt; ETH: ProgPOW plans are not discussed on developers meetings anymore. Why? Just because.

Two reasons: 1) ProgPOW was a proposal, but it wasn't a solution that could be taken off the shelf and immediately stuck into production.  Work had to be done.  Which leads to reason 2) it's being evaluated technically.  You can't rush into things just because someone on the internet thinks that things should move faster.

&gt; ETH: ""Issuance cut would reduce number of miners. Risk of 51% attack!"". But developers doing things that good for miners only (high inflation, no ProgPOW) is OK, it's not a 51% attack.

Actually, as a community we've chosen to reduce mining rewards and also move forward with ProgPOW.   At this point, it's hard to believe that you are doing anything other than deliberately concern trolling.

&gt; ETH: Users, getting tired of broken promises, are losing faith in Ethereum and leaving. Market share of Ethereum have dropped from 32% to 9%.

Markets are irrational.  Tech progress is hard.  I don't see any other basechain that is live right now that is making any serious progress at scalability except by compromising massively on decentralization.  And if you compromise on decentralization, then you just have a terribly crappy database.
 

&gt; ETH: Just yesterday it was a thread here, about all this concerns, about the need to reduce issuance, to cut inflation. Today the thread have mysteriously disappeared. Deleted by moderators. ""Because it's offtopic: price was mentioned"".

No idea what thread you're referring to, but yes, things that discuss price generally get removed.  See the forum rules on the right.  This has consistently been the rule from the early days of Ethereum.

""Kenny, you were the size of a leech. You barely drew blood and killed you by feeding you to the ferrels outside.""

""I just wasn't big enough then. Now that I'm bigger, I can swallow you up and drag you in.""

""Kenny, how can you drag me in when you can't even move?""

""I didn't think I would get stuck!""

""Did you measure the bowl? Come on Kenny this is basic eighth grade geometry.""

""High school taught me nothing! The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell!""

""You know you were taught more than that. You were just a bad student.""

""I'm sorry, I was to busy in high school getting laid and getting paid.""

""Getting paid? Really Kenny? You've been after the same gold coin for 50 years now. You haven't gotten any kind of payment in that time.""

Kenny let out a sigh and looked sad. ""Look man, My wife has taken my kid and is off running all over town at night and leaving my daughter at home alone. The judge won't let me have her because as you so graciously pointed out, I haven't had fruitful work in over 50 years. If I at least eat you then maybe the judge will take pity on me and my daughter and let me take care of her.""

""Kenny, have thought about letting it go? Is the coin really worth all that you are losing seeking it?""

""Look I can't not do it. I have a contract an eternally binding one.  All 500 pieces. And your branch won't even give up the last one. I can't even get new work if this isn't completed because it's on my records that it's incomplete. I can't even change form. I just want to be done with this job. Did you know that demons can't even die? It's just like you killing us up here. We keep coming back. Please man. I'm desperate. Can I please eat you?""

""FUCK NO, KENNY! GET OUT OF MY DAMN TOILET BEFORE I SHIT IN YER MOUTH!""

Kenny sighs and disappears.  

I look at my wedding ring. Then go to my room, my big empty room with my king size bed. Then I walk to my daughters room. Empty. 5 bedrooms, 4 baths, and one lonely man.  I walk out back to the empty pool. My wife and I had always fought over that she never understood why I wouldn't let her fill it up or take my daughter swimming.  

I grabbed the hose and drug it over and turned it on. Then went to my bank. I had enough money these days. I stopped caring about the interest earned off of it after my investments in apple and bitcoin really exploded. Yeah, I might be losing a couple thousand a month, but I really wasn't using it anyways.

When I got back the pool wasn't anywhere close to full, but there he was in his full size and glory. Massive and huge, a terror of the deep, in an inch of water. I walked out on the diving board and looked down at him. 

Kenny didn't even looked at me. ""What do you want Stan? My dignity? Are you going to shoot me for the kicks like you did when you were younger? Or are you just wanting a larger target to piss on?""

""I'm here to end it, Kenny. I'm here to make a deal.""

""What deal could you possibly want to make?""

""I want you to be my vassal. My assist. My business partner. I will give you a home and an income and a place for you and your daughter in my family.""

""I told you, I can't take on new work until I complete my old contract and that my wife has my daughter, damn it!"" Kenny said, fire and tears literally erupting from his eyes. ""Is this what you wanted to do kick me while I'm down?"" 

""No, Kenny. But you will have to go back to high school after we make this deal.""

""I told you! I can't make a deal!"" He thrashed. 

I pulled out the coin and placed it on the diving board. 

""As I said. I'm here to end it, Kenny."" I walked off the board and left the contract on the patio table, by the pool. ""Think about it, Kenny.""",2018-11-23 04:12:31

My general take: I think most ICOs are garbage. I won't miss most of them. However, like that famous saying about speech, I strongly defend their right to exist and I don't like the SEC getting involved in this space. I don't think tokens are securities, Howey test be damned, and I generally agree with the premise of the above article. Note, I have invested in zero ICOs, and so am not even remotely talking my book here.

I also think Bitcoin maximalism is dumb; it's just another form of tribalism, and generally counterproductive. Like the above, I say this as someone who predominantly holds and trades only BTC. Maximalists give alts the same treatment the general public does Bitcoin, seemingly not sensing the irony. BTC was and is king, and if it continues to dominate it will be by its merits, and not by how many people we belittle for investing in ""shitcoins,"" ""btrash,"" etc. While peaceful coexistence may be too much to ask for, the least we can do is try to make crypto less toxic as a community, keep regulations to a minimum, and let the market sort things out on its own.

* [Here is a comparison of the current triangle breakdown compared to 2015](https://imgur.com/a/FMTF7xW) You'll notice the similarities. It didn't have as much of a crazy spike down with the 2nd crash, but it appears to have the same round shaped bottom.

* A year ago when I sold my Bitcoin holdings on the runup, I made rules on what TA signals from the prior bear market to look for during this bear market to buy back in. The first was 1W RSI &lt;30. We hit 32 (close enough for me). The other was 1M RSI &lt;48. We are currently at 46.5.

The reason I grew impatient and bought back in now instead of waiting for one final push below $4k is because every trader in here the past few weeks/months is looking for that nice $3.X price to buy back in.

eab0tiq,[deleted],64,"He is upset about the current method of banking in the world, which is known as fractional reserve banking. It is the concept that banks can keep less cash on hand than they owe in deposits. So if the bank has 100 dollars in deposits, it can lend out, say, 90 percent of them.

The benefits of this are increased economic activity. It allows idle money that is just sitting in an account to be used productively. The downside is that there is a risk of a “run on banks” in which everyone tries to get their money out at once and the bank cannot meet the obligation. The FDIC ensures up to 250 gs though so unless you’re rich you probably don’t have too much to worry about. 

I’m not really sure how Bitcoin is related to this but that is what he is ranting about. I’m not even sure if he understands what he is ranting about. A lot of Libertarian types believe the fractional reserve banking is fraud because technically your money isn’t kept in a lock box waiting for you to claim it. ",2018-11-24 01:36:05

Also: Blockchain is worthless without incentivised tokenisation. Cryptocurrency will either propagate everything or completely disappear, and with it- the digital ledger (blockchain). They're crucial to one another. 

Companies using 'the blockchain' as a marketing tool, creating costly, over elaborate databases with none of the security benefits associated with an actual decentralised blockchain for an audience who haven't bothered to figure out what blockchain actually is. But want to talk about it in a sanitised, benign manner without any of the subversive implications of its actual application. That is the real fad and it will definitely die. It's pointless for all but the most niche applications. It is intranet vs internet.

Nobody really knows wether the technology will succeed at this stage- but so far Bitcoin has been alive and kicking for 10 years having been declared dead hundreds of times, having pumped and crashed multiple times.

eac6w2t,omise_go,53,"Bitcoin is still the Schelling point when most people think about cryptocurrency; but this sort of doesn’t matter. We’re not trying to build a new currency. We’re trying to build a more interoperable, scalable and efficient platform for decentralized finance, among all currencies. 

On Ethereum anybody has the ability to easily issue a token whose value is either dynamic in reference to other assets, or pegged in some way (whether it’s to a Canadian dollar, a loyalty point or a cat); and that token is then free to move about the Ethereum environment. Ethereum will go on about its business regardless of which currencies are most popular or most highly valued. 

Bitcoin is first and foremost a currency, and a network on which to transact with said currency. If Bitcoin as it exists today is to absorb all the world’s transactions, we will first need to see both widespread acceptance of the general concept of decentralized money, as well as widespread acceptance of Bitcoin specifically as the dominant decentralized currency. The volatility of Bitcoin and the technical know-how that is still required in order to use it safely are pretty major impediments to its widespread use as a store of value.

We chose to build on Ethereum because of its potential and adaptability. It isn’t a currency; it’s a platform for applications, and has an incredibly dynamic community of developers working on both the base protocol and a huge array of Ethereum-powered applications. The versatility of function allowed by Ethereum’s smart contracts and token standards allows app builders to meet end users where they are, which makes it easier to reach a wider audience.

OMG and Lightning Network are not apples to apples either. Lightning is a layer 2 scaling solution which allows cheap, fast transactions across bidirectional channels. It’s a clever design but more limited than plasma in the functionality it enables. Plasma is an L2 solution as well - a more robust and adaptable one than Lightning - but is only one layer in OMG’s full-stack suite of tools for accessible, scalable decentralized finance on Ethereum.

In short: this isn’t a single-player game. The success of Bitcoin, with or without Lightning, doesn’t preclude the success of Ethereum or OMG. Ethereum and OMG are multitaskers. Both are designed as platforms on which to build, with support for any and all currencies - including ones that look and act a lot more like the ones that the average consumer is used to dealing with. We think this puts OMG on Ethereum well ahead of Bitcoin in terms of absorbing the world’s transactions.",2018-11-24 12:02:30

I kept 1 whole ether and put another months worth of spending money in, bought a bit of Bitcoin around 6k.

I sold everything when Bitcoin hit 12.5k because I had a feeling after it hit 10k it would go crazy because everyone would see that 5 digit number and buy in, then investment people would dip once they earned a solid 20 percent investment which is really good for like a month.

Sold my ether for like near 800, my litecoin had like quadrupled.

Bitcoin dipped to 9k like I figured, what I didn't think was it was going to come back. And surge as high as it did but whatever.

https://www.hillsdale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FMF-2014-A-History-of-Alternative-Currencies.pdf


Basically it says there have been alternative coins for centuries. There are over 2000 alternative coins today excluding crypto. 

And currencies are classified into National (issued by gov), adopted (another country fiat used worldwide or region wide), parallel currency (used alongside national currency, like gold, metals etc), black market currency (used in black trade) and alternative currency (neither minted by gov or accepted by official) 

The thesis claims all alternative currencies will die because governments will stop them or they wont have adoption 

Now that governments are accepting bitcoin for tax, BTC is slowly moving from alternative currency to parallel currency on par with gold and silver. 

Parallel currencies exist and do not die, because of strong use case and faith in it by sections of society ",2018-11-26 04:04:51

eahugu2,frakilk,76,"I'm not a mod or Nano developer but I'll attempt to address a few of these:

1. Nano team has repeatedly said that [they want to help people move off official representatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/80k39d/change_your_representative_now/duwydfq/).
2. Being fee-less is very different than to having fees. While another coin's fees may seem small to users in some parts of the world, for a lot of countries they matter. And there's nothing to suggest that fees for these coins will not increase over time, Nano will always have zero fees.
3. The ""unconstrained data growth"" data vector will not be an issue when [ledger pruning](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/issues/1094) is enabled.
4. The upcoming Boulton release includes [block cementing](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/pull/1303) which permanently confirms transactions.
5. The [most recent stress test](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9830we/nano_achieved_a_max_of_756_tps_in_the_stress_test/) achieved a high of 756 TPS. I'm sure further stress tests will happen in future once the node software is optimized further.
6. ""if they hold more than 51% of the coins"" - At current market cap that's 68 million dollars worth which you have to buy from existing holders without driving up the price on exchanges. That's a lot easier said than done.
7. I run a node to fetch data for my NanoCharts tool and to help support the network. Many node operators simply run a node to strengthen the network and thus help protect their investment. Many people run Bitcoin nodes even though they are not receiving financial incentive. I think financial incentive to run nodes in other projects will ultimately be their undoing once greed and economies of scale kick in.
8. We're still waiting to hear about an audit and it's frequently requested by the community. In the meantime we can view [hackerone progress](https://hackerone.com/nano).
9. I'd be interested to hear an answer to this also.
10. This is false. Any holder of Nano can choose to assign their vote weight to any other Nano account. You are able to run a rebroadcasting representative even if no other rebroadcasting representative has assigned their vote weight to you.
11. There are many third-party wallets (e.g. Canoe, Natrium, Nanollet, NanoVault, NanoBlocks) so no-one is being forced to use the official wallet.

Close enough for me. I'm [all in](https://i.imgur.com/VlEquII.png) baby. Also bought GBTC below $5. Still expecting more downwards action, cos why wouldn't I. Low $3K at the 200d MA is or previous ATH of $1.2k are fair game at this point. Someone is dumping the shit out of Bitcoin for whatever reason, fundamentally everything's in place. I'll re-evaluate and consider selling some if we get a good bounce, but it's getting risky to scalp as we get closer to the bottom. At the end of the day ask yourself if Bitcoin can reasonably (even easily) capture $1T worth of value. Each unit of Bitcoin represents value so adoption, functionality and price are in sync. Considering how easily Bitcoin can suck the value out of other vehicles used for speculation and wealth preservation (offshore reserves, stock market, equity, gold, real-estate, currency, etc); considering the legitimacy Bitcoin has gained; considering the global reach and ease of access it provides, and the unique utility it offers that's unlike anything else; can Bitcoin capture $1T worth of value? If you think no then you're a fucking moron. At the very least you have to accept that it can, given what Bitcoin is, what we know and the developments in the pipeline. This is not a guarantee though, this is still an experiment so no shit there are risks. Everyone is seeing this play out for the first time, no one is an expert and no one can predict the future unknowns. But I've acknowledged the risk already, and given the circumstances, the potential reward and my risk appetite, I know where I'm placing my bets. If you can't deal with the volatility that comes with price discovery, or don't wanna take a shot at being right in a potential opportunity of a lifetime then that's fine, sit on the bitch boy table. But don't complain about this market or claim that Bitcoin holders just got lucky.


I play the long game and the bear markets are the best. I almost called the bottom last time, not that I'm calling a bottom now, but when it feels right I just do it. Always be accumulating.

[June 29, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3bh2k2/daily_discussion_monday_june_29_2015/csmpdj5/)
&gt;However here is why I think that if you get into bitcoin now (~$250/btc), there is a high chance that you will profit within a year. Meaning that it is more likely, imo, that the price will rise above $250/btc sometime between now and summer 2016, than staying at this level or crashing more indefinitely, even if it takes a few dips along the way. My reasoning is below, feel free to comment if you disagree with my logic



Btw- I installed the Cash App just to make small purchases of $20-$100 a week starting today and thought the rest of the bear season. I know a lot of plebs get discouraged by Bitcoin because they think it won't provide any significant returns, so I want to continue it for 2-3 years and see what it becomes.

&gt;As long as the bear trend is intact, bears have an edge. The cycle was too fast, we might bounce between 7-10K for a while before falling again, but I rather have it be sooner than later. I'm leaning toward the bear side because I want it to happen, because let me tell you something, these are the opportunities that'll make you rich. Crypto is 90% speculation, when bitcoin's at a massive discount--and people have their eyes set on already established 20K-- the fomo is gonna be even stronger. Bitcoin needs to have a speculative edge too, so this is all good for bitcoin^TM

eaieh5n,michaelmclees,72,"I was in the room at the creation of LTC. Chat room on IRC. There were about 5 of us, Charles included. It was a project that forked from Fairbrix, which I released and was flawed and no one knows about. That project was forked from something even fewer people know about, Tenebrix. Check it out on bitcointalk.org if you don't believe me.

I sold all my LTC (23,000) of them, for mere pennies years and years ago under the premise that it was all a fun little one month project, but that ultimately it it would go to zero just like Tenebrix and Fairbrix and the few dozen or so alt coins that existed at the time.

Back then, the blockspace limit was a non-factor in anything anyone was doing. The only way it even came up in conversation was with Satoshidice, where half of the blockchain was filled with losing bet response transactions.

Since then, the picture is different. Charles made a killing - I made almost nothing. He believed in the project far more than I did. When he understood, apparently, that I didn't, is that back then if BTC could be hobbled somehow, then a huge flow of money is going to flee from BTC into whatever alts are available. Not what alts are good and innovated, merely available. Present a plausible case that BTC will be full and unavailable for normal small use-cases and you can push a lot of money into a small cap altcoin.

LTC had one of the first successful launches because most of the other coins were massively premined or centralized (solidcoin) or attacked from the get go. LTC made it through that gauntlet and now is almost as much a part of the cryptolexicon as Bitcoin. I think LTC is near a bottom and the case for it is largely the same as it was a year ago.

Fill up the BTC blocks and all of a sudden you've got a bunch of people will $300 in Bitcoin wondering why they're being asked to pay $34 in fees to move it quickly onto Coinbase. They're going to diversify into thinner markets, LTC being one of the most prominent.",2018-11-27 01:52:08

eamgv3b,GaliX0,63,"Essentially Lightning Network takes the main point of Bitcoin away by creating super Hubs which process payments on a second layer outside the Bitcoin blockchain. These hubs require to have a big Bitcoin token balance in order to make sure they don't run out of liquidity. Therefore big Banks will very likely control these super Hubs. Running these Hubs will also very likely even require you to have a Bank License in most countries.

Bitcoin was envisioned to be a free and peer to peer digital payment system. With super Hubs this not the case anymore you would go back to the traditional baking system with a middle man processing your payment.

There is a constant fight going on between the :

- Bitcoin core fork with small Blocks to make peer to peer payments unavailable/expensive as we saw during the peak of the Bitcoin hype with Transaction fees of 20-55$ for single Bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. This forces people to use these Lightning super hubs because it's to expensive to blockchain.

And:

- Bitcoin Cash fork which kept the old by Satoshi envisioned peer to peer system by increasing the block sizes in order keep transaction fees low. Super Hubs are not required since the blockchain size will scale with the transaction volume.

The /r/Bitcoin sub mods are fighting for Core for years to create the illusion Bitcoin Cash is a scam. They is heavy censorship going on there for quiet some time now. Just mentioning Bitcoin Cash or any free discussion why Lightning Network might cause problems/point of conflict for Bitcoin will give you instantly a permanent ban. Therefore you have a lot of people with one sided information telling you why lightning Network is the very best with no alternative solution.

ealkgpf,Supernova752,61,"Others have explained this poorly - essentially you would have say $250 worth of BTC in your FDIC insured Bakkt account.  You'll make a purchase and scan your Bakkt QR code on your app at Starbucks, and it will and be recorded on Bakkt's ledger and process instantly/seamlessly.  Starbucks can choose to be paid in BTC or fiat.

So essentially Bakkt acts as a second layer, keeping a ledger of all transactions, which lowers transaction costs and keeps the strain off of the BTC network.  At the end of the day, Bakkt can calculate the total(let's say $500k) and move the $500k of BTC or Fiat into Bakkt's account.  Either way, Starbucks receives the money faster and fees will be far lower than 3% from credit cards, which would have been $15k from the same amount paid via credit cards, as well as a 3 business day wait for the funds to release.

So in essence, Bakkt would be acting as a form of the lightning network, and Starbucks could save serious expenses vs. credit cards.  If this system was implemented, Starbucks would likely offer the same(or stronger) incentive program for paying in Bitcoin via their app.  Starbucks is already the leading mobile payment platform in America(bigger than Apple pay... seriously) and would be the ideal testbed for the platform.",2018-11-28 06:39:19

You're comparing a *technology* to *services* and *products*.  We don't see many companies that wait 20 years to have a success products **only because those companies die from lack of revenue first**.  That isn't an issue for bitcoin.  It took us about 100 years between the discovery of the quantum effects to the creation of a quantum computer.  Some things take time.  It'd be like declaring the internet a failure in 1993 (10 years after its founding) because it wasn't already in every household.  Just like the internet, I call it a technology, because bitcoin is a tool that companies can build services on.

&gt;  And after this last $20,000 -&gt; $3,500 crash they are not touching it with a 10-foot pole

You're treating bitcoin like an investment vehicle, which is the same mistake many others make.  The reason it got to $20,000 was because so many people were buying it purely as an investment, and the price went way higher than it should and all those speculators created a bubble, when its actual value is much closer to what it is now.  That is fundamentally NOT what bitcoin is about.  Bitcoin is designed to be a medium of exchange.  You don't hold onto cash expecting it to be an investment.  There are companies out there that facilitate bitcoin purchases without the buyer or seller ever having to touch bitcoins, which is much more in the spirit of bitcoins.  You go to purchase something, and at checkout it just tells you how many dollars you need to spend, which the company then converts to bitcoins and sends to the seller.  The seller can then have his own company convert them to his own currency automatically.  Using that system it doesn't matter what country you're buying from, it can just send the bitcoins to anyone with internet access.

&gt; Isn't it time we accepted that Bitcoin will become the Linux of currencies? That is: though it's free and full of well-intentioned developers and noble and great... it will never surpass Windows.

Linux isn't ""Dead"".  When it comes to servers it may actually be doing better than windows.  I'm not sure why you're making such a big deal out of needing to surpass windows on a specific metric like desktop installs when that isn't even where linux excels the best and calling it dead if it isn't the biggest player on the block.",2018-11-28 01:02:17

eapffgi,Brunswickstreet,166,"So lets try and get this straight. First of all, Cardano has a huge market cap because that reflects the sentiment of investors and speculators towards the project right now and their assessment of the future valuation of the currency. Also proportionally speaking and compared to other cryptocurrencies there is a much larger portion of the coins being held off exchanges. Just like with any other asset there is nothing else to it. But I dont think thats the answer you wanted I guess.

So the first thing that should be noted, is that Cardano has been around since 2015, but since 95% of the holders are from Japan it didnt really set foot here on reddit for a long long time, thus people are a little bit irritated how such a coin is getting up there, that nobody knows. Also most of the trading volume before USDT was a thing came from Korean and Japanese exchanges so their never was a lot going on in the west for Cardano. All that might change in the upcoming year because IOHK (the company behind Cardano) is moving from Hong Kong to Wyoming due to positive digital asset regulation and [5 pro blockchain laws](https://media.consensys.net/wyoming-passes-5-pro-blockchain-laws-points-the-way-in-digital-asset-regulation-6fae9e07d129) 

Its not a new Coin and its not some crazy idea (decentraland, singularity). Most people would say Cardano tries to squeeze the best of Bitcoin (store of value), Litecoin (cheap, fast p2p transactions), and Ethereum (smart contracts) into one project. 

So lets get to the project itself. It is the only peer-reviewed cryptocurrency that is out there for now (they submit their papers for review to be accepted at cryptographic conferences like [FC'19 lately](https://twitter.com/inputoutputhk/status/1067363249304334336?s=21). For me thats not a matter of peoples opinions and feelings, one can only have precise and rational arguments and developement when everyone is speaking the same language and that language is an academic approach where proposed protocols are described formally and precisely, and the claims are made precisely, and the claims are proved formally, so everyone is in a position to peer review the claims and proofs. This is not a marketing strategy or whatever people want to call it. This is how people outside of the crypto-ecosystem go about research and developement and its especially important if you are aiming to be a new type of financial system. Plus, its still open-source and people are able to review the code themselfs. So one thing doesnt rule out the other. They also retained FP complete, an independent 3rd party to audit (thanks u/Nfamy) the engineering work completed by the Cardano development team, IOHK. They are producing regular reports for the Cardano Foundation that will be shared with the community detailing the findings of the audits.

So ,lets get to some of the people involved:
**Charles Hoskinson**, Co-Founder of ETH and ETC is one of the founders of this project and IOHK . **Aggelos Kiayias** is chair in Cyber Security and Privacy and director of the Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh and designs Ouroboros, the Provably Secure Proof of Stake for Cardano. **Philip Wadler**, one of the most influential people in functional programming (including Haskel) got hired by IOHK, which is the foundation that launched Cardano. **Elias Koutsoupias** computer science professor at Oxford and Gödel Prize winner for theoretical computer science in 2012.

And that is just some of the names that are involved in the developement of the project. [As of now, ~150 people work at IOHK](https://iohk.io/team/). 


Another interesting thing about the Cardano eco-system is the fact that the responsiblity is divided between 3 organisations: IOHK (develops and maintains the protocol), EMURGO (develops, supports, and incubates commercial ventures on Cardano) and the Cardano Foundation that acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. They are all kind of overseeing each other but work independently and efficiently in entirely different areas of the project. Is that sustainable? They are fully funded until 2020 and not a single ADA that is being held by them has been sold as of now.

What else do we have? Their [virtual machine IELE](https://paymentweek.com/2017-10-24-next-generation-virtual-machine-sets-future-standard-blockchain-development/) is one of the most advanced of its kind. It has been in development for years and was built by a contractor of Darpa and Nasa (Runtime verifications ltd). It lets you write your code and smart-contracts in any currently used programming language like java or python and compiles it so it works on the Cardano protocol.

So am I 100% confident that this coin will deliver on their promises? Yes. Am I 100% confident that they will take over the market? No. Depending on how and when Ethereum are inplementing their PoS-System, how the market develops, what Bitcoin will become, what XLM will do blablablabla... Nobody knows anything but the fundamentals are there and in my opinion its a medium risk/medium reward coin. Is it overpriced for what it has to offer right now? Hell yeah, but thats not how investing works. If you only invest into a coin that has multiple householdname partnerships, a fully working blockchain, smartcontracts and minigames on the blockchain, you are too late.",2018-11-29 18:23:19

eaq62h7,JeanPierreRupp,47,"I am from Venezuela although I don't live there. I can tell you a few things:

* Venezuelans are **very** poor these days. Send them any amount of BCH and they'll use it to flee the country, thwarting your plan to create a local stable BCH-based economy.
* For people living under wages of 2 USD a month (a MONTH, not a day), smartphones must be donated if they'll need them for BCH transaction. In that case they'll probably sell the donated hardware to get a bus ticket to the border, which is the best thing to do under the circumstances. Also, using a smartphone in public can get you killed (people will kill you to steal your smartphone).
* Most of the food that people living under Venezuelan salaries can afford (and that is the only thing they can afford), comes from government-subsidized sources. If these government-subsidized sources are accepting BCH, then good, if they are not (hint: they are not), then the BCH will be exchanged into whatever those providing the food will accept and spent promptly, again thwarting the establishment of a stable BCH economy locally.
* Venezuelans, even under their current dire circumstances, are extremely risk-averse people, and will see your offer of free BCH with extreme suspicion. Many will outright refuse it.
* There is food available in black markets at non-subsidized prices that can usually be bought for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash. These are reserved for whoever is making more than $100 a month and can afford these non-subsidized goods, which is a small group of people that do not need to be convinced to use BCH because they already do.
* Being that BCH is used in black markets, transactions are done discreetly, and the people doing that won't be hanging around much in Reddit. Government enforcers will prosecute whoever is selling food above the government-mandated maximum prices, which leave the government as the only provider of these goods, as they are the only group willing to provide food at a loss.

The way I see it BCH could eventually help Venezuelans to achieve a semblance of contemporary life, but the social fabric that is required to have any healthy market economy has been eroded over 30 years of communism.

BCH could prevent another country from following a similar fate, if it is widely used *before* an authoritarian regime comes to power. So use BCH widely wherever you are, and get as many people in.",2018-11-30 02:04:38

I can truly see a future emerging where we have the old bastion of the Bitcoin network, hedged the world over, battle-tested and trusted, preserving value for individuals and organisations alike, whilst the Stellar network acts as a global settlement layer, reducing vast transactional inefficiencies; providing financial access and connection of millions of disconnected assets to billions of people world wide.

These sources *probably* pass the Wikipedia [Reliable Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources) rules.

But - the first is in a proper publication ... but reads like a paid promotional piece. The second is a minor piece of news. The third is the closest to proper coverage. These weren't enough for it to survive the deletion nomination. You need more.

The other thing - I strongly suggest you use only mainstream sources. No crypto blogs. Your draft is currently referenced entirely to primary sources and crypto blogs - there's no way it'll pass muster at present.

There's been enough mainstream coverage of cryptos that crypto blogs are no longer considered acceptable sources by, e.g., the [Reliable Sources Noticeboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard) has noticed how much crypto coverage is literally paid advocacy.

Basically - spammers mean we can't have nice things.

So:

1. Find all the sources in *mainstream press* that you possibly can.
2. Don't use crypto news sites at all
3. Try to get to 0 primary sources (Cardano sites, etc).

This is what you need to do to create a Cardano article that will survive when put up against the vicious array of tools and procedures Wikipedia has created to deal with the firehoses of spam.

Then came the ethereum ICO and I remember being so excited after reading the white paper. I counted down the days till the ICO started and went all in. Then a stroke of luck happened and between the ICO and the eventual launch, I forgot my password to the pre-sale wallet and was forced to hodl til it got up to about $300 and at that point I stayed up all night with a presale wallet cracker I found on GitHub, and went deep into my own mind building a cracking dictionary of every password I've ever thought of, and got in.

eaq3v63,goatpig_armory,36,"This is not such a good presentation of the pros and cons. Real quick:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You do not want BIP70 in your wallet because you don't do not need X.509 code in wallets for anything but BIP70. As a matter of fact, BIP70 is the only reason Core needs OpenSSL. Less dependencies is better, even more so when it comes to crypto libs.

&amp;#x200B;

2. BIP70 breaks Bitcoin payment logic. It expects the signed tx be passed to the BIP70 provider for broadcasting on their end. This is an attempt to model transactions around the legacy pull system. In the legacy system, paying just means giving the authorization to the vendor to charge the customer's bank account. This is the complete opposite of Bitcoin, where payers have to push transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

The intent was to provide more control over payments to the vendor, where they could impose a minimum fee and demand a return address for refunds. However, this is not something you can enforce on top of Bitcoin, therefor the cost in terms of security and code quality is not justified.

&amp;#x200B;

3. There is no added security to BIP70. You are already relying on SSL to connect to the vendor. Adding another certificate check is pointless. The only realistic way to improve security with this setup is to introduce a 2nd factor. After all, if an attacker can compromise the vendor (as Andreas suggests), what added benefit is there to signing payment addresses that the attacker swapped in server side?

&amp;#x200B;

The only security ""improvement"" in this design is on the client side, which already relies on SSL to identify the vendor's server. Not only that, but BIP70 doesn't improve security with offline signing, as a matter of fact it can even get in the way. There is no effective benefit, this is a security theater.

&amp;#x200B;

4. You do not need to use 3rd party websites to resolve a BIP70 payment request into a bitcoin address, you can do that locally. Case in point: [https://github.com/achow101/payment-proto-interface](https://github.com/achow101/payment-proto-interface)

&amp;#x200B;

5. Wallet devs are not rejecting BIP70 on political grounds. We're rejecting it because it's bad. As a matter of fact, it is so bad it led to the removal of Gavin as Bitcoin lead developer, specifically because he implemented Hearn's BIP70 against the technical community's desire, wasting nearly a year on it.

eas1sin,SatoshisVisionTM,33,"To be honest, quoting the LN whitepaper is like quoting the Bitcoin whitepaper; you are referring to a document that has been refined and built upon for years after its inception. The Bitcoin whitepaper defines the bitcoin blockchain to be the longest chain, while everyone knows it is actually the chain with the most work done. 

LN's whitepaper section about routing is short and doesn't go into detail, but for a whitepaper, that is fine. Whitepapers are not complete technical documentations, nor are they supposed to define their intended solution explicitly. Check the first discussion about the Bitcoin whitepaper on the cryptography mailing list. Note how Hal Finney rapidly points his finger on multiple points where the implementation of certain elements of the Bitcoin protocol aren't clearly defined. Difficulty adjustments are an example. This is the only reference to them in the paper:

&gt; To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

I am aware that the routing problem in LN is more difficult to solve than bitcoin's difficulty adjustments. LN developers are aware of that too. Everyone in the space that has seriously checked the possibilities of LN has noted the problem and seen how hard the problem can be, in theory.

Most of the players also know that it won't be as hard as it is in theory, that research into this area is being done, that LN at this time is routing most payments.

Also note that even if the LN was only 2 nodes and 1 channel, it would still be a throughput increase for bitcoin if those two nodes intend to have periodic payments. If one uses the LN to perform microtransactions every second (not paying a flat monthly fee for netflix, but paying per second watched), then LN performs a service that Bitcoin can't. If netflix does this for every subscriber that opts-in, and did it on-chain, this is impossible.
