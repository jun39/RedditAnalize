Financial services giant Northern Trust has significantly expanded its work with blockchain and cryptocurrencies across multiple divisions.


In addition to adding a number of new blockchain features for managing its private equity workflow, the trust with almost $10.7 trillion in assets under custody and administration has also quietly opened its fund administration services to a select group of hedge funds betting on bitcoin and ethereum.


Taken together the series of potentially groundbreaking projects within Northern Trust amount to one of the most significant pushes into cryptocurrency, and other assets encrypted on a blockchain, by a traditional financial institution.


In an exclusive interview with Forbes, the president of Northern Trust’s corporate and institutional services Pete Cherecwich, provided an unprecedented look into the breadth of his company’s work with blockchain. But perhaps more importantly, he explained why the 129 year old institution was committing so many resources to the technology.


“You can take anything today. You can take movie rights, you can take all sorts of entities, and you can create a token for those,” said Cherecwich who has been with the company for 11 years. “We have to be able to figure out how to hold those tokens, value those tokens, do those things.”


The newest of Northern Trust's blockchain efforts is a previously unreported project with three “mainstream hedge funds” that Cherewich says are diversifying their portfolio with cryptocurrency investments. While he was unable to share the names of the clients due to non-disclosure agreements, he described his company’s new cryptocurrency services in detail.


Since the first quarter of this year, the company has been helping the hedge funds by comparing the numbers they report with the actual amount on record at the third party custodian. The firm further helps value the investment as part of its fund administration services, and records the value for their clients. Many of the fund administration services were originally developed for traditional assets. But others, including new risk and control frameworks for anti-money laundering, asset existence validation, crypto-trade reconciliations and the ability to handle new net asset value pricing arrangements, were developed specifically for cryptocurrency.


While Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services had $370 billion in assets under administration as of March 31, 2018, the financial institution is not currently taking direct custody of cryptocurrency. Nor does Cherecwich expect the company will custody cryptocurrency anytime in the near future. Instead, he says that helping the company’s customers account for their cryptocurrency investments, is part of a larger effort to prepare for the day when fiat currencies themselves are also issued on a blockchain.


“I do believe that governments will ultimately look at digitizing their currencies, and having them trade kind of like a digital token — a token of the US dollar — but the US dollar is still in a vault somewhere, or backed by the government,” said Cherecwich, who worked at State Street for 20 years before joining Northern Trust. “How are they going to do that? I don’t know. But I do believe they are going to get there.”


Beyond the new work with cryptocurrency, Northern Trust is moving to significantly integrate blockchain into the life cycle of its $77 billion private equity business.


Launched into alpha in February 2017, the private equity prototype was initially built for Switzerland-based Unigestion using an early version of the open-source Hyperledger Fabric. Just a few months after the launch, the rudimentary private equity platform was upgraded to the first enterprise-grade version of Hyperledger Fabric, and is now adding a number of new features.


The upgraded private equities blockchain is moving beyond just settling a transaction, to a more automated process by which a general partner and a limited partner exchange ownership of an asset. Further, capital call functionality has also been built into the system, with the hope of reducing the role of middle-office middlemen and accelerating the time to receive funds.


To build the series of new blockchain services, Northern Trust initially established a team of 12 technology and private equity specialists working over six months, and has since supplemented the working group with additional product managers and operations and regulatory compliance specialists in the markets targeted for implementation.


While pricing for the software solution has yet to be determined, Cherecwich says Northern Trust has already demoed it to “well over 100 clients,” and is now working with some of them to more fully automate costly middle-office services.  ""We have determined that we will be able to go out and sell it,"" he said.


“When I do a capital call, I will get my money faster than if I had to do it via emails and paper and everything else. So, my time to market, and therefore when I’m going to get paid, is shortened,” said Cherewich. “The more automated that process becomes, it’s just less costly to run a fund.”


But cryptocurrency administration and private equity workflows are just a small piece of Northern Trust’s larger blockchain plan.


Initially, the relatively low transaction rates of the $2.5 trillion annual private equity industry were seen as an ideal place to target blockchain solutions that historically had difficulty handling high volume. Going forward, however, Cherecwich believes the transparency provided by using a shared, distributed ledger, could end up of interest to auditors and regulators across industries.


To help prepare for that demand, Northern Trust and ‘Big Four’ accounting firm, PwC earlier this year revealed a suite of auditing tools designed to give real-time access to financial reports that are otherwise only sent on a periodic basis. Already, the Guernsey Financial Services Commission has access to a node on the blockchain designed to  grant them real time access to some of the data.


“Since blockchain has an immutable record, you put a robot as a node on that immutable record, and I don’t care whether it’s private equity or anything, then that robot can audit those transactions, and make sure everything syncs automatically,” said Cherecwich.


At the core of Northern Trust’s blockchain work are two patents that could eventually help transform the legacy financial institution into a software provider. The first patent, filed in early 2017 uses physical traits of a user to confirm he or she has permission to perform various tasks. A second patent, filed late last year is for hosting an investors meeting using Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum or Openchain, and relies in part on the proof of identity provided by the first patent.


“What we’ve done is not only developed a patent that enables you to have the identity management that enables you to do transactions,” said Cherecwich. “But extends the transactions beyond buying and selling of the security to actual board meetings and votes.”


Slowing down some of the progress being made by Northern Trust is an ongoing sense of regulatory uncertainty, according to a position paper on the potential role of cryptocurrencies, published by the firm in June. Citing measures taken by Bank of America, Citi and Lloyds to prevent customers from buying cryptocurrency using credit cards, the report further noted that very few major banks have launched any crypto-related services and most are awaiting more complete regulatory oversight.


Among the most notable exceptions to this apprehension is Goldman Sachs, which is opening a bitcoin trading desk, and Bloomberg, which earlier this year helped launch the Galaxy Crypto Index with support from hedge funder, Mike Novogratz.  While Northern Trust's June report characterized the firm’s reaction to the changing cryptocurrency landscape as “cautious,” the work being done by the financial services giant places it among the most ambitious of these efforts.


“It’s just something I’ve not seen from custodians in my 30 years” in the industry, said Cherecwich. “And I’m pretty proud.”

e3ddwfb,wadefagen,121,"I was genuinely curious on how much bitcoin Blue Waters could produce and I didn't see a solid answer -- so I took a journey.  I'm not a crypto-expert and this was a lot of searching and learning how bitcoin works, so please double-check all of my logic/math:

---

To answer the question of how much bitcoin (BTC) can be mined with Blue Waters, I need to first find out how much work needs to be done to ""mine"" a BTC.  I learned there are two key things when it comes to a BTC:

1. BTC are distributed in ""blocks"" and the number of BTC per block decreases over time.  Right now, there are 12.5 BTC /block. [[3]]
2. The bitcoin algorithm adjusts the difficulty so that 6 blocks are mined per hour. [[4]]

Based on this, we know that there's 75 new BTC /hour mined.  Using [[2]], I found that the current global ""hash rate"" is ~43,000 Phashes /second -- or 43e18 hashes /second.  Therefore, we can calculate the current number of hashes per BTC:

    = (43e18 hashes/second)  /  (75 BTC/hour)
    = (43e18 hashes/second)  /  (20.833e-3 BTC/second)
    = 2.064e21 hashes per BTC

---

Next, I need to know how many hashes can be calculated on the Blue Waters hardware.   There are two major pieces of hardware in Blue Waters that will compute our hashes:

1. Blue Waters CPUs are AMD 6276 Interlagos [[1]], which users on different forums from a Google search reports can generate about 500 hashes /second (2k hashes /4x 6276s).  Blue Waters has a total of 51,552 of these CPUs as part of their two compute clusters (XE and XK).  From CPUs alone, we get 25.776 Mhashes /second.
2. Blue Waters also has NVIDIA GK110 (K20X, ""Kepler"") GPUs in the XK cluster -- 4,228 of them.  I could not find an exact number, but 120 Mhashes /second is a conservative estimate.  From GPUs alone, we get 507.36 Ghashes /second (or 507.36e9 hashes /second).

Effectively, the CPUs don't matter at all -- they contribute less than 0.01% of our total hashes.  Calculating the BTC generation on Blue Waters:

    = (Hashes per BTC)  /  (Blue Waters hash speed)
    = (2.064e21 hashes/BTC)  /  (0.50736e12 hashes /second)
    = 4.0681e9 seconds /BTC
    = 1.13e6 hours /BTC
    = 47,083 days /BTC
    ...or ~0.00002124 BTC /day

At the current price of bitcoin $7,755, that's **$0.16 /day earned via bitcoins**.  (Even if the numbers were off by a factor of 10x, that's still only $1.60 /day.)

---

To answer the original question: even though Blue Waters can perform a lot of operations per second (called ""flops""), the SHA-256 hash algorithm was designed to be ""hard"" to compute.  Since SHA-256 was first developed, we have found ways to design hardware to make a hash ""easier"" to compute but requires very, very specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (or ASIC).  As a generic compute platform, Blue Waters does not do anything specific as well as a purpose-built machine but Blue Waters should be able to take on any problem you throw at it (whereas an ASIC cannot do anything but SHA hashing, it just can't).

Looking at the first graph on http://bitcoin.sipa.be/, Blue Waters would have contributed a significant percent of the total hashes /second if it mined BTC when it opened in 2013.  However, with today's specialized hardware, Blue Waters can be completely replaced by a single $500 ASIC miner if all you cared about was bitcoin. [[5]]

*(Edited this last section to answer the original question; second edit corrected the number of CPUs from 53k to 51k and made the wording more clear)*

________________

OKEX writes the futures contracts and runs the site, but they do not hold any risk by nature of the participants of the market making trades. 

OKEX will not be forced to close due to insolvency from this liquidation. The liquidation will continue to be marched down every week until it is filled, profitable traders during that period will have their profits ""bailed in"" to pay for moving the liquidation. 

The people who are holding the corresponding shorts are profiting from the gap, and thus are having their profits from that paid into moving the wall until it's filled. 

&gt;User buys 50$ worth of BTC, leveraging with 40$ from Okex.

Nope. OKEX provides no margin themselves, it is all P2P.

&gt;Your 50$ worth of bitcoin is half the size of Okex and they cannot sell those coins at the market because that would crash the price of BTC and they would only get back a fraction of it

Yes, slippage means market selling these very large positions is not feasible. 

&gt;Okex now has an exposure to BTC of 50% their size, meaning that they have effectively 1.5x leverage on BTC using their clients funds.

OKEX does not have any exposure to these contracts. Other users on the platform, those who are short, are the counterparty. Not the broker. This is not a CFD platform. 

&gt;So if BTC falls until some point Okex would be forced to close and all their clients would lose their money.

See above. 

&gt;As a result, they must find a way to depose these contracts that have their clients money as collateral.

Yeah, those who are holding the shorts that this crazy guy bought are the way to dispose of the liquidation. Every week during settlement the wall will be walked down, making it cheaper and more attractive to those who are short to close into it. ",2018-08-01 11:34:33
e3eaols,FerricNitrate,74,"God that's the story of every single one of those ""success"" stories from the crypto guys.

Two of those stuck out to me:

* There was a kid who did an AMA after winning a bet with his parents that he could drop school if he made a million dollars before 18. How did he do it? His grandma gave him a gift of $1000 that he put directly into early bitcoin. The kid, through mediocre grammar, was celebrating that he was going to start businesses instead of going to college. Really he effectively won a slow-burning lottery and hopefully got the message that he got lucky and needs to invest in himself and his education first.

* They say don't criticize the dead, but this other guy was a douche. Heir to a banking empire, he turned something like $2 million into $2 billion by just putting it in bitcoin. His obituary quoted him as saying about that, ""I earned that money. Nobody else had the balls to put the money down, but I did and I earned it"". Yeah...his dad could reimburse that without much grievance.

e3endrc,xCammer,50,"&gt;How much have you profited in total? How much went into your savings and you retired with?

1. Total I wouldn't have a clue early days of do things I'd get a check or money via post or PayPal so no idea on actual total amounts... Today there's way to many services for payments to total them up... Later on for example cam sites had tokens and here comes bitcoin so it gets easier to get and keep track of but I never really did kept a log or anything.. I made a lot and I spent/saved a lot.. Maybe a few million total... No more then 4 or 5

2. Half always went into saving half to my general spending money etc

3. Got just over 2 to retire/invest with but I have assets and homes, cars etc everything I need already this is just space cash for bills and stuff to last me.. Also my website and merchandise are still going very well but that'll fade out in a few years as you'd expect 

&gt;Are you famous enough that someone who looked into camming will recognise you? 

Yup

&gt;How did you manage your finances? How stable was your income?

1. Tbh if cash I'd just hide it in the house from mum or use as spending money later years with PayPal and it's then competitors was easy they don't care if lots of money is coming in or I'm a verified 'online seller' lol 

2. Very mixed I worked most days 6 days a week might sound a lot but some days could be 30mins on cam and 10 bucks another could be 6hrs (and still 10 bucks.. Oh the early days lol) all depends on tips which I always got **a lot** of so if there flowing I ain't stopping lol but all in all I kept savings half of everything I made mostly more not about half and never got into trouble with lack of money but yeah some weeks would be horrible some you'd get a perv offering you 5k to do some weird kindly shit so it all kinds evens out lol

&gt;What did you sell? 

You mean on my site or........?",2018-08-01 20:46:48
e3edsud,SloppySynapses,49,"Sorry for the super long comment. 

tl;dr i'm bearish again (that didn't last long), could be calling it way too early but figured I'd rather get the jump on it than end up trying to short this way lower. 

there's always the potential for a second, weaker, rally (or straight up moon!!! this is all a bear trap before etf approval 8), but the fall through $7800 on high volume has me skeptical of significant upwards movement from here. 

this shit is truly kinda depressing (it's fun being bullish! I forgot what it was like...) so sorry to be such a downer here. 

---

Unfortunately, most of my signals for the end of a rally are showing up. 

#droopy sell-off after overextended rally where we all wondered if it was going to moon

Every time we see this ""walk the price down to $0"" relentless selling price action, it's after an overextended rally where a big slug of volume occurs on the first push towards the top. 

You can see this with the double top rally in February, in April, and beginning now.

#potential move below 4h 200ma incoming

falling through the 4h 200ma is generally the ""aight, time to short every bounce"" indicator, and that's at ~$7000 right now, so we're not ""doomed"" yet but it's lining up to look quite bearish

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ppwvBWbm/

Despite this I will likely actually close some of my shorts early this time and potentially long low-mid $7ks to see if it bounces.

---

#1d 200ma resistance + the top was 50% above the bottom

The 1d 200ma is also kind of walking us down slowly, serving as a bit of an umbrella for us near the top of our rallies: https://www.tradingview.com/x/DOB7j2PU/

I like these moving average indicators because bitcoin trends so heavily lately, it's just been swing up, swing down, swing up, swing down.

Another interesting few numbers:

50% rally from bottom @ $6450 = $9675 (2nd top @ $9990, first top @ $9750, gotta liquidate #1 okex first ;)

50% rally from bottom @ $5750 = $8625 

---

#longs closed after the first big push, then new, weaker longs opened up

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9tmyg4oR/


This is another one I was watching for. Someone with very strong hands opens a ton of longs near the bottom (I assume) then closes right at the top of a rally. Then on a pullback, weaker longs open up on a second attempt to bust through. They end up underwater and provide fuel for a move downwards

---

#volume range &amp; 3d/5d rsi with big hidden bear divs

I'll be watching our volume range closely, as we could turn around bust upwards through $7800 again and re-establish our range, which would be quite undeniably bullish if we could manage to maintain it and see $8ks again.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/tDm2y627/

In terms of long term indicators, the 3d rsi is showing massive hidden bearish divergences. A close below $7800 on the 3d will potentially signal significant downwards movement from here.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/9DlULj3q

(if you don't think the 3d works because there's more than 14 candles in between each top, you can use the 5d and get the same result: https://www.tradingview.com/x/gHjVeZ8P/)

#in conclusion, i longed and lost money

lolol kinda kidding, I actually made some decent scalps off $7900-8200, but lost most of it on a big long at $7900 that got stopped out below $7800.

I had high hopes for this rally, but the recent price action, alts capitulating, and my skepticism of an ETF approval (11,000 spoofy btc buy wall before price tanks...nice, that's a good look for us) puts me pretty much right where I was before all of these shenanigans. 

As always, my longer term bearish target remains $4.5k. This would ""fill"" the volume gap we had between $4500-5500. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/cu3yx85b/

I actually think it would happen rather quickly, and $5500 to $4500 will bounce huge back above $5500 to see if we can bust thru $6k again or we'll eventually fall through $4500 and a new range between $3000-5500 will be established.

I'm not sure if it's reasonable to expect sub $3000 any time soon. as l14dy is always saying, the bounce off $3k was absolutely incredible- if we ever test it, it'll likely function like $6k where we just refuse to go below it.

e3fb7ja,Auntfanny,913,"Hi u/keysersosa a couple of days ago I received this email.  It was titled with my basic password that I used on my reddit account in around 2007

It is just so unfortunate. I am aware [removed] is your pass word. Moreover, I know your secret and I've proof of this. You do not know me personally and nobody paid me to examine you. 

It's just your hard luck that I came across your misdemeanor. In fact, I placed a malware on the adult vids (porn material) and you visited this web site to experience fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your web browser began functioning as a Rdp (Remote control desktop) with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen and cam. After that, my software program gathered every one of your contacts from social networks, and e-mail. 

After that I put in more time than I probably should have digging into your life and generated a double screen video. 1st part displays the recording you had been watching and second part shows the view of your web camera (its you doing dirty things).

Honestly, I am ready to forget all information about you and let you continue with your regular life. And I am going to provide you two options which will achieve that. These two options are either to ignore this letter, or perhaps pay me $1200. Let us examine these two options in details. 

Option One is to ignore this e mail. You should know what will happen if you opt this option. I will send out your video to your entire contacts including close relatives, colleagues, and so forth. It does not help you avoid the humiliation your self will face when friends and family learn your unpleasant videos from me. 

Second Option is to send me $1200. We’ll name it my “privacy charges”. Now lets see what will happen if you pick this option. Your secret will remain your secret. I will destroy the video immediately. You keep your daily life as if none of this ever occurred. 

Now you may be thinking, “I should call the cops”. Without a doubt, I've covered my steps to ensure this e mail cannot be traced time for me and yes it won't prevent the evidence from destroying your life. I'm not trying to dig a hole in your pocket. I am just looking to get compensated for time I placed into investigating you. Let's assume you've decided to create this all disappear and pay me my confidentiality fee. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you don't know how, type ""how to buy bitcoins"" in google) 

Transfer Amount: $1200 
Bitcoin Address to Send: 1P4xHsXFXHK*ZrBJ5jCdSoNptHb3N6hXEuM ( You must Remove * from this string and copy and paste it carefully) 

Expalin no-one what you would be transferring the bitcoin for or they might not give it to you. The task to get bitcoins will take a few days so do not put it off.
I have a specific pixel in this email message, and now I know that you've read through this mail. You have 48 hours to make the payment. If I do not get the BitCoins, I definitely will send your video to all your contacts including family members, coworkers, and so on. You better come up with an excuse for friends and family before they find out. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the proof and all other proofs immediately. It is a non negotiable one time offer, thus kindly do not waste my personal time &amp; yours. Your time has started. You should be aware that my malware will still be keeping tracking of the actions you adopt when you are done reading this message. To be honest, If I see any wrong activity from your browser history then I will have to send out your sextape to your close relatives, colleagues before your time finishes.


Edit: Just to add I knew it was a scam.  I received the email on July 31st at 02:55am.  This was the only account that I used that basic password that has had a security scare recently.  I posted the full email just so people could maybe see the consequence of the hack.  Happy to provide the email to Reddit admins if it helps locate the hacker.  ",2018-08-02 02:47:10

**RI:**

Today, we have  redditor /u/A-MacLeod presenting [an argument](https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/8kbzir/ive_just_written_a_book_about_the_media_and/dz6fcfl/) that incompetent government policy is overstated as a cause in the Venezuelan crisis.

While he agrees that the government's actions are partly to blame, he severely overstates the effect of alternative hypotheses, which are **1.** US sanctions, **2.** Oil prices and **3.** ""Economic warfare"" by businesses. Let's take each of those on their own.

**1. Us Sanctions**

&gt; When US sanctions on Venezuela are discussed in the media, it is usually to praise them or to claim they haven’t gone far enough. The media generally claim they are “unlikely to create major economic hardship”. This is flatly rejected by the United Nations, whose General Assembly said they were [“disproportionately affecting the poor and the most vulnerable classes”](http://undocs.org/A/HRC/37/L.34), some would say, as designed. The UN also condemned the US for the sanctions, urged other states not to recognize them and even began discussing reparations the US should pay to Venezuela. Don’t bother trying to find that reported in the media though.

As of August 2018, this is nonsense. First, a history lesson: the US enacted 3 major sanctions against the Maduro regime. The first one in 2014 [only applies to individuals selected personally by the US president](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ278/PLAW-113publ278.pdf). The second one enacted in august 2017 blockades selling government debt, and the third one from March 2018 blocks transactions with a government issued Venezuelan cryptocurrency.

So while it's impossible for the 2014 sanction to affect the poor, there is no reliable evidence of the sanctions affecting anyone but oligarchs. What about the linked United Nations document? Well, first let's note it [was written by the Venezuelan government](http://webtv.un.org/watch/ahrc37l.34-vote-item3-54th-meeting-37th-regular-session-human-rights-council-/5756921806001/). Second, the document specifically refers to the recent sanction on a government issued cryptocurrency (which was a [bad idea](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/Economic-Limits-Bitcoin-Blockchain.pdf) economically anyway, but a great idea if your aim is to launder money as an oligarch)

**2. Oil prices**

[This is easy to refute in one chart.](https://i.imgur.com/8iQ3IK4.png) [1] The Venezuelan GDP per capita pitfall started around 2012, while the oil price dropped about 18 months later.

If anything, [Venezuelan GDP Granger causes oil prices](https://www.xkcd.com/925/)

**3. ""Economic warfare""**

&gt; However, it is absolutely beyond doubt that the opposition and the Venezuelan elites are trying to crash the economy.

[Citation needed]

&gt; Private monopolistic companies are continually found to be squeezing the economy dry by hoarding, especially foods and medicines.

This is generally dispelled by a statement made 2 paragraphs earlier by the same person:

&gt;&gt; Another factor affecting the economy are price controls, originally implemented to make sure all could afford key foods and goods. These were very popular with the population but the artificially low price means unscrupulous people can simply fill up a truck with cheap food and drive to Colombia and sell it for way more (the same goes for gasoline).

Shortages can be explained easily by price controls and a [shitty MS paint graph](https://i.imgur.com/ApY5dMC.png). In words: Regardless of if you have a competitive market or a monopolistic profit maximizing company, price controls will reduce supply. A monopolist will reduce supply even further (or not produce altogether) because it is not beholden to compete for market position.

**Conclusion**

Duly note that none of these causes explain why Venezuelan inflation is [well approximated by the letter ""L"" turned sideways](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXVZUS), which is a discussion for another day, but much more important as a cause of the collapse. Hint: it does have to do with the Venezuelan central bank being staffed by cronies and buffoons.

e3f0fgr,Cockatiel,67,"A lot of people don't see the point of DAG technology like IOTA and NANO. I would like you examine yourself, your place in the world both economically and geologically. 

Do you have access to a stable currency, ATMs, local banks, a 'responsible' government (i.e. not Venzeula)? Do you make the minimum wage in the United States or above? If you said yes to any of these questions, DAG technology will not be as valuable to you as the *most* of the world.

DAG technology, in my opinion, will be the standard for transfer of value from one party to another whereas Bitcoin will continue to serve as the world's savings account/bank account.

DAG technology provides a unique aspect, 0 fees. This can not be understated, 0 fees are important. Many people across the world make less than $1.00 per week to support their families. Even the very low fees of Ripple ($0.10) is over 10% of their work once you factor taxes and other required purchases (propane gas, water, food, electricity if available, and medicine). Simply put, there may not be enough money left over to pay a $0.10 fee to transfer money.

As Andreas Antonopolus said, 'there may only be the electricity available for one PoW blockchain.' Bitcoin is *very* secure, which is what you want when you are storing your wealth for the long term. However that security comes at an enormous cost of PoW mining that is incredibly energy demanding and costly. That form of security is not necessary to quickly transfer wealth from one person or business to another.

e3glcfs,Polycephal_Lee,50,"Hodling is the primary use of money. you take money when you want to store value, the act of spending money is only a small fraction of its life. the whole point of money is to store value in between transactions, it's a medium you can take when you don't want to take a bunch of goods.

Bitcoin is interesting to me because it's harder money than we've ever had before. it's more open money than we've ever had before. more efficient payments is not the interesting part to me. our society already has tons of solutions around spending money, to the point that you can spend money you don't have. the tool that we were missing was a good savings instrument, and hard money is the best thing for that. 

The reigning ideology will tell you that hard money is bad, because money needs to be spent quickly so the economy can go faster and faster. this ideology sees saving as a negative thing. I completely disagree with this, hard money is exactly what we need. a strong savings instrument can extend the time horizon of our economy, past quarterly profits and into decades long projects.

As to impact on price, I think hodlers do more to increase price than anything else. holding is persistent demand. transactional demand, where I convert from fiat, then pay in bitcoin, then the merchant converts back to fiat, is only ephemeral demand. if one of the parties is not holding long term, then there will be no impact on price long term.",2018-08-02 16:00:19

e3h1lzw,Light_of_Lucifer,36,"&gt; Jesse Lund, head of Blockchain Solutions at IBM, claims that they are “very, very close” to helping a central bank to move a fiat currency to the Stellar blockchain.
There is a fair chance that the IBM/Stellar partnership could replace the decrepit SWIFT/IBAN payments infrastructure as a global standard.


-------


&gt;Tempo’s partnership with Stellar may mean that Stellar is now the cryptocurrency with the largest real-world network. Tempo has 300 locations across Europe where lumens are now for sale, and users of the Tempo app can also purchase lumens directly on their phone. The Tempo network is currently active in 120 countries with 195,000 affiliates.


------

&gt;Micropayments is another hot market, and SatoshiPay is definitely one of its leaders. This is just one more avenue that could contribute to Stellar mass adoption.


-------


&gt;Sure Remit is an established remittance company that many African workers abroad use to send money home. It has now joined the Stellar network, bringing 300 locations across Kenya, Rwanda, and Nigeria with it. Nigeria is the biggest remittance market in Africa, with an estimated US$20 billion sent home each year by Nigerians working abroad. African markets are also among the fastest growing in the world.

-------


&gt;As part of the quest to tokenize everything, Smartlands is setting out to select high quality agricultural land and tokenize it on the Stellar network. 

-------

&gt;Looking at the announcements of the projects joining Stellar, it seems as if Stellar might have stumbled on a scaling solution before Bitcoin and Ethereum even started bumping against scaling limitations—that is, specialization.
The selection of projects on Stellar is not nearly as exotic as that of Ethereum, but that’s okay. Stellar was never trying to be a “world computer” like Ethereum—it was meant from the outset to be a specialized solution for payments.
Trading off some capabilities for applications on the network also has advantages. Relatively simple programming for projects on Stellar also means that there are fewer attack vectors, and thus less time needed for security audits. This means that applications built on the Stellar network can be deployed more quickly to market, and this momentum is apparent in the headlines.



Needless to say I am very excited for stellars future; especially at its prospects of becomg the de-facto global dencentralized nasdaq type stock exchange for the world. There will be a network onto which most securities and tokenized assets will trade without friction and with massive liquidity. As Jesse Lund; head of blockchain at IBM said, Stellar is in the pole position to become that network. ",2018-08-02 22:54:36

e3gzwjw,bhlebeau,34,"Nice find.

One thing I'd like to add: XRB really, truly had one of the most ludicrous, meteoric 1-2 month price rises in crypto history. Some people call it a pump and dump, but I call it poor liquidity on shitgrail and unhealthy amounts of hype. The trade volumes vs. price action on XRB in December betray how artificially the price was increased. That's not the *worst* thing, but it's certainly a valid observation that not enough people talk about. We're talking a 200x increase over the course of some 45 days. Name one other cryptocurrency that sustained this kind of growth and didn't die out completely, except maybe Bitcoin in its pre-Mt. Gox days.

Which brings me to my main concern right now. Nano is a cool crypto and I'm excited about the investment opportunity. But I fear a sub-$1 price represents the point of capitulation where investors don't even want to go near it ever again.

Aside from Nano's basic value props, there are a few scattered things that get me excited, including 1) Bitcoin fees becoming another inevitable conversation in the relative near term (probably 1+ years. This bear market ain't going anywhere short of the mystical, almighty ETF), and 2) Taraxa continuing development, which will *potentially* turn heads back to Nano and other DAG projects (***if*** they achieve any milestones) b/c they have all-star team members (something Nano doesn't have, by the way!). And I'll tack on a bonus contingent #3: Nanex could become a viable exchange when we see healthier rises in Nano price over time.

But y'know, maybe I'm delusional. Crypto is very game-like in its speculation. Just my two satoshis.",2018-08-02 22:27:41

e3g18p4,rfng,33,"A man once said (minor typos/errors expected) :

OmiseGO - OMG Network is a game changer particularly in the field of financial inclusion because it is essentially the original Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin. It is essentially the original PayPal vision. It is essentially the Ripple vision even before Ripple was a blockchain project. 

Ripple was actually a concept for many years before Jed McCaleb and some other people decided that a blockchain would be a suitable way to implement this and the idea that time for Ripple was to .. Let me start again - 

The idea for PayPal was to make interconnection between all the currencies that people are already using to allow them to pay each other online. 

The idea behind Bitcoin was to take this but use decentralized, by a decentralized computing platform to prevent the double spending problem, which was one of the biggest problem at the time for how do we make a kind of accounting system that we don't need to trust any special party which you know, can have some problems as people at the 2008-2009 years remember quite well, and the innovation was the consensus algorithm proof-of-work and then the requirement was that there be one currency that runs on it, that would become kind of a world currency suitable for microtransactions, suitable for very low cost and easy payments. 

The Ripple vision was how do we take network currencies like a decentralized currency like Bitcoin basically, and how do we .. originally it wasn't like that, it was more along the fiat side, how do we connect all the fiat currencies and make people able to get in and out in an, OK semi-decentralized way with the idea that the issuance of the fiat in the blockchain would all be IOUs, would be debt assets and one really interesting innovation of Ripple at the time was what's called the path-finding model where users would be able to hold any currency that's been issued by some trusted gateway. Ripple is essentially a consortium chain of trusted institutions and people would be able to pay for something in the currency they hold and the system would automatically route the money and the recipient would receive the funds in whatever the recipient wants, completely invisible to each other what currency is being asked, what currency is being received.

And so, the OMG network project is 100% public infrastructure project that aims to accomplish all of these things with every single part of this monetary flow and exchange process, completely decentralized, no less decentralized than Bitcoin, so .. no reliance on trusted 3rd parties, no institutions that necessarily sit in the middle, although there are places where institutions can sit that will help facilitate this extremely low cost, fully on-chain decentralized exchange using the plasma architecture by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon - its' kind of like lightning network for Ethereum, essentially, scalability of smart contracts. So with this architecture, the idea is to be able to allow a farmer in Bhutan who has a mobile phone to have the same amount of financial sovereignty and power as a top-level banking executive has today.

e3jadrc,ChildishJack,34,"This is an incredible article. Im only halfway done, but this stuck out:

&gt;Here’s how Bakkt’s exchange for trading Bitcoin tokens, if approved, would operate. It would trade Bitcoin using what are known as “one-day futures,” contracts that would take the same amount of time to settle as trades in the current cash market, meaning in a single day. The broker-dealer would click on a posted price at anytime during the trading day on behalf of a money manager client. By the market close, the ICE clearinghouse would have arranged to route the cash from the buyer’s to the seller’s bank account, and the Bitcoin tokens would be en route the to the Bakkt digital warehouse.

&gt;The clients entrusting their Bitcoin to Bakkt could be either institutions managing Bitcoin mutual funds, or companies making cross-border payments in Bitcoin. So how do those clients spend their Bitcoin? Control of “private keys” allow Bitcoin to be spent. Those keys are a randomly generated string of numbers and letters that resemble digital signatures. Most Bitcoin owners store their keys on PCs or servers, or in accounts at unregulated marketplaces. But private keys on those devices are vulnerable to hacking, and if the hacker steals the key, the hacker keeps the pilfered Bitcoin. Cyber-thieves have stolen more than $1.6 billion in cryptocurrencies by hacking investors’ accounts since 2011, according to Autonomous Research.

&gt;Bakkt would solve that problem by storing the private keys “offline” in its heavily-guarded digital warehouse. When a fund manager or company wants take Bitcoin out of the warehouse, Bakkt would confirm the client’s identity and release the Bitcoin using the private key. The warehouse will also hold a second key, called the public key, that opens the recipient’s account to receive Bitcoin. The double-key security resembles how it takes a bank rep and the customer, both with their own keys, to open a safety deposit box.

&gt;How about trades that occur all inside the warehouse? Bakkt would be connected to the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, so that customers could seamlessly trade Bitcoin for dollars or Euros. Then, the Bitcoin would simply shift from the seller’s lockbox in the ICE warehouse to the buyer’s lockbox, as if a forklift were transferring gold bars from one storage locker to another.

e3kfvxk,Tiaan,43,"I've seen a lot of posts and comments recently about why the price is down. Most of these posts typically talk about the overall crypto market, market sentiment, x nodes unlocking, etc. They might be upset or confused as to why having great news released seems to have no effect, or a negative one, on the price. When I read these posts, I feel like many people have forgotten what is most important for VeChain. 

The reason why I invested in VeChain, and continue to do so, is that I believe that if VeChain achieves their mission, they would transcend the typical norms of the crypto market. These norms include things such as ""all alts rise or die with bitcoin"" and ""news only matters in a bull market."" From my interpretation, VeChain's mission is to be the major successful public blockchain ecosystem for enterprises. This means public transactions that each represent some real world application that actually provides value to a company in some way. I purposefully did not mention the ICOs, not because I dislike them, but because to me they are gravy on top of the already delicious roast.
 
None of the good news or price movements really matters to me until we see and confirm transactions by an enterprise client. This is what truly matters for VeChain. Once this happens, it will be revolutionary in the crypto market. It would confirm that an enterprise has $$ budgeted for VET or VTHO, and is getting value from the ecosystem. I do not believe that this has ever been achieved by any other crypto platform to date - no longer will the VeChain ecosystem be priced on speculation alone, like the current crypto market, but it would have actual value obtained from real world application.

Is it a risk? of course - but I made the bet months ago that VeChain is legitimate and has a real plan to achieve this goal, and everything that they have done so far has only convinced me more and more of this. ",2018-08-04 08:55:15

e3mrm4u,RandomGenera7ed,123,"*From the July 2018 issue*

In the summer of 2013, I was an unemployed ex-con, twice over, living next door to my mother-in-law in a house with no floors. Being June in Georgia, it was hotter than two hamsters farting in a wool sock. Work was rare. Even my dog looked disappointed in me. Something had to happen. Soon. So I bought a new Porsche Cayenne.

Then in August, I bought a new Range Rover, and another of each in September. A Rover plus a pair of Porsches in October, and in November, I paid cash for six more luxury vehicles. Before my Thanksgiving leftovers had disappeared from the fridge, I had purchased more than a dozen vehicles and spent nearly a million dollars. My wife was happy because I finally put floors in the house (laminates, but they looked damn good), and even my mother-in-law was less ornery after I paid back the bail she posted for me earlier that year.

But my new lifestyle wasn’t all champagne wishes and caviar dreams. On Christmas Eve, I woke up on a bench in the Charleston, South Carolina, airport, hung over, with pieces of a vending-machine Moon Pie stuck to my shirt. I had been holed up in a La Quinta for days, hoping against hope that a transport truck would deliver my new Range Rover to the local dealership. There was an eight-month wait on them then, even if you were a Kardashian, so I kept telling myself it would be worth it. But as the stockings were hung by the chimney with care, it became clear that I had a better chance of Saint Nick himself delivering the Range Rover. So I paid cash for the next flight back to Atlanta, which didn’t leave until Christmas Day. When I got to the front of the security line with no luggage and a six-figure cashier’s check, the TSA agent had some questions. I’m sure you do, too.

***

I explained then, as I will now, the details of exporting luxury vehicles to China’s gray market. Keep in mind that I have only a state college education, the first two years of which were earned in prison.

Though still far from a true democracy, China has adopted many of Adam Smith’s economic principles, creating something of a meritocracy and laying the foundation for the Chinese version of the American Dream. Flush with wealth, the Chinese have also taken a shine to cars—big ones, with lots of leather, executive rear seating, and panoramic sunroofs that open up like a Colorado sunrise.

But China puts a heavy 25 percent tariff on new-car imports, in part to encourage manufacturers to build cars in its country. Combine this with car companies charging steeper prices for luxury vehicles there than they do in the U.S., and it is easy to see how exporters can turn a profit, even after shipping across the ocean and paying the likes of me. For example, the current base price of a new Range Rover is $88,345 here, but it starts at 1,518,000 yuan in China, which is about $240,000.

See, I wasn’t keeping any of these cars. I was buying them for a company in San Diego, which was fronting me the money. I was a straw buyer, the bottom rung of the ladder, kind of like a multilevel marketing recruit but without the ambition. It is slightly more glamorous than the life of a roadie or a towel boy, but only just. Important—critical, even—but not in any individual sense. In a band, I am the guy with a tambourine. Or maybe a cowbell.

The TSA guy listened to all this before he ran a background check on me, which probably raised a few eyebrows, due to my criminal record. But he wished me well and gave me his number, saying that this whole export business was something he was interested in, and that working for the TSA on Christmas Day sucked.

“If you think that you have the right to sell a car you own to whomever you like, you are absolutely correct.”

There are many ways for someone without education, experience, or ingenuity to make money in America. You will not get rich day-trading or flipping houses. Bitcoin? Bless your heart. But an enterprising individual can make $10,000 this month buying luxury cars. You need a heartbeat, a driver’s license, and that’s about it. It is not as simple as it sounds, but it’s not that hard, either. The manufacturers and their dealers have worked to design a foolproof system that will prevent you from buying a car to export to another country. Foolproof never works, though, as it underestimates the ingenuity of the fool.

Rewind back to the old, broke, and unemployed me on the porch. Hot. Out of ice, Coke, and most everything else. Even running low on Ten High. An old friend, always her own kind of trouble, says she’ll pay me to ride up to Tennessee with her. All I have to do is take a check into the Porsche dealership and sign the purchase documents. After a few months without work, I had grown comfortable doing nothing. But a half gallon of Ten High runs $14.99, and $750 would buy . . . 11 million gallons? I was drinking early that day.

At the Porsche store, things seemed to go well, considering I was prom-date drunk. I remained upright, produced the cashier’s check, and signed. “My boyfriend is going to buy me a Cayenne so I won’t tell his wife about us,” my friend lied. She had arranged the deal the week before. “Y’all don’t ask him any questions or take so long that he sobers up.”

We drove the Porsche to a storage unit a few miles away. I signed a release for the truck driver who would pick up the Cayenne and left the keys and paperwork with the Go Store It manager. I got my $750.

When the driver of the multicar transport truck pulled off the expressway, he knew he was picking up a new Porsche Cayenne that, according to his bill of lading, would wind its way through the Appalachian Mountains to the port in Baltimore, Maryland. After U.S. Customs and Border Protection verified that it was not stolen, presumably it would then be driven onto a roll-on/roll-off vessel and sail to China. The truck driver, however, seeing the Porsche dealership, did the natural thing and pulled in. Whereupon he presented his papers and advised somebody that he was there to pick up Travis Simpkins’s new Cayenne.

If you think that you have the right to sell a car you own to whomever you like, you are absolutely correct. You also have the right to not sell it, which is why luxury-car dealers—BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche, specifically—refuse to sell new cars to known or suspected exporters and maintain blacklists to prevent the likes of me from doing what I had just been caught doing.

In short order, I received a phone call from the dealership’s general manager. He was angry. He had reason to be. I had signed a document promising not to export the car and agreeing to pay $8500 if I did, a piece of paper I quite obviously regarded as legally binding as a pinkie swear. But if Porsche caught him in bed with me on this sale, the dealership could possibly be fined even more than that or be punished in other ways, like having its allocation of new vehicles reduced.

We both said some regrettable things in an email exchange that followed. He indicated he would not be processing the paperwork on the Cayenne, I would not be getting a title, that I was an exporter, and he knew it because the truck driver had shown him the bill of lading. I informed him that he had already committed a criminal act, which may or may not have been true since I just made it up. He demanded that I return the Cayenne immediately, with no miles on it. I asked him if he was unfamiliar with the perils of rolling back an odometer. Had he not seen Ferris Bueller’s Day Off? We both threatened to have the other thrown in jail. Southern jails being, well, southern jails, we both knew that while I would be catching up with old friends, he might discover exactly what happens when the rabbit gets the gun.

Mr. General Manager’s parting blow was that I hadn’t heard the last from him. He was right: A fantastic gift basket from Blackberry Farm was delivered to my house, courtesy of the dealership. Apparently the GM forgot to let his marketing department know. But he did FedEx the tag office in Georgia with the deal paperwork. I don’t know where the law fell on our transaction, but those jelly jars were so good they ought to be illegal.

“A single car can earn a straw buyer anywhere from $500 to $7000 in commission. It’s enough to take the kids to Disneyland but nothing you can build a career on.”

I made friends with my first Land Rover sales consultant about a month after buying that Cayenne. Let’s call her Ashley. She was as pretty as a homecoming queen and not much older. She loved Garden &amp; Gun magazine, which she complained was always stolen from the lounge, so I bought her a subscription. A dealer’s lounge is a nice place to spend an afternoon. This one smelled like cedar and summer camp, and it had something like 17 different Keurig coffees, plus pastries and a staggering variety of granola bars.

Just across the street from Ashley’s Land Rover store, the same dealership chain had a Porsche showroom with a similar lounge. I was relaxing there, in the process of buying another Cayenne a couple weeks after she had sold me a Range Rover Sport, when in she walked with her sales manager. I tried to hide behind one of those big fake plants, hoping they’d leave before the Porsche manager came back with my keys and bill of sale. I eat when I’m nervous, which, aside from making me improperly sized for hiding behind anything, led to my devouring quite a few granola bars while peering through the leaves.

It worked out okay. I got the Cayenne, though I paid the price on that one later in the evening when the snacks turned on me. And so did that dealer chain eventually, but only after I had bought more cars from them. I am not banned from their property, but I’m definitely not welcome there today. Screw ’em. They never even sent me a gift basket.

The NYSE / Starbucks / Microsoft model might work like this:

- There will be a NYSE crypto exchange, and maybe a Bakkt payment card (might look like an EMV chip card).  

- A typical user might keep $50,000 crypto on their Ledger wallet, and around $500 in their NYSE crypto exchange account.

- When the user inserts their EMV Bakkt payment card to buy a $5 Starbucks coffee, $5 of crypto is sold off from their NYSE account (much like how Coinbase &amp; Shift card works).  Starbucks receives $5 in fiat.

- Most retail transactions are done off-chain, at the NYSE exchange level.  Users just top-up their NYSE account once a month (on-chain).

- Businesses that would be threatened by this: Coinbase, Bitpay, Lightning Network.

So yes i agree. And i think the time is near to jump ship. It's just hard to find a platform that is immune to censorship. For typical social media there are federated networks like diaspora (fb clone) and mastodon (twitter clone), but you still rely on the node where you are posting on to not censor your posts (setting up your own node partially solves this). Also i don't think there is a federated network that resembles reddit.

There are blockchain solutions which are much harder to censor (impossible if the cryptocurrency it's based on is big enough). Examples of twitter clone that stores their data in the blockchain are memo.cash and blockpress. Which do work quite well. The problem is data storage. It works fine for a twitter clone since the messages are quite small, but doing something like reddit is much harder. And you will also need to convince people to pay for posting content (even if it's a fraction of a penny, there is still a miner fee), but the positive thing is that it's effective against spam attacks.

e3nn8ej,pwuille,41,"I'm the author of BIP42.

BIP42 is not where the 21 million supply comes from. If you read any document about Bitcoin's early history the 21 million limit is almost universally mentioned. I guess there are many people these days that didn't know Bitcoin before 2014, but it wasn't that long ago. It seems completely unrealistic to think the Bitcoin ecosystem would ever have accepted such a dramatic change in its economic policy. Having the policy being fixed in stone and beyond influence of a central bank - or anyone - is one of Bitcoin's primary selling points.

Furthermore, BIP42 doesn't even claim that it is the origin of the 21 million limit. It claims (jokingly) that Bitcoin was designed to *look like* it had a 21 million limit, but through underhanded programming didn't actually do that.

The reality is that ever since the January 2009 release of the software, the 21 million limit was there, coded in by Satoshi. In March 2014, ""ditto-b"" on Github [noticed a bug in the implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3842) in Bitcoin Core (and not in other software), that would result to start another cycle of 21 million bitcoins to be issued 250 years in the future.

e3nmmy4,Formerly_Guava,38,"So I believe that what Elon is stating is factually true but I can also say it's misleading to say ""10x faster than nVidia"". I'm sure it's factually correct that at one or more specific operations it is 10x faster, but I'm sure it's not 10x faster at everything and the way that this quote is phrased it makes it sound like ""we have invented a supercomputer chip that destroys anything nVidia has"" and that's not really the case.

What they have done is taken something that has run primarily in software on a GPU and turned that chunk of code into an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). This is done all the time - a great example is bitcoin mining which was originally done on a CPU, then it moved to running on GPU's and then when they developed a bitcoin mining ASIC those immediately took over the $/W and replaced GPUs pretty much entirely at Bitcoin mining in a matter of a few months.  It's not that a Bitcoin ASIC is superior to a GPU at everything, but for that one hashing calculation, they absolutely dominate because they were designed entirely for that purpose.

Generally the way things work is that you can run software code on a general-purpose CPU but if it is something that can be massively parallelized - like in the case of ADAS, you can split the frame into multiple pieces and work on those separately - then you can switch it to running on a GPU and it will run more quickly, but if you develop a chip whose sole purpose is to do that a few specific operations, an ASIC will crush the GPU in terms of raw performance but also more importantly performance/watt of power at those few important tasks. Tesla hasn't revolutionized AI development - they have hardcoded some specific operations that they need for full self driving into an ASIC and sped up those specific important operations. But this ASIC isn't 10x faster at everything than the GPU and people won't be gaming on Tesla chips, it is very specific to Tesla's implementation.

There are two reasons why everyone doesn't make ASICs for everything. The first is that you have to hire a decent sized team of electrical engineers to design it for you. Electrical engineers aren't cheap and the design, verification, validation and debug of these ASICs is an expensive thing that requires a big wallet. The more operations that you want to hardcode and the more complex those operations are, the more more people you need and the longer it takes to do validation and all this costs money. And the other reason is that it locks you into a specific implementation. With software you can just recode the thing if you find a better way or want to change hardware, but ASICs are, by definition, very specific and this makes them very inflexible.

VeChain needs to produce results.

It's a bear market, people are not going to invest in altcoins. Bitcoin and Ethereum - and even Ethereum is a stretch, are the only things worth investing in right now if you think that the current status quo is gonna remain going forward. 

Betting on any other coin - VET or otherwise, is a bet that you think for some reason that it's gonna break out of the altcoin/Bitcoin cycle or that you think the BTC/ALT ratio is bottoming out and you wanna get in on something on the ground floor. Some people actually do believe the latter so it's not ridiculous.

Fiat gateways don't matter - We've seen this fail with multiple other coins. Vertcoin had a fiat gateway which shut down after like three months because nobody used it.

Partnerships don't matter - Every coin has partnerships and the word is used so broadly in this space that it doesn't matter. Stellar has a deep and embedded partnership with IBM and it hasn't moved out of the Bitcoin/Altcoin cycle.

You need something that will facilitate mass adoption. Ethereum had that because it became a platform for ICOs which forced a lot of people into its ecosystem. No other coin has that right now - there are coins which act as ICO platforms like Neo, but it's patently obvious that the overwhelming majority of ICOs are carried out on the Ethereum ecosystem still. Ethereum has the first mover advantage and has established a foothold long before anyone else did.

There's only 4 things left IMO that can break the status quo for Vechain:

* Mass consumer adoption, no cryptocurrency has been able to get this except for Bitcoin. Ethereum is close but not quite there. Doubt this happens in another cryptocurrency for at least 5 years. I'd say 10 is a more realistic view as well. **Edit** And honestly even Bitcoin isn't that close. It's a rarely used form of payment that only a select group of nerds use.
* ICOs explode again and Vechain becomes a preferred platform. Don't think this will happen. Ethereum is so far ahead on the game on this due to the amount of people in its ecosystem that it makes it really difficult for any other platform to catch up. 
* Coinbase listing, look what happened to Ethereum Classic. Coinbase is like Baby's First Crypto. A lot of people - myself included, bought their first crypto on Coinbase.
* Enterprise adoption - This is what Vechain is claiming it can achieve.

Regardless of what does it, you need actual, tangible results for any of those things. Empty words, promises, coming soon and partnerships do not matter. There are still only a few thousand transactions per day on mainnet and even fewer on testnet.",2018-08-07 00:56:01

Problem is, the current cryptocurrency iterations are *shit*. All we have is some random ass digital tokens that greatly benefit early investors/accumulators because of speculation and deflation. That's counter-intuitive to a currency. If it's more profitable for you to *hold* you have no reason to *spend* unless its an emergency. And if you have no reason to spend, you're not making the economy go 'round, which is the very core idea of a currency.

That means the current iterations of cryptoCURRENCIES are not and will not work as currency. And that, in turn, means the whole idea is flawed since the main objective is not going to be achieved.

And don't even get me started on adoption. Its *dropping* because of many reasons, some of which were the high volatily during high usage times (speculative bubble inflation aka ""bullrun"") and high transfer fees and/or huge delays. That's not something you'd expect from a technology that proposes itself to ""kill banking and credit cards and take over the online money playing field"". Its the very opposite.

What we have, with 99.9% of all cryptocurrencies, are just highly speculative, pyramidy, greater-fool, bagholding ~~currenc-~~ assets.

That's exactly why a huge rejection happened at $20,000.00. A lot of people were willing to sell at that price after buying/waiting for so long. A lot of people were discouraged to buy at that price because its a ridiculously high price for an asset that does the same thing at 1 cent as it does at 1 million dollars.

in the truther or conspiracy communities into horoscope. An oracle of delphi game.

They got bored and let it end leading into December.

This ends the initial LARP.

A couple opportunists saw potential to run with it for profit. Added a researcher and ponzi scheme to the initial core. Built out channels and platforms to aggregate drops with bitcoin mining baked in.

Relaunched the LARP. Change of tone is noticeable. They got chased off 4chan when changing IPs and the growing branding effort were observed.

The group grew as other parties saw the potential to build a digital brand. This was encouraged, bait dangled to research and work for the digital branding to continue generating new ideas for drops and keep the community engaged and expanding.

In addition to advertising clicks on YouTube channels, many sites are loaded up with bitcoin mining. Physical merchandise is available for sale. Donations are set up. The phone app rumored to scrape personal information of those using it. Surprising amount of donations brought in. Overall last update I heard its estimated that these people have brought in over the hundreds of thousands, possibly close to a million on the LARP. That's what this is about. BIG money. People don't want to let it go, so they'll keep it going.

The rationalization we're seeing is that its brought attention and research to topics that would otherwise not be covered by the news or otherwise not as appreciated. There is some merit there. The issues come from the toxic split among people who were in when they are ejected from the group. The branding has been weaponized at time to create harassment/bullying campaigns targeting people. That's a huge negative and distraction. As key players drafting information has tightened up, tone has directed toward a ""trust everything, don't question"" model, as opposed to the ""trust nothing, question everything"" model it began. The quality of information has declined, often parroting news sites and trends as opposed to breaking new ground.

The competing interests and money involved grew tensions. People bailed or were booted. Each time a new discord created -- these are the times the tripcode was changed.

We've continued down the path surprisingly far. There's enough disgruntled people who have pulled away that new information becomes available daily that connects dots in the pieces of information collected and backed up offline.

The entire LARP can be considered a snowball rolling down hill growing bigger as it globs onto everything in its path which then becomes part of the bigger growing avalanche of everything that trends.

* Embedded in it are all sorts of perfectly truthful, valid, researched pieces of information.

* Embedded in it is total bullshit fluff invented off the cuff to dangle some hope-porn to keep people clicking and tuning in for the next episode.

Thus because Q said something does not discredit it as untrue conspiracy by association. Q globbed onto everything.

Similarly, just because Q said a thing doesn't make it true. Its going to be win some lose some and at different points, different voices detectable in language patterns will have differing degrees of credibility. There's going to be a lot of information that filled the empty air that was complete fabrication. It just keeps doubling down and excusing what went wrong while playing up any interpretation of what could possibly claimed as prediction. Keep that hope porn alive.

At best Q is entertainment. At worst, it's shown SJW-like bully/harassment campaigns sent out after people. Treat it like watching a UFO's are real tv show and you'll be fine, provided willingness to call bullshit regularly. Pre-requisite being the ability to argue one position of an idea, then turn around and argue the opposite opinion.

e3swwrj,where-is-satoshi,38,"&gt; Standard bitcoin also can do 0-confirmation.

Oh please!


Remember the **""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE""** sticker merchants once displayed? 

Now that blockstream/core added Replace-by-Fee (RBF), merchants must check if a customer has set the RBF flag or risk having the funds stolen with a **simple RBF double-spend when the customer leaves the store**. For the merchant to accept 0-conf instant transactions, merchants need to warn customers and thus need a:

**""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE BUT NO RBF""** sticker.

Well not quite. Putting aside for a moment that a merchant rejecting any customer is bad for business, blockstream/core also instituted artificial congestion with their 1MB blocksize limit. Thus, for the merchant to accept 0-conf, a merchant must examine the customer's TXs fee with respect to the Mempool fee distribution and Mempool size to ensure the TX joins the top 2000 Mempool TXs (those likely to be included in the next block) for an acceptable 0-conf risk. Naturally the customer(payer) must also check the Mempool fee distribution and size in order to meet the fee and flag conditions the merchant sets for non-cold-coffee. Merchants then really need to display a:

**""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE BUT NO RBF &amp; TX FEE MUST BE IN TOP 2,000 FEE BAND OF CURRENT MEMPOOL""** 

[sticker](https://i.redd.it/hnzn2n9oi4m01.jpg).

Now we're good right? Not even close. Even though a merchant can see the customer's TX in the top 2,000 Mempool transactions, at what rate are new TXs joining the Mempool and how likely will the customer's TX be bumped from the set of TX's likely included in the next block? With block time variance thrown in, a merchant can only guess at the likely risk (and I'll leave it up to the reader how such a sticker would be drafted).

e3vwna2,BrutalTruth101,119,"""DONALD AND GOLIATH"" - Ben Garrison

Corporate banks privately own the Federal Reserve.

It is neither federal nor does it have any reserves. It began in conspiracy and got it's start in 1913 with the promise of ending booms and busts. What we got were bigger booms and busts, along with endless war from which those private banks profited. Adding fuel to the corruption, the central bankers also enjoy fractional reserve banking. They get to abuse that and become rich and powerful while We The People get to pay interest on endlessly increasing debt.

The first step in ending the Fed is an audit. Sure, they claim to conduct their own internal audit, which they then use to assure us with a wink and a nod that everything is A-OK. It isn’t. Ben Bernanke refused to tell Congress where trillions of dollars went. They claim they need to protect their sovereign independence, an excuse they use to cover their corruption. The Fed was bailing out big banks worldwide. They didn’t want Congress or taxpayers to know where the filthy lucre was sent. An independent audit would reveal the utter corruption of the private interests that control the Fed.

If we can audit the Fed, we can then end the Fed.

There’s absolutely no reason why the Fed can’t be nationalized. Congress again would control money creation and regulation. The process could be transparent. There’s no reason why our money can’t be created debt free. Print up money commensurate with production and services. Use it to rebuild roads, bridges, canals and locks, airports and all the other infrastructure that’s falling apart in this country. Lincoln did this during the Civil War with his greenbacks. Kennedy also attempted the same. Both were assassinated.

There’s no reason to add to an already un-payable $21 trillion debt. And while I’m at it, Americans are entitled to a pay back from the Federal Reserve banks. Make them pay us back for all the illegal taxes paid on our hard-earned wages for decades. Give us back what was stolen.

The too big to fail banks are rife with corruption. Look at Wells Fargo. It used to have integrity

Now Wells Fargo does the robbing. HSBC and other banks occasional get a slap on their greedy wrists for money laundering. The pay a trifle and continue to money launder in cahoots with the Deep State. There was a story about safe deposit boxes disappearing at Bank of America. They don’t know why. POOF! Your valuables are simply taken without explanation. Carry around a large amount of cash? Police or the TSA will simply steal it. Civil forfeiture. Banks are also very reluctant to let you withdraw large amounts of cash.

No wonder Bitcoin had such a terrific run. People are desperate to find better system of money.

Taking on the Fed will be a daunting task. The Deep State will howl loudly with outrage. They will do anything to protect the Federal Reserve because it’s their main tool to bring about their global “New World Order.”

Trump has a painting of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office. I hope he takes inspiration from Old Hickory’s toughness. It will be needed to once again take down the corrupt central bankers.

e3ubc8x,bitvote,56,"felt like it this was a good time to leave a note. 

I've been a bitcoin user/investor since early 2013 and I've never been more bullish about the long term. 

Traders have been blessed with crypto-volatility, wave after wave of high percentage daily changes. Over time this volatility is likely to decline, at least for cryptos with large market caps, but the volatility is also one of the reasons we're all here. The tradability of this asset class is a key draw. All of those exchange profits are REAL. 

Binance is straight up minting money. That a Goldman-backed Circle bought a post-peak Poloniex for $400M is... a reminder of why major banks will (in the long run) find crypto trading irresistible. If the next major run begins, many big banks want to be ready to rake in the $$$. 

And a similar story with insurance. and institutional custody services. Crypto involves huge premiums relative to standard financial instruments. The pull of profits exerts a predictable force on companies, like an apple falling from a tree, the prospect of profit will draw more and more major insurers and other services into the space. And that requires them to understand crypto a little bit. And I've never known someone who really understood crypto to not be a believer at some level. And this increase in understanding and involvement will lend legitimacy to the core. 

In the interim: Price will go up. and down. and all over the place. 

But long run, bitcoin is a killer option play. The downside is pretty limited, maybe 50-60%. The risk adjusted upside - at this entry point - is way higher than you can get with any traditional investment. even with VC returns. 

So, console yourselves a bit, all of the tears being cried today will help carry our crypto ark to the promiseland of maximum profit.

e3wdzk9,vbuterin,141,"They're very clearly writing a hit piece, and not genuinely engaging with any of the actual tradeoffs in consensus design or trying to understand Casper, as I tried with Cardano [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/92r3si/vitalik_allegations_against_ouroboros/e38j0ig/) (notice how that Reddit post still has no answers).

&gt; Regarding Casper, we are not aware of any currently published source that sufficiently describes the protocol’s mode of operation nor any provable guarantees about it.

WTF? First of all, there is [the Casper FFG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437). Second, there is the [full FFG mini-spec](https://ethresear.ch/t/beacon-chain-casper-ffg-rpj-mini-spec/2760). Both contain definitions of key guarantees (safety, plausible liveness, fairness...), along with proofs that they're satisfied. In addition, there are [computer-verified proofs](https://yoichihirai.com/amsterdam2017.pdf) of the properties of Casper FFG.

&gt; The Ouroboros protocol is analyzed in a model that is fully described: it unambiguously defines all the participants’ programs, their execution and interactions, their communication – including network properties ... Without such a model (notably missing in the Casper FFG white paper or in any other available sources related to Casper), it is impossible to prove the correctness of any claims about the protocol.

This is clearly pedantry and not any kind of honest attempt to engage with the protocol. There is clearly a model: validators broadcast votes. This model is clearly sufficient to prove the desired safety and plausible liveness properties, because the proofs exist and you can look at them.

&gt; Similarly, other versions of the Casper protocol, such as Casper FFG-RPJ, are incomplete and/or not accompanied by any proofs of security.

Umm.... https://ethresear.ch/t/epoch-less-casper-ffg-liveness-safety-argument/2702

&gt; In contrast, Casper requires a ⅔-fraction of deposited stake to be controlled by honest parties (see section 2.1 of the white paper)

Economically rational parties, or at least parties rational enough to not be willing to voluntarily burn a billion dollars. Very different from honest.

&gt; under the assumption that ⅔ of the deposited stake is honest

Once again, that is not the assumption! The assumption is that the attacker is not willing to voluntarily burn a billion dollars. Very different from relying on ""honesty"".

&gt; As a concrete example, in the same window of time, which is a little over half an hour in our current deployment, we can derive from our formal analysis that Ouroboros will offer finality against, say, a 10% stake adversary with probability of error less than 2^(-44). This is less than 1/10000000000000, one over ten trillion. To appreciate such small numbers, consider that it is expected to have one large asteroid hit the earth once every 100 million years (Scientific American). Thus, it is 10 thousand times more likely that a big asteroid will hit the earth next month than that Ouroboros will reorganise its chain to drop a particular transaction after it has been included in the ledger for about half an hour.

That's nice. You know what's even more nice? Casper FFG RPJ achieves the same level of security *within one slot* (8-16 seconds) (see arguments [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/beacon-chain-casper-ffg-rpj-mini-spec/2760)).

&gt; Blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ouroboros are called eventual-consensus since they ensure that the irreversibility of a block increases gradually with the number of blocks that are added on top of it. This means that finality is more nuanced than just a true or false value,

That's great! Casper FFG RPJ also does this.

&gt; However, near-instant finality typically also comes with significant downsides in terms of the security model such as a much higher requirement of honest stake or, perhaps more importantly, a high degree of guaranteed online presence that must be offered by the participants following the protocol.

Casper FFG RPJ requires this for *finality*. If finality is not possible (eg. due to &gt;33% being offline), then Casper FFG RPJ can still get security guarantees of a similar type to chain-based PoS algos, so it gives the best of both worlds.

&gt; This means that the protocol cannot operate in the “sleepy setting” and “dynamic availability” setting

It cannot *achieve finality* in a sleepy or dynamic availability setting. It can still grow the chain with the same guarantees as other chain-based PoS algos.

&gt; Ouroboros is analysed in the “partially synchronous” setting where messages are delivered to the majority of the parties executing the protocol within a time window upper bounded by a network delay Δ which is unknown to the parties. 

I'm skeptical that Praos is actually safe in this model; as mentioned above I'm still waiting on a reply to https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/92r3si/vitalik_allegations_against_ouroboros/e38j0ig/.

Given that they seem to be claiming 50% fault tolerance under partial synchrony, and there are [30 year old established results](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf) that this is impossible, I am very much looking forward to a clarification.",2018-08-10 02:39:30

e3z5r9t,thats_no_good,408,"I find it amazing that there is no proof that 1) the exchange actually bought the bitcoins, or even 2) that the trader exists. In the former case you just take the $25M in collateral and clawback millions more to ""break even"" on your depreciated asset that you never invested in, which means that you never incurred any loss from the depreciation in the first place. The problem with this approach is that, if the price of Bitcoin goes up, the exchange would be screwed because they never actually invested in the appreciating asset. So either a) you resort to a plethora of [market manipulation techniques](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/06/01/cryptocurrency-trader-says-the-market-is-manipulated/#34734beb25cd) or b) just go with approach number 2 above, which is just faking the trader who invested on margin in the first place.

&gt;In his Hail Mary bid to tip the election to Trump, the Republican private equity executive enlisted two controversial alt-right activists to help him understand the workings of the internet and make contacts in Trump’s orbit, according to interviews with those involved and emails obtained by Politico.

&gt;The activists, the journalist-turned-entrepreneur **Charles Johnson** and his former business partner Pax Dickinson, agreed to help Smith’s quixotic mission, which failed to track down copies of Clinton’s emails. Johnson is a polarizing figure who was banned from Twitter in 2015 after promoting an effort to “take out” a Black Lives Matter activist but maintains ties to White House officials. Smith also reached out to “Guccifer 2.0”—an alias the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Russian state hackers—and was advised to seek the help of a white nationalist hacker who lives in Ukraine.

*And*


Charles (Chuck) Johnson, alt-right troll/holocaust denier who was invited to the State of the Union by Matt Gaetz, gave Rep. Dana Rohrabacher the maximum allowed $5,400 campaign contribution in Bitcoin weeks after he claimed to [help arrange a meeting with Rohrabacher and Julian Assange. ^[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/928gau/remember_the_secret_2016_tape/e33yd3n/?context=1)

One would naturally ask, ""How does a group of people get so pumped up on hate..?""

[God's Own Party](https://youtu.be/TFSA0IPMqew) is a book about how the Christian Right became.

It started in the 1930s when big business tried and failed to push their anti taxation *(only rich paid taxes back then)* small government message... aginst Trustbusting Roosevelt.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to friendly churches. 

It's in the book. That's how it started... 

...then in the 1970s after Nixon felt the media was mean to him over Watergate,  Fox, Rush L, and the conservative media movement begun, intended as a right wing propaganda machine. That is detailed in [Brainwashing of my Dad](https://youtu.be/Qh3TeTxgNVo)

e3yof7q,Peter__R,58,"#All we needed was bigger blocks

The only hard-forking change we really needed was bigger blocks, and so I agree with Haipo.  

#Important advancements can be made permissionlessly _without_ a fork

Exciting work is being done for bitcoin cash right now.  All the items below can be done without a hard-fork, and in most cases without a soft-fork too:

- double-spend proofs (neither a hard- nor a soft-fork)

- faster transaction relay (neither a hard- nor a soft-fork)

- graphene (neither a hard- nor a soft-fork)

- subchains (neither a hard- nor a soft-fork)

- UTXO commitments (not a hard-fork, but needs a soft-fork to be trusted under the PoW conjecture)

I'm not saying that I'm against hard- or soft-forks, but I think if they happen at all, they should happen very slowly and only after _lots and lots_ of community discussion.

#""You cannot articulate why this forking-change is bad"" is not a convincing argument in favour of forking

It is the responsibility of the faction who wishes to make a hard- or soft-forking change to convince the community that it is useful, doesn't hurt existing use cases, and that the risks are well understood.  A good example is the hard-fork to enforce canonical/lexicographic ordering of transactions in blocks, scheduled for ABC's November upgrade.  I don't like it.  I think this change will come back to bite us.  But I have yet to articulate a _really convincing_ reason of why it is bad (I can articulate several somewhat convincing reasons however).  But then, the group who wants to make this hard-forking change cannot articulate a really convincing reason why it is good.  **I think in a case like this, we should have a strong bias towards the status quo.**  

#Unknown Unknowns

Hard- and soft-forks have unknown unknowns.  Nassim Nicolas Taleb, the author of Antifragile, might say ""why open yourself up to a huge (but unpredictable) downside, for a small (but predictable) upside?""  Yet, developers seem to have an inherent need to sniff out and remove all inefficiencies in a system (I know I am guilty of this myself).  What we miss is that oftentimes those ""inefficiencies"" were actually adding robustness to the system.

#If developers played God

If our human physiology were designed by developers instead of by Nature's trial-and-error process, we'd certainly see some improvements: the devs would fix the L5/S1 weakness in the human back, and get rid of the appendix.  But then I bet they'd eventually want to redesign the human eye to move the optic nerves to the back side of the retina (like the Octopus) to eliminate our [blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision)).  

Such a redesign of the human eye has a small but known benefit: our vision (especially with only one eye open) would objectively be improved.  But we'd be opening ourselves up to an unknown downside: did they really get the redesign right?  Maybe there were some small details of the original human eye that we didn't understand (details that millions of years of evolution fine tuned in subtle ways) and then missed when they made the redesign to remove the blind spot (a good example of this is the small consensus bug ABC created when they [refactored a section of code for cosmetic reasons](https://medium.com/@coryfields/http-coryfields-com-cash-48a99b85aad4)).

#Bitcoin development should be more like growing a garden

The point I'm trying to make is that Nature would never redesign the human eye to remove the ""inefficient"" blind spot.  Our eyes work well enough.  

Gavin Andresen said once that Bitcoin development is like growing a garden: ""you plant all these different seeds, try to help them grow, weed out the bad stuff, and let nature do the rest.""  Gardens grow slowly and no matter how much we try, the plants will never adhere precisely to the design we had in mind when we planted the seeds.

Then they threw the book at him and denied him a well deserve retrial and appeal. It's so incredibly fucked.

e40vwr9,Kain_niaK,72,"Bitcoin is a solution to a very specific problem: 

&gt;[Commerce](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for
most   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid   mediating   disputes.     The   cost   of   mediation   increases   transaction   costs,   limiting   the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and   there   is   a   broader   cost   in   the   loss   of   ability   to   make   non-reversible   payments   for   non-
reversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.

The blockchain is a part of a mechanism described to solve the above stated problem. It makes ZERO sense outside of this mechanism. And this mechanism makes ZERO sense outside of this problem. 

If Bitcoin is a car, blockchain is it's engine. 

What you are seeing now (with the blockchain buzzword hype) is the equivalent of taking an engine out of a car and say: ""You see this engine?, if we put this engine in to a traffic light it will decentralise the roads and thus make the world a better place"" 

Which is a totally bonkers statement but if you don't know what an engine is or what it does, or what traffic light are, or how they work, or what they do. And if you don't know what the word decentralise means or in what context it should be used. And if you have no idea what roads are and how they work. But you like the idea of getting rich without having to do anything and you saved up some money. Well ....

&gt;The letter says the sender has evidence of what the men have been hiding and includes instructions on how wire the blackmail money using bitcoin.

&gt;If the recipient chooses to ignore the threat, the scammer writes that “I will take this evidence and send it to your wife. And as an insurance against you intercepting it before your wife gets it, I will also send copies to her friends, family, and to all your nearest neighbors. So even if you decide to come clean with your wife, it won’t protect her from the humiliation she will feel when her friends and family find our your sordid details from me.”

&gt;The FBI says the scammer is sending the letter in large numbers in hopes that some of the men who receive it may actually be cheating on their wives or have something else to hide, so they opt to pay up.

Also [csw has an interesting comment about fraud proofs as well](https://coingeek.com/craig-wright-bitcoin-scalability/):

&gt; This leads us to SPV wallets. SPV wallets or “Simple Payment Verification” clients are a technique which Satoshi had described in his paper, describing how a lightweight client can verify transactions without downloading the entire blockchain.

&gt; Craig Wright states the following:

&gt; “Now, the first thing we need to understand is that all encryption systems are probabilistic. Password systems and any modern information security system works on probabilistic information. The so-called experts who talk about the probabilistic system of bitcoin fail to comprehend that strong encryption is probabilistic.

&gt; Fraud proofs and nowhere near as difficult as anyone thinks. They do not require some special cryptographic protocol. They are far simpler to implement than anyone seems to understand.

&gt; The solution is incredibly simple. All you need to do is randomly select a series of nodes on the network and query whether the inclusion of your transaction has occurred on that node. Each query would be random. Using a simple Bayesian algorithm, we could use a failure model to analyse the likelihood of a double spend or other attack.” – Dr Craig Wright

&gt; Wright explains that each time we pick a node at random and request our transaction we can expect either of the following results:

&gt; – We receive our transaction as we expected,
&gt; – We receive an alternate transaction such as a double spend, or
&gt; – We receive nothing.

&gt; Basically, checking eight nodes would give you 99.9999% assurance that your transaction will be included within a block in the next block mine (assuming that the cap has been removed and we don’t have all these delays). The limitation imposed by the cap it is severely diminishing the security of the network.

&gt; In under two seconds, 99.98% of the total hash power would have received your transaction. These figures are from the existing network. This means that without the cap, you can be assured of even zero confirmation transactions in a minimum amount of time. This wasn’t the case in 2010. This has nothing to do with the protocol. It is to do with the economics of the system. As miners become more commercial and professional, the overall security and efficiency of the network increases exponentially.

&gt; Craig Wright concludes “0-confirmation WAS secure before Core”.",2018-08-12 08:30:42

(Hashrate being the sole differentiator in the favor of the older blockchain... is that the sole metric the market values?)

Take away their names and focus on the tech: the only thing that makes the less ambitious project a ""store of value"" is a narrative that developed around it last year in the face of poor on-chain scaling. The capabilities - especially the PRESENT, REALIZABLE CAPABILITIES - are all that should matter; the narratives are largely noise.

The problem is that there is no self-contained description of what exactly Casper does in all possible circumstances to leave the reader without any doubt about what is happening in the protocol as well as there are no proofs of all the relevant properties. Some examples: in the FFG whitepaper, Theorem 1 on safety is proven in page 4 for the static version of the protocol where the validator set is fixed. As a result the theorem is not a full proof of safety since the assumption that 2/3 of validators do not violate a slashing condition is only sensible for the period of time that validators have actually something at stake. In upcoming sections, protocol operations related to this are revisited (e.g., in Dynamic validator sets, Long Range Revisions), but no other formal theorem statement is made except for a sketch that is provided in section 4.1. In the RPJ mini-spec, similarly, dynamic validator sets seem more of an afterthought and a claim without a proof is presented. Back in the FFG paper, in section ""The Casper Protocol"", the validator broadcasts a vote, but while the data type of the vote is given, it is not described exactly what the validator votes on and when. This leaves ambiguity in terms of the protocol operation and furthermore raises a question about how useful ""plausible liveness"" can be as a property. The reason is that it is easy to think of specific voting strategies and underlying block proposal mechanisms that even though can satisfy liveness at the block proposal level, plausible liveness will not imply liveness at the FFG level and no checkpoint will get finalised beyond the genesis block. The list can go on. What is needed is a full description of the protocol in high level / pseudocode, concrete formal definitions of the properties and then proofs that the protocol satisfies them. Finally a proof of liveness is needed under clearly stated assumptions on the underlying block proposal mechanism in FFG or directly in the case of RPJ.

&gt;This is clearly pedantry and not any kind of honest attempt to engage with the protocol. There is clearly a model: validators broadcast votes. This model is clearly sufficient to prove the desired safety and plausible liveness properties, because the proofs exist and you can look at them.

I don't think it is pedantry to ask for a full description of the protocol that is unambiguous and accompanied by proofs that persistence/safety and liveness are satisfied. Let's not forget: the burden of proof is with the protocol proposer not the protocol reviewer/user. I am saying all this in good faith and I am very much looking forward to a complete writeup of the protocol.

&gt;I'm skeptical that Praos is actually safe in this model; as mentioned above I'm still waiting on a reply to [https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/92r3si/vitalik\_allegations\_against\_ouroboros/e38j0ig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/92r3si/vitalik_allegations_against_ouroboros/e38j0ig/).  
Given that they seem to be claiming 50% fault tolerance under partial synchrony, and there are 30 year old established results that this is impossible, I am very much looking forward to a clarification.

Answering this is easy and also showcases the importance of having concrete statements about protocols and proofs of their properties. You can refer to theorem 1 of Ouroboros Genesis paper ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/378.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/378.pdf)) or theorem 9 of Ouroboros Praos ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf)) to see what happens in settings like this. For instance, consider a ten-fold increase in network delay. Plug in Delta and 10Delta in the alpha inequality and you will see that an extra factor approximately (1-f 9 Delta) will appear in the second case changing the lower bound for honest over active parties. For the sake of concrete numbers, suppose f originally is set as f\*Delta \~&lt; 0.03; in turn, this means that the protocol will provide security in the 10Delta setting assuming the honest parties are over at least 69%, as opposed to over \~50%. As we state in p.3 of the Praos paper ""security degrades gracefully as Delta increases, and this parameter is unknown to the protocol participants."" To make a broader point, as mentioned already, Ouroboros Praos and Genesis are analysed in the partial synchronous setting and provide the exact same type of persistence/consistency guarantees as the Bitcoin protocol (but without PoW of course, relying just on stake). In more detail, both Ouroboros and Nakamoto consensus use a conservative guarantee for the network delay and then set a parameter for the silence period (in case of Praos/Genesis) or the difficulty level (in the case of Bitcoin). One of the beautiful points in the PoS setting is that silence can be engineered in the protocol via a VRF mechanism and achieves a similar effect to proof of work as we have shown in Praos. The ""(1-f)\^Delta"" term you find in the theorems cited above is common in both Bitcoin and Ouroboros (where f is roughly the probability that in a unit of time a block is produced). You can see the same exact term in the Bitcoin backbone analysis (section 7 [https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765.pdf)) and in the Pass, Seeman, Shelat 2017, ""Analysis of the Blockchain Protocol in Asynchronous Networks"" ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/454](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/454), theorem 1.2, note that the term there has been simplified by bringing Delta down from the exponent). It is worth noting that as Bitcoin recalibrates difficulty to accomodate changes in hashing power, it is possible to recalibrate f in Ouroboros in a similar way, to accommodate a wider range of delays and participation levels while security can be shown drawing from our analysis of the Bitcoin protocol in the variable difficulty setting ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1048](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1048)). Regarding alternative blockchain methods such as GHOST and the degree they can improve things, it is an interesting question that we have been looking into for some time. A first analysis of GHOST we have performed is in the synchronous setting ([https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/545](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/545)) and I expect it will easily extend to the partial synchronous setting (using the same proof logic laid out in the backbone paper, Section 7).",2018-08-13 08:58:03

There are also lots of mainstream conservatives, libertarians, anti-SJW liberals, etc. all of which have sometimes been grouped in with ""alt-right"". But /pol/ fervently hates the term ""alt-right"", does not use it as a self-descriptor, and hates the few who do. Some of them used to be the main people to call themselves that, using it as an umbrella term that meant ""non-institutional right"" or ""internet-right"". But when Richard Spencer popped up and claimed to have invented the term and thus the ""movement"" (despite the fact that very few who called themselves alt-right had any idea who he was and the term ""alternative right"" predates him, at most he can claim to have popularized the shortened version) they considered him to be either a shill or an eceleb attention-seeker and the term itself was swiftly abandoned.

So no it doesn't really exist as a useful category. Mostly it's a way to muddy the waters and imply someone is a white supremacist when they haven't actually expressed any white-supremacist beliefs. To the extent that it gestures at a real movement or subculture, it means 4chan/8chan. People are good at picking up tribal/subcultural cues, so they notice when suddenly a bunch of the political landscape is people using imageboard memes. The term ""alt-right"" provides people a way to talk about 4chan's influence (or overstate it as a boogieman) that doesn't involve putting ""4chan"" in the title of hundreds of articles and sounding like an idiot.

For example GG was created by 4chan's /v/, and is often called alt-right or the origin of the alt-right despite being majority left-wing and only having the similarities of being anti-SJW and originating from 4chan. Part of that is just people trying to group all their outgroups together together the same way they've spent years conflating together MRAs and PUAs, but part is that both /v/ and /pol/ share certain elements of imageboard culture that people can pick up on. It reminds me of an earlier effort along those lines by AManInBlack (anti-GG twitter poster whose twitter posts about GG got him invited to write some articles for The Guardian and Boing Boing), who in 2015 wrote ""[A beginner's guide to the Redpill Right](http://archive.is/lk3kG)"". It tries to conflate together GG, MRAs, PUAs, neoreactionaries, conspiracy theorists, Bitcoin speculators, TERFs, egalitarians, equity feminists, etc. Of course ""redpill"" is just 4chan slang that means informed/enlightened/""woke"", where the specific thing you're informed about varies by context, as well as being a reference that has seen more widespread use in pop culture. So it's a mixture of groups that use 4chan slang, MRAs (which generally don't use 4chan slang but are justified because a few old AVFM articles made Matrix references), and various unrelated groups that don't actually use the term ""redpill"" at all but that he threw in there anyways. People who then encounter 4chan slang can associate it with this categorization scheme. It reads remarkably similarly to a modern alt-right ""explainer"".",2018-08-13 01:05:32

e43zxwe,jtoomim,34,"I believe you mean ""chain split,"" not ""hard fork"". 

The terms are a little counterintuitive in the Bitcoin community to newbies. A fork happens whenever the consensus rules change, even if all miners follow the same branch.

A hard fork happens whenever the consensus rules become more permissive, so that a previously disallowed block would be allowed. Hard forks may also make other rules more strict at the same time. For example, a hard fork could allow a block header to be 112 bytes instead of just 80 bytes, but with the requirement that the extra 32 bytes represent a UTXO snapshot commitment.

A soft fork happens whenever the consensus rules become strictly less permissive, such that some previously valid blocks become invalid, but all blocks that are now valid were also valid before. For example, a soft fork could require that the coinbase transaction have an OP_RETURN output containing 32 bytes of data representing a UTXO snapshot commitment. Doing that right now isn't against the rules at all, but nobody does it because it's also not required. A soft fork could change that.

Forks are so-called because they have the *potential* for a chain split. That is, **they're like a fork in the road. Just because both paths exist does not mean that both are taken.** If some miners go down one branch of the fork and other miners go down another branch, that is both a fork and a chain split. If all miners go down the same branch, that is a fork but not a chain split.",2018-08-13 22:06:53

[God's Own Party](https://youtu.be/TFSA0IPMqew) is a book about how the Christian Right became.

It started in the 1930s when big business tried and failed to push their anti taxation *(only rich paid taxes back then)* small government message... aginst Trustbusting Roosevelt.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to friendly churches. 

Before this, religious people didnt have any particular political affiliation. It's in the book. That's how it started... 

...then in the 1970s after Nixon felt the media was mean to him over Watergate,  Fox, Rush L, and the conservative media movement begun, intended as a right wing propaganda machine. That is detailed in [Brainwashing of my Dad](https://youtu.be/Qh3TeTxgNVo)

e44jb7h,cryptozypto,81,"2013 stands out as the worst in my memory. I bought in halfway up the parabolic in April thinking that it finally found its legs and was going mainstream. When it tanked, the same talk about how Bitcoin was “over” was being thrown around. Then again in November, with the same “Bitcoin is dead” mantra. 2014 was dormant, but I decided to buy up more, holding through and basically forgetting about my holdings until 2015 when I heard about Ethereum. In 2016, I used some of my gains and more fiat to buy in at $11, only to have it dip through the beginning of 2017, forgot about it for another few months, checked my balance in May of 2017 and just about shat a brick. In my experience, the market has the memory of a fish and forgets about even the bloodiest of times. I have my positions now and will hibernate for another year or so. I’ve cashed out nearly all of my initial investment, so I’m letting it ride because I believe that it’s the future of money.

e44y0va,johnbmaclemore,79,"Starting to get saltier in here, that's a good sign. I know many are depressed and down trodden and poor and yeah that sucks, but I'm going to tell this story again for some perspective.

In late 2013 I sold my home and walked away with a decent amount of money. Not life changing but for a 26 year old it was a lot. I purchased another home and had $xx,xxx left over. At that time Bitcoin was making its run to it's first $1200 top, and I bought in the $800-900 range. I dropped in half of what I got out of my house on a then stupid YOLO play. The news was just like 2017 ""Bitcoin going to $100,000"" ... ""Bitcoin is the future of money!"", ""1 Bitcoin could be worth $1,000,000!"" 

About 1 month after I bought, Bitcoin dropped, and kept dropping and kept dropping. I felt like a fool, but I didn't sell. At this point my $xx,xxx investment was worth  $x,xxx. It just wasn't worth it to sell at that point. I locked it up in the CoinBase Vault and basically just walked away. I checked the price every few months, my heart would sink and then I'd forget about it. I held for more than 3 years and basically wrote off cryptocurrency all together.

Then in 2017 I read an article somewhere ... Bitcoin hits $1,000! I logged into Coinbase and sure enough it had, it was actually at like $1070 or something close to that. So I initiated a vault transfer, which takes 2 days. I had held for 3 years and I was ready to break even on this shit investment. I watched Bitcoin closely for those 2 days ... $1100 happened in a few hours, $1200, $1300. 

Now I'm in profit. So I held. Then I see the Coinbase listing for Ethereum. I'm like, I know Litecoin but what's Ethereum? I start digging and I'm blown away. Ethereum is what Bitcoin promised to be when I bought in 2013. It's fucking programmable money, it's censorship resistant, decentralized, it's a token platform, it's being actively developed! Holy shit, I thought Crypto was a fad but it turns out a lot of people had been working really hard for the last 3-4 years and it wasn't team Bitcoin. So I bought, some at 140,220,250,278 ... I was way over invested. Ethereum hovered in the 270-300 range for ages after that, and I'd pick up an ETH every time it dropped to the 270-273 range. Meanwhile, I watched my Bitcoins pump into the stratosphere.

I finally capitulated and sold all my Bitcoin at around $16,000. I couldn't resist, it was enough to pay off the remainder of my mortgage in one swoop, so I took it. My only regret is I didn't fucking buy more when it was like $160-$250 for 2 years. I'd have a beach house and a yacht instead of a paid off mortgage.

I'm not making that mistake with Ethereum, I'm holding and I'm buying your cheap ass coins all the way down to $42 if need be. Ethereum is \*THE\* Blockchain platform. Thousands of competitors and none of them can get much traction. Meanwhile Ethereum gains traction every day, and when those tires hook up it's going to run so far and so fast it'll make the $1400 pump look like a Boy Scouts Pine Car Derby.

I think my point here is, this shit will come back around and when it does it'll be huge. When I invested in 2013 it was the very beginning, nothing was sure, this was quite literally an experiment by some mysterious guy that disappeared and no one knows who he was. No one was interested except Ancaps and drug dealers. 

It's different this time, Ethereum is different, there's billions a day being plowed into these markets. This drop doesn't worry me, I'm DCA'ing in every damn week, I don't care what the price is because I can see where this is going, this is the beginning and I'm not missing the party like I did with Bitcoin.

I don't think this will take 3-4 years to recover, the ecosystem is so much bigger now. Megacorps from every industry, Governments, Banks, Law Firms on every continent see the value in this system and are plowing resources to developing it. Development takes time and I'm actually shocked at what they have accomplished in the 3 years Ethereum has been around. The next 3 years are going to be awesome, and the next 3 after that will be even better.

Don't have a heart attack, just write this one off, set some price alerts in an app and walk away. Don't drink, don't do drugs, don't fucking hang yourself. Ethereum is one you don't want to miss.",2018-08-14 06:28:50

It was a good reminder that films and tv aren't always accurate, as I imagine they would say something like 'oh my God' and gasp rather than my reaction.

""WHAT THE FUCK"" is what I screamed, before Alec leapt over the bed and clasped a hand over my mouth. It's warm, so he's not a zombie at least. He tried shushing me as I wrestled free. ""Quiet man, your parents will hear!"" he whispered at me as I damn near fell over the bed and a suitcase I didn't recognise. Didn't even really look like a suitcase. Just then, I heard the front door. If my parents hadn't heard anything before, they could now so for the sake of what I think might be heart palpitations and for an explanation, I buttoned it. He held still as we both waited to hear if my parents said anything.

""Mike, honey?"" my mum gingerly asked. ""Was that you?"" she asked in that soft town she's been using ever since Alec died. Or I guess I thought he died. Wanting to get to the bottom of this and maybe actually kill Alec for real, I'm going to have to keep her out. ""Yeah mom, sorry... I just... uh, thought my laptop had been swiped but I left it under my bed."" A pause, hopefully she isn't coming to the door. This time the voice was louder in the same soft tone, she was definitely right outside. Heart in my throat I realised my laptop might be out in the kitchen which would puzzle her and thus make her come in. Looking over it was on my bed, next to this case that I assume has something to do with my not-actually-dead-friend.  It looks ancient, like something out of Harry Potter.

""Oh okay sweetey... me and dad are here if you need us okay? We won't disturb you, you'll probably want time alone."" I looked at Alec who mouthed 'I love your mom' and then winked like the smartass he was. Is. Christ, I \*am\* going to kill him. Waiting for the coffee machine to start in the kitchen, Alec looks at me with pursed lips. Obviously he's happy to see me, but I imagine my face is one of shock and anger. Usually we just have big stupid smiles around each other. He's probably starting to realise this is quite a shock to the system for me. This is real, I'm not one of those morons who can't tell between reality and a fantasy, no hallucination is this good... I hope. But how can it be real? Why? 

As the coffee machine clicks on, he launches himself at me. Before I can say anything, he hugs me. We don't usually hug, but \*boy\* have I missed him these last few weeks. We don't move for I don't know how long. It could just be 5 seconds or 5 minutes, my mind is moving too fast to keep track. 

It reminds me of when I first heard the now-fake news of his death. Driving home. His car lost control. Down an embankment. In the river. Blood found, windows smashed, and no body to recover. At those temperatures and with that current, everyone including his family just assumed the worse. A dive and search found nothing. I remember his mom just staring with these glazed over eyes, not even having hope for a miracle. Again, time moved weirdly after his death. The week before the funeral dragged on. Days haven't felt that long since I was in kindergarten. 

He holds me at arms length, and asks me something he previously would never have had to:

""Do you trust me?"" 

I always did, but obviously there was a great big giant elephant in the room in the shape of my not-dead best friend. He would have to explain just exactly \*h'why\* he faked his death before I could begin to trust him. Hang on, why does he need me to trust him? What's going on that necessitated his death and a funeral? Looking for an answer from me, all I can do is nod. He was always wild but not crazy, every action had a reason that probably contributed to his great life and our great friendship. So w.t.fuck is the reason behind all this?

""I don't have much time to explain. You remember how I helped paint the deck last month? That's where I hid this, and why I needed to... well, you know. Go all Jesus for a week."" He was pointing at this case. I assumed that was the case (heh), and was now really curious as to what was in it.

He whispered in a hurry. ""You remember in high school, I wasted all that time in the computer lab on the dark web and crap? Well I wasn't wasting my time. I was up to some shady stuff. I was one of the first people to dabble in crypto. More importantly I also uh... got involved with some people I shouldn't have. Ever wondered how I managed to buy my own car in senior year? Catfished a paedophile who was a CEO and blackmailed him."" 

My look of disgust made him reassure me that: ""Oh don't worry, after he coughed up the dough I sent his deets to the feds. Anyway, I got up to a lot of shit like that, and eventually pissed into the wrong person's bowl of criminal cereal. He vowed he'd track me down for taking his gang's drug money and dismantling half of their network. Like Robin Hood, just a keyboard and mouse not a bow and arrow.""

He paused, assuming I had a question. I could see where this was heading, so I let him continue. ""Well, the dark web was all anonymous so I thought that threat wasn't really you know... a threat. After we finished school I forgot him, and stored my bitcoin wallets and the well actual cash wallets in this case at the bottom of one our fields. Planned on selling the lot of the coins soon and starting that business we always talked about, modding old muscle cars.""

  
I couldn't help but smile, we had always talked about that. Of course, I didn't think we'd ever have the means to do it, \*especially\* like this. Before he could continue, I heard mom from across the house. ""Honey, we're going out to Mike's for dinner... I've left you money on the counter for whatever you feel like. You're more than welcome to come along... sweety?"" Sensing the urgency to his explanation and wanting to hear the rest, I answered. ""N- no thanks mom."" I sniffled for effect, as Alec smirked at me. ""I'm just going to uh... look over some stuff of Alec's online, have a pizza probably. Say hi to Mike for me."" 

After the door closed and we heard the car started, he resumed the explanation. ""Remember the one gang leader I mentioned? That vowed to get revenge on me? Well, about a month ago I saw him. I walked right past him in the street outside the store. I might've actually died right then and there from a heart attack. I knew what he looked like from the arrest I caused. Of course being the leader he was pretty untouchable and only got a couple of years. He was released this year. Somehow he managed to track down our town. I knew immediately I needed to act. Hence the case under your deck and my fake death. It won't be long before he gets to the school and asks around. I have to keep my family clear of this, so that's why I've hidden it here and bumped myself off. I want us to disappear for a while as I work out how to get rid of him. So, do you trust me?"" 

Before I could respond, the front door opened. I roll my eyes at him and whisper: ""Typical. She always forgets something."" But his eyes are widening, and he whispers quietly. ""I didn't hear the car pull up..."" Suddenly my heart was back up in my throat. ""He can't have found you already... how would he know to come to me anyways?"" Alec quietly moves the case under the bed, and hides in the wardrobe as I yell out. ""Mom?""

No response. But footsteps. Running footsteps. Straight for my door. It crashes open as I'm thrown onto the bed by a hulking, tattooed blast from Alec's past. Immediately he sticks a gun right into my mouth. He places a finger over his mouth. ""One word or move I don't like and I blast you, got it? Nod if you understand."" I do. ""You're friend is the reason I just got out of the iron bar hotel and I'm looking for him. As I say, you bullshit me and I'll kill you. That sneaky rat ratted us out and destroyed our gang, as well as stealing a bunch of our cash. If I hadn't seen him in the street after tracking him down in the year book, I might've believed he was actually dead."" I tried not to look at it, but I saw the wardrobe door opening. 

""That old coot in your school library told me he always up to shit on the computers around the time I got ripped off, and once I found the year book I found him and I found \*you\*. Tell me where is and where he hid the case, otherwise I'll blow you to pieces."" I mumbled. He removed the gun from my mouth and held it by his side. ""Think before you speak, \*where is he and where did he hide the money?""\* Remembering Alec's homerunning-swing and the fact I had a bat in the closest, I answered. ""Why don't you ask him yourself?"" The gang members eyes widened riiiiiight as Alec discombobulated him with the bat. 

""I trust your baseball skills for sure"", I wryly said to him. His smirk widened. ",2018-08-14 07:05:50
e45xqn2,krokodilmannchen,73,"I want to take a moment to re-post /u/johnbmaclemore's great post from yesterday's daily, for my fellow Europeans who might've already went to bed..    

&gt; Starting to get saltier in here, that's a good sign. I know many are depressed and down trodden and poor and yeah that sucks, but I'm going to tell this story again for some perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; In late 2013 I sold my home and walked away with a decent amount of money. Not life changing but for a 26 year old it was a lot. I purchased another home and had $xx,xxx left over. At that time Bitcoin was making its run to it's first $1200 top, and I bought in the $800-900 range. I dropped in half of what I got out of my house on a then stupid YOLO play. The news was just like 2017 ""Bitcoin going to $100,000"" ... ""Bitcoin is the future of money!"", ""1 Bitcoin could be worth $1,000,000!""
&gt; 
&gt; About 1 month after I bought, Bitcoin dropped, and kept dropping and kept dropping. I felt like a fool, but I didn't sell. At this point my $xx,xxx investment was worth $x,xxx. It just wasn't worth it to sell at that point. I locked it up in the CoinBase Vault and basically just walked away. I checked the price every few months, my heart would sink and then I'd forget about it. I held for more than 3 years and basically wrote off cryptocurrency all together.
&gt; 
&gt; Then in 2017 I read an article somewhere ... Bitcoin hits $1,000! I logged into Coinbase and sure enough it had, it was actually at like $1070 or something close to that. So I initiated a vault transfer, which takes 2 days. I had held for 3 years and I was ready to break even on this shit investment. I watched Bitcoin closely for those 2 days ... $1100 happened in a few hours, $1200, $1300.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm in profit. So I held. Then I see the Coinbase listing for Ethereum. I'm like, I know Litecoin but what's Ethereum? I start digging and I'm blown away. Ethereum is what Bitcoin promised to be when I bought in 2013. It's fucking programmable money, it's censorship resistant, decentralized, it's a token platform, it's being actively developed! Holy shit, I thought Crypto was a fad but it turns out a lot of people had been working really hard for the last 3-4 years and it wasn't team Bitcoin. So I bought, some at 140,220,250,278 ... I was way over invested. Ethereum hovered in the 270-300 range for ages after that, and I'd pick up an ETH every time it dropped to the 270-273 range. Meanwhile, I watched my Bitcoins pump into the stratosphere.
&gt; 
&gt; I finally capitulated and sold all my Bitcoin at around $16,000. I couldn't resist, it was enough to pay off the remainder of my mortgage in one swoop, so I took it. My only regret is I didn't fucking buy more when it was like $160-$250 for 2 years. I'd have a beach house and a yacht instead of a paid off mortgage.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not making that mistake with Ethereum, I'm holding and I'm buying your cheap ass coins all the way down to $42 if need be. Ethereum is *THE* Blockchain platform. Thousands of competitors and none of them can get much traction. Meanwhile Ethereum gains traction every day, and when those tires hook up it's going to run so far and so fast it'll make the $1400 pump look like a Boy Scouts Pine Car Derby.
&gt; 
&gt; I think my point here is, this shit will come back around and when it does it'll be huge. When I invested in 2013 it was the very beginning, nothing was sure, this was quite literally an experiment by some mysterious guy that disappeared and no one knows who he was. No one was interested except Ancaps and drug dealers.
&gt; 
&gt; It's different this time, Ethereum is different, there's billions a day being plowed into these markets. This drop doesn't worry me, I'm DCA'ing in every damn week, I don't care what the price is because I can see where this is going, this is the beginning and I'm not missing the party like I did with Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think this will take 3-4 years to recover, the ecosystem is so much bigger now. Megacorps from every industry, Governments, Banks, Law Firms on every continent see the value in this system and are plowing resources to developing it. Development takes time and I'm actually shocked at what they have accomplished in the 3 years Ethereum has been around. The next 3 years are going to be awesome, and the next 3 after that will be even better.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't have a heart attack, just write this one off, set some price alerts in an app and walk away. Don't drink, don't do drugs, don't fucking hang yourself. Ethereum is one you don't want to miss.

e44er19,Contrarian__,60,"&gt; I still believe that CSWs knowledge on the protocol is unparalleled, at the very least, the man is very knowledgeable (and confident in that knowledge) on the protocol as well as the disciplines involved within.

(The following is reproduced from an older comment I made.)

There are two ways to approach his technical ability. First, let's check the positive evidence of his technical ability. Has he shown that he's capable of producing quality technical things?

No.

* There is no evidence he's even able to code. 
* His PhD (which he claimed to have before 2015) was awarded in 2017. It's in a subject that's [definitely not computer science](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/the-quantification-of-information-systems-risk-a-look-at-quantita-3) and it (unsurprisingly) has [basic math errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/659wk9/craig_s_wrights_ph_d_thesis_submitted_to_charles/dgaiftm/).
* One of his biggest claims (in terms of technical achievement) is when he [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/94vydm/beware_of_users_like_craigbch_they_are_core/e3p39d1/?context=3) that bitcoin's *script language* is Turing Complete. [This is wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/92usrk/yes_csw_is_an_aholean_shole_who_is_usually_right/e3dz7e8/?context=3).
* nChain wasn't even able to implement code changes to the ABC client and had [to outsource it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/90e4j7/csw_writes_about_a_new_non_hardforkchange_they/e2ry3h3/).
* He claims to have written hundreds (is it thousands yet?) of technical papers, but [here's what an actual Computer Science Ph.D. says about his papers](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7386vx/craig_s_wright_facts/dnrfaze/).
* His patents seem to be [full of plagiarized content](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3wdz7r/craig_steven_wrights_registry_patent_heavily/) and are of [dubious validity](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8gxsf7/patent_on_technique_which_bitcoin_cash_used_since/).

So there's a *lack of evidence* of technical ability. On to the *evidence of lack* of technical ability.

* His math skills are [absolutely abysmal](https://twitter.com/i/moments/888788567497035776).
* He [claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkodky/) that selfish mining doesn't even work *in theory*!
* He doesn't [understand what the CENT variable is in the bitcoin client code](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6985s5/craig_s_wright_qa_on_slack/dh4j5m3/), though he supposedly wrote it!
* He doesn't [understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6l6w56/the_hard_evidence_about_craig_wrights_backdated/djstl74/?context=3) the current bitcoin client code.
* He doesn't understand elliptic curve cryptography. ([His claim](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924242722810195968) and [the devastating refutation](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/799xlz/csw_many_wonder_why_secp256k1_was_used_in/dp0azeb/).)
* He [makes recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8721o7/discussion_of_craig_wrights_statement_that_miners/) for mining that are [provably idiotic](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8bsi94/why_the_coingeek_pledge_to_improve_instant/).
* More (hilarious) [lack of understanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cmq15/nchain_releases_nakasendo_royaltyfree_software/dxjc4iu/) of basic math. 
* He [didn't understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/90e4j7/csw_writes_about_a_new_non_hardforkchange_they/e2pzmte/) how the early bitcoin protocol worked. 
* He has beginner-level [misunderstandings of functions versus data types](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hfyoo/evidence_that_craig_wright_is_not_satoshi_he/d2pi8fs/) with [bonus hilarious technobabble](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hfyoo/evidence_that_craig_wright_is_not_satoshi_he/).
* His pseudocode has [embarrassing, beginner-level errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8bgnvw/nchain_obtains_patent_to_enable_video_music/dx70f39/).
* His most famous work (with Kleiman) is [basically technobabble](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6nzpiw/dave_kleiman_is_satoshi_nakamoto/dkf8qp8/).  
* The team working for him at nChain was [perplexed at his lack of technical skill](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1495.0-1495.559).
* He stole other blog posts' [technical content](https://hackernoon.com/did-satoshi-steal-my-blog-post-76a68cdda4f3).
* He [plagiarized almost an entire paper](https://twitter.com/PeterRizun/status/983752297363660800?s=19), even though the stolen work didn't even apply to his thesis.
* Deadalnix says Craig [doesn't understand basic distributed systems concepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/90e4j7/csw_writes_about_a_new_non_hardforkchange_they/e2pyewk/).
* He claimed (in regard to selfish mining) that [gamma could be negative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TglmWKJBTec), when **by definition** it cannot. 
* [People](https://web.archive.org/web/20170110160430/https://www.nikcub.com/posts/craig-wright-is-not-satoshi-nakamoto/) who worked for Craig [think he lacks the skill to be Satoshi](https://meanderful.blogspot.com/2018/07/satoshi-claims-duality-and-scammer.html). 
* He [claimed](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/1028305674592309249) that reserved OP codes were meant to be used in case of a future hash vulnerability, but that's [utter nonsense](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/96jtgy/the_null_op_codes_are_in_bitcoin_for_the_day_a/e417jp0/). 
* He is so technically inept that, when [he faked his PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24), he didn't realize that using modern software would create keys that are different from the ones that [would have been created in 2008](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6l6w56/the_hard_evidence_about_craig_wrights_backdated/dk0l1s9/).

Given that his technical skills are so obviously lacking, why does he seem able to convince some people (though nearly all bitcoin devs think he's a fraud) that he has the chops? Here is an enlightening [quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cmq15/nchain_releases_nakasendo_royaltyfree_software/dxjijns/) from Peter Rizun:

&gt; I gave him the benefit of the doubt for a long time (even though I couldn't parse a single technical thing he ever wrote). We actually met in person once in Vancouver at a nChain office. It was this meeting that made it clear to me that he was making stuff up.

&gt; First, he told me how great my work was and suggested that we write a paper on his selfish mining findings together (as co-authors). I said something like ""I'm pretty sure you're wrong and that Eyal &amp; Sirer are perfectly correct. But, I'd still like to try to understand your argument for why selfish mining is a fallacy.""

&gt; He walked me over to a whiteboard, and then proceeded to scribble a few blocks connected as a chain. He looked at me and said something oddly technical: ""You're obviously familiar with the properties of Erlang and negative binomial distributions.""

&gt; That's the point I knew he was a bullshitter. He **intentionally** asked the question in a way designed to make me feel dumb so that I might be too embarrassed to answer 'no.' I responded ""Not really.""

&gt; He smirked and half laughed.

&gt; I then said ""but I am very familiar with the math required to understand selfish mining, let's work together on the board."" I proceeded to try get to a point where we agreed on even a **single technical thing** about bitcoin mining, but it was impossible. I said ""OK, let's imagine a selfish miner solves a block and keeps it hidden. Do you agree that the probability that he solves the **next** block is equal to his fraction of the hash rate, alpha?""

&gt; He retorted: ""Well that's sort of true but its really just an approximation. You're not looking at the problem from the proper perspective of IIDs.""

&gt; I replied back ""What's an IID?""

&gt; He laughed to himself again, this time louder, and told me that he had assumed my math skills were better than what I was presenting to him. He said IIDs are ""processes that are independent and identically distributed.""

&gt; I replied back: ""Oh, you mean like how mining is memoryless, right? Yeah, I understand processes like that. So OK forget about the hidden block, do you agree that the probability that the selfish miner finds the next block is equal to alpha?""

&gt; And again he would say something like ""Peter, you obviously don't understand IDDs and negative binomials, but I have a paper coming out soon that will help you to understand what I'm saying."" And I'm thinking to myself that he hasn't actually **said anything at all**.

&gt; The conversation went nowhere for a while like this with him dropping technobabble terms like it was going out of style. At the end, we had not agreed on a single technical fact about bitcoin mining. I wondered why he drew those blocks on the whiteboard, since he never actually referenced them in the conversation, but I decided not to ask.

This is why bitcoin is considered useless, because the one use people actually suggest it for is already being done better, faster, and cheaper, with more consumer protection, using other existing online payment methods like credit cards or PayPal. 

Bitcoin, or any crypto, needs to be able to improve on the existing tech and it simply hasn't. Bitcoin has had 10 years to prove its utility and still it has improved nothing except online purchases where anonymity is the single most important concern.

All I see is the largest development community in crypto. The EEA with hundreds of the largest companies. Proof of stake is coming which will allow you to easily earn interest.

I'm not a maximalist. I own some Bitcoin. But it's mostly just because I can recognize that people think it has value.

However, I really don't understand why it has value. To me it's just a speculative trading vehicle.

You can say the same about ETH, and I would mostly agree at this point. But I compare the two projects and I don't see any progress or what the ultimate goal of Bitcoin is going to be. And to me, that's scary. 

The narrative has switched from a payment system to digital gold. I can't help but crack up every time I hear this. It's so out there it just makes BTC seem like a ponzi scheme. 

I just don't understand why everyone hates Ethereum and are rooting for it's demise.

- I get a Bitcoin loan for 1 BTC
- I straight away go and sell that 1 BTC, I now have $6000.
- I wait until tomorrow, where the Bitcoin price falls to $5000.
- I buy 1 BTC for $5000
- I now have the 1 BTC I started with (which I can use to repay the loan) AND an extra $1000 profit.

So, to break down what OP is saying:

- Lots of people have taken Bitcoin loans.
- All of those people have immediately sold those Bitcoin, expecting the price to drop.
- The price is slowly rising instead.
- If the price continues to rise, this will cause all the people who are trying to short Bitcoin, to buy back their Bitcoin and repay their loans in order to minimize their losses, further increasing the value of Bitcoin.

e4ak66p,BDF-1838,43,"**Short Pitch:**

Vertcoin is a bitcoin-like blockchain and doesn’t compromise on immutability of Bitcoin’s approach to blockchain, but focuses on better decentralization through forking away from ASICs, Botnets, and other threats to decentralized consensus.  In addition, it focuses on lowering the barrier of entry to non-crypto-savvy users through a focus on intuitive UX design in mining and upcoming second layer scaling solutions for adoption as a means of exchange.

 

**Long Pitch:**

Dedicated to maintaining the incentive structure and immutability of the Bitcoin Blockchain while aiming for greater decentralization.

Decentralization of consensus by having a twice (so far) demonstrated community commitment to fork algorithms to obsolete ASICs and Botnets, and next to mitigate the effects of rented hashrate (ala nicehash).

Aiming to lower the barrier of entry to participating in consensus by limiting mining to consumer hardware like GPUs and an easy to use GUI miner to have the maximum possible spread of participants in consensus while not leaving the network open to botnets of weak cpus.

Decentralization of usage by focusing on second layer solutions (LIT implementation of lightning) and ways for an average consumer who doesn’t understand the backend to still use it (Litbox on raspberry pi, full lightning node and wallet) through an easy to understand mobile remote wallet. Providing a degree of privacy by routing all lightning network traffic over TOR.

No premine, no ICO, no built-in dev fee.

Means of exchange coin, not trying to do everything, but trying to aim for long term public adoption and avoiding corrosive incentive structures that act as systemic risks to scaling, network resiliency, or individuals within the network.

To send money you have to use the bitcoin network, which costs a small fee but guarantee's that your money shows up.

The reward for ""mining"" is a small amount of bitcoin. Mine long enough and it becomes a sizeable amount. 

Mining is part of the process because no one entity controls bitcoin transactions. Anyone can send money through the bitcoin network and anyone can recieve. To make sure that *someone* is willing to use their computer to ensure the transactions are legitimate, there is a small payout for using your computer to do it.

But though we do not know who the Joker was, we know who he is. He is never not the Joker, that cannot be overstated. He lives an astonishingly chaotic life. When he is with Harley Quinn she is simply along for the ride. He lives wherever. In mansions sometimes, flop houses sometimes, in cars, old warehouses appear to be a favorite, anywhere his deranged mind decides on. He is insanity personified, only his brilliance allows him to be functional, were it not for that he would be a drooling madman in a rubber room, and has been at times. 

He sleeps with harley quinn, or completely alone. He can cook, and does when he decides to or must. He shits like we all do, on a toilet when one is available, on the ground when one is not. It seems unlikely the Joker does laundry, at times goons must do it, at others his clothes likely become gross. He does not always have goons, indeed often he does not. He goes off entirely on his wits and ferocity regularly. 

The Joker is never not ""working"". He may not be planning an attack upon Batman or those close to him, or some other villain who happened to piss him off, but he is always working. Perhaps he is murdering a guard so he can take over the warehouse he is guarding, and anyone else dumb enough to come by. Perhaps he is taking over some small time racket for shits and giggles. Perhaps he is running guns. Perhaps he is burning random building down. God alone knows what, but he cannot seem to go long without doing something. 

The criminal organization he runs is not really an organization. He has a certain number of goons at times, but the fear his name engenders in everyone besides Batman, and likely Batman at the core as well, without exception. Ripping off other criminals is a big way he makes money, which could be stashed anywhere at all physically, or in foreign bank accounts or bitcoin or Gold, anything. I suppose there are some who swear they do not fear the Joker, if not they are madmem themselves or very stupid. If they go against him they never succeed, not that I am familiar with, if another major Gotham crime figure has beaten him I am unfamiliar with it, it is incredibly rare for sure. 

Most who go against him die bloody deaths pretty quickly. What makes the Joker so frightening is he is just a man, he should be killable and should have died very quickly. But he never dies, seems to at times, but never dies. Nobody knows what he is going to do, his plans well incredibly chaotic always have an incredibly intricate point. He is incredibly brutal and could pop up anywhere, at any time, for any reason. He is just a man, but he acts like a ghost, a grim folk tale, a myth. But he is not a myth, he is absolutely real, the fact he is a man that exists and acts and does stuff, but functions more like a malevolent bad spirit, and both his brilliance and animal cunning, the latter of which is unmatched, is why he is so frightening.",2018-08-17 09:44:22

One way I can drive the price down is to place a buy order at $9.99 and then fill it myself. I could use multiple accounts or just collude with someone else, it makes no difference. Now the market price is $9.99 since that was the last order. So seeing your stop loss I do this 10 times, and now the market price is $9.90.

Now I can put in a bid order at $9.90 and pick up your bitcoin, even though nothing happened except for me trading with myself.

e4djv43,drysart,55,"Blockchains, as a core concept, are easy:

There exists a cryptographic concept known as a ""hash"".  You basically take a large piece of data, feed it into a shredder, and you get out a much smaller piece of data that's derived from the big data set, but can't be turned back *into* the big data set.  That small piece of data is the ""hash"", or ""hash code"".  This is a one-way process; so you can't (easily) start with a hash and work backward to find an original data set that will create that hash value.  Another important property of a hash is that changing even one bit in the original large data set makes the resulting hash look completely different, and in a pretty much unpredictable way.

The upshot of this is that having a hash is a way of proving knowledge of the original data set.

So basically, you have a chunk of data known as a 'block'.   You 'chain' the next block to it by requiring that the next block contains the hash of the *previous* block in its data.  Because of this, each subsequent block 'proves' that it knew about the previous block, because there's no other way it'd know what the previous block's hash was.  In short, since block C contains the hash of block B, it must have been created after block B.  Since block B contains the hash of block A, it must have been created after block A.

That is the most fundamental idea of a blockchain: a set of blocks of data that can each prove they were created after the previous block.

To make this core idea useful in a practical way, you typically have to pile other concepts on top of it, like cryptocurrencies do.

For instance, one important aspect of something like Bitcoin is another concept known as 'proof of work'.  Proof of work is a way to prove you did a large amount of work, in a way that anyone else can *quickly verify* that your proof is valid.  Without getting into too much detail, you can use hashes for this too.  Thus, it's *incredibly costly and time consuming* for someone to create a new valid block; and because the underlying blockchain concept enforces that the blocks were created in chronological order, you effectively can prove that you did all that work *after* the previous block was created.  It also makes it effectively impossible for someone to rewrite history, because they'd not only need to do the work to rewrite an old block, but they'd also need to do all the hard work for all *subsequent* blocks too, since the Bitcoin network only accepts the *longest* chain.",2018-08-18 06:16:51

Bitcoin is a brand nowadays. It's on TV sometimes and people think of it in the same way they think of Kohl's, or McDonald's. It's a brand and like all brands is representative of the underlying *organization* that controls and benefits from it.

To the average nobody, Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core's product.

We know this isn't the truth. Bitcoin is a technology and Bitcoin Core is open-source (albeit read-only) software that any person is free to clone and modify.

Propaganda cannot last forever. As a wise man once rapped to a terrible beat, ""you can't hide secrets from the future"".

e4dzhl4,nullc,29,"&gt; The late Dave Kleiman's possible involvement has never really been criticized.

I'm sure Kleiman was a fine chap, but all the information about him suggests that his technical expertise extended to ""IT Guy"" and not further.  The sum total evidence him having _any_ programming expertise is that apparently he once wrote a trivial Windows registry ""security checkup"" tool in visual basic. Most of his professional history was IT support for a local police department.

It's like suspecting that the guy who fixed your microwave by replacing a fuse might have secretly been part of the design team of the space shuttle, ""because he's good with machines"".   While it's possible that Bob The Handyman might have worked on the space shuttle's design, its not substantially more likely that he did than Wilma down at the hardware store... and not worth debating.  I'm not trying to suggest that IT Guys aren't smart and capable, but so are other people who do skilled work-- there just isn't any particular reason to expect any random one was involved in creating Bitcoin.

It's especially not worth spending time debunking because at least some of the accounts that keep posting about it are obvious (and less obvious) CSW shill accounts,  and they're just going to keep posting it until the end of time.

Archive.org showed that the references to Bitcoin on CSW's blog that the ""leaked"" documents refer to were backdated and added in 2013.  Once that was noticed all discussion about him should have stopped.  When his ""proof"" signature turned out to be a really lame forgery, it doubly should have stopped.   The fact that the media keeps suggesting ""what if"" makes me wonder if not having meaningful civil liability for journalists that recklessly reprint such obviously bad speculation might actually be a really poor public policy... and it makes me fear for the future, not of bitcoin, but of humanity.

e4f7ffs,adamMatthews,89,"Really simple language here so feel free to ask more detail if you understand.

Using Bitcoin as an example, there is one block ""mined"" every ten minutes worldwide, where *mined* means that one lucky person who mined it gets some Bitcoin. You can then sell the virtual coins to other people, or use them to buy things.

To ensure the time is ten mins, when the previous block is mined there is a mathematical puzzle set that if every current miner put their computer power into it, one person will solve it in the time period and this person gets the reward. If they get it too quickly future puzzles are harder, if it takes too long future puzzles are easier. The puzzle is basically just guessing lottery numbers until you get the right ones, but creating the numbers takes time and resources.

Because the puzzles are now so difficult, people group up into ""pools"" of miners where no matter who solves the puzzle they share the prize. Because it's like getting a group of people to agree to share lottery winnings, your odds of winning go up.

To be as efficient as you can you want your computer to put as many resources as you can into this puzzle. This uses a lot of electricity because normally you would want to balance performance and resource utilization to save energy and not overheat.",2018-08-19 03:29:18

e4fcogw,Hodor7777,71,"&gt; Any sane person will realize that a global currency where the creators of the currency owned (and still own) a MASSIVE portion of the currency and are selling it off at huge profits is never going to achieve wide scale adoption. Distribution must be fair and reasonable.

The creators of XRP were a group of individuals, some of whom still transparently own a material amount, yes.  However, Chris Larsen has stated that he plans to donate all of his, and Jed's is locked up in sales restrictions. 

60% of it is owned by Ripple inc., and almost all of *that* is in a revolving escrow for approximately the next 55 months to 30 years.  

Ripple has placed all unused amounts back *into* escrow as they've indicated.  

All of this information is published in their quarterly XRP report:  https://ripple.com/insights/q2-2018-xrp-markets-report/

Ripple has *never* 'dumped' XRP on the market.  I've been tracking them quarter-over-quarter, and that data can be found in my review of their markets report:  https://xrpcommunity.blog/setting-sail-quarter-2-xrp-markets-report-and-bitrue/

But also for reasons of 

1) No scalability 

2) Massive drain on electrical grid, and 

3) Vulnerable to a simple 50% attack.

e4fk8xm,cryptomil,54,"FWIW, my investment thesis is the same as it has always been since the Ethersale: Ethereum has long term intrinsic value due to its \*use\* on the network itself (and I don't mean ""gas"", see below). BTC and other chains have 99.9% speculative value with little intrinsic value and little developing on the horizon. Thus, Ethereum is a vastly better investment vehicle. 

In the early days of Bitcoin, it was entire speculative. You couldn't buy anything with it, and even if you could (like 20k BTC for a pizza), you could easily buy that same thing with dollars. Now that BTC is a thing, it requires some participants to carry some BTC holdings: exchanges, merchants, industrial ASIC miners... all must hold at least a little to be able to transact in the ecosystem. Thus, some of the speculative value was turned into real intrinsic value. But I'd call it less than 10%. Maybe less than 1%. There is a strong substitution effect: Merchants and miners can deal in any other coin or multiple coins. Ex: You can buy VPN services with Dogecoin, if you want. Aside from being first and the superficial advantages therein (everyone has heard of ""Bitcoin"", ETF efforts are underway, etc), there is no fundamental need for any transactions or holdings to specifically be in BTC. This is why I have never held BTC in any significant quantity or for any amount of time.

Ethereum, on the other hand, has many, many more use cases and a portion of those use cases require ""lock up"" of quantities of Ethereum, effectively reducing supply. Examples include contracts where ETH is locked as collateral, casino contracts that need to be able to cover large payouts, crowdfunding contracts that hold ETH until the sale is over, ENS, and on and on.

This is where the ""Ethereum can work even if ETH is $1"" (gas) argument breaks down. On the surface, it's true. We saw it in 2015. And on-chain scaling solutions only make it more true since each transaction will cost even less gas. What they're not accounting for is locked-up ETH and the corresponding reduction in real supply.

If you fast-forward a few years and you're using your ETH account to log into most websites, your browser is integrated to use ENS, Augur and Gnosis are thriving, and this stuff has gone semi-mainstream where everybody has to have at least a little, then you're going to see a significant ETH supply crunch.

Obviously I am not suggesting to accept what is said as gospel (that would be an appeal to authority logical fallacy), however, it is a good data point that I probably need to carefully consider my position as I'm probably missing something.

In this case, what you're missing is that you are solely focusing on a singular aspect of the system, namely stakeholder management of the project treasury, that is **far** less important than the real meat of Decred's governance, which is all about the on-chain governance of orderly consensus rule changes.  That portion is what people are, rightfully, extremely excited about and refer to as ""best-in-class"" and ""revolutionary"".  That portion of Decred is fully functional, has been there since launch, and has even already been used on a few occasions to make important changes.

There is a monumental difference between governance of consensus rules and management of a treasury, and the two must not be conflated in any way.  The most important, and foundational, part of governance in a cryptocurrency has everything to do with governance of those consensus rules.  In order to see why this is the case, all one has to do is consider other crytocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero.  Neither one of those have a built-in project treasury at all!  Therefore, clearly, the foundation of governance of a cryptocurrency can't possibly be related to something that doesn't even have to exist at all.

Decred is now innovating towards the next pillar, which is providing a censorship resistant way to manage the treasury fund in a cryptographically-secure, decentralized, and transparent fashion.  This is obviously a work in progress, and is important as well, but it has nothing to do with the foundational aspect of Decred's on-chain governance which is what is being referred to.",2018-08-19 10:56:40

This means that they have a value in Bitcoin. The value that you see in your favourite portfolio and/or cryptocurrency price tracker when it shows it in USD goes through a process. The price is first gotten from the price on exchanges (which is generally priced in BTC) and then converted to USD, then the USD price is shown to you. Therefore when the price of BTC moves, the price of other cryptocurrencies that mostly trade against BTC naturally move with it.

This does not mean that over time there won't be any difference. There can be enormous differences over time.

e4i4jws,CaptainBritish,52,"I've known some carders in the past, this is actually really common especially among online black market vendors. They'll buy stolen details for bitcoin that they acquired through selling their ""goods"" then buy gift cards with the stolen details (or just buy them with the bitcoin but you lose more money that way and they were just bought with stolen details anyway) and usually sell the gift cards on to other middlemen who in-turn sell them on grey markets like G2A. eBay is actually fairly uncommonly used for this sort of thing because of the high fees, that's why the cards you see there are higher priced than elsewhere. It's an easy if highly unethical way of turning an extra few hundred dollars a week (depending on how many people you buy gift cards from, obviously.) 

This is also why you hear of so many scam call centers asking for gift cards as payment instead of card details now. Basically impossible to trace what's coming from where this way because the gift cards will end up coming from and going to so many different innocent people. They only lose about 15-20% of their earnings this way which is basically nothing in comparison to the risk of doing things any other way.",2018-08-20 14:45:03

Decreasing issuance to 1 eth per block will bring us in line with bitcoin as well as making ether a more attractive investment which increases the cost of attacking as it indirectly increases the mining reward.

e4iim6g,ChrysMYO,38,"Super weird, have no idea about the Petro. But people are saying crypto is getting some attention in Venezuela as a way to flee the bolivar as you can avoid remittance fees when getting money sent from out of the country. Sometimes it's been said to be easier to exchange crypto to dollars then bolivar to dollars. 


Also, you can store it relatively safely if you dont trust your local bank. 


So my assumption is, Venezuela wants to encourage the use of a crypto that *they* control. One that can be surveilled and regulated the way they see fit vs a global market like bitcoin. Then to
Bolster both the bolivar and petrol further, they've tried to peg both pieces of currency to oil prices. 


This is is likely an attempt to give each piece of currency some *inherent* value like when dollars used to be backed by gold. Since Venezuela has a lot of oil. They basically want to say, our currency is basically as valuable as our oil. 


In the end, currency can only carry the value that two parties can both agree with. And crypto can't really be contained and people cant really be forced into one cryotocurrency. 


Crypto basically can only be contained by people's knowledge or lack thereof on how to use it and keep it secure. And access to telecommunications and computers. ",2018-08-20 21:54:09

For example, Block-Lattice cryptocurrencies like Nano only consume around 0.111 Wh per transaction (vs Bitcoin's 950 **k**Wh). This means that you can make EIGHT MILLION transactions for the same power as a SINGLE Bitcoin transaction. This is on top of being near instant with no transaction fees, since it uses a Block-Lattice (with delegated proof of stake for conflicts) instead of a Blockchain.

It's been real world tested at 300+ TPS, but at it's current estimated maximum of ~7000 transactions per second (vs Bitcoin's 10-15), you can make 25,000,000 transactions in an hour for the same power usage as 3(!) Bitcoin transactions...

That is quite a bit of money to have tied up in obvious red tape. LBC always seemed to have quality support, but three years is a bit much. I’ve met both brothers with my co-founder and they are really reasonable people. ( full disclosure: I am a Co-Founder of Paxful, also a p2p finance service which many see as a competitor to LBC )

P2P marketplaces are a step ahead of centralized exchanges with automated order books but there are still huge problems with fraud and scammers. We @paxful work tirelessly on this and being in the worlds most challenging markets, Nigeria etc.. only makes the challenge greater (but also means our fraud defense is super tight). We ban hundreds of scammers a day and in those cases, we do hold suspend funds in escrow, but only for those who are proven to have scammed others and then these coins are later distributed to scam victims. I’m not trying to make light of your situation as you are CLEARLY LEGIT nor am I defending LBC or even Paxful, just letting you know things are rough out there in p2p land.

Let me state clearly that THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN ON PAXFUL! We have 24/7 support and even a complicated case like this wouldn’t ever take more than a day or two, especially with the proof you have provided. At the very least we can liaise with the bank in question and inform them you were receiving payment for good and services rendered on our platform.

One of our employees has had over 1 BTC held by LBC for over three years as well and they refuse to release it even after he KYC’ed and there was clearly no fraud as he was selling bitcoins. I don’t know their reasons.

Not sure how I can help here but I am willing to listen to feedback. Without vendors, there is no P2P and the reason we exist is that we listen to you guys. We just wish we did a better job of protecting you all.

Please be patient and offer feedback :slightly\_smiling\_face: We love that!

P.S. We are really trying to help the situation in Venezuela now as it has reached the point of CRITICAL INFLATION with two zero's being added in a single day... We are actively recruiting bitcoin sellers in #Venezuela and #Turkey now so if you can help and have bank account in either of those countries please do make an account on Paxful and put up an offer to sell people bitcoins. Even if you just REMIT money to Venezuela if you do it with bitcoin you can make 20% not lose 10% like with Western Union, just put up an offer to sell for a certain amount for bank transfer and give the buyer of your bitcoin the bank account of the person you are sending money too! it works like Magic and they get 20% more and you only pay less than a 1% fee to Paxful for the escrow! PLEASE HELP anyone who sees this. I will make my self available to help you directly and we have an active Venezuela chat on telegram now.

Let's say we changed to 2 eth per block on October 30th, when there should be roughly 102,500,000 ETH in existence at current mining rate. After that the issuance would be 2 ETH per 5760 blocks mined per day = 2 * 5760 * 365 = 4,204,800 ETH per year. Additionally there would be 613,901 ETH per year created in uncle rewards.

* October 30th 2018 = 102,500,000 ETH
* October 30th 2019 = 107,318,701 ETH
* October 30th 2020 = 112,137,402 ETH

If we stay within the current 2020 deadline, the switch to PoS should happen around here with [current best guess of 500k of ETH issued per year after PoS](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455)

* October 30th 2021 = 112,637,402 ETH 
* October 30th 2022 = 113,137,402 ETH
* October 30th 2023 = 113,637,402 ETH

So in total over the next 5 years that would make for [average ETH inflation of **2.084% per year**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=102,500,000+*+x%5E5+%3D+113,637,402).

Now compare that to bitcoin, with supply increasing from 17,348,400 on October 30th 2018 to [estimated 19,750,000 on October 30th 2023](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/37092) for an [average BTC inflation of **2.627% per year**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=17348400+*+x%5E5+%3D+19750000) over the next 5 years.

e4orn8m,eskelaa,169,"This could be countered by using 3d secure (3DS), or it's alternative solution on various payment networks. Right now, card owner can say ""ops, it wasn't me who bought it"" because there's only one validation (card + address + name, all which can be obtained/stolen). With 3DS, you need to complete challenge, think of it as second factor authentication for card payment. It's either code sent via sms, it's a password, or you have to tap in the app to confirm it's 'you'.

If user completes 3DS, then responsibility for transaction switches from merchant (DE) to bank. And it's then bank's responsibility to deal with it, but bank can no longer claim money back from merchant, even if card owner tries to chargeback. If card owner tries to claim chargeback, bank can accept it and refund user (but can't touch merchant), or say ""yoo, dude, it was you"" and not refund user.

​

3DS is a pain for genuine users and it can have significant implications for conversion rates. 3DS rules out certain payment systems, not all banks support 3DS. 3DS is a flawed system and many 3DS implementations are stupid. More read: [https://blog.gpayments.com/article/5-things-merchants-need-to-know-before-implementing-3d-secure/](https://blog.gpayments.com/article/5-things-merchants-need-to-know-before-implementing-3d-secure/)

There are sites that force 3DS, like Coinbase, imagine buying bitcoin and making chargebacks! - that would be silly.

​

There are 50/50 solutions. Merchant can design their own set of rules when 3DS is forced (user won't complete transaction without 3DS) and when 3DS is optional. It can be based on account age, last login, country of origin, card type/payment network and so on. DE could get a significantly better control over chargebacks that are hitting them and - while flawed - solution is out there.

Source? Company I worked for had a significant chargeback problem, but it was usually genuine users trying to ""win"" their money back, rather than stolen card fraud. We added hybrid 3DS requirement and it cut chargebacks by 90%. If user tries to make purchase and 3DS is available for their card, we force it. If user tries to use a card without 3DS we accept the payment and take responsibility, and that's where remaining 10% chargebacks come from, but there's good portion of revenue via this stream and 'only' 10% loss for the company (but the actual revenue stream without 3DS is about 40% of total and totally worth that 10% of old chargeback costs).",2018-08-23 20:48:27

Where as deflation(which has been happening with bitcoin ever since its inception) hinders economic growth because people feel that their money will be worth more in the future and should therefore avoid spending it now. Now obviously the inflationary rate in Venezuela is one of the most extreme in history and it is definitely a problem for the country. However, that is not a result of them using “fiat” money it is a result of a loss of faith in the institution that creates that money.

Recently the disagreements turned personal and nasty.

I'm not 100% sure but it sounds like the SV client will raise the blockcap to 128Mb, but I've not seen hard claims on that and I'm not sure code has even been released.

Bitmain seems to be siding with ABC/Amaury, while Calvin Ayre/Coingeek seems to be siding with Nchain/CSW.

My personal speculation is that the opcodes ABC wants to implement would reduce the value of some of CSW's proposed patented ideas.

Just dollar-cost-average a little bit each week or monthly, only what you can **easily** afford, until you've acquired your goal. Have it in multi-sig cold storage...and then just chill. Enjoy life.  
Take opportunities to support the transaction-loop growth of your coin as they come up, and replace those spent funds.

If you're feeling uncomfortable about this dip, take another peak back at the all-time price history of bitcoin, on a logarithmic scale.  Get some perspective.

This bear could dip well below $3k and we would still not be in as extreme of territory as some prior crashes.

All expected to get rich quick by investing based on a few tweets by an optimistic CEO, a cool white paper, a promising team and a few moonboys yelling this thing will be 100 dollars EOY. Market's falling off the table and now all of the sudden the OMG team sucks and it's all their fault.

Newsflash: this project doesn't evolve around you, the token price or your meager 2, 3 or 4 digit stack. Look at the top 200 adresses. They are all holding or increasing their stacks because they actually understand what this team is so furiously working on. This is a utility token, and right now it doesnt have any. They dont have a network up and running, just like a big majority of the projects in crypto land. The other part has questionable usability and real life adoption. The thing is, this project is still ranked within the top 30 projects out of 1800 and when the entire market tanks, so does OMG. 

Sure, I wish price was higher and we had tons of great 'partnerships', huge conglomerates, tons of wallet SDK integrations and whatsoever. But I think its great the team refuses to participate in these token price discussions and structurally refuses to fuel more speculation. Its professional and classy. I dont see Vitalik Buterin tweeting about the ethereum price. Youre all just mad because youre not rich yet and you bought in between 10-28 dollars. Sucks to be you. **Big boy games, big boy rules, big boy consequences.** Now you either stick with the plan and ride it out or be a dick about it, rage sell, blame Jun and whine in this sub. Its not reserved to OMG, look around all the other crypto subs. The same sad farts everywhere.

My guess; the team doesnt give af about your crappy buy-in. You are responsible for your finances, you decided to participate in these markets. They have promised so many times this thing WILL be used by their merchants, partners, utilizers and banks etcetera. Some interests are WAY more important than you and your unrealized losses. They DO believe keeping us up to date is important, look at their extensive plasma/wallet updates. Not enough info you say? Theres probably a reason they are not disclosing all the juicy stuff. Either they have huge things brewing, or they have nothing. There's probably nothing in between.
Staking is what this token is all about, and it will come one day. They are making sure the volume is there. Dont believe in them? Go ahead and buy some other alt thats also down 90% from ATH.

Its easy to blame the team for your lack of patience. In the meantime, these guys are working their ass off educating people on plasma and their wallet SDK in their Neutrino work spaces (hint: have a look who attented those). They collaborate with the big boys in crypto, Stanford University and sponsor/attend the biggest blockchain conferences and meetups around the globe. They have one of the most active githubs around. Have a huge company behind them already succesful in SEA. They know how to handle this. The TRUE crypto community and devs have ALL stated this is the project to look out for. BAT founder, Stripe (when they announced ending bitcoin support) and the ethereum OG's like VB, Poon and many others.

They said optimistically Q3, pessimistically Q4 to have a working blockchain out. They have nailed most of their roadmap targets and they are even f*cking ahead of it concerning plasma development. No spoon you say? Blame COSMOS, they are the ones who dont have anything working yet. The tendermint team is responsible for the cosmos omg dex now and to be honest, i bet the team doesnt even care (ok maybe just a little) because they will launch their plasma dex so much more sooner than they expected. The tendermint was always going to be temporary solution until they release they own version. 

To conclude this rant: shoutout to /u/omise_go . I am glad you guys are taking your time to get something out that actually works, is battle tested, usable and safe. Even though the market conditions out there are terrible, I am sure you guys are building something that will be profitable for stakers in the (nearby) future.

&gt; In contrast, physically backed futures do the opposite. When you buy a physically backed future, actual Bitcoins are purchased and removed from the market. So when institutions begin leveraging Bitcoin with Bakkt, the actual Bitcoin is removed from the market. Essentially driving price higher as supply diminishes and contributing to the overall market cap. As Loeffler recently explained in a Medium post, “As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset.”

e4ppgkr,SamsungGalaxyPlayer,80,"Monero and PIVX are two projects with legitimate privacy advantages over Bitcoin. I will not be able to speak about every single nuance between these two projects, but I gnerally think that both projects have good intentions.

I have broken the main points into a few categories for simplicity.

# Privacy

Monero and PIVX both advertise themselves as privacy coins. They use different technologies to meet this goal, and they meet it to different extents under different circumstances.

Monero uses a combination of ring signatures, RingCT, and stealth addresses to hide the sent output (sender), amount, and receiving address of a transaction. Think of stealth addresses as one-time use safety deposit boxes that can only be opened by the recipient, and no one knows who this person is. Ring signatures are the weakest part of Monero that I will discuss in detail, but they make it seem as if there are many sources of funds where the money is coming from. Right now, the default is 7 total possible outputs (6 decoys), and consensus is pointing towards a fixed ringsize (non-configurable) for the Sept/Oct protocol upgrade.

PIVX uses a modified version of Zerocoin. The researchers who developed the Zerocoin protocol abandoned it to work on Zerocash. Zerocash is used in Zcash. Zerocoin offers a lower trust requirement. At the moment, the RSA trusted setup is required, but there are initiatives to move past this. Zerocoin transaction amounts are visible, and the transactions are large (even larger than Monero's).

You may have heard of bulletproofs, which will reduce transaction sizes by ~80% for both Monero and PIVX. Both communities can benefit from these advancements. Monero is set to include these following 3 successful audits in Sept/Oct. I don't know PIVX's timeline, but I know they are expected to add them.

---

All right, down to business. This will get relatively deep for newcomers, so I apologize.

For every transaction, Monero hides the sender, amount, and recipient. PIVX has two classes of coins, PIV and zPIV. PIV is completely transparent - it's just like Bitcoin. zPIV hides the sender and receiver. So if you make a zPIV -&gt; zPIV transaction, the sender and receiver origin and addresses are hidden. zPIV -&gt; PIV hides the origin of funds. PIV -&gt; zPIV hides the receiver.

Since the amounts are visible for PIVX, they divide the outputs into certain set denominations as low as 1 zPIV (~$1.15). When someone sends a zPIV transaction, it shares an anonymity set with every other zPIV output of the same size. For example, if there are 1000x 1 zPIV outputs, then all 1000 could possibly be spent. PIVX claims that it benefits from a large entropy set, and this is technically true, with other caveats that I will mention later.

There is relatively little research into the privacy effectiveness of PIVX specifically, but we can look at research on Zcash to see what parts are applicable. Monero also has some research. Most important of these for Monero and Zcash are below:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/ ""An Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain""

https://smeiklej.com/files/usenix18.pdf ""An Empirical Analysis of Anonymity in Zcash""

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01210.pdf ""On the linkability of Zcash transactions""

Let's focus on the applicability to Monero first, then I can move onto Monero.

Zcash z -&gt; z (""fully shielded"") transactions hide the sender, receiver, AND amount. These research papers looked at the metadata leaked when the transaction amoiunt is revealed (in a ""partially shielded"" transaction). Since PIVX reveals the transaction amounts, many of the findings are applicable.

Note that these are heuristics based on user behavior. Sure, a transaction of 11234 PIVX could have technically come from anyone, but it's more likely that it comes from certain people. Especially if people use the zPIV ferature as a mixer, which is what researchers found with Zcash z-addresses.

If you use any transaction of a unique amount in PIVX, use any fractional value that cannot be protected with zPIV, or make transactions in quick succession (since PIVX generally does not have many transactions per day), then you likely will stick out enough to be prone to heuristic analysis. This is further exacerbated by the completely transparent PIV, which means identities can more easily be connected to zPIV. If every transaction used zPIV with the transaction amounts visible, PIVX would still have issues with advanced heuristic analysis, though it would generally be more difficult to connect multiple transactions to a single person.

With PIVX, you have a scenrio where you can increase flexibility by decreasing the smallest denomination of zPIV, but this also decreases privacy. As there are more decimals, the more simple it is to associate transactions of specific amounts to a person.

Monero has a different problem, though I argue to a lesser extent. There is no transparent pool to associate with. Every transaction has plausible deniability. However, individual entropy sets for individual transactions are relatively small.

Many of the complaints about Monero's privacy are old news. Read my response to the research paper linked earlier here: https://getmonero.org/2018/03/29/response-to-an-empirical-analysis-of-traceability.html

However, nuances with Monero's ring signatures persist. Though each output in a ring is sorta a reference to ""nothing,"" this isn't quite the case in practice. Attackers can send people funds which they attempt to track. There are many situations where the output, especially if there are multiple outputs, are associated with an identity or each other in a way that is incredibly unlikely by chance. If I send Monero to 5 different subaddresses, and these outputs all appear in the same transaction, this is highly unlikely by chance.

Monero users need to increase the entropy for specific transactions by creating more transactions. This adds more ring signatures with more entropy, and the resulting new outputs can be used in other transactions to increase ambiguity. Research here is stil ongoing, but at least we have some models. Read more here: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/4229#issuecomment-415139034

I still genuinely believe that Monero offers better privacy since the leaked meatadata issue in PIVX is likely significant. Zcash offers potentially more privacy than PIVX and has fewer opportunities for leaked metadata, and researchers were still able to account for 31.5% of all coins in the shielded set.

# PoW vs PoS

PIVX uses PoS, Monero uses PoW. I'll defer to other people on this one, since I wrote so long about privacy and need to get this out. I generally prefer PoW since it's better established.

# Fungibility

I very passionately state that optional privacy is NOT the same as fungibility. Fungibility means you can accept funds without regard for anything except the face value.

Would you accept PIV without auditing? Probably not, since it could be tainted. You still need to check to see if it is tainted. As a result, it is not fungibile. Fungibility is provided by the lowest common demoninator, not the other way around.

Monero benefits and offers the greatest fungibility since it has the strictest lowest common denominator. You can accept any Monero with the knowledge that there is plausible deniability, adding significant uncertainty where the funds came from. It is however not perfectly fungibile, since Monero does not protect against every heuristic.

However, if we look at the definition of fungibility, I believe that any system with a mandatory privacy protocol is more private than one without. Especially when less than half of funds are converted to zPIV by default in the wallet.

# Conclusion

In my opinion, Monero offers superior privacy and fungibility. While PIVX is susceptible to a wide attack surface, including a public set of transactions and transparent amounts even for zPIV, Monero's attack surface is mostly restricted to its ring signatures, which provide plausible deniability under every circumstance we are aware of at the moment.

Of course, both coins are still succeptible to timing attacks. However, since Monero is more widely used with more transactions per day, the impact of timing attacks is lower on larger networks.

I am glad that PIVX is generally taking a sensible approach to privacy, but there are currently better options available.

I dunno I can't even keep track of the fucking nChain narrative anymore, it has more twists and turns than Blockstream's insane incoherent narrative. There's so much drama and division from a single entity and so far all of their work output seems to involve buying influence by investing in every BCH company and revoking that investment should they say anything bad about CSW, creating a bunch of shitty patents, and arbitrarily threatning to split the chain.

Een betaling verrichten via betalingsnetwerk Visa kost zo’n 0,002 kilowattuur, eenzelfde betaling via Bitcoin vergt 906 kilowattuur, ruim een half miljoen keer zoveel en genoeg om een tweepersoonshuishouden een maand of drie van energie te voorzien.

Als miners meer moeite steken in het oplossen van de puzzeltjes (lees: ze bouwen meer van die donkere servergrotten in Alaska), worden de puzzeltjes automatisch moeilijker, en is er weer meer rekenkracht nodig. Het is een eindeloze, zinloze wapenwedloop om hetzelfde aantal betalingen met steeds meer energie te verrichten.

A $20 investment in 2009 would have been worth $300,000,000 when BTC hit $20k.

No need to save every penny, but be careful even at that level, you would own enough to basically tank the entire market with a sell-off.  If you ""saved every penny"" you'd likely cause the market to have grown and developed very differently than it did.

e4rrh4g,Mr_Yukon_C,69,"&gt; Xin Xu argues that a decline in issuance from 3 to 2 (33%) will cause a drop in hashrate by 33%, and that such a large drop in hashrate will lead to an influx of GPUs on the market that can be used to attack Ethereum. This argument is predicated on the idea that hashrate will drop significantly. However, any drop in hashrate will decrease difficulty so mathematically a 33% drop in issuance should have at most a ~15% impact to total hashrate. **I don't believe that a drop in Ethereum Network Hashrate from current levels (280 TH/s) to February 2018 levels (240 TH/s) is a doomsday scenario.** And the real drop will likely be much lower, as **historical data shows that hashrate is extremely resilient against drops in price as well as issuance** (source: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DlTEyKBV4AERGtB.jpg:large). **On top of that, all historical Ethereum and Bitcoin issuance reductions were followed immediately by price increases which we cannot ignore completely.**

I agree with all of your bolded comments.

I listened to the meeting and felt that Xin Xu (along with a few other miners) was completely biased (no surprise there).  His ""argument"" is just that...an argument / opinion.

Like you, I don't see any historical precedent or evidence that suggests what he claims, to be the case.  Thus, it sounded a lot like a politely presented FUD campaign to me.

The most recent example is the issuance drop from 5 ETH to 3 ETH. After which, hashrate continued to increase along with price.

Of course market conditions play a part in these things.  But right now, I feel like miners are FUDing this hard, when in reality, they should be thankful that PoW has lasted this long, since it was scheduled to be PoS by now.

Certainly some miners have a vested long term interest in Ethereum post-PoW, meaning they are possible hodlers.  But, keeping inflation / issuance at current levels is only rewarding a demographic that by and large will not be sticking around for much longer, while continuing to punish people (holders &amp; investors) who in many cases, have supported Ethereum from Day 1 and will *continue* to support Ethereum with PoS / Casper.

Lastly, the issuance reduction and difficulty bomb should never, ever be separated from each other.  We heard it first hand today by Xin Xu himself (and other miners) -- he wants *no block reward reduction*, but of course, wants to delay the difficulty bomb.  That's called having your cake and eating it too.  Doesn't work that way.

--------------

**If the miners don't want to agree to an issuance reduction, then I propose leaving the difficulty bomb in place / as-is.  That will eventually force them to the table.**

**Furthermore, any delay in the difficulty bomb should be accompanied by an issuance reduction that *at least* matches the effect the difficulty bomb would have had on the issuance rate.  That is the only fair move IMO.**

--------------

The previous difficulty bomb delay and drop from 5 to 3 was handled that way and frankly, I have no idea why this is even being debated at this point, since it's the exact same scenario again.  What has changed since last time aside from the price?  Nothing else that I can think of other than miners trying to exert influence over the ecosystem that IMO, they do not deserve.

**Lastly, I think the biggest thing to focus on is -- what are we paying for security?  Right now, we are overpaying *by a lot*.**

[There was a very good Medium article published recently by our very own /u/econoar that detailed exactly what is going on.](https://medium.com/@eric.conner/a-case-for-ethereum-block-reward-reduction-in-constantinople-eip-1234-25732431fc77)  I recommend those who care, take the time to read it.

Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain allows for the possibility that, because of their transaction history, a company may declare certain bitcoin to be ‘tainted’ and labelled as unacceptable as payment. Blockchain analysis companies, who try and trace the provenance and ownership of bitcoin, compromise the privacy of users and inhibit the ability to freely exchange bitcoin without bias. Unless privacy of basic transactions can be maintained, bitcoin loses some of its fungibility.

1. Decentralized, Censorship Resistance, Immutable: These are the cornerstone aspects of sound money and Cryptocurrencies. No one entity can block, censor, or reverse a transaction.

2. Speed/Security ratio: This is is something that not many people in the space will talk about. Many investors and speculators in the Crypto space will talk about coins that are very fast and can process thousands of transactions per second. What they fail to illustrate how vulnerable the currency is to an attack on the network or how much lower the security is on the network. Litecoin is the King of its mining Algorithm and attacking Litecoin would be very expensive/difficult, yet the speed and fees at which Litecoin processes transactions is much faster and cheaper than all coins with same level of security.

3. Lightning Network Support: Lightning Network is one of the biggest innovations in the crypto space, in my opinion. I won't get into the nitty gritty on what it is and how it works, I highly suggest watching some videos on it. The main point of it is, It allows for almost instant and free transactions without compromising the security. Also, it allows applications to built on top of Litecoin and Bitcoin network. Not only this, but Litecoin can effectively compliment Bitcoin to create a very powerful ecosystem of sound money where Litecoin is cash and Bitcoin is Gold.

4. Longevity and Reliability: Litecoin is the Second oldest Cryptocurrency right behind Bitcoin to still be alive and working today. It is a tested network that has constantly been improved as the technology has been improved i.e Segwit, and is, for the most part, the first to implement any new innovations.

5. Liquidity: No need to go into great detail here, It is one of the most liquid coins out there.

6. Strong Community/Developer base: With a strong community and developer base, Litecoin can grew and prosper quicker and more efficiently than other coins.

There are many other reasons that involve a lot more discussion, but these are the main reasons I am long term bullish on Litecoin.

**Craig Wright is** ***not*** **Satoshi Nakamoto.** It is *crucial* that we make this clear. *It's no longer okay to give Craig Wright the ""benefit of the doubt"".* He has been trading off of this uncertainty for far too long. In fact, the only reason his **toxic shit** continues to pass the smell test is that too many Bitcoin Cash idealists still cling to the possibility he's Satoshi. If you are in any doubt about the fact that Craig Wright is *not* Satoshi, then please take advantage of the considerable research undertaken by u/Contrarian__.

* Craig [lacks the technical ability](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/96u1ft/invested_15000_in_crypto/e44er19) to be Satoshi:
* There is a [mountain of evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7386vx/craig_s_wright_facts/) against Craig being Satoshi.

A recent [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9241an/csw_has_now_blocked_amaury_sechet/e33oned):

&gt;His not having the keys is toward the bottom of the list of reasons why he's a fraud. Here are some others, for your perusal:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. He faked [blog posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ryvc/craig_wright_2008_august_26_blog_post_i_have_a/duxwsyk/)  
&gt;  
&gt;2. He faked [PGP keys](https://medium.com/@tbrice/wrights-appeal-to-authority-paper-disproved-its-own-thesis-8f2d45e5df24)  
&gt;  
&gt;3. He faked [contracts and emails](http://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/)  
&gt;  
&gt;5. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)  
&gt;  
&gt;6. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)  
&gt;  
&gt;And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence  
&gt;  
&gt;2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter  
&gt;  
&gt;3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)  
&gt;  
&gt;4. He [called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space  
&gt;  
&gt;5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014  
&gt;  
&gt;6. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive

Of course, we all want to believe that Satoshi would back Bitcoin Cash, and Craig's claim plays into this hope by giving us a straightforward reason to think that Satoshi does. However, if we hang all confidence in the value of Bitcoin Cash on Craig's unsubstantiated claims then we easily end up making irrational excuses for the obvious holes in his story, and, most importantly, hand him undeserved power and ignore his toxic behaviour. He has now systematically vilified Peter Rizun, Vitalik Buterin, Amaury Sechet, Emin Gün Sirer, Jihan Wu and Jonald Fyookball (I'm sure I'm forgetting more important figures), all individuals who have long been respected in this community, and who have happened to have recently called Craig's antics into question. Does anyone honestly believe that this is the behaviour of Satoshi Nakamoto?

When we combine the “possibility” that Craig is Satoshi with his habit of throwing around technical terminology, obfuscating in a complex enough manner to dumbfound non-specialists, and an intentional appeal to this community’s understandable paranoia of a malicious takeover, then we arrive at *the perfect recipe for exactly this kind of malicious takeover*. Be vigilant, we cannot let this happen.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to ""friendly"" churches. 

Before this, religious people didnt have any particular political affiliation. It's in the book. That's how it started...

In 2009 or 2010, a person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto made up bitcoin and the block chain, the technology that supports the currency. 

The block chain is often described as a distributed ledger. Typically, accounts of money are kept in central ledgers like banks or credit card companies. In contrast, everyone in the bitcoin world keeps a copy of the full record of all bitcoin transactions on their computer. In this way, everyone has access to and agrees on which wallets (a wallet is like a bank account for bitcoin) own which coins. To maintain an accurate record, the “blocks” or data sets in the ledger are protected through heavy encryption. The calculations required to preform these encryptions are very demanding for computers to preform. “Mining” is the term used when people use their computer to process these calculations and are rewarded with newly “minted” bitcoins. 

The value of the bitcoin is in its scarcity. As more coins go into circulation, it becomes more difficult to mine each one. Eventually, it will be virtually impossible to make new bitcoin. Therefore, the coins are protected from governmental forces like central banks who use tactics like promoting inflation and manipulating interest rates to artificially change the value of currency. This protection, along with the anonymity of bitcoin, are two of the most attractive features of the currency for users",2018-08-26 10:04:26

e4vhw4j,ThomasZander,65,"I've been around Bitcoin (BCH) for half a decade now and have been very heavy into the code and protocol for the better part of it. I run the https://flowee.org client.

The nChain client has a proposal to hard fork that doesn't seem to have any technical reasoning behind it. Going for 128MB while we still have issues above 32MB ([why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/99e521/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu_latest_propaganda_is_that_128_mb_is/e4n41hy/)) is most likely a political move, definitely not a technical one.

The ABC people have just published their roadmap and they are clearly going down a road that stops growth in the short term in hope of a rather radical idea to work out in the long term. The radical idea is not LN, the radical idea is sharding.

The picture that ABC gives is one of a roadmap that is going to lead to world domination, but the technical details are not being discussed. In actual fact, problems people have with the technical steps are actively swept under the rug.

The biggest issue with both of those teams is that there is no room for anything but their own ideas. No criticism on their ideas is allowed (CSW banning people is well known, but ABC isn't much different). Technical improvement suggestions are ignored.


The nChain client calls itself the Satoshi Vision one. Now, this is clearly an advertising technique and I hope people don't fall for it.  
But like all good advertising techniques there is a core of truth to it. And this is that the ideas behind the ABC roadmap is to fundamentally change Bitcoin Cash. The incentives will fundamentally change, the way clients communicate will change and to top that off we'll have several years of instability in the protocol which will make companies that today might join stop investing in Crypto.

**Please choose option number 3, no protocol changes in November**

I'll publish a more in depth series of posts in the coming weeks about how scaling according to Satoshi actually **can** work. Without any protocol changes.

I pointed out that the latter part (""UWLpVr"") is a checksum needed to actually send coins to that address whereas the actual address part is ""1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"" (Obivously a burner address).

The valid address is needed so that anyone can send coins to it: ""The Counterparty proof-of-burn was set up so that anyone who sent bitcoin to the address 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr during the one-time burn period in January 2014 automatically received XCP in return in proportion to the amount of bitcoin they burnt."".

e4wxiqm,Light_of_Lucifer,36,"&gt; Recently, Bakkt, a new company designed to bring digital assets to the mainstream created by Microsoft, Starbucks, and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), stated that it is working on building a consistent regulatory construct; transparent, efficient price discovery; and an institutional quality pre- and post-trade infrastructure.

&gt; More importantly, Bakkt, which is targeting to serve institutional investors in the US market, said that its exchange will not allow BTC to be traded on margin or leverage, which is the primary reason why the nine ETFs from ProShares and Direxion were rejected this week.

&gt; “A critical element to price discovery is physical delivery. Specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of Bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset,” the Bakkt team said.

Sorry Ed, I’m just not experiencing the same reality that you are. As I see it, Craig Wright has now systematically attacked Peter Rizun, Vitalik Buterin, Amaury Sechet, Emin Gün Sirer, Jihan Wu and Jonald Fyookball; all individuals who have long been respected in this community, and who have recently called Craig's antics into question. 

He has given credence to elaborate conspiracy theories about ABC, BU and Bitmain—the last of whom has, by Craigs very reasoning, the best motivation to care for the long-term interests of Bitcoin Cash. And in the last 24 hours he has tweeted that a pending nChain patent (one of the ones that was supposed to “protect” BCH) will mean they “own the base protocol” if DSV is added.

e4v88y4,DanielKrawisz,34,"Thanks for alerting me to this thread. I don't know too much about what's going on with the specifics of the proposal but I can say a little bit about what has been going on based on my conversations with ABC developer micropresident (not sure what his name is on reddit). I don't have a complete view of what is going on at ABC because I've been very busy with my own things but I hope that I can still make some general comments that will be helpful.

My impression is that he believes that what he's doing is very important but it does not appear to be very important to me because it makes some fundamental changes to the protocol to address scaling issues that won't be a problem unless BCH is much more successful than it is now. I would prefer to focus on creating that success rather than having to work with ABC's new invention. There are many problems to deal with now, and from my perspective ABC is creating a bigger problem than they are solving. For example, eventually as part of my job I'll have to figure out how BCH works so that Stash can support it and the bigger the changes the more difficult this becomes and the further off BCH support is at Stash.

I have heard the argument that it is easier to make the change now than it will be later. However, any potential protocol change can be valued on the market via a futures contract and if exchanges were to offer such a contract we would be able to tell when such a protocol change is actually demanded by investors. If some scaling issue were to become imminent, then everyone would be able to see that BCH would be more valuable if the protocol change were adopted. Once that happened then someone could make a library for the protocol change that would be easy for programmers to use and anybody running a business would know that incorporating it would be an important thing for which to allocate resources. This process would allow bitcoin to evolve as needed without requiring anybody to make any kind of overarching scaling plan for it.

Micropresident also sees CSW as an opponent, whereas I would prefer to see everyone acting as if the real opponent is the dollar. In my opinion, the most critical requirement of BCH's success is for people to learn how to cooperate in an environment where nobody can hold any fixed position and the very concept of any fixed chain of command is laughable. I think that the ability to cooperate is much more important than being able to invent new technical proposals. CSW is obviously very difficult to cooperate with and it's certainly no shame on you if you can't get much out of him but many, many people in bitcoin are like autistic idiot savants just like him. CSW might as well be seen as an archetypical bitcoiner. Success means enabling people like him to work together well.

I think that successfully scaling Bitcoin needs to be more like something in which everybody attempts to invent small pieces of a big puzzle and every puzzle piece needs to be accepted by the investors regardless of who invented it. Anyone attempting to follow an overarching plan is defeating themselves. I would like people to learn how to build ""cooperative ideas"" like that which I discussed in my video Expanding Bubbles, which you should watch high. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InefJwYoKDs&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InefJwYoKDs&amp;feature=youtu.be) Determining exactly what a ""cooperative idea"" is is a big problem, so it's ok if you don't have a clear idea but basically you need to build something that attaches easily to everything that already exists and can be adopted person-by-person rather than requiring everybody to move together. The leader should be the person who knows how to do that. I'm sorry if this is kind of a vague idea, but I have some stuff in the works now that I'm not really ready to show off that I believe exemplifies the idea and which I hope will be accepted by the community.

The biggest problem with any hard fork is not the technical issues surrounding it, but predicting whether people will go along with it. If you say ""this hard fork is scheduled for X date"" that really only makes sense if you're doing something that's so obvious that everyone will go along with it. Otherwise the only procedure that is reasonable to me is to create it so that everyone can see it works and then treat it as a proposal to the investors, and it will be turned on once it can be seen publicly from the prices available in the market that BCH will be more valuable if it is adopted. Simply scheduling it and acting like everyone will go along with it or turning it into some kind of political power struggle is self-defeating.

Finally, I know that micropresident regards himself as a representative of the miners. I don't know if the other ABC developers subscribe to this theory, but if they do then they should obviously not be treated as leaders.

The idea that the miners might have some sort of hashing war over scaling proposals is also foolish because miners in the end this question boils down to which coin is more valuable, which means that the miners are better off following the market as well. In my opinion, the reason that miners burn energy is because proof-of-work is a convincing reason for people to look at and evaluate a proposal. Thus if a miner is burning energy on an idea that people don't like it doesn't matter how much energy he has. Miners need to figure out what everybody will accept FIRST and THEN start hashing it or else they waste energy and the best way to learn that is simply to follow a protocol change futures market.",2018-08-27 00:57:32

I think they'll vote to delay any consensus changes until May the earliest. This is the most reasonable course of action. Bitcoin Cash works as-is, no need to have controversial changes now.

Here is my take on ABC's changes: 

&gt;A new opcode called OP_CHECKDATASIG that improves the BCH scripting language to permit the validation of messages from outside the blockchain. This will enable uses such as the use of oracles and cross-chain atomic contracts.

There is hardly any risk here. Good change. I don't think BU or XT devs have something against this one. There is plenty of other functionality that this brings pretty much immediately. This change is good. 





&gt;The introduction of canonical transaction ordering. This is a technical building block that lays the foundation for massive scaling improvements in the future.
Several minor technical fixes and improvements.

This change is coming to early. We should postpone this change. We need more study and data on this. Because there might be better/different ways of getting to what ABC is trying to achieve and once we lock this change in we are stuck with it for a long time. 



Either ABC removes canonical transaction from this upgrade, or I ~~advice~~ ask everybody to run BU and XT node software and to not upgrade to the new version.  However, like  /u/hapticpilot is saying. If majority hashrate quickly supports this version (which I expect will happen, ABC already is 65% of the network) then I ask all the others miners to support it as well. Because a chain split would not be good. (unless it's craig coin, csw can splinter away. I think that would be great) 



How is this even going to work with BU and  XT? If 60% on the network suddenly has canonical transaction ordering the way ABC proposes and the rest does not. Will this break stuff? What will happen? 


~~nChain has no code, so I can't say anything about it. I advise nChain to not wait one day before the 1st of november to ship their code.~~

edit: I think they just put some code on their github. 


 I also advise them to ship it open source and not closed source and to not put any patent code in it. Patents restrict innovation and you risk that Bitcoin gets controlled by the company that owns the patent. 

And finally I fully agree with /u/jessquit  on this quote: 

&gt;ABC needs to get out of its cowboy-coding mentality, and fast.

Adam Back dismissed Bitcoin even when contacted directly by Satoshi Nakamoto himself and Greg Maxwell said Bitcoin can't work on day 1, but showed no proof. Then both kicked out Gavin Andresen who was working with Satoshi since day 1, under the guise that he was compromised. Gavin gave them the keys to the repo and then they locked him out right after lol. 

That's like hiring a landscaper that tells you it's impossible but you keep and pay him anyway, only to find out he paved over your front lawn because growing a thick green lawn is ""impossible"" without ever showing any proof or numbers. It's pretty obvious they had their plans set to throttle onchain Bitcoin with any excuse possible. that's why a simple blocksize increase was fought tooth and nail.

and today's Blockstream solution are so twisted it makes my head hurt. 0-conf works now and today and Coinbase uses 0-conf for BCH today. That says it all.

But instead they're pushing for an alterntive to a simple blocksize increase which is Lightning. Who's gonna use lightning when you have all this baggage:

- Must be running a node of your own to do anything. Each user must have their own Lightning node. Neither Stacy, Joe Schmoe or grandma are ever going to do this.

- Must be online to receive money. Even Venmo doesn't have such a requirement. Lightning is worse than a banking app geez.

- Must have an equal or greater amount of Lightning BTC to receive that much Lightning BTC. Joe Schmoe is going to be confused to hear he can't get paid unless he's holding that amount or greater. WTF? Out of all the shitcoins out there none are as difficult to use as Lightning. Stacy is going to tap out at this point and going back to Venmo.

- Your Lightning node can get DDOSed or you can lose internet and funds can be stolen if you don't check in within 144 blocks (24 hours) by a bad actor. WTF? So now you have to hire watchtowers services to watch your money. WTF? 

- Routing errors that are only going to get worse as Lightning grows. With today's short attention spans people are going to dump an app that fails to send/receive money every 5th/10th/100th payment. Doge coin is more reliable than Lightning and has cheap fees and it's a joke of a coin made by 4chan. Hold on... a joke coin works better than $155million dollar funded Blockstream Lightning solution. Ok somethings up.

[Bitcoin Verde](https://github.com/softwareverde/bitcoin-verde) (my multithreaded implementation of Bitcoin Cash; still in alpha) validates (uses libsecp256k1) about 1,200 transactions per second on my laptop (and about 2.5k Tx/s on a server with an M.2 drive), which equates to about 154MB sized blocks IFF you want to spend 10 minutes validating a block, which is impractical because you'll have zero seconds to mine a block.  Ideally, you'd validate a block in less than 30 seconds, and at 1,200 Tx/s you're looking at 7.7 MB blocks (scaling linearly from there... so 32MB would be 30 * ~4, so 2 minutes).

It gets slightly worse from there, though, because while I'm able to *validate* 1.2k Tx/s, I can only *store* about 600 Tx/s per second.  Fortunately, with ThinBlocks you're storing the next block's transactions as they come in, so you have a larger window than 30 seconds to validate/store.  But while syncing, and/or without using ThinBlocks, you're looking at like 400 Tx/s.  Having anything near 154MB sized (full) blocks basically makes it impossible for a disconnected node to ever catch up.

e53d4hp,CAPTAIN_FIAT,52,"I think Jihan's description of events is accurate/honest and his theory is plausible.

CSW did ruin Gavin's reputation by deceiving him. Incredibly impressive con-job. 

He claimed he was going to stop SegWit from going into Bitcoin with mysterious ""hash power"" that never materialized.

He now says that the reason he didn't stop SegWit was because he told Jihan about his plans to prevent SegWit, which prompted Jihan to fork Bitcoin Cash.

CSW accuses Jihan of not wanting one Bitcoin to become global currency because Haipo exchange makes more money from shitcoin exchange.

Sounds good, but think about it for a second. None of it makes sense!

Q: If CSW actually had the hash power, why didn't he prevent SegWit from going into BTC? How did Jihan forking prevent CSW from mining against BTC and preventing SegWit?

A: It didn't prevent CSW from stopping SegWit. If he had the hash power, he could have done it. SegWit was not stopped. **The reasonable conclusion is that CSW is deceiving us and didn't have the hash power to do what he claimed (not the first time).**

CSW is accusing Jihan of not wanting Bitcoin to succeed, that his business does better with thousands of shit coins that people can gamble on.

Fact: Jihan makes money primarily from SHA256^2 mining. That's BTC and BCH. Jihan doesn't run Shapeshift. Gambling on shitcoins is NOT how Bitmain makes revenue. Again, CSW is lying.

CSW is an incredibly gifted liar and deceiver. A lot of people will probably be fooled by his BS. 

I think Jihan is probably right about CSW. CSW is an incredible actor. He strikes me as an agent provocateur working for the same interests that funded blockstream. He seems to be here to divide the community and @#$@ everything up.

What I can't reconcile is why Jihan/Amaury are not engaging in dialogue with the community and are pushing changes without discussion. 

/u/deadalnix should get out here and openly/transparently talk about the plans for the November fork, and come into consensus with XT and BU FAST. 

What really bothers me is that both Jihan and Amaury are ENABLING CSW to divide the community by not engaging and pushing these changes.

If either of these two would simply engage, CSW's house of cards and accusations would fall apart like the rest of his magic tricks.

So why aren't they doing that?

It makes CSW look like he might be telling the truth (he's not, he's a huge liar).

My fear is that there's an alternative hypothesis.

Both Jihan/ABC/Amaury and CSW are on the same team. This is a really powerful and effective attack that will polarize the BCH community and split it, and it's backed by big hash power.

The kind of hash power that Nation States can afford.

e51n1mx,thieflar,43,"Overall, a very well-written article, surprisingly accurate and professionally presented information.

The most misleading paragraph in the article, though, is hands down this one:

&gt;As such, the SegWit soft fork separated the transaction data from the signature data, keeping the signature data in extended blocks called “witness”. This freed up the blocks with more space, allowing miners to include more transactions in a block. The extended blocks (Witness signature data) are in a data structure that is running in parallel along the bitcoin main blockchain.

The witness signature data is included in the blocks and transactions themselves, it's not ""running in parallel along the bitcoin main blockchain"" whatsoever. Segwit transactions are serialized so that their witness data is *at the end of the transaction*, not *taken out of the block entirely*. Importantly, this data *can* be stripped out on demand (because it's cleanly separated at the end of each transaction), which is [pretty cool for a lot of reasons](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/).

This 'poison pill' was added to prevent the 'old' chain in an upgrade HF from living on, unless it takes special measures. A touted benefit of this feature, which effectively forced the 6mo HF upgrades (at least for ABC users) was to prevent ossification of the protocol development.

Note that this feature was made optional in the spec, and BU, XT didn't implement it afaik.",2018-08-30 04:40:07

Cboe Global Markets, the exchange behind the first market for bitcoin futures, is telling market makers it is close to rolling out futures for ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, people familiar with the situation told Business Insider. The product may launch by the end of 2018, one of the people said. Futures, which provide investors a way to bet on the future price of an asset, helped propel bitcoin to all-time highs at the end of December. Bitcoin future markets, which include Cboe and CME in the US, have been relatively muted since their launch in December. Still, the launch of ether futures would mark a significant step in ether's maturation as it could open the door to wider trading in the crypto and possibly an ETF. Cboe will be basing its futures on Gemini's underlying market, people familiar with the situation said. Cboe also based its bitcoin futures on the New York-based crypto exchange run by the Winklevoss twins. The futures and options exchange is waiting on the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to get comfortable with the product before its official launch, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A Securities and Exchange Commission director in June notablysaid the agency didn't view the trading of ether as violating securities law which could bode well for Cboe. Cboe president Chris Concannon has previously hinted at the launch of other products tied to crypto markets. Concannon said in December 2017 that a family of cryptocurrency products, including futures for ether and bitcoin cash, could come to fruition as the market continues to mature. ""We started down this road in the form of an ETF,"" he said. ""A healthy market is a healthy underlying market, derivatives markets, and an ETF. That will take time."" Meanwhile, rival CME Group's CEO Terry Duffy has said ether futures won't go live on his venue any time soon. ""I will take a wait and see approach with Bitcoin for now,"" Duffy told Bloomberg in July. Bats Global Markets, which was acquired by Cboe earlier this year, attempted to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund from the Winklevoss twins.

e53q42o,SarangNoether,61,"Hello again! Dr. Sarang Noether here with my monthly report for August. I say it every month, but my sincere thanks go out to the entire Monero community for supporting my research for the Monero Research Lab. The goal is always to drive Monero forward through the finest research and development efforts.

As our next scheduled network upgrade approaches, I've completed further Bulletproofs optimizations to squeeze as much speed as possible out of transaction verification. As was our original goal, tests show that transaction size is crazy small and transaction times are crazy fast. Tests on a few different machines suggest that verifying one Bulletproof is over 4 times faster than our old method, and verifying a batch of 64 Bulletproofs is over 36 times faster than the old method! We also added some additional checks and safeguards to reflect suggestions from our audit process, taking a belt-and-suspenders approach. There is additional side work happening on some Bulletproofs generalizations that could be useful later. To help with this, I made a quick [Python port](https://github.com/SarangNoether/research-lab/tree/master/source-code/pybullet) of basic Bulletproofs functionality that is substantially simpler than the original; this port is for prototyping only, and is neither efficient nor asserted to be secure for production use.

I've assisted Lab partner Surae Noether with formalization of our multisignature scheme, which underwent major revision to reflect new academic research and more comprehensive analysis. The paper has been posted to the [IACR preprint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/774). Security proofs can get admittedly pretty ugly, but they are an important part of the development process that we hope will benefit other researchers and projects as well. We're completing similar formal analysis of dual-key outputs that was written up earlier.

The recent Monero village at DEF CON in Las Vegas was a smashing success, and I was glad to represent the Lab. I had the opportunity to share great information about the project with hundreds of people, both Monero enthusiasts and newcomers to the space. Our room was packed with attendees, and we even had to turn people away when we hit capacity! I delivered a talk on privacy research and attack vectors that was recorded and should be made available through more official DEF CON channels. I can also post the slides from this talk to my research repository if there's any interest; let me know. I'll be delivering similar talks on the importance of privacy research at upcoming events in Houston and Orlando (no community funding needed).

There's plenty of ongoing research happening. There has been good discussion on the practical functionality of view keys. Right now, proving the balance of an address involves giving an auditor both the view key and a list of signed key images, which leaks information about which outputs are spent. I'm interested to see if there are alternatives to this that don't have this kind of leak. To be clear, there is no plan to force users to give up any privacy. There are useful cases for wanting to demonstrate balance, and right now we don't have a good and safe way of doing so. Research continues on smaller ring signature schemes, on safe methods for refund transactions, and on heuristics involving ring size and churn behavior.

As always, on to Sarang's Reading Corner, a selection of just a few of the interesting papers I've come across recently. Being on this list doesn't mean I necessarily agree with the contents or conclusions, just that I found the paper interesting.

* [Coloured Ring Confidential Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10554): Initial work on how to include multiple assets on a single blockchain that's compatible with our ring confidential transaction model.

* [Mobius: Trustless Tumbling for Transaction Privacy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/881): An idea on how to implement certain privacy features into Ethereum that applies ring signatures to mixing.

* [On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf): An analysis of possible future implications to assets of finite supply, and a good reminder of why block rewards are important to mining incentives.

e54h0rw,Ovitius,54,"For the people still wondering who is at fault here:

1) Showing up at the branch to withdraw 16k without proper ID and not calling in advance is sketchy, no matter who you are.

2) The guy only gave them a bitcoin exchange ID and not his transaction history, so instead of telling them he had an investment in bitcoin and made capital gains, he was being a smart ass with them and they assumed he was into shady activities.

3) Nobody who's a complete shipwreck emotionally speaking, has no jobs, and has this sort of cash flow will be able to take their money out that easily without explaining how they got it.

The bank is not doing it to ""steal your money"", they will hold the funds until you give them a proper explanation of how you got it, and if they didn't close his accounts and gave him a check with his money to tell him to take his business elsewhere, it means he is under investigation for money laundering suspicions.

My advice to people withdrawing large amounts off money through cryptos: Have your story ready and your trading history ready as well. No, nobody owes you an apology for being careful and it's your responsibility to cover your bases with financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies are being used to launder money and for illicit transactions, so pretty much every bank out there is being careful about them so if you don't help them understand your situation better, they don't owe you any explanations if your funds get frozen for investigation purposes.

Yes, it's your money, not the bank's money, but you are using the bank's products and you should own up to your responsibilities to prove that your funds are legit. This doesn't happen with cryptocurrencies only, but pretty much any incoming foreign wire transfer or unusual transaction that goes through your bank account.

PS: When trying to explain them your situation, take your bullshit libertarian anti-bank views out of the picture and be nice to the person handling your case, that will greatly improve your chances at not getting in trouble. Nobody cares that you are a ""crypto investor"", there is no conspiracy to steal your money, if you're being reckless, you will get in trouble.

PPS: By trading history, the bank wants to see that you purchased the digital assets at a specific date, and sold it later at a profit, which then explains the origins of your money. That is enough to get all suspicions out of the window.",2018-08-31 08:01:41

&gt;**Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are useless**

&gt;*For blockchains, the jury is still out*

&gt;AN OLD saying holds that markets are ruled by either greed or fear. Greed once governed cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin, the best-known, rose from about $900 in December 2016 to $19,000 a year later. Recently, fear has been in charge. Bitcoin’s price has fallen back to around $7,000; the prices of other cryptocurrencies, which followed it on the way up, have collapsed, too. No one knows where prices will go from here. Calling the bottom in a speculative mania is as foolish as calling the top. It is particularly hard with cryptocurrencies because, as our Technology Quarterly this week points out, there is no sensible way to reach any particular valuation.

&gt;It was not supposed to be this way. Bitcoin, the first and still the most popular cryptocurrency, began life as a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks. A decade on, it is barely used for its intended purpose. Users must wrestle with complicated software and give up all the consumer protections they are used to. Few vendors accept it. Security is poor. Other cryptocurrencies are used even less.

&gt;With few uses to anchor their value, and little in the way of regulation, cryptocurrencies have instead become a focus for speculation. Some people have made fortunes as cryptocurrency prices have zoomed and dived; many early punters have cashed out. Others have lost money. It seems unlikely that this latest boom-bust cycle will be the last.

&gt;Economists define a currency as something that can be at once a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. Lack of adoption and loads of volatility mean that cryptocurrencies satisfy none of those criteria. That does not mean they are going to go away (though scrutiny from regulators concerned about the fraud and sharp practice that is rife in the industry may dampen excitement in future). But as things stand there is little reason to think that cryptocurrencies will remain more than an overcomplicated, untrustworthy casino.

&gt;Can blockchains—the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies—do better? These are best thought of as an idiosyncratic form of database, in which records are copied among all the system’s users rather than maintained by a central authority, and where entries cannot be altered once written. Proponents believe these features can help solve all sorts of problems, from streamlining bank payments and guaranteeing the provenance of medicines to securing property rights and providing unforgeable identity documents for refugees.

&gt;**Nothing to lose but your blockchains**

&gt;Those are big claims. Many are made by cryptocurrency speculators, who hope that stoking excitement around blockchains will boost the value of their related cryptocurrency holdings. Yet firms that deploy blockchains often end up throwing out many of the features that make them distinctive. And shuttling data continuously between users makes them slower than conventional databases.

&gt;As these limitations become more widely known, the hype is starting to cool. A few organisations, such as SWIFT, a bank-payment network, and Stripe, an online-payments firm, have abandoned blockchain projects, concluding that the costs outweigh the benefits. Most other projects are still experimental, though that does not stop wild claims. Sierra Leone, for instance, was widely reported to have conducted a “blockchain-powered” election earlier this year. It had not.

&gt;Just because blockchains have been overhyped does not mean they are useless. Their ability to bind their users into an agreed way of working may prove helpful in arenas where there is no central authority, such as international trade. But they are no panacea against the usual dangers of large technology projects: cost, complexity and overcooked expectations. Cryptocurrencies have fallen far short of their ambitious goals. Blockchain advocates have yet to prove that the underlying technology can live up to the grand claims made for it.",2018-08-31 22:49:07

e55qiz9,eesahe,30,"Reposting my 5 year inflation calculation with issuance reduction to 2 ETH / block:

Let's say we change to 2 eth per block on October 30th (just before DevCon 4), when there should be roughly 102,500,000 ETH in existence at current mining rate. After that the issuance will be 2 ETH per 5760 blocks mined per day = 2 * 5760 * 365 = 4,204,800 ETH per year. Additionally there will be 613,901 ETH per year created in uncle rewards.

* October 30th 2018 = 102,500,000 ETH
* October 30th 2019 = 107,318,701 ETH
* October 30th 2020 = 112,137,402 ETH

The switch to PoS should happen in 2019 but even accounting for delays it should definitely happen by October 2020. The [current best guess is 500k of ETH issued per year after PoS](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455)

* October 30th 2021 = 112,637,402 ETH 
* October 30th 2022 = 113,137,402 ETH
* October 30th 2023 = 113,637,402 ETH

So in total over the next 5 years that would make for [average ETH inflation of **2.084% per year**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=102,500,000+*+x%5E5+%3D+113,637,402).

Now compare that to bitcoin, with supply increasing from 17,348,400 on October 30th 2018 to [estimated 19,750,000 on October 30th 2023](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/37092) for an [average BTC inflation of **2.627% per year**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=17348400+*+x%5E5+%3D+19750000) over the next 5 years.

What projections are you talking about? Saying ""Bitcoin is useless"" isn't projecting the future price. People pay money for lots of useless things. 

The economist doesn't try to predict the stock market or other asset prices. Economists know that trying to predict price fluctuations is pointless and futile. It's OK to disagree with the Economist, but you don't have to make up a bunch of bizarre lies about them.

That's an actual finance magazine, so your comments actually make sense for them. Maybe you were confusing the Economist with something else.",2018-08-31 22:13:02

People are so delusional now if they don’t become a millionaire overnight.

Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men.

Anyone around since 2013 or before knows the meaning of patience.

Sit tight. Most years we rally in Q4. (2014 excluded) Guess what though, this is 2018.

Much more developed eco system now. Still would call for a new ATH by year end. We didn’t need an ETF for 20k before anyways.",2018-08-31 13:31:03

Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV are clients, the same as Bitcoin Unlimited and BitcoinXT. They are now arguing about what new rules to enable in the upcoming hard fork  for Bitcoin Cash. This is where the drama comes from.

Bitcoin ABC wants to alter the sort order of transactions in blocks, something other developers aren't convinced is a good idea.

Bitcoin SV is a new client which rejects ABC's proposal and instead wants to increase the block size, activate new OP codes and remove the OP code limit in a transaction. Other developers don't think increasing the block size right now is good because there are protocol limits that are difficult to replace. It's pushed by CSW, coingeek, nChain and an army of trolls in this subreddit.

Some think both proposals are bad and that we shouldn't fork at all, like Cobra but there isn't code for a client yet.

Others like BU and XT wants to allow miners vote on individual changes and could in theory support any side of the fork.

Edit: Missed some questions.

&gt;  Why suddently CSW and Jihan started throwing shit at each other?

CSW has been throwing shit at everyone. Jihan returned some of that.

&gt;  Wtf is Coingeek and why they involved? 

A news site owned by Calvin, owner of nChain, is heavily biased towards Bitcoin SV and have published pure propaganda articles. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9bhn98/coingeek_is_publishing_blatant_false_information/)

Edit 2: I forgot to mention ABC also wants to implement OP_CHECKDATASIG which all developers are in favor for. CSW thinks it's crap for reasons that doesn't make technical sense.",2018-08-31 01:47:43
