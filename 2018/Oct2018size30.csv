Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited about the lightning unicorn.....

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users (where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them too. 

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with a fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.

e6zavhh,DCinvestor,30,"Forgive me this indulgence / cautionary tale, as I know we are not an EOS sub (and I'll tie this back to Ethereum if you stick with me), but in case you aren't tracking, EOS is facing a governance crisis, [with serious allegations that BPs are selling / trading votes to each other.](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/09/29/rampant-collusion-in-eos-exposed-by-huobi-leak)  Many of us felt that such a scenario was [inevitable.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8rilqy/eos_block_producing_has_stopped/e0rota4/)

It has been very interesting to see the EOS community's response evolve from ""You're wrong, we have a Constitution.  Anyone who buys and sell votes will simply be removed or voted out.  Collusion will not happen.""  Now to: ""Collusion isn't actually a problem at all.  Ethereum and Bitcoin are the real centralized blockchains.""  [Anyone talking about collusion as a problem is being labeled a ""FUD'ster"" by some.](https://np.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/9k5xbm/i_hate_having_to_use_my_weekends_to_end_the/)

Blockchain is designed to solve a problem of trust, primarily by creating an accounting system (or world computer, if you will) that is trustless and uncensorable.  It may not always be as fast or as scalable as we want it to be, but once you sacrifice that property of trutlessness (as EOS possibly has), and you end up with something that occupies an awkward middleground- trying to solve profound economic problems, but creating more fundamental ones at a base protocol level with flawed attempts at governance.  And with these recent revelations, I will be surprised to see EOS used for any meaningful purpose by anyone who cares about that unique value proposition of blockchain.

So who's still holding EOS? In likely order of the amount of EOS they control (and not necessarily mutually exclusive): 1) Corporations / BPs realizing they can control and profit from their administration of a blockchain, 2) Individuals seeking to profit from a self-purported ""Ethereum Killer"" at the peak of ICO mania, 3) Technologists who focus inordinately on transactions-per-second and don't even understand the problem sets for which blockchain is best suited to solve,  4) Utopian idealists who want to believe people are only good, and 5) Dan Larimer groupies, who blindly support any project with his name on it.

But what about people who care about the real value proposition of blockchain, to provide a decentralized, uncensorable platform for economic activity?  I'd say not so much.

A lot of folks in here are upset that Ethereum hasn't scaled yet.  Some think it's as easy as waving a magic wand, and having Casper and Sharding operating at scale tomorrow, giving us trillions of transactions per second.  They ignore the fact that Ethereum still enjoys a powerful network effect, with developers undeterred from building out their visions on Ethereum.  They ignore the fact that L2 technology is evolving a rapid pace.  And they ignore the fact that Ethereum already operates as a secure, reliable, and trustless network- securing meaningful economic activity.  That's not to say Ethereum doesn't have its own technical and governance challenges, but I'd take them any day over accusations of vote buying and BP collusion.

Once the base layer of a protocol has been corrupted, in the way that EOS potentially has, I'm not sure there is going to be any turning back.

So as an Ethereum investor, and as someone who believes in this technology, I'm happy to know that this dev team and community isn't looking to take unreasonable shortcuts just to pump a transactions per second number as quickly as possible.  There's a reason why you see so few projects actually fleeing Ethereum, despite those challenges.  And I'm proud of the fact that this is an open community, with announcements today of partnership with other projects, including one being launched by [previous R3 executives](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/10/01/ethereum-co-founder-invests-65-million-in-former-competitors/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=1810824851&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesCrypto#30c80a2d5880) and another with [Hyperledger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/astanley/2018/10/01/hyperledger-and-enterprise-ethereum-alliance-join-forces-in-enterprise-blockchain-boost/#32e34ab94aa2).

We don't need to be Ethereum-maximalists, and we don't need to kill every other project out there.  But if you're going to masquerade your project as an open / properly decentralized blockchain, and conduct what is an effectively a grand governance experiment with $4bn of contributed money on the line, well, you can expect some healthy skepticism from those who got into blockchain for reasons that perhaps differ from your own.",2018-10-02 02:57:53

This doesn't mean it won't happen in the unbanked world as well.. but I believe they'll use it as more of a currency there.

That said, Nano is still evolving and with more liquidity the price will stabilize and make it a more reasonable currency. We still have some years to go before pushing it.

I think if we rush it as a currency we will ultimately stunt the growth of Nano. We already saw Bitcoin lose Stripe as well as many merchants due to the issues BTC had (high fees, long waits, etc..).

There is nothing of substance in this spiel. If you are going to try build a false narrative, at least get the opening assumptions correct. 

* AntShares began when Erik Zhang met with Da Hongfei to discuss Da Hongfei's prototype project, which he first proposed his ideas for in a speech at a Bitcoin conference in early 2014. They met in the middle of 2014 and began building on the concept. **2014**. 
* There was no 'third' ICO, there was a rebrand. As someone that bought into ANS and has remained active in the NEO community ever since, I think this is something that is unlikely to have passed my attention. 
* That 'relic of NEO's past' Ant Financial is literally bigger than Goldman Sachs. Facepalmed so hard I almost swallowed it when I read this one.
* Claims NEO was only a rebrand, with no changes to code. Well, that and the entire smart contract functionality that didn't exist in AntShares, I suppose.
* Title claims devs abandoned codebase, yet not only is nothing to this point contained in the 'report', but the [author looks for code in an awesome-list repo](https://twitter.com/canesin/status/1031460275386544128). Quality 'research' wins again.

Meanwhile, NEO devs (working together with the awesome dev community as always) just rolled out [neo-cli 2.9.0]
(https://neonewstoday.com/development/neo-adopts-the-actor-model-in-neo-cli-2-9-0-release/), which features an entire refactor that adopts the actor model (based on Akka). This has been in the works since [25th June](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/288) and will provide a massive stability increase to NEO, as well as setting the stage for future TPS improvements.

As with all projects, there have been growing pains with NEO. The community has come down pretty hard on NGD/NF this year as a result. We're starting to see results, the ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. These desperate attempts at FUD are thoroughly amusing.

Something good about Qubic is that a company can run its own internal Qubic nodes to process trusted internal data through the tangle at no additional fee, but can also access public Qubic nodes for a fee to integrate non-proprietary information.

The potential public/fee possibilities are countless for businesses and individuals - and this would add value to the iota token.  And, as stated, utilization of the tangle in general also speeds and secures the network in its final state.

What gives value to any cryptocurrency long-term is use for a purpose.  Fast, feeless cross-border payments is a purpose.  Accessing information is a purpose.  Transaction between machines without need to coordinate accounts between banks or differing  currencies is a purpose.  A business accepting digital payment without onerous processing fees is a purpose.  There are strong incentives for individuals and businesses in any of these use cases.  Iota can be used in any of these capacities.  Think about how much money Amazon or Walmart pays to Visa at 1%-3% charge per transaction - just for the convenience of digital and/or online payment.  Don’t they have a large incentive in using something less costly?  And, if buying coffee is one’s primary goal, no fee is better than fee - just like no tax is much nicer than tax for the consumer.

When people die from a software or hardware failure, people take the time to make sure things like this can't happen. Model checking is a software technique that was used on the Mars Rovers. It's a major reason they have outlived their mission lifetimes by an order of magnitude.

But, motherboards have never been worth the investment to analyze. The juice just isn't worth the squeeze. Even in a high availability build-out, you just put redundant hardware in and fail over within your SLA. You _don't_ spend the kind of resources that NASA does to make sure it's perfect (NASA developers write about 1 line of code a day).

So, we'll need to change the calculous and start implementing the safety-critical development tools we have for general purpose computing. That's a huge investment and will obviously slow growth, but I think it's going to be an acceptable cost when compared to rebuilding a supply-chain that's been put together over the last 25 years.

Added to that -

&gt;The stability report said the development of digital trading platforms and digital currencies such as bitcoin, along with other financial technology companies, had been rapid. It said: “**Despite its potential benefits, our knowledge of its potential risks and how they might play out is still developing**. Increased cybersecurity risks pose challenges for financial institutions, financial infrastructure, and supervisors. **These developments should act as a reminder that the financial system is permanently evolving, and regulators and supervisors must remain vigilant to this evolution and ready to act if needed**.”

IF something terrible were to happen (I'm really hoping it won't) - Ten years from now we'll likely be reading books, watching movies and interviews from researchers and experts about how nobody today had a clue about what was actually going on. The future's equivalent of *Margot Robbie in a bathtub, sipping champagne* explaining how a lot of business was carried out without a remote understanding of not only the risks, but the infrastructure itself. This followed by some expose on how some top players didn't know the mechanics of cryptocurreny, how it worked, why it mattered, what it was used for and where it came from (or where it's headed). 

Cynical as well? Perhaps. But don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are many analysts who are heavily familiar with cryptocurreny. I ain't saying nobody gets it. I'm saying my hope is that the people *in charge*, those with the unregulated power of making supremely important decisions which end up guiding our economy and have the potential of causing financially catastrophic damage if erroneous, understand it.

Vega was supposed to be their big comeback, and the flagship just about matched the GTX 1080 with a considerably larger power draw.

To add to the problems, the Vega was released during the peak of the bitcoin craze, and had somewhat limited production. So not only did it perform so-so, but it was damn near impossible to get one for anything near the MSRP. Between all these factors it was considered pretty much a flop, despite not being ""bad"" GPU's.

Fast forward and, with no real competition for it's flagship cards, Nvidia recently released the 20XX series. Many enthusiests are less than happy with an incremental rise in traditional performance compared to the previous generation. Nvidia has touted some new technologies, but these have not yet progressed beyond a couple demos and a lots of press releases.

Classic addresses start with the digit 1 and segwit addresses start with 3. Multi-signature addresses start with 3 as well, but don't worry about those for now. There are also wallets that support segwit address creation and some outdated ones don't. The edge mobile wallet for example is a good wallet that supports segwit addresses. It makes a lot of sense to use a wallet that supports segwit addresses and send all the coins you use for everyday spending to it, because when you spend from such a wallet, you pay much less for fees, and you allow more transactions to be processed by the Bitcoin network, so you indirectly reduce the fees for everyone including yourself. Segwit is backward compatible, so anyone with an old wallet can send to your segwit address (3) and you can send to their classic address (1). Ask if you have more questions!",2018-10-04 21:42:41

If November is compromised what is the backup plan, and don't tell me pitchforks and riots, it won't happen.

Money is the end game here, it's what is poisoning politics and has been for decades.

Blue States need to organize, since I know that the minority of red States, zealous alt-right Christian groups, Trump, the GOP, Kavanaugh, and Russia are in a race to destroy this country against the values and the votes of the majority.

Blue States need to flex their Plenary Authority and create their own SOE Bank that grants business licenses, where the State is the ""owner"" and the business is the ""agent"". As per IRS definition if the State acted as the shell to all business as ""owner"" the SOE Bank can in theory Withold all Federal taxes from all business through smart contracts, where the Federal Government would have to go to the State to receive withholding taxes.

By withholdings all federal taxes of their States businesses into escrow accounts it would actually give labor a voice, where it is representation through taxation.

The Federal Government would be required to meet certain criteria to have the funds released. Examples of criteria can be impeached Trump, guarantee net neutrality, free college for all, guarantee Roe v Wade, Medicaid for all, term limits on all politicians and judges, etc.

The Federal Constitution guarantees States Sovereign rights through the Commerce Clause, which allows them to create licensing and dictate monetary policies within their state lines.

An example of the Commerce Clause and Plenary Authority happened in California when [SB 930](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB930) almost passed this August.

This bill is a perfect example of Commerce Clause, Plenary Authority, and State Owned Enterprise if I ever did see one. This bill would have allowed California to create an online banking system, outside of Federal Government reach to be created for the Cannabis industry.

This is a perfect example of how to take the power back from a corrupt Federal Government, Trump, the GOP, and Russia. By creating an online banking system where the State is defined as owner to be a Shell and protect all business defined as agents.

The State would shut down any attempt of reprisals or retaliation from the federal government based on this Shell company scheme. The federal government would not be able to handle the bandwidth of un-obscuring all the Shell of business owners in a State like California. It's what States like Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming have setup today.

In addition, an online banking system with smart contracts on Federal Withholdings is future proof to currency changes since it could also act as an exchange, especially with  California's GDP of $2.8T in liquid cash per year.

Since this concept is based for business licensing for only legal businesses it will not have a fallout like the cannabis industry, you would be able to insure all bank accounts, similar to FDIC insurance.

As for the Google's and Facebook's that want their c-corp or Shell status to hide their money from the federal government, this system works for them as well.

It would be identical to what these companies have structured now for c-corps and shells, but they would still be taxed with a domicile tax that is in place currently. It basically means no matter where you are licensed you will still pay the State your full share of taxes.

As far as the Federal Government creating new money or Constitutional Amendments, this system would have to embrace the IOT-buzzword of Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts, where the system can be flagged for theft or manipulation, be it from criminals or the Federal Government. In other words, once the online banking system has been turned ""On"" there is no turning back, similar to Bitcoin where all activities is shared through blockchain.

https://i.redd.it/8tx8489v80o11.png
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72hfsv/psa_dont_buy_coffee_with_bitcoin/

User unable to take back his money from Lightning Network - https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9cgjhx/just_tripled_my_money_on_lightning_spin_but/

3) Charlie Lee said ""LN is peer to peer because we're connecting in networks... transactions jump from peer to peer...""

By that logic, that means Inter-Banks transactions are also peer to peer. What a deceitful asshole.

4) ""Have you seen the photo of the lightning network where people laugh at nobody connecting to the Roger Ver node?""

Charlie Lee: ""No""

""If that node is excluded from the network...Doesn't it look like it is censored from the network?""

Charlie Lee: ""That picture is a joke.""

Roger Ver: ""The picture is from the actual live Lightning Network.""

Charlie Lee: ""Someone made a joke...""

So here we see Charlie Lee claimed that he hasn't seen the picture Roger was talking about, but when he has to defend Lightning Network, he will lie that the picture is just a joke. Suddenly he understood what every node is thinking about why they are not connecting to Roger's node... These nodes are just joking! I, the liar Charlie Lee, knows they are joking! Fuck you, Charlie Lee, for being a deceitful bastard.

5) Charlie Lee: ""47 cents is low fee""

""Each Gartner hype cycle begins with a burst of enthusiasm for the new technology, and the price is bid up by the market participants who are “reachable” in that iteration. The earliest buyers in a Gartner hype cycle typically have a strong conviction about the transformative nature of the technology they are investing in. Eventually the market reaches a crescendo of enthusiasm as the supply of new participants who can be reached in the cycle is exhausted and the buying becomes dominated by speculators more interested in quick profits than the underlying technology.""

""Following the peak of the hype cycle, prices rapidly drop and the speculative fervor is replaced by despair, public derision and a sense that the technology was not transformative at all. Eventually the price bottoms and forms a plateau where the original investors who had strong conviction are joined by a new cohort who were able to withstand the pain of the crash and who appreciated the importance of the technology.""

""The plateau persists for a prolonged period of time and forms, as Casey calls it, a “stable, boring low”. During the plateau, public interest in the technology will dwindle but it will continue to be developed and the collection of strong believers will slowly grow. A new base is then set for the next iteration of the hype cycle as external observers recognize the technology is not going away and that investing in it may not be as risky as it seemed during the crash phase of the cycle. The next iteration of the hype cycle will bring in a much larger set of adopters and be far greater in magnitude.""


""Very few people participating in an iteration of a Gartner hype cycle will correctly anticipate how high prices will go in that cycle. Prices usually reach levels that would seem absurd to most investors at the earliest stages of the cycle. When the cycle ends, a popular cause it typically attributed to the crash by the media. While the stated cause (such as an exchange failure) may be a precipitating event, it is not the fundamental reason for the cycle to end. Gartner hype cycles end because of an exhaustion of market participants reachable in the cycle.""

""It is telling that gold followed the classic pattern of a Gartner hype cycle from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. One might speculate that the hype cycle is an inherent social dynamic to the process of monetization.""",2018-10-05 22:23:13

That address is plausibly in her ""hot"" wallet used for receiving donations and maybe regular spending that she keeps a relatively constant amount in (analogous to the cash one carries in a physical wallet), with any excess being periodically transferred to a ""cold storage"" wallet (analogous to your bank account or cash in a mattress), and as I said above, you can't really tell the difference between actual spending and that shuffling from just the transactions without deeper investigation.",2018-10-05 13:04:32

While I've seen some spread in the past that in my opinion supports my hypothesis, it didn't seem conclusive.  However, yesterday a spread opened up, with Poloniex and Bitfinex running about $50 higher than Kraken and Coinbase.  Bittrex is up there with Poloniex and Bitfinex, and as noted above, Binance. 

In addition, its become clear lately that the pumps do not draw people in like they used to.  Look at the chart and see that each successive rally has been smaller, which in my opinion is due to an ever-shrinking pool of suckers to draw from.  Underscoring this is that google trends shows that searches for bitcoin have been falling ever since the peak.

One would naturally ask, ""How does a group of people get so pumped up on hate..?""

[God's Own Party](https://youtu.be/TFSA0IPMqew) is a book about how the Christian Right became.

It started in the 1930s when big business tried and failed to push their anti taxation *(only rich paid taxes back then)* small government message... aginst Trustbusting Roosevelt.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to ""friendly"" churches. 

Before this, religious people didnt have any particular political affiliation. It's in the book. That's how it started... 

...then in the 1970s after Nixon felt the media was mean to him over Watergate... Fox, Rush L, and the conservative media movement begun, intended as a right wing propaganda machine. That is detailed in [Brainwashing of my Dad](https://youtu.be/Qh3TeTxgNVo)

**Conclusion** - This all adds up to the rightwing ""followers"" being like slave computers in a bot net, albeit used as human voter slaves...

These entrenched, industrial miners likely won't be content losing their cashcow when PoS is eventually put on the docket for a future fork release. What exactly happens when they inevitably disagree with PoS? What if they threaten to hold the network hostage? It would be entirely their prerogative to start massively double-spending, effectively turning the network into chaos. Would the devs need to institute some kind of rollback?

It's an ugly scenario, but not unlikely if Vitalik continues the status quo and decentralization is left on the backburner and ignored. Bitmain recently obtained a [majority 51% control of Bitcoin's network](https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-mining-pools-now-control-nearly-51-percent-of-the-bitcoin-hashrate/).

So people are speculating that they are doing it to drive up transaction fees on Bitcoin to make BCH look better. Maybe this is true, maybe it's not.

Peer-to-peer just means that the funds move from Party A to Party B without going through a Party C.

In Bitcoin this is true. Charlie's claim is that the miners must mine it and therefore they are Party C, but the miners are never custodians of those funds. The transaction is announced (broadcast) to everyone, as Charlie said, but it's not as though everyone is involved in that transaction. It always goes from Party A to Party B regardless of who hears about it. Charlie is incorrect, Bitcoin is peer-to-peer.

This is a very weak argument from core supporters and it can be immediately debunked by showing the chain of custody of the coins: A to B, no C. Yet even though this argument is thin as a playing card they still repeat it over and over.",2018-10-06 08:54:46

e79hatd,autemox,32,"This article never discusses the technology.  The talk referenced can be found on YouTube video ""Scaling Bitcoin 2018 ""Kaizen""_day1_Part2"".  It is 30 minutes long and starts at 1:02:00.

It was just uploaded and has a grand total of 124 views right now.  It will take time for people to find the material...  but also very long to process the concept of ""Forward Blocks"".  

Edit:  Some thoughts after watching the video:

These changes are much more complex than segwit or anything that's been done before.

His idea of forward blocks should be considered separate from his other ideas... although he talks about them together. His ideas include sharding (wants 28 forward chains), proposed changes to the miner rewards (he wants to replace halvening with slow change over time to eliminate the 'event'), flexcap for block sizes (he wants to allow miners to change their proof of work target and in doing so increase or decrease size of block in a manner that would incentivize 'good block size').  So a lot of very ambitious ideas here that probably don't belong on BTC, at least not until they have been applied to litecoin and other altcoins.

It's a neat idea, hard to know if it can work right now, but sounds interesting.  It more complicated than I would like on Tier 1 BTC, and it breaks in-use functionality of bitcoin, such as time-locking (because the compatibility chain would be mined at faster than 10 minutes using a bug, and the forward chain would be mined slower than 10 minutes to 'increase security').  

Just that fact that he is exploiting a bug to manipulate the legacy chain into keeping up with the forward chain is grounds to say this is an attack...  And there are other things about his idea that make it sound like an attack.  

Personally I think any large change to BTC should be considered a potential attack, even if it does not involve exploit bugs, forks, and changes to the base protocol.  Especially after recent events where we found out bugs were introduced during very small code upgrades.  Imagine what a bad actor could sneak into a big upgrade like this.  If a change is adopted on other coins first, such as LTC, for very long periods, it is more palatable.",2018-10-06 16:37:35

I was on the fence for a while and the bitcoin maximalists make solid arguments because bitcoin is non inflationary etc.


The thing is most people keep their money in the currency that is the most useful to them. 


People in the US hold USD because they can *use* the USD to buy milk and eggs at the grocery store. If they cared about inflation, they would keep their money in gold. 


ETH has utility. Bitcoin doesn't. There's a whole ecosystem of applications and systems that you need ETH to participate in.


Developers then build on those applications to create even more applications that need ETH to participate in and the network effects keep going and going and going.


I've experienced this personally. I need an ETH wallet to store my DAI, i place bets on Augur with ETH, I purchase cards on Gods Unchained with ETH, i need ETH to pay for transaction fees for all of these.

e7bviwq,gr8ful4,28,"Market participants act on their assessment of the market. They have their own psychology (emotions!) which tricks basically everybody that starts to trade. Only if you over-come your psychological limitations you'll become a good trader/investor.

If you lived through all the bear markets before you will notice, the different shades of fear, the different shades of denial, the different shades of capitulation.

I'd call the 2011 bubble - **""the lucky one""**. It's consequent down fall was harsh and people thought of Bitcoin as a **""one-time wonder""**. There were probably around 25k market participants back then.

The first bubble in 2013 could be named **""the unbelievable one""**. Many people who haven't given up in the previous cycle or bought in cheap after the 2011 crash threw in their towels early around the $30 to $70 mark only to see this beauty rally to $266. Then **""the nightmare""** started: Mt. Gox became unreliable and trade execution latency fucked up the mind of the newly rich. They exited in droves. People still had fresh memories of the last crash and doubt about another lucky coincidence and that this market could easily fade away came up. Back then the market had around 150k participants .

Then in late 2013 **""the surprising one""** happened out of nowhere and on bad news (Silkroad bust) prices rose to $1200. The bubble pop was awaited already by some veterans who lived through 3 bubbles by then. Despite the Mt. Gox scandal, the massive hacks and a severe decline in price over a long period, that was only interrupted by **""the hope for resurrection one""** of June 2014, the old timers knew that Bitcoin was not a fad that would go away. It was them who accumulated at the lowest possible prices buying when people lost their minds and sold because ""Mt. Gox would bring down everything"". The 1M market participants by then were thinned out.

Now that Bitcoin recovered for a 4h time- let's call it **""the foreseeable one""** - even non-believers started to see that Bitcoin is not an anomaly or an historic outlier that will easily go away. They know even if they still mistrust the concept, that there is something magical to it. They want to own Bitcoin, just in case. The fear in this market marks a shift in sentiment. It precedes what's coming next! Around 50M participants (or 0.7% of the worls's population) are involved now.

Only new comers full of fear and for the wrong reasons believe that 1M participants were able to drive up the price of an obscure currency to $1.2k and the now 50M participants should struggle to keep price at x5 despite being more and more acknowledged by traditional financial institutions as a new asset class. LOL. This is a low volume accumulation market that is painted as a bear (for obvious reasons).

The next cycle will be **""the inevitable one""** and it'll change the risk/fear from being invested (and lose everything) to being not invested (and lose everything)!

I could probably go more into detail, but I think you already get what I mean.

When BTC is volatile almost every column is long.  Things have been very quiet.  Statistically a descending triangle is most likely to break downward (continuation of trend)...  So sideways is good for bulls.  It's also good for bulls because bitcoin is deflationary and time is on the bulls side as there is a lot of exciting fundamentals/projects coming for BTC.  

Descending Triangle https://www.tradingview.com/x/FTzgF14G/  Been watching this (and not trading) since August 20!  Volume is very low on all timeframes from 2 hour to weekly.  We are in a really interesting place right now at last- can't wait for this to break.

In my last post 5 days ago, I recommended bulls long the horizontal support (the pink line on above chart @ 6,476).  We've touched down on that support.  Our upward trendline (see pink trendline in below chart) is now almost above that horizontal support so fair chance it won't touch again.  I would no longer long the 6,476 level- the opportunity has passed.

I also recommended bears short  7,200-7,429 range, which would be a break out of the large descending triangle but with no higher high confirmation.  I still like that range for a short, but I believe another shorting opportunity has come in the form of a small triangle on the 12 hour timeframe:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/dQxGHcYG/  I would short confirmation of a downward trendline break.  Short the key lower low @ 6,424.  This would also be good place to stop loss your long if you took the 6,476 long from last week that I described in my last paragraph.  Bulls should hold this higher low if they want to break out upwards of the larger descending triangle.",2018-10-07 07:48:34

e7c3f3w,itzprospero,55,"**Remember: Peter W. Smith also contacted members of the alt-right for help with the search for Clinton emails.**

Buzzfeed published an article entitled, [GOP Operative Made ""Suspicious"" Cash Withdrawals During Pursuit Of Clinton Emails](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money) ^[[1]](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money) that states, “Peter W. Smith withdrew $4,900 in cash the day after he finalized a plan to work with ‘dark web’ hackers”.  

&gt;Now, BuzzFeed News has reviewed documents showing that FBI agents and congressional investigators have zeroed in on transactions Smith made right as his effort to procure Clinton’s emails heated up. Just a day after he finished a report suggesting he was working with Trump campaign officials, for example, he transferred $9,500 from an account he had set up to fund the email project to his personal account, later taking out more than $4,900 in cash. According to a person with direct knowledge of Smith’s project, the Republican operative stated that he was prepared to pay hackers “many thousands of dollars” for Clinton’s emails — and ultimately did so.

This money shed new light on Smith's effort during which he told people he was in touch with Trump officials and Russians on the dark web.  He singled out Mike Flynn in particular.


Peter W. Smith also hired Chuck Johnson, as detailed in the Politico article from July 2017 [GOP Researcher Who Sought Clinton Emails Had Alt-Right Help](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/11/gop-researcher-who-sought-clinton-emails-had-alt-right-help-215359) ^[[2]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/11/gop-researcher-who-sought-clinton-emails-had-alt-right-help-215359)


Dana Rohrabacher was given the maximum donation of $5,400 campaign contributions in Bitcoin from alt-right holocaust denier Chuck Johnson.  ^[[3]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-far-right-blogger-chuck-c-johnson-gave-1508457881-htmlstory.html)  The pair [pose together for a picture^[4]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html) as Johnson flashes the co-opted white power hand gesture. This is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8opgjn/charlottesville_hate_marcher_elected_by/e05d4ga/?context=3) to a post detailing the gesture.

The two are familiar because Johnson helped set up the meeting between Rohrabacher and Julian Assange.  **Johnson, who was also [invited to the State of the Union by Matt Gaetz^[5]](https://www.thedailybeast.com/florida-congressman-invited-infamous-troll-chuck-johnson-to-trumps-state-of-the-union), sat in on a meeting between Rand Paul and Rohrabacher at the capitol**.  Rohrabcher’s spokesperson, Pitkin, says they discussed cannabis and Assange’s legal situation, among other things.  ^[[3]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-far-right-blogger-chuck-c-johnson-gave-1508457881-htmlstory.html) 

Michael Isikofff, co author of Russian Roulette, reported in that article that Chuck Johnson is not interested in cooperating in ongoing investigations: 

**The article states Johnson appeared to be the first figure in the Russia probe to make such a defiant position publicly, “refusing to cooperate in any way with the committee probe”.**

A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[4]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

Remember Rand Paul just recently moved to block Sander's Russia resolution backing the intelligence community and requiring Trump to speak with counsel Mueller and suggested that people were suffering from “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and “intense hatred for the president”.  .^[[6]](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/397879-rand-paul-blocks-sanders-russia-resolution-calls-it-crazy-hatred)

Rohrabacher met with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London of August 2017, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails. According to Rohrabacher, Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[7]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)

The problem that's been bugging me with bitdb was that while it's powerful, it doesn't let you express a fully high level API like all the mainstream tier-1 API providers like Twitter, Facebook, etc. The query results used to look like a raw database dump made up of unreadable attributes.

Well I've been iterating on multiple variations of this ""uniform"" query language to query data out of bitcoin via Bitdb, and finally found a solution I'm satisfied with.

It's a programmable query language. which means it not only queries the database but also can express the processing logic after the query, which means the entire query as a whole is now programmable to produce any type of deterministic immutable data you want straight from the blockchain.

Please go check it out, would love to hear feedback and potential ideas. Last time I had discussion here I got lots of great insights.

e7crfj6,PsyRev_,25,"Theorizing that TPTB are behind this doesn't do the full story justice. AXA, a large insurance corporation, are behind the fake users that started the whole thing about Roger last year.

AXA are the main actor behind Blockstream, the takeover of the Core dev team and the ownership of r/bitcoin, and they have stood to benefit from making Roger into a scapegoat as an elevated figurehead for BCH. When all he's done for BCH is actually just promote it on his site, and be very argumentative with 'figures' in the BTC crowd. He had nothing to do with the creation of BCH, in fact it took him a month after BCH was created to get on board and put his voice behind it, if I remember correctly. He saw it as the original bitcoin he'd been working so hard on, this is why he said in the rage vid that he'd worked hard on it. Not because he was behind it. And no, he clearly doesn't pump and dump the markets, he sits on his coins.

This is what's so crazy, that the lies of the smear campaign are this far removed from reality and yet some of these newcomers from the latest bubble just believe it anyway. In any case, even if Roger was involved in the creation of BCH, no big deal. But it does benefit AXA to try and make him seem like 'the BCH king'. It puts *all* the feelings and doubts people have about BCH behind one figurehead. Makes it very easy to FUD about BCH, and to oppose that BCH is the real bitcoin.

They made the decision to start the smear campaign against Roger because he owns bitcoin.com and r/btc, which makes him an easy figure to make prolific to anyone outside the BCH community, and shoot down. (Note: with open mod logs and lax rules on r/btc, meaning his ownership of the sub doesn't give him any power or ability to do anything). All the things in the past they smear him about, and the things that he do, really aren't particularly significant at all. Nobody has held against him that he sold firecrackers by mail before this smear campaign started, for example. That's just the top of the list, the list of things this smear campaign has made a mountain out of a molehill over is longer than this, but still actually only a handful of items.

Essentially they've created a delusional crowd-think about Roger. In the beginning the only users (on the various platforms the crypto community resides) that were spreading these smears were the fake users by AXA. I was watching a year ago when it started, all of the users on reddit that were smearing him and talking shit about him were already tagged on my RES (r/enhancement for those who don't know) as fake users, and were only posting UASF stuff and spreading general misconceptions before then. And since then, regular non-tagged users joined in, because they read these faked outrages by the fake users and interpret them as real users and real narratives, and believe it themselves because it's being repeated so much.

The best we can do about this is keep people aware that these are lies and exaggerations that are spread about him, while keeping a level-head about Roger. Don't worship him (not that anyone actually does, contrary to the narrative of the smear campaign), see him for what he is; a good contributor in the space, and still support him and see him as a regular human being. Because that's what he is, and he got caught up in the spotlight by these people. Us old timers (I'm /u/PsyRev from 2013-2015, I deleted my account but you can find me easily in the archives if you weren't around back then or don't recognize me) remember Roger Ver from r/bitcoin when he was promoting bitcoin and contributing to the space, and did a good job at it. Like many others. He's had a track record of having a good philosophy and ideals, and may not have the best soft skills. And that's who he is in the space. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. (Feel free to reply with more if I forgot anything).

I hope my comment has helped shed some light on this. And I hope I've given some ammo to others others who would like to strive and do the same and defend him as a regular person. The worst they'll do is make troll-arguments with you, and what you can do is target their strongest arguments (which aren't strong lol), this is the best way to argue. In the end I think we do bitcoin and the bitcoin community a great deal of good by weakening this delusional crowd-think. And fuck, if Roger needs a break.",2018-10-08 05:51:46

1\. The Instamine bug (and them keeping it):

&gt;First of all, the instamine. In the first day or two almost two million coins were mined. This would be bad enough if it had a supply like Bitcoin ranging in the 18 millions, but instead it has a total of 8 million mineable coins, which means that a quarter of the whole supply was mined by the founders because of a “technical error”. Considering the coin was two freaking days old, it was easy to restart it and fix the “bug"", but instead the founders decided to give themselves this cozy unofficial ICO

2\. The Masternodes controversity:

&gt;Moving on, we've got the “master nodes” system that holds 40% of the total supply, and nobody knows who owns these nodes, likely people close to the owners too. I suppose the function of these things is to offer mixing, completely centralized by default.

3\. The Marketing-Team:

&gt;In place of actual features Dash has an impressive marketing team that is working tirelessly to sell people canned air

There's a big controversity saying that the founders hold a majority of the voting power trough their Masternodes (if only for the Instamine amount they had) hence the network is likely fully under their control.

The thing is voting power is bound to big $$$ with a few individuals that hold most of the supply - that's never a good idea.

Nobody is limited from owning more then a single masternode. Theoretically a single individual can hold all Masternodes.

e7gidxk,shunyada,60,"This whole thread is just mind boggling.

So instead of a single BTC transaction you are suggesting:

1. Use a credit card, in which the credit card processing company collects 2-4%, always more than they give in cash back.
2. Sell Bitcoin on an exchange where you will most likely incur a transaction fee.
3. Withdraw USD from said exchange where you may get hit with a withdraw fee and wire transfer fee (Kraken)
4. Use another banking instrument to transfer USD to the credit card merchant processor before you incur  interest fees.
5. As we are in a bear market possibly incur loss of value from Bitcoin price decline much higher than the cash back %.

So a credit card processor, 3-4 Banks, and a crypto exchange involved instead of a crypto processor and 0-1 banks. WTF?

As a merchant who has accepted Bitcoin and Credit Cards since 2013 I can tell you that the ""hefty fee/spread"" charged by ""crappy bitcoin payment processors"" is less than 1/3 of what the credit card processors charge me. Also the merchant always pays the fees, not the user. Bitpay even provided free processing up until recently. Also many merchants like myself who accept Bitcoin never convert it to USD since they are such a small percentage of orders it's a great way to DCA in over time.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the prevailing arguments seems to be that the infrastructure just isn't there to support these types of payments and credit cards are better suited for such transactions. How will we get that infrastructure built out if no one supports merchants who actually accept Bitcoin by paying in Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious if you would say the same thing about lightning/liquid? How will adoption of any system happen if you tell people not to use crypto except as a store of value to be sold only when you need USD?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what Bitcoin is to you but to me it's always been an attempt to replace the greedy banking and middle men system with as close to peer to peer transactions as we can get. Seems like you guys just want to prop up the current middle men system till you can be the new middle men.

e7ihvem,DamonAndTheSea,55,"Heyoo.... I took a month off trading to do more interesting things and made sure not to check the price at all during my break (an exercise in self-control to say the least).   I am surprised, upon returning to the crypto milieu, that we're still above $6k.

[This chart I posted last month](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4JCUsjrc/),  showed 200MA acting as support on the 3d, and price moving in large cup formation.  So far, this formation has been [honored for the entire month.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/B9xCHOU0).  There is a historical prescient for this consolidation behavior - if we pull up the primordial BTC chart, [price consolidated on the 3d 200MA over the course of about 4 months in 2012 before the subsequent rally.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kb1ckheZ/)

In my view, the longer price marches along this cup formation, the greater the chance we'll finally see price move above 200MA on the daily, which has historically signaled the end of the preceding bear market.  We're [currently in a tight range](https://www.tradingview.com/x/IMZeKstf/), and if we see a strong impulse above $7400, I'll switch to dip buying mode.

There's of course a real chance, we break down from here.  If we pan out a bit, I see two possible long term price forecasts (both assume continuation of log adoption curve) --&gt; [CHART](https://www.tradingview.com/x/i8110Egi/)

Scenario 2:   If we move below $6k, I'm expecting it to bottom somewhere between $4.4k - $5.2k.  Both the long term trend line dating back to Aug 2015, and the [log trend line (seen in orange) intersect around $4.4k](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tSiW7e3r) and should act as support.  This would prolong the bear market another 6-8 months, pushing the potential for the next bull run in late 2020.

Scenario 1:   If we're able to maintain stability above the $6k range for the next few months, this will signal a market bottom allowing price to accelerate in late 2019.

I personally think we're likely to see scenario 2 unfold... but I've seen some compelling evidence to the contrary.  In particular, Bitcoin charter 'flibflib' has proposed some compelling evidence to suggest we're about to exit the bear market in this period.

e7hzt66,perry-d-astor,41,"At this point I hope that you realize what I put up there was saitire.

First a quick lesson 

Deep Web: Is the part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines, this includes databases that require a query in order to retrieve information from, anywhere you need to authenticate, etc. Basically places you can't get to through Google, this is estimated to consist of about 80% of the current internet, and most of it isn't anything interesting.

This deep web is often confused with the Dark Web. The Dark Web is technically a network of web servers and clients that cannot be accessed via a normal web browsers, and often requires a specialized client to access. Such as Tor or Freenet. 

Most ""Dark Web"" technologies are heavily concerned with privacy, anonymity and being untraceable, they accomplish this through various means which is outside of the scope of your question; however because these technolgies focus so much on being untraceable, being anonymous and being private they often attract people who would rather not be noticed by the law. Which can be beneficial if you live in a communist dictatorship where the government rewrites history and punish thought crime, but can also be not so good if for example the illegal things you want to do involved pictures of children being exploited for sex.

So in final answer there really is nothing special about the Dark Web vs the clearnet, there is more child porn on the Dark Web but pretty much everything else is the same. The sites that advertise hacker for hire, or hit man services are scams designed to separate the gullible from their bitcoin.

Hope I have answered your question.",2018-10-10 15:25:59

So he goes through all this trouble creating new bank accounts, takes his computer and gets it wiped, all trying to make sure they don't steal his identity.  In the meantime, he tells his wife about it who is SUPER pissed about the porn stuff and is talking about leaving him.

The man says to himself ""I wonder what life was like on earth before the war obliterated everything"" he ponders this on a daily basis through his routine boring life and likes to read history about the concept of ""government"" and how there was countries named United States, China, and Japan with unique cultures/ideneity behind it, he couldn't fathom the idea of a non materialistic lifestyle apparently the humans before were ""happy"" without concept need of spending. While waiting to meet an outlaw who has a 100BTC bounty(it goes up each season slightly)The man shakes his head and pulls out his Amazon™ kindle to read about history.


It all started when anarchists finally overthrew the government and everybody could live free. Everything was prosperous for a short term people though, no taxation, no laws. But once day when Jeff Bozos was the first declared quadrillion, the downward spiral began. There was a prior dispute over who violated the NAP(Non-aggression principle) because another Disney™ world was attacked by Mcdonald™ Airforce because Mcdonald™ accused the latest Avengers Infinity War X Star Wars 19 movie had soundwaves that entered Mcdonald™ property. Mcdonald™ has also currently a bigger standing army as Somalin children soldiers cost much less bitcoin than full fledge adults. This eventually escalated into a full world war when Jeff Bozo tried to buy the patent to being able to breathe. What happened was a full fledged war that wiped out 99.5% of humanity, those who could afford Space X rides were lifted onto mars to colonize it....
He who's name is Unit-2049(as everything else was too expensive and copyrighted) 5 minute lunch break was over, his job was to enforce for Gong Cha Corp™ private security they have gotten very powerful thanks to Gong Cha acquiring the rights to water. On a daily basis he wear's Arc'teryx Veilance™ Indisce Blazer which can go from a formal blazer to lapelless coat with wind proofing capabilities, breathable and water resistant when Gong Cha decides to use Oolong milk tea to replicated what rain was like on earth. He has a matching pair of Indisce pants. The Mionn jacket to keep him warm because it's always freezing as the heating companies don't allow public summers anymore. Finished off with his Guerilla Group holster which holds his Ninja stars. And his seque tote which carries his complimentary Gong Cha Corp Private Security™ MP5. No mortal man is allowed to leave the space station as all of them signed a contract at birth. 2049 walks outside to see nothing but bright and colorful neon signs, advertisments of pornography, anime, weapons, fast food and such he sees a bald man apporach him. The bald man seems to be wearing a unique jacket with 3 pockets in front, a bag slung behind him and colorful shoes. When he finally makes eye contact he steps forward and says ""I work for ACRONYM® we're trying to break out of this hell wanna join us?""
2049 then nods and says ""The future is now""

e7kq7xh,deadalnix,33,"&gt; That said I've been very critical of the way ABC acts with their upgrade proposals which leave zero room for discussions

To the contrary, we published timeline so that discussion would happen in a way that wouldn't be disruptive. The feature freeze was set Aug, 15. Bitcoin SV was announced Aug, 16.

I'm sorry but it is not possible to change everything at the last minute. It has nothing to do with being inflexible, but we have an ecosystem to support. No objection was formulated within the proper timeframe, and, to be 100% the objection formulated after that are mostly of the kind it's contentious (because we make it so).

The current upgrade contains numerous elements requested by 3rd parties - the same 3rd parties that try to paint ABC as inflexible and dictatorial now. Notably OP_CHECKDATASIG is nothing more than Andrew Stone's OP_DSV  after going through review and integrating feedback (You can subsequently verify that Andrew voted against OP_CDS to be implemented in BU). The malleability flags were a request from Tom harding (more specifically he asked for 4 of them, but only 2 could be implemented and tested properly in the timeframe we had). In fact, going full CTOR was a also a request from Tom Harding, ABC only proposed to remove TTOR and allow any ordering in Nov. nChain used to support these changes and you can find documents on their website in favor of both CTOR and OP_CHECKDATASIG from several month back.

It is simply not possible to cooperate productively if people are going to request things and then shoot you down when you do what they asked.

The most disappointing part in all of this is that this drama attract a ton of attention on actors that behave poorly, to the detriment of the ones doing the actual hard work. bitprim has been cooperating with ABC very nicely, has setup testnet for all the upgrades, including the initial one that created BCH. They've provided infrastructure for wallet, block explorer and various other services. They also implement their own node software. But you know what they aren't doing ? I think you do, and this why you haven't heard of them as often as other I mention in that post.

In any case, we are open for discussion about what should happen in May next year. The time to have this discussion is now. If you have something of interest to be included by then, I suggest you to get involved now. Join the workgroups, write a proposal for a spec, you'll discover that we are open for discussion. Provide feedback on ABC's proposals - we are desperate to get more. But if the plan is to not do so, and then complain in March that ABC is inflexible then yes, ABC will be inflexible. The feature freeze date for Next May will be Feb, 15. It'll come fast, so now is the time to get to work.",2018-10-11 23:23:30

e7m7c05,Agent_Orange7,590,"Unfortunately 1.21 jiggawatts is a unit of power, not a unit of energy, but if we assume you had a constant source of 1.21 jiggawatts to mine bitcoin with. According to [this](https://grisha.org/blog/2017/09/28/electricity-cost-of-1-bitcoin/) source, as of 28 September 2017 it took ~13000 kWh to mine a single bitcoin. 1.21 jiggawatts by definition comes out to 1.21 GWh every hour, or  1,210,000 kWh. So with a constant source of 1.21 jiggawatts, you could mine about 93 bitcoin every hour. At current prices, that comes out to 564,554 USD per hour. Backtracking through inflation to 1985 dollars, that comes out to 241,312.25 USD per hour.

Of course, if you were smart you would use your time machine travel to peak bitcoin price to sell your 1.21 jiggawatt bitcoins. At peak price of 19,783 USD/bitcoin, your 93 bitcoins per hour would sell for a cool 1,839,819 USD. That sheer amount of income would put you as the richest person in the world within a matter of a few years. Of course you would be crashing the market, but you could actually extract a very large amount of sales by time travelling back one day at a time to dump your bitcoins, so that you are selling again before the effects of your last sale (or indeed the sale itself) happened at all. Hopefully this would not create a universe destroying time paradox.

Of course, this doesn't account for the staggering amount of electricity you would need just to cool the vast number of poor graphics cards you are cruelly torturing to do this, you monster. Nor does it account for the construction costs, maintenance, and property taxes you would have to pay for your GPU torture gigafactory, which would dramatically cut into your profits.",2018-10-12 12:15:54

e7ktznt,OgdruJahad,138,"First and foremost the problem is that its entirely possible to get malware from legitimate sites, especially through advertising, its called malvertising. This happens from time to time even on 'safe' sites like I don't know maybe [the BBC and New York Times.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/16/major-sites-new-york-times-bbc-ransomware-malvertising) 

Second AV products do a lot of things, including detecting bitcoin miners on pages you visit. At the very least keep Windows Defender on. Also while effectiveness tends to vary, heuristics (in AV products) can sometimes block possibly malicious code even if its very new and hasn't been identified yet. 

Updates are also extremely important, if you don't update there is a chance of getting all kinds of nasties include remote code execution. This is especially true of Windows Updates, you don't have to install them immediately but try to install them soon. And with a remote code exploit, you don't even have to do much to get compromised, visiting a specially crafted site can sometimes be enough. 

You need to have a defense in depth approach, using something like a Javascript  blocker like Ublock Origin, updating things like your router and your PC and software like MS Office and VLC will go a long way to reduce the dangers of the bad guys. 


Also phishing is still remarkably effective even to this day, when you get a suspicious email to be from your Bank, credit card company, facebook etc.. Always be a little skeptical and if possible contact the company in question in a different way like using your phone. Also don't use any numbers in the email as they too could be compromised.

e7l1kik,onewalleee,79,"Hope my fellow Centipedes appreciate the music I decided to use 🎶

I spent many hours reviewing surrounding footage, reading eyewitness testimony, watching interviews, reading AntiFA after action reports, etc. I wanted to make sure I wasn't including ""questionable"" or ""borderline"" cases, where one could convincingly argue that AntiFA was merely acting in proportional self-defense against illicit violence. I may have made a mistake, but it is not for want of a good faith attempt. 

In every single case it was clear that at least one (often more) of the following criteria applied:

- prima facie unjustified, a person literally doing nothing wrong (most of the couple dozen attacks satisfy this criterion but proving it within the context of the video would have required lots of boring video no one would watch)
- people being cruelly beaten because they tried to stop a crime: either violence against another innocent or preventing a robbery 
- disproportionate force used against people who are not a threat, for example, folks on the ground covered up (even unconscious in one example) or running away

It's such a disturbing video. I've changed the minds of some normies with this. The problem of course is that it's hard to get people to watch a video when they know they won't like the implications.

For that reason I've also written up textual descriptions of some of them, particularly a subset of them that don't require any additional context to know they are absolutely unacceptable. People have a harder time ignoring a block of text than they do just refusing to click a link. 

These are just a few of the victims who are standing still or otherwise doing absolutely nothing threatening, or clearly no longer pose any threat (if they ever had) and are ambushed or assaulted for no reason:

- 0:28 - man in a red shirt holding a microphone and peacefully reporting. He is attacked by a terrorist wielding some sort of bludgeoning instrument. After he tries to run away, a horde of AntiFA terrorists try to stop him from escaping and someone strikes him with a flag pole.
- 0:46 - man is calmly speaking to a group of people while extinguishing a fire they started. Says he supports their right to protest but not lawlessness. Two AntiFA thugs sneak up behind him, steal his hat, and smack him (then attack his friend who tries to secure the property forcibly robbed from him)
- 1:24 - man is already unconscious and face down in the street. An AntiFA terrorist  hits him with a flag pole. (I remember from my research at the time that AntiFA militants who claimed to be there were justifying it by saying something to the effect of “this chud was yelling ‘build the wall’”)
- 1:45 - man in a green hat. His back his turned, his hands are up in a non-threatening way. He is asking police for help. A group of people attack him from behind. (This fellow is interesting because he's the only victim in the video that was attending an explicitly racist event. He's probably a POS. Despite that, he was _inarguably_ acting peacefully when they assaulted him from behind.) 
- 1:59 - guy in a red shirt. He is standing around peacefully talking to a group (asking people to calm down IIRC) when an AntiFA terrorist emerges from the ranks and ambushes him with a bike lock.
- 2:44 - man in a grey sweatshirt, having a peaceful discussion. AntiFA terrorist sneaks up behind him with a pole and attacks him.
- 3:17 - woman in a “Make Bitcoin Great Again” hat giving an interview to a journalist. AntiFA thug sneaks up and pepper sprays her at point blank range for no reason.

**We have a problem with them intentionally crippling the throughput on the base layer so that most traffic has to go through their shit on the second layer.  To ensure profits for themselves.**

Everything that’s been done to the Bitcoin block chain lately has led up to the creation of LN and subsequently Liquid. 

At the end of the day this is about making Blockstream money, and paying back their $151 million in investors.  

Literally every social and humanitarian goal that Bitcoin had (directly tied to a functional base Layer) has been sacrificed for this purpose. That’s what we have a problem with.

How the fuck did they even get $151 million in investors for a completely free, decentralized currency system in the first place? 

Well they had to find a way to monetize it. And the only way they could do that was to cripple it and force throughput through their products.   **You can’t make money off Layer 2 if Layer 1 works just fine, for free.**

e7orik7,WisePlagueisTheDarth,66,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

e7nd5hs,Twin_Spoons,36,"It's a common misconception that money is only doing something if it's being spent on consumer goods. As the subtitle to Wall Street 2 put it ""Money Never Sleeps"". 

If you give money to a poor person, they are likely to spend all or most of it on consumer goods/services. This is good for firms that make those goods or provide those services and for the people who work in them. 

If you give money to a rich person, they are likely to invest most of it. Having more investment in the economy makes it easier for firms to borrow money. This is especially good for new and innovative companies (and the people who work for them) that need investment to get started. These firms create jobs and also create the categories of consumer goods that people want to have in the first place (e.g. smartphones). 

The ideal economy involves a mix of investment and consumption, though it's difficult to tell exactly what that mix is. In my personal opinion, signs point to the US economy needing more consumption. These signs are:

1) Money has been systematically accumulating with the rich for a while now, so if you ever thought we were in balance before, we're definitely not in balance now. 

2) There's so much money looking to be invested that it's tending to be put towards more questionable ventures (think bitcoin, every possible Silicon Valley startup, housing and student debt)

3) Many Americans are so desperate for money to consume with that they have been consuming on credit: maxing out credit cards, using payday lenders, and going to Rent-a-Center type establishments.

You can't just look at a short period of time like a week and assume that two things are highly correlated in one way or another.

Especially when you are paying attention to only one of two factors. Just looking at the direction of the movement and not paying attention to the other factor; volatility %.

Bitcoins most volatile day this year is around 40%.  The stock markets most volatile day this year is around 4%. The fact that the ""correlated day"" had totally different percentage moves relative to their maximums this year shows that the correlation is **WEAK** at best. In other words the stock market had an unlikely 3-4 sigma event while Bitcoin only had a very likely 0-1 sigma event, which more or less implies its just noise since it could very well just be random chance too since the event happens so frequently.

This is actually giving me a ton of faith in crypto for this year. If ""that's all?"" for all the speculative weak hands to drop at the first hint of trouble in the traditional markets, most of that money is here to stay.

&gt;This paper investigates whether Tether, a digital currency pegged to U.S. dollars, influencesBitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices during the recent boom. Using algorithms to analyzethe blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturnsand result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1% of hours with such heavy Tethertransactions are associated with 50% of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64% of other top cryp-tocurrencies. The flow clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations inBitcoin, and suggests incomplete Tether backing before month-ends. These patterns cannot be
explained by investor demand proxies but are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesiswhere Tether is used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices.",2018-10-13 18:19:28

*  Miners that support the Nov15 HF could start voting for the SV features they support.  

* Miners that don't support the Nov15 HF (even if that miner will follow the hash power majority come Nov15), should start using BIP135 to vote for the Nov15 features it supports.  A vote FOR a Nov15 feature is basically saying ""I like the feature, but I want a different activation mechanism"".

If we see significant numbers of votes, especially a majority, it will be a strong signal that we should either stop the Nov 15 HF, or start BIP135 activation rather than the periodic HF afterwards (depending on what features are voted for).

**You don't need to run Bitcoin Unlimited to vote for these features (we just make it easy).  Just set the bits in your block's version field appropriately.  This can generally be done in the mining pool software**.

Peter Todd:

&gt;A fee that would be about $20 (1) for a typical transaction even if $10 million a day, or $3.65 billion a year, goes to miners keeping the network secure for everyone? I'd be very happy to be able to wire money anywhere in the world, completely free from central control, for only $20. Equally I'll happily accept more centralized methods to transfer money when I'm just buying a chocolate bar.

Mike Hearn:

&gt;I don't personally have any interest in working on a system that boils down to a complicated and expensive replacement for wire transfers. And I suspect many other developers, including Gavin, don't either. If Gavin decides to lift the cap, I guess you and Gregory could create a separate alt-coin that has hard block size caps  and see how things play out over the long term.

Gavin Andresen:

&gt;I really don't understand this logic. Yes, it is a fact of life that if you have a system where people are competing, the people who are less efficient will be driven out of business. So there will be fewer people in that business. You seem to be saying that we should subsidize inefficient miners by limiting the block size, therefore driving up fees and making users pay for their inefficiency. All in the name of vague worries about ""too much centralization.""

Mike Hearn:

&gt;The cost of a Bitcoin transaction is just absurdly low and will continue to fall in future. It's like nothing at all. Saying Bitcoin is going to get centralized because of high transaction rates is kinda like saying in 1993 that the web can't possibly scale because if everyone used it web servers would fall over and die. Well yes, they would have done, in 1993. But not everyone started using the web overnight and by the time they did, important web sites were all using hardware load balancers and multiple data centers and it was STILL cheap enough that Wikipedia - one of the worlds top websites - could run entirely off donations.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I could go on. But it's pretty clear that the assumption there was that Bitcoin would be pretty soon capable of and actually processing Paypal volume +. It's sad to see how far the aspirations of many Bitcoiners have fallen.

e7pxkyz,Jusherefordacrypto,37,"How about this for a change in perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Software development in blockchain is hard. Its very hard, its new, and much of the development is happening for the first time, ever. Blockchains like Bitcoin have some of the brightest minds in the world working on it, but guess what. Developments take a long time. Ethereum is another example.   
Rapid deployment of DApps exceeded the capacity of the development teams ability to upgrade the network. Scaling issues are ongoing, as are GAS fees for transactions that aren't basic logic. Lisk has a tech heavy team of developers, which should be celebrated by anyone financially invested into this project. I mean come on guys, they are one of the few teams to be in one central location and not scattered around the world in multiple time zones. Do you know how much productivity is gained by this? Let me tell you, it's a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Now speaking more of the financial side, Lisk has zero control over their coins price, and nor should they! Of course a coins economics and incentivisation is built into the underlying foundations of the protocol, we all know that, but they can't talk about it guys. Anyone who has read the news and studied this space knows the U.S has the entire industry on edge in regards to securities laws. Any project talking about their coins price is taking unnecessary risks. Go and study the Howey test and read some the U.S SEC statements on their website if you don't believe me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what about deliverables, well I'm not sure if anyone has downloaded Lisk Hub and used it, but this wallet is one of the best I have ever used. Sure its just a wallet right now, I get that, but just look at the effort that has gone into it. Why so much effort into a wallet? Because the team is building the foundations for what will become a turn-key product for users, developers, and investors. Software development in blockchain takes time guys. Especially when you're building an entirely new protocol, and one focused on Javascript as well. Could they communicate developments better? Sure! Does communication really change what the mission of what Lisk is trying to achieve? Not really. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you what Lisk is. Lisk is trying to position itself as the first credible blockchain protocol that is loved and cherished by all stakeholders. It doesn't want to be Ethereum, a niche and tech heavy project. It wants to be mainstream one day, which is why its doing everything so professionally and taking its time. Personally, I couldn't be more bullish on this project, as the projects that are building the ecosystem this well will be the ones that survive long term.

Before, it used to be the monarchy (or tribal councils in Africa, Native Americans, Aztecs etc) You see it in animal ecosystems like ants or bees. Even the tallest trees get the most sunlight and spread their roots the furthest.

Then democracy came about, and now people are calling for more political reform. It's an ongoing process.

Society has progressively advanced living standards - both material and nonmaterial (healthcare etc). 4 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since the early 90s.

Sure it's harder for a man to support a single family on one wage compared to the 50s in the West. But the average job is now an office based job rather than a physical one and women now earn money too. Also you're not just limited to your town/college network anymore. You have the internet and far more flexibility to move elsewhere to excel in your niche. So in a roundabout way it can be easier to find your true purpose and make good money from that.

Yes, the Republicans in the short term are being regressive. However, around the world there are increasing talks of a basic income which is gaining momentum amongst major left wing parties in Europe, such as Labour in the UK.

We are increasingly moving away from a debt laden economy of artificially high asset prices so there will be plenty of opportunities for millennials to buy at the bottom and make a good start in life which is admittedly something Gen X'ers found hard.

Political change is so slow, it barely has an effect on our life. The effect it takes to show is often 10+ years and political change lags behind technological and social change. The best thing we can do is to control what we can - ourselves. We can do so much to change our life in just one year and certainly a ton in a few. We should work to improve ourselves (via education, networking, self-improvement, crowd-sourcing knowledge - Reddit is amazing for this) to stay ahead of the social/technological curve (like how there was a hubbub about Bitcoin 5 years ago here) to carve out our own corner. We never had as much individual agency to do this than at any point in history, ever!

e7rdt4f,drysart,68,"The ability to exploit arbitrage in bitcoin isn't really tied to how fast a bitcoin transaction clears.  It's tied to how fast an *exchange* transaction clears, since that's where the spread you're taking advantage of exists: in the exchange rates.

Basically, you need to have accounts at several different exchanges, and those accounts need to carry balances of both bitcoin *and* dollars.  Then, when you see an arbitrage opportunity between two exchanges, you simply realize it by, say, buying bitcoin on one exchange and selling it on another; using the balance carried at each exchange.  The only transactions being done are the buy and sell at each exchange, *nothing happens over the bitcoin network itself* so the speed of a bitcoin transaction is moot.

The net result is that if you add up the balances of bitcoin and dollars across those two exchange accounts, you'll now have slightly *more* of one of the two types of currencies than you did when you started, it's just that it'll be distributed across the exchange accounts differently.  Then, outside of the arbitrage opportunity window, you can re-balance the exchange accounts more or less at your convenience.

An exchange frontrunning your trades is a concern, yes; but really only if they're *also* running arbitrage; because in and of itself, a single exchange can't take your arbitrage opportunity away through frontrunning.

Bob: You should buy Barbie dolls!

Jane: Why? I don't like dolls anymore.

Bob: ...because they are a store of value! If you buy them, your purchasing power will be transferred from the money you used to pay for them into the Barbies themselves!

Bob: ...uh... because the Barbies might go up in value increasing your purchasing power!

Jane: That sounds like investment advice. If I'm looking to profit, surely I'd judge these Barbies against all the other vehicles of profit there are out there... e.g. stocks, property &amp; doge coin.

Bob: ... but Barbies have had a great history of going up in price!

“There’s clearly a lot of homework going on. The White House in particular seems to be thinking about what it means to have 80 percent of bitcoin mining taking place in China and a majority of Ether mining taking place in China.

“When you look at XRP, there is no mining, so from a foreign-control aspect or from an environmental aspect, XRP is a very different beast. And in conversations we’ve had with the administration, they seem to get that and think that might matter.”

e7rkhjy,Ttatt1984,30,"An interesting application of her work would be in creating a post-quantum Bitcoin blockchain where the block chain itself is of a quantum architecture.

Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but the current bitcoin block chain takes up a great deal of memory, more so since it is decentralized and every node and miner needs to download a complete and current copy of the block chain to participate in the bitcoin network. 

Her work could potentially achieve two things at once: reduce the size of block chains, perhaps then allowing it to scale faster for increased adoption, while at the same time securing the network from a 51% attack or any other attack to its security. The current fear is that one day a quantum computer will be able to crack the bitcoin block chain. Her work, IMO, could also work as a way to prevent that from happening by upgrading bitcoin’s hashing algorithm from Sha-256 to something like LWE. Essentially, bitcoin could be made more secure, the blochchain size gets reduced, and verification and confirmation of transactions can be done without having to scour the entire quantum-proof block chain for proof that it did what it did. We can trust it because the algorithm itself proves that it did. ",2018-10-15 04:46:36

Let's say that each car drives 100 km per day. So total consumption =

10kWH * 365 * 2100000 = 7665000000 kWH. That's 7.665 TWh.

1. The moving around of lumens he mentions, was done by people that SDF distributed lumens to, through the bitcoin giveaway for example.
2. Inflation is a protocol level function. The protocol has no idea if lumens are ""in circulation"" or not so yes it applies to all lumens in existence.
3. SDF said from the beginning that it would use the lumens it got from inflation for its operational budget. Keep in mind that SDF is a non-profit. The amount of lumens that SDF has doesn't make anyone personally more money. It just allows SDF to do more.  I would think lumen holders would want this. It seems good for SDF to have enough resources to contribute the ecosystem/network and to carry out its mission.

According to TV 2, the police received tips that the 24-year-old exchanged the crypto currency bitcoin in a ""big cash"" before being killed in an apartment in Majorstuen in Oslo.

&amp;#x200B;

Several people in deceased's friend circle tell VG that deceased did invest in the crypto currency and that he should have taken a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

According to VG's sources in the deceased environment of friends, the 24-year-old has earned a million on bitcoin.

( 1 usd = 8.2 nok. So the media is right to say he made millions, but they are talking about million in NOK, what is 

equal to around 121.5K USD)

&amp;#x200B;

The closest knew that he had earned significant sums on the bitcoin, but none of the people he lived with as far as I know that he had taken out an amount lately, says a friend to VG.

&amp;#x200B;

According to TV 2, the police are aware that big amouth of fiat cash has been kept in the apartment and that the police are now working to map this.

&amp;#x200B;

""We are familiar with the case is bitcoin related, but at this moment we will not provide any more information about the investigation""said Grete Lien Metlid, The Head of Joint Unit for Intelligence and Investigations in the Oslo Police District.

&amp;#x200B;

NRK writes that one of the police theories is that the unknown perpetrator entered the apartment through a window to rob some money

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, there must have been a bloody battle where the 24-year-old was stabbed more than 20 times. after the NRK is informed.

&amp;#x200B;

deceased found in the living room.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday at 12 o'clock the 24-year-old was found knife injured by a roommate. The AMK center was notified. The apartment wall lays ""wall to wall"" with ""Majorstuen school"", and the roommate have climbed over the wall and into the schoolyard and asked for help in the middle of the schoool break. Witnesses (staff from the school) have described him (the guy who ask for help) as bloody and ""white in mask/face"". (probably have tried to save he's life and got blood on hes hands)

&amp;#x200B;

The staff at the school joined the roommate to the apartment block, and in the apartment was faced with a terrible sight.

&amp;#x200B;

According to VG's information, the 24-year-old was found with many knife sticks/stabs in the living room of the apartment. The police describe the scene as ""demanding"".

&amp;#x200B;

No one is so arrested or suspected.

&amp;#x200B;

Examining escape routes.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday morning there is still big investigation activity in the apartment. On Wednesday afternoon and evening, careful investigations were made of possible routes for a potential perpetrator.

&amp;#x200B;

 All these four roads are now being investigated intensely by the police:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Through the main entrance. To enter the apartment, first enter a door that goes to the backyard of Arbo street 2, and then enter the door to Arbo street 2 b

&amp;#x200B;

2) Over a wall separating the garden patch behind the apartment building from the schoolyard to Majorstuen School

&amp;#x200B;

3) Over a fence in the backyard

&amp;#x200B;

4) Through two gates that allow you to enter the back garden from the road outside the building. These gates have all the residents keys to.

&amp;#x200B;

We are concerned with where a possible person has come to the apartment and where the person has left. We are very concerned about it. All inputs and outputs are important for the police and further observations here Monday morning, says police inspector Grete Lien Metlid at Oslo Police District (says) to VG.

e7zjxom,leon_oswald,40,"#moon math time!

I just did some napkin math in reference to the new Fidelity announcement and the numbers are astronomically high.

Fidelity has about [26.7million accounts](https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/fidelity-by-numbers/overview)

An avg account balance for people with both IRA and 401k (or 403b) is about [$300k](https://www.fidelity.com/about-fidelity/employer-services/fidelity-announces-q1-2018-retirement-data).

Last year, [JP Morgan claimed](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) $6 billion in net inflows since 2009 has resulted in a market cap of $330 billion.

If they were to invest just 0.25% into crypto, that would result in $64,500 per BTC!

26,700,000 accounts x (0.25% of $300,000) = $20 billion inflow

((inflow * JPM ratio)+(current market cap))/(BTC in circulation)

(($20 billion * 50) + ($117 billion)) / 17.3 million) = **$65,000 per BTC**

I'm sure my math is wrong but I'm a little to drunk to see where.

Edit: Here's some slightly lower altitude moon math. Let's ratchet that JPM ratio down to 15, and lower the avg account value from 300k to 100k, bump up the investment to 0.35%. That would still put us at about $15k per BTC. That's still pretty good.",2018-10-18 16:54:06

e80bfyb,mrstickball,149,"TL;DR:

The US is pulling out of a rule that gave Chinese companies massive subsidies that allowed them to ship packages to the US at rates that American small businesses could not hope to compete with. If you've ever seen a product with free shipping and a too-good-to-be-true price, this is the rule that allowed such things to exist. Chinese companies could ship from China to the US for less than an American could ship to a buyer inside of the US, which killed businesses such as mine.

The left will take the laws as being bad for consumers (since prices will go up on lots of cheap items via E-bay/Amazon), but the reality is that this subsidy was hurting the US small business as well as USPS. I've done international shipping, and the cheapest prices I was able to negotiate was about $6.5/kg from Shenzhen, and these shippers were getting stuff into the US for a fraction of that. It was and is disgusting. This is by far the best thing Trump has done, and even Obama's administration was begging for this rule to be rescinded.  


(if you want the backstory on how it killed my actual business):  


I invented a product for the Bitcoin industry, as well as sold goods in the US that I produced in China (like many others). It was a great business, and I and others did well at it. Then one year after the Chinese New Year Shutdown (around 2014), a vast number of trading centers began listing the product I developed, as well as other products I was selling in the US at approximately 1/3 the cost with free shipping. Essentially, they began to sell direct at the same price I was wholesaling at with a 100pcs minimum buy. I went from about $5,000 a week down to about $50 a week, and ended up liquidating my inventory at cost. My story isn't dissimilar from many others.

e80da12,NickWoolsey,82,"In regards to the general situation on Reddit: There are a lot of young people, and a lot of people with agendas. It's a bit tedious. 

The fact that you watch videos on the Ethereum Channel is pretty awesome! I'm learning to code so that I can start to understand all this stuff. 

Lots of crypto projects will fail. The good ones will roll out useful products and services. I personally believe that businesses will drive adoption. Crypto will offer corporations ways to streamline their operations and increase their profits, but only if/when their customers pay with crypto. They'll convince their customers to pay with crypto by offering loyalty points or savings. (BTW: Crypto doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better than Visa and Mastercard, which have big issues and the only reason they've been widely adopted is lack of competition).  

All of that will take a couple more years. Businesses will need access to crypto-solutions that save them money, and customers will need access to easy and cheap ways to convert to crypto. 

Cell phones were invented in the 1940s. It took 50 years for adoption to start becoming mainstream. 5 years ago, very few people had heard of Bitcoin. While many people say, ""what's taking so long!?"" I say, ""wow this shit is happening fast!!!!"" 

As for your final comment: I don't particularly expect crypto to improve the lives of average people in rich countries. I think it will have a bigger positive impact on the world's poorest people, which was true with the Internet. That's mostly a hopeful guess. 

And back to your main question, ""does anybody care about the distributed nature of crypto?"" Personally, no. I think the problem is that many people are only concerned with how distributed any system is, and they've forgotten why that mattered in the first place. I am happy to have a middleman if that middleman is providing me with a good service. I only care about whether the end result improves my life or the world somehow. Distributed could just mean poor people getting screwed over by a bunch of random greedy Reddit trolls, instead of the usual ultra-wealthy. Why would that be better? ",2018-10-19 02:20:03

Bitcoin hit its $19800 ATH on December 17th, 2017.
 
In 2014, bitcoin’s yearly lows were $340 - or almost exactly $5900 in today’s prices – up until Oct 4th, 2014, when it breached $5800 and sold off to the equivalent of $4700 in 2 days (later bouncing back to $7100).
 
There are 309 days in between Nov 30th, 2013 and Oct 4th, 2014.
 
In 2018, bitcoin’s yearly low is $5800. Today’s date is October 18th, 2017, which is exactly 305 days since December 17th, 2017.
 
309 days after the 2017 ATH would be October 22nd, 2018, in 4 days.

The good news is, if we are above $5800 in 5 days, we'll *officially, finally* be higher than 2014 in terms of % ATH yearly low!

We don’t usually rate sidechains separately from the cryptocurrency they’re intended to work with. Normally, we consider them to be part of the main project. And in this case, OmiseGo could be considered part of Ethereum.
We make an exception in this case because OmiseGo’s design is so unique. So we’ve decided it makes more sense to treat it as a separate, independent project that happens to use Ethereum as a settlement network.
The folks behind OmiseGo have done away with the Proof-of-Work (PoW) approach that was — and still is — the big pitch behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead, OmiseGo replaces Proof-of- Work with something called the Plasma Network.
Plasma is basically a plain-vanilla Proof-of-Stake approach in which the more OmiseGo (OMG) tokens a person holds, the more likely he or she is to become a validator on the network.
For instance, if you hold 10% of the total OMG supply in your wallet, you will get to produce 10% of the blocks on the network.
But OmiseGo’s version of this design CAPS the number of validators that can be active at any one time.

This helps speed transactions. Because if only a relatively small number of people can validate and write new blocks, the network can run a lot faster.
Is this new or innovative? Not exactly. Delegated-Proof-of-Stake networks are based on the same principle. EOS, for example, has only 21 block producers. NEO currently only has nine.
How many validators will OMG have? They’re still trying to figure that out.
How OmiseGo uses Ethereum
OmiseGo uses Ethereum as a kind of backup. Suppose conflicts appear on the OmiseGo network — such as a consensus failure, or an attack by a malicious actor.
Solution: The network can always fall back to a previous state recorded on the Ethereum ledger. Like losing the last Word file you were working on ... and then restoring the file you had on a backup disk or in the cloud.
This can come in handy. Especially when some hacker exploits an undiscovered bug in the code, something that actually happened to Ethereum in 2016. There then ensued a massive hack and theft, but there was no pre-established way to roll back the clock on the network.
When Ethereum developers finally decided to force the network to reverse transactions, it ended up fragmenting the community. In fact, it’s because of this that we have two versions of Ethereum today: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
By using Ethereum as its settlement, the OmiseGo network effectively avoids these issues.
Sidechains on top of sidechains
Ethereum is the base settlement blockchain. Think of it as the ground floor.
Then, independent chains like OmiseGo are built on top of Ethereum. That’s the second floor. Additionally, other smaller ledgers can also be built on top of OmiseGo, a third floor. OmiseGo uses somewhat different terminology to say the same thing:
Root Chain: The Ethereum Proof-of-Work settlement ledger.
Parent Chain: The independent OmiseGo blockchain on the Root Chain Child Chain: Other, smaller blockchains on the Parent chain
The whole purpose behind this three-tiered design: Speed, speed and more speed:

By itself, even at max capacity, Ethereum is lucky to do 15 transactions per second.
OmiseGo will probably do a couple thousand at most, although the precise number is not yet known.
Then, the child chains will probably also do a few thousand transactions a second.
By themselves, these numbers still don’t come anywhere near the hundreds of thousands (let alone millions) of transactions per second needed to support mainstream applications.
But multiplied out, they may just do the trick.
For example, let’s say ...
Three of Ethereum’s 15 transactions per second represent OmiseGo Parent chain settlements ...
Each of these represent 2,000 Parent Chain transactions ...
And each of the Parent Chain transactions, in turn, represent 2,000 Child Chain transactions.
Do the arithmetic: 3 × 2,000 × 2,000 = a robust 1.2 million transactions a second! A single, decentralized global
crypto and fiat exchange network ...
Now, here’s where OmiseGo really stands out from the legions of other third-generation cryptocurrencies.
It’s engineered from the ground up to be interoperable:
First, the OmiseGo blockchain will be able to “talk” to other distributed ledgers in the crypto universe.
Second, and more importantly, it will also be able to interact directly with the legacy, bricks-and- mortar financial system.
This will be done by creating digital versions of U.S. dollars, euros and other fiat currencies that are backed 100% by bank deposits.
Once created, these digital versions of fiat currencies can then be used to buy and sell crypto peer-to-peer, without going through a cryptocurrency exchange.
Ultimately, OmiseGo wants to make buying crypto as simple as downloading a wallet to your smartphone, and funding it with a credit card. OmiseGo would then credit your wallet with fully collateralized digital fiat tokens. And you will be able to use those tokens to buy crypto or other fiat currencies right on the same network.
If they’re successful, the end result could be revolutionary: A global decentralized crypto and fiat exchange network. A platform that could thoroughly disrupt international banking, currency dealers, and cryptocurrency exchanges as we know them today.
Ambitious? Absolutely!
Possible? Too soon to say. So before you get carried away and load up on OMG, a word of caution: OmiseGo is still very early in development. It’s so early, in fact, that we found a host of critical design decisions yet to made. For example:
How many validators will the network will use? (Remember, the number is capped.)
What will the fee structure be? OmiseGo developers eschew Ethereum’s complicated fee structure, but have yet to come up with a serviceable alternative.
What about enforcement? What happens if a validator breaks the rules and tries to cheat?
Where’s the cool wallet feature that allows anyone with a credit card to buy crypto seamlessly? Still to come.
Summarizing our sub-indexes:
Technology: OmiseGo is basically a plain vanilla Proof-of-Stake coin. But it gets solid points for its emphasis on interoperability — not just with other cryptos, but with the legacy financial system. This is what’s needed for ordinary people to embrace Distributed Ledger Technology in massive numbers never seen before. OmiseGo’s Weiss technology grade: Excellent.
Adoption: The coin is quite popular and has some industry heavyweights working on it. End-user popularity and developer support are excellent. That said, this project is still in its very early stages. Plasma, for example, is mostly a concept with little actual implementation. OmiseGo has also missed several preset development deadlines, which weighs on its adoption metrics. Weiss Adoption score: Fair.

Technology/Adoption: Combining Tech and Adoption: B.

Investor Risk/Reward: There was a lot of investor enthusiasm for OmiseGo last year, but noticeably less in 2018. That probably reflects growing disappointment as the project fell behind schedule. In terms of recent price action, the token has been more stable than most other altcoins, but also with more limited upside. 

Weiss risk/reward grade: D.

e80cag0,SatOhShe_KnockAMoto,33,"So I have never actually bought anything off of the darkweb and I am not active on it, but I know enough to answer this question; in fact, anyone who has actually done anything illegal on the darkweb is probably aware enough of their privacy that they would never answer this question. Now I think mainstream awareness about the darkweb, like mainstream awareness about pretty much any esoteric topic, is quite flawed. Asking the public about weight loss will give you a few legitimate answers hidden amidst a plethora of bullshit. The public idea of the darkweb is the same—search it up and you’ll likely get more clickbait than real information. In fact, just like most doctors aren’t really experts on weight loss, most IT workers don’t know much at all about the darkweb. So let me illustrate the public conception of the darkweb and compare it with the reality:
  ***
# What the Public Thinks
  ***
So I don’t know very well what the public in general thinks, but here’s what I saw in a movie:
  ***
He’s wearing a black hoodie, in the dark of his basement (because everybody uses computers in dark basements while wearing hoodies, right?), typing furiously into a laptop computer (because he happens to make thousands online yet has no need for a desktop), selling jailbait, drugs, or viruses to some random guy on the internet. He goes out only to use public computers and he’s always wearing his black hoodie even though it makes him look awkwardly suspicious. Nobody sees his face. He hires a contract killer to stalk out his internet enemies and steal their data by breaking into their house, shooting them, dismantling their desktop towers, and ripping out the motherboard even though what he actually wants is the hard drive. The cops then catch the criminal and he engages in a high-speed chase (run, run, if you can, you can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!) and somehow escapes the police and is living a life of luxury with crack and hookers on some tropical island.
  ***
I think the public believes at least one part of this story accurately describes the lives of most darkweb users. But it’s not true.
  ***
# What it Really is
  ***
First, I need to define things for you because I’m pedantic. The surface web is everything a search engine can find. The deep web is everything a search engine cannot find (search engines can only click links, so anything behind a paywall is deep web). Darknets are basically the networking technology that enable darkwebs (I won’t go into much technical detail here, but other than Tor there are other services like I2P and freenet), and darkwebs are the actual content on thee darknets.
  ***
Also, just take everything here with a grain of salt, because it’s just my experience and may not be completely correct or all-inclusive.
  ***
So assuming that you people are more interested in the illegal uses of the darkweb, let’s start with a more mundane portrayal of illegal darkweb users:
  ***
First off, most real darkweb users usually won’t wear hoodies unless it’s cold, because they’re actual human beings who wear hoodies because they need to survive, not because they need to look cool like some actor in some bullshit movie about the darkweb. Also, I’m quite sure that not all of them like black. This paragraph is simply here for the idiots who think that the stuff in the movies is real.
  ***
In respect to the demographics of darkweb users, I can’t really say that most users are geographically located anywhere, because they are quite scattered out, but almost all darkweb users are in nations that have a good percentage of internet users. It’s reasonably common to see users who claim to be from Nigeria, but it would be uncommon to see a user from somewhere like the DRC. Most users don’t mention their location more specifically than country. From my understanding, the majority of illegal users are well-educated males between their mid-teens and their late 40s, and they are overwhelmingly South Asian, or White. Note that this is just the number of users; if we were to question who owns most of the wealth on the darkweb, then it would be a hard question to answer (I would say Latin Americans own the wealth, but that’s just my intuition and I can’t prove it).They are disproportionately educated in the IT field, but users could hold diverse occupations, from athletes to lawyers, and I would estimate that about half of all users are not formally educated in any IT field (which also makes them less obvious suspects).
  ***
Now before we talk about what most darkweb users are like specifically, we must draw a distinction between buyers, goods sellers, hosts, service sellers, and legal users. The host is the one managing the operations of the website, and the police will always come after him first. Goods sellers sell things like drugs, viruses, and whatnot, and their operations are usually (so far as I can tell) mainly on the internet, with few physical interactions. Police usually come after them next, but whether they are actually caught or not really depends on the severity of their actions (did they ship illegal substances internationally, was the good legal in either the home country or destination country, etc.). Understand that it takes large numbers of highly-paid, well-trained professionals and lots of time to catch people on the darkweb, so the police might just let smaller goods sellers off the hook instead of wasting millions engaging in some global wild goose chase. Service sellers sell things like bitcoin mixers (which scramble peoples’ bitcoin so it is harder to track: instead of seeing that you sent the BTC to a drug seller, the forensics see that you sent it to a bitcoin mixer) as well as contract work like hacking or killing. The contract killers are high-priority targets for police, but the people running the bitcoin mixer and other benign services are not. Buyers just buy goods and services, and police do not come after them (usually) unless they commissioned a contract killer. Also, you should note that legitimate contract killers are rare. In fact, they are so rare that some people speculate over whether there are really contract killers on the internet. And you can’t even screen a contract killer like you would any other prospective job candidate because nobody is going to tell you about how they murdered their previous victims. So maybe contract killers are unicorns, I don’t really have the experience to tell you. But I can certainly say that people have gotten in trouble before for purportedly hiring a contract killer, and some cases involve dead people, so maybe there really are. And lastly, there are the legal participants, people who just come to the forums to talk about shady stuff. I don’t think the government can successfully prosecute most of these legal participants unless they confess to have actually done shady things. I myself am one of these legal participants, and I was just interested in knowing what the darkweb was like, so I talked to people on forums and browsed the listings and talked with merchants and buyers and website operators.

**CONTINUED IN COMMENTS BELOW DUE TO CHARACTER LIMIT**",2018-10-19 02:07:03
e80cbkh,SatOhShe_KnockAMoto,33,"So far as I can tell, most darkweb users have multiple computers that they use for different tasks, both legal and illegal, in order to maintain anonymity. For example, they might have one computer (which usually looks pretty inconspicuous and might be high-end or not depending on whether they are a gamer) for everyday tasks like email and whatnot, while they may have another computer (this one usually is not high-end because they’re not doing anything hardware intensive) for buying things on the darkweb, while they may have another computer for selling things on the darkweb; having multiple machines helps decouple each of their online identities from each other—although it does not provide complete protection from the authorities, it might just make it slightly more annoying for authorities to connect the dots. Lots of darkweb users change their physical location a lot for anonymity purposes, so they might use laptops or public computers for this purpose; otherwise they mostly use desktops. They try to change their way of communicating online (their wording, grammar, etc.) to make it harder for forensic linguists to catch them (you wouldn’t believe some anecdotes people have on the darkweb about forensic linguists).
  ***
Most website hosts are crazy about anonymity. They usually have super high-end equipment to handle hardware pressure from doing website-related stuff. They have an “office” which is somewhat far away from their residence. At this “office”, they store their servers and other equipment needed for their occupation. They usually also have a system in place to help them know if the police come to their “office”. Some of them bolt off to another nation at that point, while some of them turn themselves in. As far as I know, most website hosts see their downfall when their website grows so much that they need to hire other people, and these people then somehow compromise security. I can’t remember which site, but there was one darkweb site that was brought down by an undercover cop who became trusted in the community and convinced the website owner to let him host the website after an attack brought things down. People traced it and found out that he was hosting the website in his office, and amidst speculations that he was a cop, something happened, and the website disappeared.  I think it was seized by the FBI.
  ***
Most goods sellers have large-scale operations that benefit from being online. Why do they benefit from being online? Well, selling it to physical people instead of an online persona makes it by far easier for the police to catch the producer. One problem with this, however, is that people on the internet expect higher quality and are not necessarily going to pay more—this is because there is far more competition for online drug trading, so people have come to expect higher quality and cheaper prices. I guess you can say that the darkweb is responding to consumerism. I kid you not, I have seen people claiming to sell 100% pure and organic cocaine. So even though profit margins on the darkweb are lower than in the nearest big city for most merchants, it’s often worth it because the police are less likely to catch them, and they don’t have to deal with the lowlife in their city (less profit is better than getting shot or stabbed to death).
  ***
Most contract killers (remember that I’m just getting this info from anecdotes) on the internet are apparently far better than local contract killers. People on forums have claimed that most local contract killers (the kind who deal with their employer in person) just walk up to their quarry and stab them or shoot them without much forethought. These sorts of people must be total idiots and it surprises me that not all of them are in jail yet. These are the kinds of people that would take $500 to kill a person. People on the darkweb that I have talked to claim that these people are the worst people to hire, and that you should hire a professional contract killer off the darkweb instead. Apparently most of these professional contract killers cost anywhere from $50,000 to $1 million or more, but they are far more reliable. They seem to use less obvious methods and are much more prudent. One anecdote I remember, and which I honestly think is fake, involves a killer who got access to the water pipes going into the house of a high-profile person (at least one person was always awake inside, so breaking in was not an option) during a period when there was less security around the house. He apparently poisoned the water through the pipes, which ended up killing him. The doctors somehow concluded it was due to a poor diet. I don’t know how the others in the house did not die, which is why I think the story is fake.
  ***
Also, don’t believe everything you see on the darkweb because (surprise!) people want to scam you. I once saw a “crowdfunded hitman” site that claimed that people collectively laid down $1.2 million bitcoin to murder Obama. In reality, the guy who owns the website probably just wrote $1.2 million even though he got a measly $400 or whatever.
  ***
And also, I have to clarify a few things about child pornography. I’ve seen some evidence that it is one of the least-traded things on the darkweb. In fact, most people on the darkweb seem to be repulsed by it, and quite a few sites have rules against it. The majority of trading volume on the darkweb is drugs. So really, the public idea that darkweb = child porn is wrong, and it should be darkweb = drugs. And I don’t even think there is a place on the darkweb to buy or purchase humans, so I can say with certainty that human trafficking makes up very little trading volume on the darkweb. After the drug trade, illegal financial trade is the largest, and this includes stolen bank account information, credit cards, fraudulent financial instruments, counterfeit money/gold, and a host of other illicit items.
  ***
I definitely know that some people use the darkweb because they live in repressive countries, but I haven’t interacted much with these people. Honestly, a few forums I have seen are not even in English, so it would be hard for me to get in tough with them. 43 percent of stuff on the darkweb is not illegal, and at least a million people a day access hidden services, so we can safely say that a few hundred thousand of these repressed users access the darkweb every day.
  ***
In any case, the days of centralized darkweb websites are over. The Silk Road was the zenith of centralized darkweb marketplaces, and it had a monopoly. After it fell, multiple smaller websites rose in its place, each with better security; some, for example, used Monero to make transactions harder to trace (churning and tumblers make it nearly impossible to find the original owner). However, none have lasted more than a few months, and vendors are transitioning to selling their items on P2P decentralized marketplaces. And a lot of things are invite-only, so you need to already have contacts.
  ***
I don’t really know what else to write because I cannot think of anything now, but if I think of anything I will add it in another comment. Also, just remember that what I wrote here is not gospel. I have merely learned this through personal experience and asking around; I am in no way affiliated to this, and I am neither a researcher nor a cybersecurity expert.

e83b2v0,gofuckadick,48,"The tsuki project specifically warned users not to commit suicide, and it died out sometime last year as well (I believe the FBI got involved, but don't quote me on that), so I'm not so sure that's it. I don't know what cult the LAOP is referring to, but it's all a bit too far fetched. Seems like either he's being taken for a ride or we are. *Nobody* can realistically control the spread of information, like he says about their ability to keep it out of the media. Most investigative journalists would never back down that easily - a cover-up is basically crack for them.

He also describes (in a comment) a self replicating trojan with a main control panel to monitor all aspects of every computer that it gains access to - well, they just don't work like that. If it was that easy then why isn't [every virus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_viruses_and_worms) able to do it? He's literally just describing a long dead script kiddy's wet dream virus called [Sub7](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7) that you can download from ""h4cker"" sites since 2004 - or some other variant - that wouldn't actually be reliable, if it worked at all. It's essentially remote administration, which is *really* locked down nowadays. He also mentions a program that the super hacker creates to automatically try inputting mass amounts of known user credentials, and then draining money from accounts that work - which, once again, if it was that easy then you would see reports of it happening *all the time*. It rarely actually happens, and has never successfully been done within a financial system that I know of, mainly for two reasons. First, there are a *ton* of protections against brute force attacks like that. Second, *money is trackable*. Unless he *only* stole bitcoin, then he would need offshore accounts and a way to clean it for this to be true. Not impossible, but pretty complex and not really worth the risk. 

I'm not saying it's definitely not true, just that he's talking about a cult-leading psychopathic millionaire hacker with unparalleled computer access and connections, who thrives on watching people's reactions to their lives being destroyed through their webcam, and can find and intimidate anyone ""from a username."" So... yep. I've seen that movie before too. He says the right things to make his exploits sound plausible technologically, but it's fantasy - like if he said instead that the guy is an expert assassin who became a serial killer, that loves watching people die and can take anyone down with his bare hands. Could it be a real thing? Yeeeeeaaaaah, maybe. 

Edit: clarification.

Edit2: actually - LAOP stated one of the guys is from the Netherlands. It *was* revealed that the creator of tsuki project was Dutch. He was also 17. So. Yeeeeeaaaaah.

Edit3: d'oh -

&gt;Ivan has hacked into my computer on multiple occasions and demanded that I allow him to access it through TeamViewer at any time.

And

&gt;Markus was required to allow Ivan to access his computer at any time over TeamViewer.

*Why does the super hacker need them to give access through TeamViewer?* What about his remote control trojan? 

If he's real, then the guy most likely manipulated LAOP into believing he's an expert hacker with fake screenshots and details.  There *are* sites that compile lists of unsecured webcams/usernames/passwords/emails/credit card and social security numbers/etc - I've seen a few with tens of thousands of entries being sold. He probably came across one and convinced LAOP that he hacked them. He likely knows how to install a keylogger and use google, but he's definitely not capable to the extent LAOP thinks. Either way I'm sure the FBI would love to find out.",2018-10-20 08:30:16

e83de2m,Ladylarunai,40,"Some guy on youtube named Noncompete argues that all of video games failures are the result of Capitalism, that Capitalism itself only has two methods of increasing profits, that DLC, DRM, Microtransactions, Streaming, poor treatment of workers and anti piracy are all measures in one of those two ways, argues that marxism and unions are the only solution to making games and or gaming better and ends with a gamedrop.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The video includes many many many many strawmen arguments

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Time to burn some strawpuppets

This will be faster if I just comment on the idiocy and ignore the constant strawmanning every two seconds

0:24 Bitcoin mining did not take up every card under the sun it was maybe 5 specific cards at most, no one was hoarding 750ti's in 2015 which you can still play gta V on

0:33 up until just before the bubble burst mining could easily offset the electricity costs

0:52 are you arguing that someone that openly pirates nintendo games wouldn't have cracked their copy of gta V?

1:33 there is more than one place to get roms

there is a lot of idiocy in this video, way to much to be normal, figured I would take this time while they rattle of strawman after strawman to write this part since there have been only 4 actual points in the 5 minutes of the video so far

4:59 Are they actually trying to argue piracy is a marxist issue?

5:40 ""there are only two ways to increase profits"" That is not true in the slightest, there are many many ways to increase profits that not include charging more or cutting costs, you act like consumers are a static non fluctuating number that you can only ever access a maximum sales number from. you argue as if there are only ever 100,000 gamers and that the only way to get more or less money is either cut your costs or rip off that 100 thousand its an amazingly limited viewpoint on how marketing works

6:53 The reason for telltale games failure was it failed to change, every game was identical because they were lazy not because capitalism forced them to do it, there are many franchises that barely change and profit year after year, telltales terrible writing, lack of gameplay are what caused to to go under

6:57 no videogames would do far worse if everyone owned their own labor and had workplace democracy because it ends up like trying to herd cats, everyone wants to do their own thing and push their own ideas leading to nothing ever getting done or worse feature creep, this is why there are team leads and company directors because when these people left a lone none of them could build a straight line without getting into an argument which direction it should face. (funnily enough you are literally arguing for a system like gamergate)

PS. horse you are a retard

7:20 You argue dead cells as if the company isn't founded on capitalism, the reason it can work as an ""idea sharing"" is because it has 11 people in it, telltale had 275 employees and you want them to all go their own direction? you also ignore companies like tale of tales that couldn't even function with 3 people, you disingenuously jump from comparing large scale productions to a team of 10, saying the failings are purely because those 300 people didn't have that same idea structure while ignoring the 100 or so other factors that lead to success or downfall

7:45 Steam =/= The companies on its platform, you instantly group everything on steam as capitalist when you don't know the composition of any of the studios on there, you cant sit there and argue Dead cells is a working example or Marxism but look at all this shit on steam its Capitalist scum conveniently ignoring Dead cells is on steam that is some amazing cognitive dissonance, since for all you know the Day Z guys could have been using the same team setup and Dead Cells

8:29 Gamergate wasn't about Anita, at least get one fact straight in the entire video

9:08 ""So one company made once concession"" This is literally the argument you are making to support marxism, that this one company succeeding using a system you like is what should tip the scales against all the other failures using that system

&amp;#x200B;

First, set up Coinbase and Binance accounts.

* Coinbase has few coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC, ZRX): If you only want these ones, you don't need Binance too.
* Binance has hundreds of altcoins, but does not accept fiat deposits (yet).

Once you have set up your account(s):

1. Deposit fiat to Coinbase. Bank transfer will be cheaper but slower than debit card, usually.
2. Transfer fiat to Coinbase Pro (free).
3. Place Buy Limit order for Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) on CB Pro (no fees, but you'll have to wait for the market to fill the order).
4. Withdraw BTC or ETH to Binance (also free).
5. On Binance, use your BTC or ETH to buy as many shitcoins as you can lay your filthy little mitts on!

* Always do your own research. View all information regarding crypto with a critical eye, and make your own, informed decisions.

Buzzfeed published an article entitled, [GOP Operative Made ""Suspicious"" Cash Withdrawals During Pursuit Of Clinton Emails](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money) ^[[1]](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money) that states, “Peter W. Smith withdrew $4,900 in cash the day after he finalized a plan to work with ‘dark web’ hackers”.  

&gt;Now, BuzzFeed News has reviewed documents showing that FBI agents and congressional investigators have zeroed in on transactions Smith made right as his effort to procure Clinton’s emails heated up. Just a day after he finished a report suggesting he was working with Trump campaign officials, for example, he transferred $9,500 from an account he had set up to fund the email project to his personal account, later taking out more than $4,900 in cash. According to a person with direct knowledge of Smith’s project, the Republican operative stated that he was prepared to pay hackers “many thousands of dollars” for Clinton’s emails — and ultimately did so.

This money shed new light on Smith's effort during which he told people he was in touch with Trump officials and Russians on the dark web.  He singled out Mike Flynn in particular.


Peter W. Smith also hired Chuck Johnson, as detailed in the Politico article from July 2017 [GOP Researcher Who Sought Clinton Emails Had Alt-Right Help](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/11/gop-researcher-who-sought-clinton-emails-had-alt-right-help-215359) ^[[2]](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/11/gop-researcher-who-sought-clinton-emails-had-alt-right-help-215359)

This is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8opgjn/charlottesville_hate_marcher_elected_by/e05d4ga/?context=3) to a post detailing the gesture.

The two are familiar because Johnson helped set up the meeting between Rohrabacher and Julian Assange.  **Johnson, who was also [invited to the State of the Union by Matt Gaetz^[5]](https://www.thedailybeast.com/florida-congressman-invited-infamous-troll-chuck-johnson-to-trumps-state-of-the-union), sat in on a meeting between Rand Paul and Rohrabacher at the capitol**.  Rohrabcher’s spokesperson, Pitkin, says they discussed cannabis and Assange’s legal situation, among other things.  ^[[3]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-far-right-blogger-chuck-c-johnson-gave-1508457881-htmlstory.html) 

Michael Isikofff, co author of Russian Roulette, reported in that article that Chuck Johnson is not interested in cooperating in ongoing investigations: 

The article states Johnson appeared to be the first figure in the Russia probe to make such a defiant position publicly, “refusing to cooperate in any way with the committee probe”.

A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[4]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

Remember Rand Paul just recently moved to block Sander's Russia resolution backing the intelligence community and requiring Trump to speak with counsel Mueller and suggested that people were suffering from “Trump Derangement Syndrome” and “intense hatred for the president”.  .^[[6]](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/397879-rand-paul-blocks-sanders-russia-resolution-calls-it-crazy-hatred)

Rohrabacher met with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London of August 2017, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails. According to Rohrabacher, Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[7]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)

**For any new cryptopians looking to get started, the following is the simplest &amp; cheapest way for most people to buy cryptocurrencies** (though it will depend on where in the world you are):

​

First, set up Coinbase and Binance accounts.

* Coinbase has few coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ETC, ZRX): If you only want these ones, you don't need Binance too.
* Binance has hundreds of altcoins, but does not accept fiat deposits (yet).

Once you have set up your account(s):

1. Deposit fiat to Coinbase. Bank transfer will be cheaper but slower than debit card, usually.
2. Transfer fiat to Coinbase Pro (free).
3. Place Buy Limit order for Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) on CB Pro (no fees, but you'll have to wait for the market to fill the order).
4. Withdraw BTC or ETH to Binance (also free).
5. On Binance, use your BTC or ETH to buy as many shitcoins as you can lay your filthy little mitts on!

​

**Remember:**

* Always do your own research. View all information regarding crypto with a critical eye, and make your own, informed decisions.
* Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.

e87yixz,C00mbsie,30,"Here is my response to a similar concern that ""data control is inevitable"" and that China will put a back-door in the Carrier:

There is a difference between State controlled data and corporate/app controlled data. Also, the degree of data control is a spectrum. It is not all or nothing. Application's/ISP control over data can be fixed. State will be different. How each country accepts the carrier will vary. China is the most difficult, and of course Elastos will not fix all of China's problems. Change starts with ideas and ways of thinking. There are many more benefits to Elastos than censorship resistance. I am sure the Chinese government will want a secure and efficient IoT industry. IoT is literally the next industrial revolution, and will drastically change the world. In China I could see them doing something to make people give up their data privacy, but not touch the Carrier if it becomes a compelling IoT solution allowing for secure M2M connections so a hacker doesn't turn 1 trillion devices into a mini robot army of doom. For instance, they could make every Chinese DApp send copies of code to government servers or something. They could also just do what they are doing now and only allow certain government controlled Chinese Apps/DApps. Everyone would see a back-door in the Carrier, so if they did put one everyone would know about it.


&amp;nbsp;





My hope is that Elastos becomes extremely popular and useful intranet in every other country, creating digital economies through enforceable digital scarcity, and providing a secure internet infrastructure for the IoT revolution. Then I hope China FOMO's in haha. Either way Elastos is global. China may fight tooth and nail to stick to their ridiculous ways. What IS true is that it will be a pain in the ass to get rid of something like the Elastos Carrier once it gets very big. This at least gives people some sort of leverage, as no company can be attacked to shut it down. The people just need to stop using it and shut off their devices (which they likely will if it is illegal).

&amp;nbsp;





As for the rest of the world, I think they are coming around slowly. In general it looks like the tides are turning with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. I think non-China countries will have to accept things like Elastos Carrier. Momentum is definitely picking up toward data privacy. Things like the Cambridge analytica scandal only propel this agenda further, and they will keep happening. Now if someone like the NSA is like nope, we need a backdoor, that is not a total loss. Or not even a back-door. It could be key visibility. Meaning when you sign up the NSA gets a copy of your private key only to be used under certain situations(not saying they would adhere to those). Yes it sucks, but NSA needs stuff sometimes for good reason, like national security. However you can work with the NSA, and still protect against the dirty hands of the ISPs and Facebook types. Private entities that can sway elections and public opinion on pretty much anything whenever they feel or are paid off to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;





Don't mistake optimism and excitement for delusion (although of course there always are some). Some people find small improvements very big. Also this blockchain movement did not happen in a vacuum. Bitcoin speaks to many people just as Elastos does. There is the possibility for change. If China is China, then we move on and tackle the other 194 countries first. Also, we are many years our from a full fledged vision of the smart-web. The world changes pretty fast at times. I hope China begins to see some light. What I am confident of is that there is not going to be a backdoor in the Carrier. It will be compliance layers on top if anything. I am pretty sure the reason why Rong basically gave up 20m in funding from FoxConn is because he did not want Elastos to be ""The Chinese Operating system."" He wanted a global and neutral platform, and so he told them to fk off (I remember reading something that eluded to that in an old interview, but don't quote that).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;







For certain countries, I think we are going to have to settle for protection from ISPs/Apps, but sometimes not complete privacy from the state. I am fine with that. Ideally, If governments are totally on board, they can be worked with to figure out a way to give them the exactly the info they need only when they need it for national security, but not more than they need. Or maybe they will just accept that it is inevitable. It's hard to barge into the houses of millions of people to steal their IoT devices (Who knows maybe China might, but I would say unlikely).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;






Anyway what is important to know is that Elastos is NOT a Chinese platform. The main offices are in China (but company from Singapore), but that is all the relation to China. Yes the TV boxes are in China only, but that is just a start. ioeX are going to get 1m devices in the next 12 months to EU and NA. This is 100% a global platform. The Carrier is super easy to intstall into IoT devices so if Elastos takes off, there could be 10s of millions of devices all over the globe in a relativley short time. Expecially if ioeX really does reduce operating cost by 70% as they claim. Also Elastos already has proven that the Carrier can get through the Great Firewall.",2018-10-22 14:24:54

e8ar8vs,Georgy_K_Zhukov,240,"Instances are known where certain requirements were waived for African-American men, but always in situations where the man was willing to vote Democrat. Holloway notes the case of Silas Green, who had committed some small time crime, who had been allowed to vote when he balloted Democrat, but upon switching his affiliation, was challenged by the Democratic election officials. It is important to note that in 1880, Reconstruction had only just ended and while ascendant, the Redeemers didn't necessarily feel quite in total control, so as Holloway aptly describes, this form of waiver for specific black persons was *""particularly effective because they offered Democrats a flexible but effective way to manipulate the vote when a close race was at hand.""* They quite literally could create voters if needed, but immediately prevent further voting if they believed that person would no longer support them. This would, of course, become less necessary and less common as the Jim Crow laws were passed and the white ruling elite came to feel more secure in power, and there was no longer any need to court any black voters.

The impact of such laws is stark. During Reconstruction, in Louisiana, 130,000 black men were voters. After the state was ""redeemed"", 5,000 black voters were registered. And even those few who were able to get through every hurdle thrown their way still had to contend with the intimidation and threats that would be directed their way for daring to make use of their right. Other states saw similar declines in the late 19th century (although by the early 20th century numbers would again rise as black community organizers worked to fight back and take back the vote). 

So at this point, I would again insert a caveat that I'm speaking only to the process in the South. As discussed, the ante-bellum period saw minimal registration, with eligibility essentially claimed at the polls, and offered up in judgement to the election officials as part of the community ritual that surrounded the electoral process. The emancipation and enfranchisement of African-Americans, however, was an existential threat to the white elites who, with the end of Reconstruction, used, among other schemes, stricter requirements for voter registration to institute technically non-racial laws to prevent actual impact of black suffrage from being felt. This was not the only factor worthy of discussion - I'm sure that someone else who wishes to could expand on the change in the Northern states or the impact of increasing urbanization where community recognition no longer could be a guarantee, among others, but at least in the American South increasingly strict laws for voter registration are intimately tied to racial politics and attempts to maintain white supremacy.

1: As a side note given the premise and how people *really* want to discuss that, I take no issue with the premise. There is no Federal law in place that requires registration outside of those regulated by the National Firearms Act, and this is in fact banned by the Firearm Owners Protection Act. 4473 Forms are kept by dealers upon sale, and turned into BAFTE under certain circumstances, where they keep them but can't digitize them, but this is not legally considered a registry, and private sales require no paper trail whatsoever, so if it were, it still wouldn't be a *requirement* to buy a gun, just a requirement to buy one that isn't used. So no, there is not a requirement to register firearms, and so being in a state that doesn't have a state level one, if I wanted to I could meet a sketchy dude in a parking lot at 3 am to buy an entire arsenal ~~in unmarked, non-sequential bills~~ with BitCoin and that would be totally legal. As with voting, various states have their own requirements, which can include registration, as FOPA doesn't restrict the states, and SCOTUS has not held anything like that to be unconstitutional to date, but that doesn't make the premise incorrect. 

If you want to nitpick a premise, is that there is a requirement to register to vote, as it is basically the same deal. Federal laws and the Constitution say what the state's *can't* do, but it is basically left entirely to them to decide the specifics, or whether to require registration at all, although only North Dakota requires none.",2018-10-23 23:34:52

* We are building for the mainstream. Ethereum isn't ready for the mainstream
* Visa B2B - IBM operates Visa's backend. Visa has an initiative called B2B connect, cross border payment solution for businesses, stay tuned for SIBOS this week. Probably an announcement. 
* Lighting - can be used to obfuscate some of the transactions for banks that want to keep some transactions outside of the public eye. 
* Financial companies won't be obliged to hold lumens, will just pay a fee to IBM that will take care of everything for them. But market makers will hold them to provide liquidity for the transactions. 
* IBM current focus is around core stellar protocol. 
* Crypto regulation: more likely to see light regulations to make the banks more comfortable but no outright bans

e8a569g,bitvote,54,"I'm feeling more and more confident that the bottom is in. 

I just spent some time looking at the charts from 2014-2015. It's a pretty steady downward slope from the Dec 2013 peak until Jan 2015 - there never was an extended period of stability like this. I believe what we're seeing now mirrors the period from Feb-Jun 2015 where we traded in a very tight range for months. This extended low volatility phase really set the bottom imo (more than the knife down to ~$170 on Jan 14). 

And the low volatility we're seeing right now may be our own version - setting a floor. $6k has been battle tested. 

It's pretty clear that there are long-term buyers at $6k. Come to think of it, many of us here are buyers at $6k... 

And now that we're almost a year into this decline, the risk / reward is starting to favor being bullish imo. Barring some black swan event  the biggest bear profits are probably gone for this cycle. 

Re Black Swans - I don't think it'll be Tether despite how excited this sub likes to get about USDT. 

So the downside is starting to look like (to me at least) like it won't be that bad. My biggest concern (within the crypto market) is the fact that alts haven't broken down more. I would like to see some of them - that are most obviously shitcoins - go closer to zero. But I also recognize that many of these are super-thinly traded and what little trading there is may be heavily manipulated. So a trip to zero will likely take another year even if there's ZERO real value. 

Back to bitcoin. We've told the institutional story so many times, we may be at risk of forgetting that one of these times it'll be true. It probably already *is* but we can't see it clearly yet. 

The custody element is huge. There are now a number of large, reputable financial institutions who offer custody solutions. 

And the Fidelity offering is ... crazy exciting imo. Not just bcs it will give $7.2T (!!!) of assets access to bitcoin, but bcs Johnson (the CEO) is a true crypto fan - she knows her stuff and loves it. 

And the media is now fluent enough in crypto that they are ready to help us with another run. In 2013 almost everyone reporting on crypto was painfully clueless. That degree of ignorance stayed steadily abysmal through end of 2015 imo - it's amazing how a journalist will print a piece on a subject they know almost nothing about, riddled with factual inaccuracies. 

But 2017-2018 have been a huge learning opportunity and now many hosts and authors know enough to be able to comfortably have a conversation. And they also know how to roll out some useful storylines (i) BTC as store of value + comparing bitcoin marketcap to gold marketcap, (ii) ""new asset class"", (iii) programmable money + 2nd layer pieces like LN, (iv) a few metrics to watch (like the number and value of tx on the blockchain).

All of this doesn't guarantee that we'll have another bull run in 2019. or ever. But if we DO have another bull run - another FOMO party - it's almost certain to be 5x huger than the last one bcs the onramps are so much better 

Remember when 50k/ people a day were trying to sign up on Coinbase and what a clusterF that was.... imagine if all they have to do is log into their Fidelity account or call their broker or use Square Cash or Robinhood or... You get the idea. 

Overall, I'm in the process of switching out of battered bull mode and getting optimistic about when the next run will begin.

sure my value has gone up thousands of percentages, but I'm not crazy wealthy. The reason being, I was a college kid and thus did not have much money to buy BTC with, and also because I didn't get involved in Bitcoin to only HODL it. I spent a good majority of it because I wanted there to be an economy and help stimulate it. 

Here's another thing to consider; For every ""If I knew about bitcoin back then I would've spent my life savings when it was $1"", there's 99 people who would've sold when Bitcoin hit $3-5.

e8akqg1,BobUltra,34,"&gt; It's actually going very well for the US. Inflation has been been low and stable. The real economy is larger than it's ever been. Unemployment is very low. Out of all the countries and currencies on Earth over the past 100 years, the US and its dollar have had a better track record than almost any other.

&gt; A few corrections to some possible misconceptions:

&gt; (1) Fed is short for Federal Reserve. It's not an acronym.

&gt; (2) The goal of the Fed is not 0% inflation. Because downside risks are worse than upside risks, the Fed's explicit long-term target is 2%

&gt; (3) House prices aren't great to use as a metric of inflation. A house built today is far, far better than house built in 1913. According to the consumer price index, $3,400 in 1913 has the rough buying power of $88,000 today.

&gt; https://www.bls.gov/cpi/

&gt; In my opinion, if you want to make a serious argument against the Fed, you should (a) do more work than rhetorically asking how the past century has gone for us, and (b) at least be familiar enough with the thing to spell its name correctly.

Zooming out, I'm still bullish on our long-term prospects for 2019.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/fayFUBVQ/

Weekly stability continues to be measured against Bitstamp because it has been around so much longer. Daily stability has been moved to Bitstamp because Bitfinex no longer represents the larger market. That may change if arbitrage ever brings USDT exchanges back in line again.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/d0S3bvn6/

Last week I suggested that Bitfinex was likely to lose customers. I still think that's the case, but generally there's less evidence for it than I thought there would be. Last week saw volume increase at Bitfinex while, overall, retail increased market share dramatically.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/rJnLweXO/

I put the odds of breaking down back down to somewhere between 15% and 20% again. That's down from the 30% I was suggesting last week.

IMO, these market conditions feel and look most like the silk road event before the Dec 2013 bubble. It's worth remembering that everyone believed that Silk Road was the only real use case for Bitcoin when the site was busted and shut down. Similarly, we have people saying that bitcoin can't maintain its value without tether and altcoins today.  I expect more drama related to basic wrong assumptions (and confirmation bias) that are systemic within this ecosystem. That fud will remain while larger interests establish their footing.

This period also looks and feels like the long period of accumulation in 2015. Watch out for small bear traps and big bull traps. Scalpers should probably stop trying to short the market when we're close to support.",2018-10-23 01:25:03

I can’t help but feel those that are able are holding the price down. You see large chunks of bitcoin sat either side of our sat value. The big wallets keep growing, and extra 4% of tokens have moved to nodes - big fish are definitely still accumulating. Eventually the tokens out there on the market are going to dry up and that will Impact the price. Right now, the price doesn’t really have any reason to go up, let’s be honest. VET token not yet in use, lots still in circulation and only a few exchanges trading on low volume. 

Regulations are coming, legitimate exchanges are coming. It may feel bad right now, but the next few years are going to fundamentally change the crypto landscape and there’s only one project I want to be balls deep in when it matures. You do you, of course :) but I can’t help but feel when we escape this current ‘Wild West’ mode, VeChain is going to be catapulted as a legally compliant and endorsed public Blockchain.

Maybe he would be open for a debate with /u/jtoomim, /u/thezerg1 or /u/deadalnix so we can resolve this once and for all?

I'll just quote the most relevant points from that thread:

&gt; A $200 GPU should be about 100x faster than a $200 CPU for ECDSA. That should allow about **1e6 verifies per second** instead of 1e4 per CPU. For a 300 second block with 1 GPU, that would be 3e8 inputs or OP_CDSVs verified, which would take up about 3e10 bytes, or 30 GB. You can scale this up by just adding more GPUs. For the ECDSA verification part, the **hardware cost needed to handle blocks of a given size is about $10/GB**, so a cluster capable of handling ECDSA for **1 TB blocks would cost about $10k with current-gen hardware**. By the time we actually have need for 1 TB blocks, that cost will probably be below $1k.

e.g. Ryan wants to charge you 4,50 USD (at the current prices) for an operation that takes 1 millionth or 0,000001 seconds to compute, **$4,50 for 1µs of GPU time** and he calls not doing that a ""subsidy"", if that doesn't sound insane to you, I don't know what would.

&gt; A single ECDSA verification takes about 100 µs on a single core with libsecp256k1. That's true both for OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY), which is used in all current p2pkh and p2sh transactions, as well as for OP_CHECKDATASIG(VERIFY). **That means a $300 CPU can verify about 30,000 to 60,000 signatures per second**. All normal script verification is done when the transaction hits mempool, and the results of that are cached by the time a block arrives, so for a 5 minute block we would be able to verify about 10 million sigops on a $300 CPU. As each sigop requires about 100 bytes of data (found in the scriptsig and the previous output for OP_CSV, and pushed onto the stack by the script for OP_CDSV), a 10 million sigop block would be at least 1 GB in size.

&gt; **OP_CDSV is the same computational cost as what we're already doing with P2PKH and OP_CSV. It also pays the same miner fee.** Furthermore, it's cheap enough that it doesn't matter. Signature verification is not the bottleneck.


It's also worth to read the [actual article](https://www.yours.org/content/dear-ryan--why-op_checkdatasig-is-not-a-subsidy-3c240f0b8f19) RXC is responding to, valuable info there too.

Edit: I'd like to just encourage you to upvote the OP if you find this discussion important even if you disagree with Ryan as I do as the discussion IS important and it deepens the understanding of Bitcoin by this community overall, which is a good thing.",2018-10-23 17:05:36

e8bcge3,Like1OngoingOrgasm,98,"Note that I don't know specifics about individual situations. I am not a lawyer. I am not ""elite."" My only qualifications are that I'm an EFF member, a DSA member, a linux hobbyist, and a free culture advocate.  I don't know what resources are available to the average Brazillian. This is general advice, and assumes you have a wifi enabled laptop and access to public wireless access points.

First thing first. If you have been very active politically on social media, using your real name or photo, then there's a record of it. There are ways to scrub your accounts, which will mitigate the threat from reactionary mob violence. Chances are you are likely under the government's radar and unless you start making a lot of noise you're going to stay that way. If you are active enough that you think you could be on a shortlist of targets then you should be thinking about an immediate exit plan.

In netsec, perfect is the enemy of the good. For most people, staying off the hitlist of your local fash is probably the best you can hope for... and good enough. Do your best to appear normal on social media. But tone down your presence on all official channels. Blend in, but stop revealing so much about where you are and what you are doing.

It would be *best practice* to obtain a business-class laptop, cash or otherwise untraceable (bitcoin is not untraceable). Second hand from a small computer shop is fine, but brand new (plastic still sealed) is better. It's near impossible to protect against pre-installed hardware bugs, but honestly I wouldn't be too worried about China appropriating your intellectual property right now. :) Something ubiquitous that is used by IT professionals. Intel CPU with integrated graphics and Intel wifi/bluetooth is your safest bet for running linux on a laptop. Don't be like me, meaning you shouldn't have activist stickers on this laptop. That's a college habit I haven't outgrown. My laptop doesn't feel complete without an EFF sticker.

If you don't know how to use linux and tor, then the safest way to maintain communication is by installing \[TAILS\]([https://tails.boum.org](https://tails.boum.org)) on a USB flash drive. TAILS stands for The Amnesic Incognito Live System. It's designed for the specific purpose of securing and concealing private communication between political activists, journalists and their sources, etc. Even though it is designed to be fairly easy to use, please read the \[documentation\]([https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)). All of it. And then only use it on public wifi so you are less visible to correlation analysis. Don't just use the same coffee shop or wherever. Stay mobile, be unpredictable, and don't bring your phone.

When you boot into TAILS and connect to the internet, your connection will be encrypted, sent through a series of 3 tor nodes. The result is that your IP address can't be tracked from the other end, and no individual node has access to all the encryption keys. Tor stands for The Onion Router, named as such because it uses multiple layers of encryption to anonymize network activity. If you want to learn more about onion routing, I suggest watching \[Computerphile\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRYzre4bf7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRYzre4bf7I)).

After that, the best thing to do is use an encrypted email service to stay in communications with your political contacts, who you should meet face to face in order to exchange addresses. You can also create throwaway accounts for reddit and other services.",2018-10-24 04:22:02

If you use big-data analysis on all inputs and outputs of all of the transactions available on the blockchain, you can usually pin down which addresses are logically grouped together and sometimes can even pin down the real-world person that controls said wallet group.

Sometimes, it's unclear whether one or more addresses belong in a logical group. (i.e. sometimes it's clear that addresses A, B, and C belong to user 1, while it's unclear if D and E belong to user 1 or a different user altogether).

If someone sends a couple of satoshi to address E in this case, and find that sometime down the road, that dust was consolidated to one of those addresses, or grouped with a send that also included addresses A, B or C as inputs, it's clear that address E also belongs to the same user.

Additionally, if addresses D and E are currently empty and only dust is sent (just a couple of satoshi) there is a chance that the added address data will cost user 1 more in fees than it would by excluding the address altogether.

The tokens started trading and people were selling them just to be able to get anything out. They were trading for less than 20 cents when trading started and bitcoin was at $1,700 or so. Bitfinex themselves bought the BFX tokens on the cheap. Then sometime in April 2018  they said that whoever still had BFX tokens would be credit $1. By that time, BTC was over $1900. 

So, to summarize. You had 1 bitcoin at Bitfinex in Aug. 2017 and you got 600 BFX tokens. If you kept them until you were credited with 600 USD and used that to purchase bitcoins you would be able to buy 0.316 BTC in April 2018. Tell me again in which universe that equals 'refunding' all users.

This is a new concept similar to what Bitcoin Cash recently achieved using their ""Money Button"". It lets you use dapps without metamask, and that's huge. How?

Well, there is basically only one way this can be done. You generate the private/public key pair entirely in the client JavaScript. Then you take the keys, and store em encrypted in localStorage in the browser. Now, apps can prompt you to give the password and get access to your keys.

From there, Zippie creates a standard web3 client using JavaScript. Normally, Metamask provides this, but the website js can also do the same. I didn't see a mention of which nodes you're using, so they probably hooked it up to Infura like everyone else (metamask).

Great job, Zippie guys. There are two things I don't like:

* The branding on the Zippie button is quite over the top. When users sign into my site, I don't want to make them see your logo and name on a huge button. I would probably override it in CSS and restyle it. Money Button does this right -- they have almost no branding, but a unique style + ux

Johnson, who was also [invited to the State of the Union by Matt Gaetz^[3]](https://www.thedailybeast.com/florida-congressman-invited-infamous-troll-chuck-johnson-to-trumps-state-of-the-union), sat in on a meeting between Rand Paul and Rohrabacher at the capitol.

Rohrabacher met with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London of August 2017, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails. According to Rohrabacher, Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[5]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)


A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[1]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

If you want strong privacy then as a start you need to run a full node  (and use either Bitcoin Core wallet, or run your own electrum server), preferably via tor.

e8haw51,i0tal0ver,37,"In an exclusive interview to the channel [**Cryptology**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrPwtvkswM&amp;feature=youtu.be)  and portal Livecoins Sergei Popov professor at  [Unicamp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~popov/)  and co-founder of IOTA cryptocurrency, he spoke about the project.

Serguei Popov holds a PhD in mathematics from the University of Moscow and together with Sergey Ivancheglo, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener he has given life to one of the most important crypto-coins in the industry.

In the interview, Popov, who is responsible for the theoretical / conceptual development of IOTA, said he had met Bitcoin and crypto-coins five years ago and then became interested in the subject, while researching on altcoins in the Bitcointalk forum, he met a project called NxT that looked very promising.

Popov made calculations on the NXT blockchain and [shared a paper on the forum](https://ledger.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/46%C2%A0.) . People liked it and the article brought prestige in the crypto-coins community to the teacher who was invited to join a project called Amaranth, later renamed to IOTA.

According to Popov, the initial IOTA project needed improvements to ensure security, so he persuaded developers to change the code. 4 months later they arrived in a design that is known today and respected by the Global community.

On the future, in a joking tone Popov says that ""IOTA wants to dominate the world"", the project was created for micro transactions and focuses on Internet of Things. He points out that ""transaction fee does not match micro transactions."" To solve the problem of rates it is necessary to eliminate the mining process and soon the miners.

The solution was to create a collaborative system. There are no transaction fees at the IOTA, to process transactions users must collaborate with the network. That way, in a system where there are hundreds of millions of connected devices, all of them must be actively involved, collaborating with the system.  


## ""Let's kill the Coordinator""

IOTA is still a centralized criptomoeda, just as Bitcoin was once a day. The IOTA Foundation has a central node called the Coordinator. Its main goal is to protect the network until it becomes strong enough to sustain a large-scale attack.

Asked about this, Popov said that there is a project that wants to eliminate the Coordinator dubbed [""Coordicide""](https://www.iota.org/research/roadmap) and will soon be published by the foundation. This project would lead to the decentralization of the project and the end of the Coordinator.

## Scalability of IOTA

Theoretically the more users on the IOTA network the more transactions per second it can perform. Popov points out that the concern of several crypto-coins in solving scalability problems resembles "" *the mega-pixel race of digital cameras* .""

Before working on scalability, IOTA will solve the ""problem"" of the Coordinator.

## IOTA and resistance to quantum computing

IOTA was one of the first crypto-monks to worry about quantum computing - one of the main threats to crypto-coins - asked about where the initiative came from, Popov said that the quantum threat is real and can come at any time.

Popov points out that every public key cryptography system is not resistant to quantum computing, because of this IOTA was concerned with developing the project with resistance from the outset.

This is mainly due to the fact that IOTA uses a [signature scheme based on the](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/191.pdf)  Winternitz [hash](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/191.pdf) , which is considered (reasonably) resistant to quantum computing.

[Help me to Contact Poloniex] - Margin BUG – $40.000 Dissappeared

e8g4ktd,cryptocached,28,"&gt;Craig has contributed a lot of education like about Turing completeness on Bitcoin

Lies are not education.",2018-10-26 05:26:20
e8gwwb2,rdar1999,28,"&gt; (As a funny side note, Craig put a footnote to indicate that 'IFF' means 'if and only if'. He was too lazy to change it in-place.)

What is standing out here is that he is writing about big topics and finds important to waste time explaining what IFF means.

It must be to cover up his massively unwarranted conclusion that

&gt; The functions presenting in this section are examples of elementary recursive functions that can be used to create far more complex systems. We can use the notion of Bounded maximization to prove the privative (sic) recursive nature of the quotient and the remainder functions. These are native scripts in Bitcoin that are currently disabled: 


&gt;OP_MOD 151 0x97 a b out Returns the remainder after dividing a by b.  

&gt;OP_MUL 149 0x95 a b out a is multiplied by b. 

&gt;OP_DIV 150 0x96 a b out a is divided by b. 

&gt; We have now demonstrated that any primitive recursive function can be created within an unrolled bitcoin script. 
 

Wait, what? Translation:


Craig Wrong copied an obscure entry about primitive recursive functions to show you that they can be created within Script, provided he can loop them left and right. He forgot to mention that he needs this since one cannot form a composition of functions in Script otherwise. So, he is actually showing ya'll bitcoin is TC by assuming bitcoin is TC. His paper is full of such *petitio principii* fallacies.

What contrarian showed is enough to conclude Craig is a fraud, but I find important to point out that he also has no idea whatsoever over what he is plagiarizing.

The passage above is very telling of this, he just put a mumbo jumbo of formulas together and said some asinine thing in the end. He is saying something like ""duck rhymes with buck, therefore I can pay my bill with ducks"".

He chooses obscure sources to copy from in order to not get caught, what also makes his ""articles"" even worse. For instance, the author of the plagiarized planetmath stub defines `add(x,n+1)=s⁢(add(x,n))`. This is obviously true but it is very poor style to pick the sucessor `s()` to avoid writing down `+1`, but writing down `n+1` anyway.

This is not exactly how logicians would use a lexicon, one is syntax, the other is semantics. 

Make it either `add(x, s(n))=s⁢(add(x,n))`, or `add(x,n+1)=add(x,n)+1` across the board. That definition is weird. (thus I leave this as a suggestion for Craig to improve his fraud readability next time)

e8its7g,btc_clueless,66,"From all the altcoins I hold, Nano is one that I am more optimistic about.

The Bitgrail hack was a major setback and part of the reason why Nano is so far from its all time high. I am confident it will recover well.I consider Nano a solid project with a working product. Yes, there are a few open questions for example how well the network would keep up under an attack or high volume, but all these things have been taken into considerations by the devs (for example there was a recent stress test to better understand these issues). I don't see them as red flags.

The dev team is small but competent (if you want to dive in a bit deeper, DataDash had a [half an hour interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWdOkIev_xM) with the Nano founder two days ago). The community is great, too, very engaged (the Venezuela donation campaign is a good example), not the delusional moonlambos you often find in other subreddits. Some in the community are also very enthusiastic about the fast and fee-less transactions that simply work and want to spread the word. I think this is where the ""hate"" in r/cc comes from. I don't think that's really hate towards Nano itself but rather people being tired of Nano shills telling them how amazing Nano is, over and over again. Understandably so. I don't think there's more to it, really.

If the fundamentals look good (as I argue), then why isn't Nano further up in market cap? A valid question!

To answer this, let me start with a broader picture. As we know, blockchain has many very different applications. Supply chain management is a completely different task than let's say a smart contract platform. Some of those blockchain applications can be used productively right away. IBM started [TradeLens](https://www.maersk.com/en/news/2018/06/29/maersk-and-ibm-introduce-tradelens-blockchain-shipping-solution) with Maersk and 90 partner companies now use it for their logistics. Great. But cryptocurrencies (in the narrow sense) are very different. For crypto to be useful as a currency you need adoption. If no vendor accepts your cryptocurrency it's useless. And even though Bitcoin is about to celebrate its 10th birthday, adoption is still awfully lacking behind. (Needless to say, Nano's even more so). Now you might argue ""but hey, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and it's the number one coin in terms of marketcap"". Yes it is, but why are people buying or holding Bitcoin? To actually spend it? No, mostly for speculation, as a store of value, or to trade it for other cryptos. Generally speaking, the sad truth is: **Nobody holds crypto to actually use as currency**.

This has nothing to do with Nano or Bitcoin or any other currency in particular. Think about it: how much of the Bitcoin you hold have you actually spent? Sure, I bought my Ledger Nano S with Bitcoin and paid for a VPN and donated a bit to some people in the developing world. But when I add up everything I ever spent it's less than a percent. I would expect it's the same for most of us. Yes yes, I'm all excited about the tech but for the most part we buy and hold cryptocurrencies because we hope one day they will be worth more.

Adoption will continue to be slow. And there's still very few places in general that actually accept cryptos. And many of them are crypto enthusiasts themselves. They don't offer to be paid in crypto because it's actually convenient or better for them (rather the contrary if you consider how complicated it is to file taxes on crypto in most countries). So this is a general problem of cryptocurrencies, not a Nano-specific problem. Adoption will take time.

Another problem is that for increased adoption we need easier ways to convert fiat to crypto and back. Most people outside the cryptosphere wouldn't even know where to look and how to do it. It's still awfully complicated: signing up at an exchange, jumping through KYC hoops, learning what 2FA is and how to use it, sending money to the exchange (in case of bank transfer this might take a few days), buying Bitcoin, changing Bitcoin to Nano (possibly having to sign up for another exchange because the first one doesn't have Nano), downloading Nano wallet... I mean, seriously, we are still a long way from major adoption of cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

As always, there's exceptions from the rule. When you look at Top 10 marketcap, there's two more currencies: Tether (again, just used for speculation or short-term store of value) and Monero. Monero is a special case because it has a very particular use case (which is not buying that coffee at Starbucks), and that use case actually has a demand right now for which people are willing to spend some time to figure out how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe that Nano is great at what it aims to do and has its niche where it excels, especially microtransactions. But adoption will not happen overnight, not even if the next bull cycle starts tomorrow. However, when people see (and happen to agree with me) what a solid project Nano is and how it improves on many aspects of the original Bitcoin concept, there's a good chance that they will put money into Nano during the next bull run, even though adoption is still lacking.",2018-10-27 09:45:18

But he's absolutely wrong saying that extending out this number is ""creating moar bitcoinz omfg,"" because in reality, everything would scale perfectly proportionally, which effectively gives you more divisibility.

3. No mining, no absurd energy consumption

5. The team is AWESOME and Colin is one of the smartest people on the market 

6. The team is planning to use Nano for global remittance, like Ripple. Imagine something : Nano is open source and free to use, it costs nothing for business to use the network. So if Western Union wants to use Nano tomorrow, they can. And they will benefit A LOT FROM IT.

e8lcoa9,cryptovestor,27,"I like to think about the two major forms of financial crisis.  In a stock market crash (at the point where too-big-to-fail comes into play) people move quickly from risk on to risk off positions.  That would mean crypto speculators that come from the traditional finance world would be exiting anything they deem risky and moving their portfolios to low risk instruments or straight cash.  I imagine that any of those types holding crypto would likely move to cash and this would cause a short term crypto price crash but super high trade volume.  Those of us primarily within the crypto system might think differently, especially if you use your crypto for something or you have plans to stake on many different chains, and we might be the only folks left holding for a long time.  It would definitely be the most painful price action to date since the stakes for anyone involved for more than a year are very high.  Only the true believers would be left, maybe for years, and we might see enhanced focus on the store of value proposition rather than the smart contracts proposition.  For that reason I do feel that bitcoin is better positioned to eventually gain after a crash, from a social scalability perspective.  However.  Given that it's ethereum projects leading the charge for Decentralised Finance, I put a non-zero probability on Ethereum gaining too.

A sovereign debt or central bank crisis is an entirely different beast.  In that situation people are forced, sometimes with their lives at stake, to face things like bank haircuts and hyperinflation when they desperately need the basics - food, water, shelter etc.  You can look to Venezuela for ideas on how that plays out.  People who are in that situation are in survival mode and will do anything to maintain a basic living.  We see growing interest in localbitcoins when these events occur, but the scale is still miniscule.  It's going to take a global crisis to see if masses would turn to crypto for storing value.  If you put yourself in that situation where you life is truly on the line, crypto would probably be the last thing on your mind.  

Regarding adoption - I don't think it matters where on the scale of adoption we are sitting before a financial crisis.  The masses simply do not understand money. When under hyperinflation and haircuts there is of course an increase in the number of people getting 'woke,' but still the masses will never learn about why it happens.  When the markets crash and index funds are eviscerated only a fraction of those invested understand.  Most have no idea and will never take the time to get an idea of how all of this actually works.  They will shout and scream and shake their fists at the sky.  Just remember the way you treated money before you came to understand it - it's (what I now believe to be) an unacceptable level of ignorance, but that's the reality for the masses.

Either way, I am banking on a guaranteed maximum pain event with all speculators capitulating  followed by a slow grinding realisation that crypto is a long term store of value.  Such an event would kill off any project that has no real world value.  Who knows if that means we are left with just bitcoin or bitcoin plus a handful of projects.  ",2018-10-28 16:59:01

""Many of those transactions that take place are illegal"".  Source?    Here's a source that says the complete opposite.

From UK HM Treasury  *National Risk Assessment* document...

 *""There is little evidence to indicate that the use of digital currencies has been adopted by criminals involved in terrorist financing, whether as a means by which to raise funds (crowd funding etc.), to pay for infrastructure (e.g. server rental), or to transfer funds.""*  [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-publishes-anti-money-laundering-assessment-and-commits-to-action-plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-publishes-anti-money-laundering-assessment-and-commits-to-action-plan) 

And there is good reason Bitcoin is not used for those sorts of things, Bitcoin is fully traceable at the exchange points and bitcoin history is public and preserved forever... only idiots would use it for illicit purposes against a state that has the ability to acquire IP addresses/exchange details of those involved in a trade and ability to work back through the chain to identify anyone.

It is far easier to use commodities, offshore accounts or service industry to hide a transactions history.

&amp;#x200B;

""Its slow""

Urm, no, it's instant.  And confirmed settlement takes \~10 minutes.  That's like 2100x faster than the best banking system around and more robust.

&amp;#x200B;

""It's expensive""

Yes, but no where near as expensive as a SWIFT/BACS transfer.  It is also vastly faster and not held by a private company.  It is expensive because a lot of people are wanting to use it and it's still in very active development.  These costs will come down as it's insane to do interbank settlement on every single transaction around the world, this is what layer2 technologies are solving.

&amp;#x200B;

""Energy use"".

Yes this is a temporary issue, this is also why bitcoin has to remain expensive to use and develop Layer2 technology and why the amount of electricity used halves every 4 years all things being equal.  Equally the internet, cars, electricity, heating, logistics, all use vast amounts of energy.  Perhaps we should solve the energy production issue rather than burning black sludge that is actually proven to be killing people.

&amp;#x200B;

Either she doesn't know this or she is perpetuating these myths because of fear it may impact the importance of a FED to control a nations supply.  Given the latter is not a significant threat to wealthy nations since people will still use their local currency and pay taxes in local currencies by law I can only think it's because she has been misled on the innovation and the advantages it brings rather than intentionally trying to spread FUD.  

This is actually a good thing, it show's she is sceptical and worried about non-important issues. It merely shows she is new to it, probably not actually used it and hasn't found any significant issue yet.  If someone wasn't sceptical of the bitcoin experiment at first they'd be a gullible person you should be cautious of.  

Her reservations show she is intelligent, done research by listening to the media and others so may take a while before the ah-ha moment as to why it is only going to continue getting stronger with or without her being a fan.

Bitcoin adoption in real life is still really rare and is mostly driven by hype. And no, a couple of photographs on /r/bitcoin are not going to convince me otherwise.

The oft-cited blockchain technology has yet to be implemented in any kind of actual real-world useful work over a decade since its inception.

People in poor countries or in countries with stupidly high inflation like Venuzuela have failed to adopt Bitcoin en masse, even though it supposidly has a lot of benefits over using the American Dollar or the Euro. Why? Because it's unstable and overly-deflationary. 

At least a coal plant produces *something*. At least I can use a dirty internal combustion engine to do work.

e8sdkfi,MarketsAreCool,48,"This was really great. But by making it a conspiracy though, I think the story takes away from how horrific the social media system is. Social media doesn't even need a shadowy machine learning system, although I'm sure it can help. It's a constant optimization process fueled by regular humans with regular incentives and outrage meters. 

I was getting fed up with the culture wars and the 2016 election, so I started looking for other communities to become active in, and as a developer and privacy interested person, I decided learning about Bitcoin development in early 2017 might be an interesting place. And it was, but almost immediately I got drawn into the Bitcoin block size debates, which despite being much lower stakes than ""who the president should be"" the emotions were somehow *even higher* than in politics. Big blockers called small blockers corrupt and evil and vice versa and it was a giant clusterfuck. Eventually the blockchains split in August 2017 but the communities still viciously hate each other. 

So I took a step back, and focused on real life things for a while, tried to read more books in 2018 and I think that worked pretty well, although I was still on Twitter and Reddit, so it's not like I was cut off. And again, social media figured out the *exact way to push my buttons*. Earlier this year, I read an interesting blog post by Robin Hanson, which was pretty much about what you'd expect him to write if you followed his work on signaling and economics for a long time. I honestly didn't think much of it. Until a few days later, people outside my rationalist/econ circles starting asking *me* if I had read about this crazy misogynist economist who wants men to own women or something. 

It was shocking to me how I had thought I was pretty insulated from the culture wars or the online controversies, and yet they still found their way in, in the exact way that would make me incredibly angry. There wasn't a algorithm doing this, it was just people on social media. That's really scary. ",2018-10-31 22:54:30

e8rpn8r,influbit,40,"This is all speculation (I’m in AI)

Tesla informed everyone they built a new chip.

They hired one of the best chip architects in the world to help build basically what I believe is an ASIC (similar to how bitcoin ASIC’sdominate bitcoin mining now and how Google developed TPUs - similar to ASIC’s). So Tesla basically built a custom ASICS chips that runs Tesla models 10-100x better than GPUs. This is risky because it’s like 100 million dollars (traditionally) to architect this and it’s very difficult to change if the models or AI system changes drastically. Tesla basically tripled down that their neural network models (Deep reinforcement learning systems + deep object detection systems + few other deep learning systems ) with more data and more powerful chips can get to FSD. Neural networks are all about training it until it reduces errors (it’s like a parabolic curve thou bottom of the parabolic curve being lowest error point, you wanna get to the bottom without overfitting and hallucinating- even we humans see animals in clouds - that’s an example of overfitting). 

So there are something like 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and radar. Put together about 21 high resolution sensors along with the acceleration pedal, brakes and wheel, gps data, speedometer data, etc.. let’s just round up to like 50 inputs and 25 outputs. Now Elon also invested in OpenAI who basically takes advantage of deep reinforcement learning.. which is a very powerful algorithm because it can tackle very general and complex problems. They demo how they can beat humans at Atari games and other complex PC games.

Now how does Deep neural networks that do reinforcement learning work? They basically are reward or punished based on state changes (state changes are you are on highway middle lane now then moved to highway left lane and the current state is your in highway left lane what’s the next move?) the training part they take in all this data from their entire fleet of cars with sensor data and train in the cloud probably many many many many scenarios of how humans drive and the actions they took. The training process is too expensive for each car to run individually so they do this in a massive data center with a crap ton of GPUs if not TPUs. Once train you can download this model and it’s fairly small all things considered... this is what u download in the update... maybe a few GB uncompressed... anyways this model now has to get validated and Tesla has enough fleet of cars to run 10 million miles in a short period of time to validate their models. I also do believe that with a large fleet they have the capability to start validating against more crazy complex scenarios. If a model gets validated on 10 million miles or more, this is more miles than you’d drive in a lifetime. When running in shadow mode it’s basically validating the model they pretrained and determining that this is safe enough. Someone did this calculation and I think it’s only a few weeks.

Anyways, the obvious next steps are determining how TPUs perform on AP3, with a 10-100x performance upgrade the Frame rates that are being processed will be incredibly high. Right now the cars you see sometimes glitch because the current GPUs can’t process all 8 cameras that quickly it’s like every maybe 10 frames it runs a object model detection? So in one second 30 frames that’d be 3 predict functions run (3 guesses that this shape is a car in this picture) well I’m guessing a Tesla ASIC’s can do all 30 frames simultaneously. Which will greatly reduce the glitchy ness. Furthermore, this will greatly stabilize the AP system for objects that are in motion as well. I think humans can only really see up to 60 FPS (noticeable changes - apparently some people can see up to 120hz) but then u blink and ur attention span is all over the place u only have 2 cameras and humans are buggy? So 30 fps x 8 cameras that’ll outperform human capabilities in terms of sensor capabilities, making sense of the sensors as, humans miss signs all the time(AP3) will probably be 10X more alert than a human.

So, next logical step would be more object detection. Signs are the most difficult to do. In fact I’m pretty sure Tesla is still using google maps for speed limits, but to read road signs for speed limit, stop signs and red lights, this is incredibly difficult to do... because these signs are tilted diagonals and can trigger a lot of false positives or negatives. Even humans run 4 way stop signs... not sure how they can over come this. One way is to be more conservative (like Wayno) and just stop or slow down, but this also causes accidents, maybe FSD needs to flash hazards when driving autonomously. Another is to just really train the object detection models really hard with a crap ton of data... otherwise they need a map of every single sign (unlikely to be accurate). There should be an electronic gov standard actually... not sure why it already isn’t...

If I were Elon, I’d use space x and high resolution satellite imagery to see if I can pick up all of these signs... see where that goes

*update correction about eyeballses ability to see beyond 60hz

*update ASICS are shoes not chips

*update about a statement saying 10 million miles is enough to validate crazy complex scenarios",2018-10-31 12:30:43
