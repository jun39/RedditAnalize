e1kqpe0,browner87,122,"Came here to say this. The first red flag was ""No phone number, no chat online"". I pay $10/month for Google Apps for Business just for a simple personal account and I can get phone and chat support instantly any time. If your stuff is seriously important or business stuff, stop being a cheap high school student and actually pay for the service?? 

Cloud hosting gets regularly abused and hacked so if consumer accounts get shut down without warning because of suspicious activity I'd be perfectly happy. If I'm running on free or personal tier and someone is about to rack up a $15k bill be spinning up half a million coin miners, I want that stuff taken offline NOW. If I'm a moron and run Mongo open to the internet and someone is in my database encrypting all my data, I want it stopped NOW. If I'm a business with more to lose with offline infrastructure than a few bitcoin miners and I have good backups of important data, then yes please call me instead of unplugging my mission critical servers. But calling costs the business a lot of money, so if you aren't paying for your service...",2018-07-01 08:15:51
e1l2qfm,PsycoSteve,117,"Greetings!! Im also from Venezuela and actually one nano is indeed more than yuo0u can earn in two months with a regular salary. Sadly it is easier to sell bitcoin ([localbitcoin.com](https://localbitcoin.com)) directly to our currency that to sell nano. There is a telegram group for nano that works really well and is a safe place to buy and sell nano, but with more like this i think we can improve nano´s adoption in our country. I do have some nano  since i used to do some translation for the discord group of Nano in spanish, I even lost about 28 nanos on bitgrail, so I consider myself a hard supporter of Nano.

I just want to thank people wanting to help venezuelans, we are really starving here. One dollar is like a month of work, so with the money you will use to buy a cup of coffee in your country, you could help a family to eat for a couple of weeks. Make it nano (which is my preferred coin of course) or bitcoin or any other coin, but please keep the help coming.",2018-07-01 12:24:33

e1lb2dk,satoshiscrazyuncle,58,"Most ""social media"" sites bend right over for the deep state and fast become social engineering playgrounds. 

In all cases, ""social media"" sites are invaded by black budget trolling programs in effort to manipulate what you think.

Due to our heavy focus from an early age on socialization (public schools), the manipulation is incredibly potent and effective. In short, if members of a targeted audience are made to believe, by the number of comments, or however, that other people think or do X, then the targeted people are likely to change their own thinking or actions to match. So these black budget campaigns hire thousands of poor idiots and bots to post their misleading, destructive, and communist tripe everywhere they can.

[This video](https://youtu.be/caUDXLqpdYc?t=2m40s) contains a clip that demonstrates how such manipulation works. It's 2-3 minutes and relevant.

- Litecoin LTC: $0.02

- Bitcoin Cash BCH: $0.00

2) Bitcoin Cash is the ONLY coin with widespread retail acceptance, AND low transactions fees.

Because of Bitpay (#1 payment processor), there are only 2 coins with widespread retail support: Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash.

And between those 2 coins, the median transaction fees for Bitcoin BTC are 20-200 times more expensive than for Bitcoin Cash.

3) Lightning Network is an off-chain scam, and a dead end.  Only idiots will use it. 

- Everyone has to stay online 24/7.
- You can't even send Bitcoin to someone who currently has zero Bitcoin.
- There are [no solutions for its routing problem](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pOZaLbUUZUs). 
- Funds can be stolen via old channel states.

&gt; if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal money, the other party has to act within a defined period of time to block the attempted theft.
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Lightning_Network
&gt;
&gt; in Lightning, the security of the payment channels requires constant monitoring to ensure that your counterparty is not stealing money from you by publishing an old channel state to the network.

e1lts6a,_ACompulsiveLiar_,65,"This sub attracts amateurs (and by amateurs I mean people who have no clue what the fuck they're doing) since professional investors generally don't spend their time posting to public forums.

Cryptos are also very attractive to people who don't know better because they see massive arbitrage opportunities (which aren't even closeable, they exist because there's too much volatility/instability to close them) and think that it must be easy money if they can just write a script that says ""pls buy bitcoin for less and sell for more""

Also amateurs are more prone to seeing patterns and thinking that swing trading is a reliable way of making money, since they have no education/experience in accounting for risk adjustment, downside management, hedging, etc. So they see some head and shoulders in eth/nano and think they have it all figured out.

It's funny that you mentioned machine learning at all, I'd bet that 90% of the people here (me included lmao) don't even know anything about machine learning.

* Paid off car (It was a zero interest loan for 3 years, paid it off at 2.7 year mark)
* Upped my insurance (car, home and umbrella)

Nobody led the BCH fork, it was a community effort.  Many people played important roles.  There were devs like Amaury Sechet who started Bitcoin-ABC and then once segwit locked in he decided to fork off with BCH.  It would not succeed without a lot of community and energy and support including that from miners, and there was some heavy hash power in the early days protecting BCH.  Exchanges supporting the coin and futures contracts on places like viabtc were also a very important step.  Once we had enough momentum, even BCH haters had to capitulate and add support including Trezor and Ledger wallet.

BCH is a team effort and continues to be so. I call this energy around the early adoption of Bitcoin and then later BCH the spirit of the Honey Badger.

Before the fork was called 'UAHF', I was working on it with u/deadalnix [EDIT: and others] and it was just called 'ABC' at that stage.

We decided to rename it to 'UAHF' based on the tweet by Jihan Wu (""UASF? UAHF!"") because we needed a generic name for the specification (which would apply to various clients), and it became necessary to fork against the chain wipeout threat of UASF and also to pre-empt Segwit to avoid pollution of the chain and codebase. So UAHF seemed as good a name as any for the spec.

We then drafted the specification together with Bitcoin Unlimited, Classic and XT developers, and also miners.

(People actually DID agree to this, twice, with the Hong Kong agreement and the New York agreement, both times core unilaterally reneged on their promise to raise the blocksize). 

But without a blocksize increase, it forces transactions to primarily occur off-chain (lightning network). This fundamentally breaks the economic incentives that make bitcoin work. Currently miners make most of their money by finding new coins, but as the reward decreases over time the primary compensation stream for miners becomes the transaction fees. If 99% of all transactions are happening off chain then fees need to be 100x greater if you want to transact on chain, or else mining becomes unprofitable, miners stop mining, and the chain dies.

One of the brilliant innovations of bitcoin was that it was designed the incentives to create virtuous self interest, which just means that when everyone acts selfishly they are ALSO working in the best interest of the network as a whole.

Does this mean the sidechains are bad? Definitely not - but they can't come at the expense of affordable on chain transactions. Sidechains that offer genuine innovation and utility are welcome, and most people expect that we'll see them on BCH eventually, but if all you want to do is send coins from wallet A to wallet B there should be no reason why that can't happen on-chain.

When, and if we do see side chains arrive on the BCH chain it will be because there is something unique that they allow, which isn't feasible on the main chain, but Segwit isn't the best solution for this, and wouldn't be the approach BCH would take, for all the reasons that others have articulated.",2018-07-04 08:05:06

Doesn’t mean it will have a larger market cap than btc this year but this exchange has the potential for XRP to flourish without moving in all the potential waves of btc.

I guess it’s a wait and see for now. But I think July 2018 will be the last month XRP can be purchased under a 1.00$ US.",2018-07-04 03:18:17

e1sg2q2,TumbleWeed_-,120,"STOLEN BIKE 5 thousand pound reward.

Stupidly large anonymous reward paid in bitcoin or cash for information leading to the prosecution of the person who stole my bike. Read on for a fun story.

PICTURE OF BIKE

My lovely e-bike a merida eone sixty 900e was stolen from outside my house on Lansdown Grove Road, Bath on friday night. I am upset a bit. I feel a bit violated and disrespected. I trust people. I think people are good and you mr thief mildly shook that world view for a split second. But I am not powerless to make this whole little event a force for good and learning as you will see .SMILEY FACE.


Firstly a message to my thief friend. Well played my buddy. Round one is surely yours. I locked my bike to a metal railing outside my front door and you saw what I should have noticed - that with a bit of handy work it is feasible to remove the entire metal banister my bike was attached to and steal my bike. Congratulations! It's a lovely machine and hope you have enjoyed riding it. If you need a cheap charger let me know. .WINKY FACE.

However game recognises game, so i hope you enjoy my choice of actions in this moment as i have an interesting conundrum for all of your friends. If They or anyone else for that matter provides information which leads to your prosecution I will pay them anonymously five thousand pound. of course I hope to get my bike back but to be clear, the 5 thousand pound reward is for your prosecution. You will never know who ratted on you as i have enough evidence what you were wearing etc. to prosecute. I even think I saw you from my window scoping the bike out so i think i may even be able to spot you in a line up .Smiley face.

A message to your friends. 
If you are the friend in question who knows this person let me sell you on all the benefits of doing the right thing. Firstly, you will receive the full 5000 anonymously a big bag of cash, bitcoin, its your choice Mon amis. Assuming you are not required to be there in court which I doubt as i hope there should be enough circumstantial evidence. Your "" friend "" will never have any idea it was you who said anything.

you will have enough money to start out on perhaps ( hopefully ) a really positive path by doing the right thing. Surely if this person is your friend you are making some bad life choices right now. you can change this. this could be your chance to change lanes and have meaningful finances in order to really make things better for yourself. you could pay for that college course start that business you wanted to, go travelling for a year. It's your money so its up to you! This could be a real turning point in your life. you can start a fresh. You can choose to do the right thing and hopefully in the future you will choose to spend time with nice people, instead of people who choose to see treat others badly. trust me, its way better.

One last message to my thief friend. 
IF my bike magically returns by the 10th of July the reward for your prosecution will also magically disappear too. If the bike does not re-appear by that date this deal expires and the reward gets bigger. smiley face.

what to do now.
If you have any information please call 101 quoting crime reference 5218144552 and or incident reference as-20180630-0720 to collect your reward email me here. stolenbikereward1@gmail.com

I don't talk about price a lot, but there comes a point where you need to seriously look at the other options and how far ahead of the game NEO is. Bitcoin is over a 100B market cap and it literally only functions as a currency (which it does poorly).

BIG has more to lose going into this and I believe are better off at the moment as a team.

All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

BIG in my opinion got the luck of the draw to make it this far into the tournament. Ending up playing a weak MIBR team and squeking by in OT on map 3. I think this G2 squad is way better than anticipated. X6 has really been using shox and KennyS to his best ability and I don't know if BIG has the fire power to stop either of them if they are firing on all cylinders. SmithzZz has also been playing quite well this tournament and he can easily match up against NEX / Tizian. X6 and Gob B have very similar skill sets when it comes to ingame potential as well. This is going to be an insane match either way. Battle of two of the greatest minds in CS History. French vs germans. Will KennyS put a stop to smooya the new rising star? The last hope from the UK Scene? Yeah pretty likely. G2 almost dropped astralis on dust 2 yesterday and their is no way NUKE will be played. Lets take the french team at probably the best odds we are going to get from them in the future. I think they will be a top 5 team soon enough.

Here we are, midway through 2018. I'm seeing a common trend amongst many communities right now in this market - frustration stemming from the uncertainty of regulations, the state of the longetivity of the market, and concerns of the prolonged downtrend that has almost reached 200 days.

There is good news to this. Shake out the nonbelievers who came into this space for a quick buck. The people that fomo'ed into the market in Dec 2017 are the ones that sold and we never saw them again. Everyone else has had their fair share of exposure and has been through market cycles.

I commend that, and despite some of the blunt feedback I've given, I will always support them. We need to accept that this is new territory.

e1vowsk,lubokkanev,37,"After discarding all the shit talk and personality smearing, the debate boils down to ""can the Bitcoin idea work?"". 

Supporters of the BCH fork of Bitcoin think Bitcoin can work and are fighting to preserve it. 

Supporters of the BTC fork of Bitcoin say that the idea has been flawed from the start. The idea to move the trust from the middleman to a decentralized network of competing miners (section 6 in the whitepaper) is not good enough, so **everyone** should always be running a full non-mining node, but that won't be possible if the blocks get bigger than ~200MBs today (though, with time and technological improvements, even 1GB blocks will be fine for home nodes soon). They also don't believe in the SPV node security (section 8 in the whitepaper). This is seemingly why they are against BCH and bigger blocks. Even taking all those points in consideration, it still doesn't explain their decision to not follow their word and go with the 2X upgrade, which would've increased the BTC block size cap to 2MB and made the chain much more reliable, without sacrificing any home non-mining full nodes. 

All of that makes me think there's something else that's incentivizing the BTC devs do act the way they do, and one explanation I'm seeing is that crippling BTC is making room for their other project - sidechains like LN, which will directly put money in their pockets. 

BCH is what Satoshi started in 2008, what has been working flawlessly till 2016 and what continues that path since August 2017. If I wanted something different I'd've gone with some ICO. BTC is a science project hijacking the Bitcoin network effect achieved by all the actual believers of Satoshi's idea, and it's doing it by censorship and propaganda. ",2018-07-06 16:48:37

Upgrading to Schnorr signatures merely requires a Soft Fork and I don't expect this to be controversial.

Benefits:

* Onchain transaction size is reduced allowing for more transaction throuput. **this upgrade would\* reduce the use of storage and bandwidth by at least 25\%**
* Better privacy for participants of a Multi-Signature wallets
* transaction validate faster making bitcoin more secure and scalable
* Combat certain forms of spam attacks

**\*This BIP merely is intended to integrate Schnorr signatures and does not imply signature aggregation thus this is the first step towards these benefits. Wallets would need to use signature aggregation to see these benefits.**

As so many people have stated - and it's hard to argue against - this market is akin to the dotcom boom and bust, but compressed into a shorter time span. 

Actually, the time span isn't a heck of a lot shorter - depends how long this bear market continues - but the comparison is so valid, it hurts.

The biggest difference, however, is that we already have an incredible success story (probably two). Bitcoin first and foremost - the driver of this entire scene. And then we get Ethereum, arguably the most important driver of DAPPS and really, this dotcom boom/bust type situation. An enabler of it, if you will.

EOS is a side show right now.

It seems to me that if Bitcoin totally crashes in price, it's going to take **everything** down with it, game over. That's unlikely to happen, so surely it's the wiser investment to make long term?

It's so tempting to pull everything in my portfolio out into USDT, wait for BTC to dump below $6k and just buy into it at that point, shove it in a wallet and forget about it for six months.

I don't think many of these will be deserving of being labeled under other for long... truly, but I will mention them here since I am getting lazy. lol.

* **Microsoft Server OS &amp; services:** I am talking about the stuff that was inside your servers at your offices for a long time now.  Not sure how to discuss them from an IT perceptive without just giving a lecture on what they are. You may google windows server and read up on these. They have been here for decades now and are ever evolving tomeet company needs. However on a side note, as an non IT investor, you may not know this but... one thing to realize about services like Amazon's AWS which host computers is that the virtualized computers that run INSIDE AWS's EC2s will still be other application/services. Things like windows, linux, oracle etc. So Microsoft still plays a role within AWS itself.
* **Linkedin:** These guys overpaid for something that investors weren't happy about and turned it profitable. Now everybody is happy with where it is/headed. It used to just be a social media app for businesses. But now its a legit competitor of [indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) as you can apply for jobs directly inside Linkedin. And more recently they have included educational services. I truly feel they are making this the one stop shop for businesses, from educating the individuals, to connect the people, hiring the people and building a community with business people. They own their own facebook which has no competition... really. I highly doubt we will see businesses protesting against linkedin the way they do with facebook and deactivate their profile.
* **Attitude towards Linux:** I love this about the new CEO, rather than being Linux's competitor.. they are starting to welcome the Linux community. In fact they offer Microsoft certifications for Linux integration in their database services, offer linux command lines in microsoft's powershell as an option and much more. And the recent purchase of GitHub only solidifies this push to marry Linux and Microsoft more and more. Microsoft is corporatizing linux while also opening it self up to open source. This is big considering how everything has been
* **GitHub:** Think about what they just bought... a depository/community for the world's largest open source code! This has everything in it. From website, programs, services code, to small scale student and what they wrote, you name it... even the code for bitcoin all these folks make their coins out of. And its a community forum too. They plan to integrate this as an easy to access service in to their products: Azure and Visual Studio. Github has lost quite a few linux users who hate microsoft with a passion. But the younger generation will not care and the scale of GitHub is too large for it to be abandoned over ego. I believe this may turn out in to a linkedin situation. Rather than tackling the corporate they are now tackling coders. Pure specualtion on this one, too early to tell but interesting none the less.
* **Xbox:** I never would have added this until I realized they are going to the cloud. Imagine gaming handled in the same form as Netflix. Such a crazy idea. You dont need hardware ($400-$700) to play games, Just sign in on your TV and select the game, pair your controller to your TV and Boom... You are playing. And guess who owns their own cloud hosting service? Sony will have to pay (to a company that will generate profit from hosting sony's content) to match the same thing that Microsoft will not have to pay a premium for... just the raw cost for running the service. Either Sony, Nintendo, etc will go with Microsoft's Azure (which I doubt since they compete) or go with AWS. This gives Microsoft a clear advantage in the next video game transition that is coming. And not to mention Microsoft is opening its self up to make their own games more and more (like Sony does). They bought 4 studios and already own minecraft.

However, I don't buy Sergio's interpretation that he has not spent any coins because of ""faith in bitcoin"".  

A better explanation, IMHO, is that he panicked when drug traffickers started to discuss bitcoin in their forums as a replacement for Liberty Reserve.  I think it is likely that he destroyed all traces of his involvement with the project, including his wallet (which was worth about $10 k at the time).

Unlike the bitcoiners, but like most normal people, he must have chosen to stay as far away from criminals as possible; and he should have feared to end up like the creator of Liberty Reserve, who is now serving a 30 year prison sentence in the US.   He was of course aware that the US government would identify him at once, if he tried to sell or spend any of those coins.

(Another less likely theory is that he was an NSA employee, tasked with developing a payment system that would let the CIA pay spies, saboteurs, and corrupt officials in other countries, bypassing their banking systems and government controls.  In that case, those 1.1 million BTC would not be his, but property of the US government -- who presumably has not found yet reason to use them.)",2018-07-07 23:55:50

e1xc30i,MobTwo,42,"If you're neutral to the Bitcoin debate, you should know a couple of facts. This is not an isolated incident where Bitcoin Core supporters went to Bitcoin Cash events to harass BCH supporters and/or to disrupt the events. Here is another example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfeg6W95t0Q

And it's definitely not the first time where a Bitcoin Core supporter make up bullshit and lies as they go along. For example, they can't even answer a simple question when asked. (In fact, in that video the guy keeps redirecting Roger's simple questions) For anyone who is interested, Bitcoin Core fees was around $55 per single transaction few months back. Last year, I wasted over $100 on transaction fees in Bitcoin Core. This make it totally useless as cash because who will want to lose $55 per single transaction each time they make a transaction. Source: https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/12/22/gregory-maxwell-celebrates-high-fees-300000-stuck-transactions

Now, the fees are lower because Bitcoin Core has a negative adoption rate which means businesses and users stopped using Bitcoin Core precisely because of unsustainable high fees, so there is no congestion for the time being. If adoption happens again, then the fees will rise above $55 per single transaction again. Do you want your money to lose $55 each time you use it?

Basically, that tells you what assholes these people are. They are unethical troublemakers whose life is dedicated to spreading toxicity. They certainly don't give a shit about people losing over $100 on transaction fees so why should you care about Bitcoin Core? That is why I used to support Bitcoin (BTC) and now I only care about Bitcoin Cash. These disgusting people and their actions have made me a Bitcoin Cash supporter and I'm dedicating my life to spread the adoption of Bitcoin Cash now.",2018-07-07 09:48:57

Charles believes altcoins will eventually rise more while Bitcoin slows and is a good sign for technology advancing the space

Charles says they are creating the next generation of ico platforms and will comply with regulations so that any icos will have to comply to use their platform which will appeal to more regulated businesses

Charles says Cardano can do everything Ethereum does but cheaper faster better and safer

Charles likes Roger Ver as a person but doesn't agree with Bitcoin Cash, doesnt like Craig Wright and doesnt care for Dan Larimer pretty much

Charles says a lot of interesting projects but of course believes Cardano is he best

Has 160 people on their team and says when they started he recruited the best from all over the world to work on Cardano

Charles says they are rebuilding the entire financial structure of business

Charles says people will begin to realize how BIG Cardano project is compared to others. His visions is for thousands of companies to form a collectively made structure for the financial industry governed in a decentralized manner'

Announcement coming soon in August about ATM mobile wallet and Cardano

If you think this will happen by 2020 then I applaud your optimism. Right now a tiny percentage of the worlds population have heard of blockchain, it may seem strange to us that live in reddit crypto subs and spend our hours watching charts but it is a fact. Govt's and large intstitutions are now just taking notice, and they move at a glacial pace.

Ethereum has the largest base of developers and interested parties (Ethereum Foundation). The chances of IOHK or ZIL getting anywhere close to that in 5 years is tiny and not something I would bet on. So if other blockchains do get sharding and POS soon they will still be under the radar enough to be eclipsed when ethereum catch up.

Remember smart contracts made platforms like Ethereum the potential bitcoin killer. That still hasn't happened 3 years on and realistically the flippening is still a year or two away.

e1z7mgb,where-is-satoshi,45,"Remember the **""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE""** sticker merchants once displayed? 

Now that blockstream/core added Replace-by-Fee (RBF), merchants must check if a customer has set the RBF flag or risk having the funds stolen with a simple RBF double-spend when the customer leaves the store. For the merchant to accept 0-conf instant transactions, merchants need to warn customers and thus need a:

**""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE BUT NO RBF""** sticker.

Well not quite. Putting aside for a moment that a merchant rejecting any customer is bad for business, blockstream/core also instituted artificial congestion with their 1MB blocksize limit. Thus, for the merchant to accept 0-conf, a merchant must examine the customer's TXs fee with respect to the Mempool fee distribution and Mempool size to ensure the TX joins the top 2000 Mempool TXs (those likely to be included in the next block) for an acceptable 0-conf risk. Naturally the customer(payer) must also check the Mempool fee distribution and size in order to meet the fee and flag conditions the merchant sets for non-cold-coffee. Merchants then really need to display a:

**""bitcoin ACCEPTED HERE BUT NO RBF &amp; TX FEE MUST BE IN TOP 2,000 FEE BAND OF CURRENT MEMPOOL""** sticker.

Now we're good right? Not even close. Even though a merchant can see the customer's TX in the top 2,000 Mempool transactions, at what rate are new TXs joining the Mempool and how likely will the customer's TX be bumped from the set of TX's likely included in the next block? With block time variance thrown in, a merchant can only guess at the likely risk (and I'll leave it up to the reader how such a sticker would be drafted). Luckily it doesn't matter now as the merchants have moved on from BTC in any case.

Bitcoin Cash, uncongested-by-design and free of RBF, need only a:

**""Bitcoin Cash ACCEPTED HERE""** sticker for a rockin' 0-conf!

*Todays Pick:*  **Dominika Cibulkova -2.5 (-127)** vs  Hsieh-S.W.

**Wimbeldon Tennis 06:30 AM EST**

Cibulkova has been on a nasty streak this tournament. She is yet to drop a set to anyone, even managed to take down Elise Mertens in straight sets only dropping 4 games. She is on the right track to make her 9th career quarter finals and I don't think Hsieh is going to stop her. Despite Hsieh taking down the number 1 seed Simona Halep. Halep herself looked tired and not focused. She just won her first grand slam and honestly I think she was content with losing if that meant she got a break from tennis for a little while. Even so it still took three long sets for Hsieh to pull off the upset. They got a days break from playing, but Cibulkova barely had to work for her win against Elise so she will be adequately rested. Hsieh also had 36 unforced errors against Simona. Cibulkova has a dominant first serve and won 81&amp;#37; of her first serve points in her last match. Those two are a recipe for disaster for Hsieh. I think Cibulkova has a strong chance at making it to semi finals at the way shes been playing. Lets take the Slovakian to win by 3 games and cover the -2.5 spread.

Also noting that BTC was 2.80x larger at the high than now that would mean the 2019 Christmas Bull run would put Bitcoin at $53,048.

That means in 1.5 years you could buy the bottom now and sell the top for a profit of $46,248 per BTC.

The average Lamborghini costs $200,000. If you play your hand perfectly, an investment of $29,406 or 4.32 BTC would land you a Lamborghini in 18 months.

e22e55e,Azuaron,5205,"I'm 4.

I become the most depressed and intelligent pre-K child in the history of the world, due to the abrupt loss of my wife and children. My parents don't understand what's happening, and I don't tell them, because it sounds absolutely crazy. I am not taken to a psychiatrist for years because we don't have insurance and can't afford it out of pocket.

I have behavioral problems at school. No one can deny my seemingly preternatural intelligence, but I'm so bored by the required work that, instead of doing what's assigned, I make up and solve my own calculus problems. I write code in programming languages that don't exist yet. I do not have access to a computer, and frequently demand access to a computer. My grades tank, I'm often sent to the principal's office for disrupting class. But, this is America, so I graduate grade after grade after grade. My fourth grade teacher recognizes how much I already know, and feeds me high school textbooks. It's a good year. The next year returns to normal, and crushes me.

In 8th grade, my mom's insurance coverage shifts, and psychiatric issues are finally covered. I go to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been living retrograde for about a decade. The sharp edges of grief have somewhat dulled, but the boredom of an adult living as a child has not. I extract a promise from the psychiatrist. A promise not to tell my parents, or my teachers, or the police, FBI, or _anyone_ what I'm about to tell him. He agrees.

I tell him I've been transplanted back into my own life from 2018, that I should be 41^1 with a wife and kids, and I've been dealing with this alone since I was 4. He doesn't believe me. I write him some computer code in versions of languages that don't exist yet. I write calculus problems and polar equations that I shouldn't understand. He thinks I'm a prodigy, but crazy.

I tell him George W. Bush will win the Presidential election. He thinks I'm guessing. I'm shouting now. I scream at him about 9/11, one year away. He's no longer laughing. I've made a mistake. He thinks I'm dangerous. He thinks I am planning 9/11. I try to backpedal, to say that it's Al Qaeda. He asks me if Al Qaeda speaks to me. I know I've lost him.

They put me on anti-psychotics. It kills my mood, stunts my mind, ruins my enthusiasm for everything. I'm no longer ""depressed"" or ""acting out"", so the treatment is hailed as a success. I get regular checkups from the psychiatrist.

9/11 happens. I'm dragged into a meeting with my parents, the psychiatrist, a police officer, and two men in suits. My parents don't understand what's happening. They try and get me to talk, but I refuse. They have all internet traffic from my house, some of which is embarrassing, but none of which is incriminating. I demand to be taken off the drugs and allowed to return to baseline. They agree. I am under house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I can go to school and home. I don't care; I never made friends, even my old friends from my past life were too juvenile.

A month later, a repeat of the meeting. How did I know about 9/11? I ask for a lawyer. They deny me one. I shrug and stop speaking. They get me a lawyer.

I tell my lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. She doesn't believe me. But says she'll work on my behalf as if she did. I agree.

We tell them nothing. The house arrest is a violation of my rights, and the Patriot Act doesn't exist yet (barely) for them to be able to hold me on suspicion of anything. My lawyer threatens to go public. They back off.

My freshman year grades are terrible. I realize I need my grades up if I want to go to the right college to find my wife, so I double down on my school work. I go from a D average screw off to acing every class. My teachers are confused, but relieved.

It's senior year. I apply to only one college. My parents think I'm crazy. I get in. I apply to the Honors Program. The Honors Program, where I met my wife nearly 30 years ago on my personal timeline, where I'd live in the same dorm building as her, and work late on the same engineering team as her, the time when our relationship began.

I don't get in. My grades are too low, after tanking my freshman year. I'm going to the right college, but I can't replicate the circumstances of our meeting.

There's hope, but it's a slim hope. I go to college. I know what clubs she goes to, what friends she has. I contrive to be wherever she is. I spend months in her orbit, working up to asking her out. How do you ask out someone you were with for 12 years, then lost 14 years ago, who doesn't remember you at all? How do you approach her with the baggage of your entire relationship that she has no knowledge of?

Eventually I do it. I ask her out. She says no. I don't understand. My entire world is crashing down around me. She is my wife, doesn't she understand? I go crazy, it scares her and she runs away. I try to follow her, but she hits a campus safety panic button.

With my history of ""mental illness"", I'm involuntarily committed. I spend a month in the asylum.

Two men in suits ""visit"" me one day. They say they can get me out. But, I have to tell them about 9/11. It's the FBI agents from all those years ago. I've given up. I tell them everything. They get me out. I'm setup with a nice house in the middle of nowhere, a good computer, state of the art internet. And I have to keep feeding them information about the future.

In my free time, I'm a software engineering consultant. The FBI pays my expenses, so anything I make is spare money. January 2, 2009 I've built a GPU beast of a computer. January 3, 2009 I start mining BitCoin. I mine a _lot_. I mine far more than anyone expected someone could mine so early. The BitCoin economy never takes off, because no one else can get in on the early mining with normal computing hardware. ""Cryptocurrency"" fails before it can even get a start.

Two years later the FBI approaches me, looking for more information about the future. I've got nothing left; I've told them everything I can remember.

They kick me out, and repossess all the computers they bought me, and ""appropriate as evidence"" all the ones I bought myself.

I've got nothing left. I wander the streets of small towns, hitchhiking half-hazardly. I lay down on a park bench one night.

The next morning, I don't get up.

*Todays Pick:* **Dominika Cibulkova ML(+114)** vs  Jelena Ostapenko

**Wimbeldon Tennis 07:50 AM EST**

This is easily the best match of the entire day tomorrow. Two of the most emotional and momentum oriented players in WTA. Ostapenko coming in as a slight favorite despite having an easier draw in my opinion. That being said she is playing one of the best momentum and confidence based players in Dominika. Cibulkova has been riding an insane wave the entire tournament, not dropping a single set. This is the girl who was bumped to an unseeded position so that Serena could be seeded. That put a fire under her ass, blasting through Cornet, Konta, Mertens, and easily defeating Hsieh who upset Halep in the 4th round. Both girls have had lack luster service games at certain times this tournament, but Cibulkova is faster off the returns and her forehand winners have been remarkable all tournament. Add that to the weight Ostapenko already has on her chest with an 0-2 record against the Slovakian.

2. This 10% drop was reversed after about 10 days, and the estimated hashrate is now once again at an all-time high when using the 504 block window. If hardware was destroyed by a flood, one would not expect the hashrate to bounce back so quickly.

***

I explained then, as I will now, the details of exporting luxury vehicles to China’s gray market. Keep in mind that I have only a state college education, the first two years of which were earned in prison.

Though still far from a true democracy, China has adopted many of Adam Smith’s economic principles, creating something of a meritocracy and laying the foundation for the Chinese version of the American Dream. Flush with wealth, the Chinese have also taken a shine to cars—big ones, with lots of leather, executive rear seating, and panoramic sunroofs that open up like a Colorado sunrise.

But China puts a heavy 25 percent tariff on new-car imports, in part to encourage manufacturers to build cars in its country. Combine this with car companies charging steeper prices for luxury vehicles there than they do in the U.S., and it is easy to see how exporters can turn a profit, even after shipping across the ocean and paying the likes of me. For example, the current base price of a new Range Rover is $88,345 here, but it starts at 1,518,000 yuan in China, which is about $240,000.

See, I wasn’t keeping any of these cars. I was buying them for a company in San Diego, which was fronting me the money. I was a straw buyer, the bottom rung of the ladder, kind of like a multilevel marketing recruit but without the ambition. It is slightly more glamorous than the life of a roadie or a towel boy, but only just. Important—critical, even—but not in any individual sense. In a band, I am the guy with a tambourine. Or maybe a cowbell.

The TSA guy listened to all this before he ran a background check on me, which probably raised a few eyebrows, due to my criminal record. But he wished me well and gave me his number, saying that this whole export business was something he was interested in, and that working for the TSA on Christmas Day sucked.

&gt;If you think that you have the right to sell a car you own to whomever you like, you are absolutely correct.

There are many ways for someone without education, experience, or ingenuity to make money in America. You will not get rich day-trading or flipping houses. Bitcoin? Bless your heart. But an enterprising individual can make $10,000 this month buying luxury cars. You need a heartbeat, a driver’s license, and that’s about it. It is not as simple as it sounds, but it’s not that hard, either. The manufacturers and their dealers have worked to design a foolproof system that will prevent you from buying a car to export to another country. Foolproof never works, though, as it underestimates the ingenuity of the fool.

Rewind back to the old, broke, and unemployed me on the porch. Hot. Out of ice, Coke, and most everything else. Even running low on Ten High. An old friend, always her own kind of trouble, says she’ll pay me to ride up to Tennessee with her. All I have to do is take a check into the Porsche dealership and sign the purchase documents. After a few months without work, I had grown comfortable doing nothing. But a half gallon of Ten High runs $14.99, and $750 would buy . . . 11 million gallons? I was drinking early that day.

At the Porsche store, things seemed to go well, considering I was prom-date drunk. I remained upright, produced the cashier’s check, and signed. “My boyfriend is going to buy me a Cayenne so I won’t tell his wife about us,” my friend lied. She had arranged the deal the week before. “Y’all don’t ask him any questions or take so long that he sobers up.”

We drove the Porsche to a storage unit a few miles away. I signed a release for the truck driver who would pick up the Cayenne and left the keys and paperwork with the Go Store It manager. I got my $750.


When the driver of the multicar transport truck pulled off the expressway, he knew he was picking up a new Porsche Cayenne that, according to his bill of lading, would wind its way through the Appalachian Mountains to the port in Baltimore, Maryland. After U.S. Customs and Border Protection verified that it was not stolen, presumably it would then be driven onto a roll-on/roll-off vessel and sail to China. The truck driver, however, seeing the Porsche dealership, did the natural thing and pulled in. Whereupon he presented his papers and advised somebody that he was there to pick up Travis Simpkins’s new Cayenne.

If you think that you have the right to sell a car you own to whomever you like, you are absolutely correct. You also have the right to not sell it, which is why luxury-car dealers—BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche, specifically—refuse to sell new cars to known or suspected exporters and maintain blacklists to prevent the likes of me from doing what I had just been caught doing.

In short order, I received a phone call from the dealership’s general manager. He was angry. He had reason to be. I had signed a document promising not to export the car and agreeing to pay $8500 if I did, a piece of paper I quite obviously regarded as legally binding as a pinkie swear. But if Porsche caught him in bed with me on this sale, the dealership could possibly be fined even more than that or be punished in other ways, like having its allocation of new vehicles reduced.

We both said some regrettable things in an email exchange that followed. He indicated he would not be processing the paperwork on the Cayenne, I would not be getting a title, that I was an exporter, and he knew it because the truck driver had shown him the bill of lading. I informed him that he had already committed a criminal act, which may or may not have been true since I just made it up. He demanded that I return the Cayenne immediately, with no miles on it. I asked him if he was unfamiliar with the perils of rolling back an odometer. Had he not seen Ferris Bueller’s Day Off? We both threatened to have the other thrown in jail. Southern jails being, well, southern jails, we both knew that while I would be catching up with old friends, he might discover exactly what happens when the rabbit gets the gun.

Mr. General Manager’s parting blow was that I hadn’t heard the last from him. He was right: A fantastic gift basket from Blackberry Farm was delivered to my house, courtesy of the dealership. Apparently the GM forgot to let his marketing department know. But he did FedEx the tag office in Georgia with the deal paperwork. I don’t know where the law fell on our transaction, but those jelly jars were so good they ought to be illegal.

&gt;A single car can earn a straw buyer anywhere from $500 to $7000 in commission. It’s enough to take the kids to Disneyland but nothing you can build a career on.

I made friends with my first Land Rover sales consultant about a month after buying that Cayenne. Let’s call her Ashley. She was as pretty as a homecoming queen and not much older. She loved Garden &amp; Gun magazine, which she complained was always stolen from the lounge, so I bought her a subscription. A dealer’s lounge is a nice place to spend an afternoon. This one smelled like cedar and summer camp, and it had something like 17 different Keurig coffees, plus pastries and a staggering variety of granola bars.

Just across the street from Ashley’s Land Rover store, the same dealership chain had a Porsche showroom with a similar lounge. I was relaxing there, in the process of buying another Cayenne a couple weeks after she had sold me a Range Rover Sport, when in she walked with her sales manager. I tried to hide behind one of those big fake plants, hoping they’d leave before the Porsche manager came back with my keys and bill of sale. I eat when I’m nervous, which, aside from making me improperly sized for hiding behind anything, led to my devouring quite a few granola bars while peering through the leaves.

It worked out okay. I got the Cayenne, though I paid the price on that one later in the evening when the snacks turned on me. And so did that dealer chain eventually, but only after I had bought more cars from them. I am not banned from their property, but I’m definitely not welcome there today. Screw ’em. They never even sent me a gift basket.

Guess which crypto Vitalik has been advising the most out of any crypto out there? That's right, Omisego. Their dev teams are consistently with each other and not afraid to show the world of their relationship. Vitalik (at least in my opinion), is not out there to cheat anyone in the world as many of these scam ICO creators are. He would not jeopardize his character by falsely leading/advising Omisego when he has Ethereum's reputation to still uphold. If he did't fully believe in Omisego, he would not show this much public showing with them. He know's something about the project we don't. In fact, for the sake of Ethereum and it's scaling issues, Vitalik NEEDS Omisego to survive and break currency barriers via plasma. And Vitalik, just like Elon Musk, is a man of the people and a person who wants to further the human race. If the Binance CEO (who will likely make 1B in revenue profits this year) is even saying that Vitalik is ""king-like"" in the crypto industry and that *king* happens to be on our side, why are we losing focus?

e25nrhe,DCinvestor,47,"Not sure if anyone left here is investing over multi-year time horizons, but in case there are, here are some refinements on my recent thoughts:

The first big crypto bubble in 2013/2014 was probably driven by China entering the Bitcoin market, spurring insane retail hype taking BTC to $1K.  Our latest 2017/2018 bubble was undoubtedly driven primarily by ICOs, taking ETH to $1.4K and BTC along for the ride to $20K.  My prediction is that security tokens will fuel the next big bubble up within the next 1 to 1.5 years, in an overall bubble that will take at least 3 to 6 years to hit dot com bubble levels (longer timeframe due to likely entry by financial institutions, which will probably trickle in).  And it's possible it will pop again within that 1.5 to 3 year timeframe with another 80% retrace from whatever the new all time high is, before running up to possible dot com levels of hype within 3 to 6 years (i.e., maybe the *big* bubble).

All of these financial dapps (0x, Maker, Augur, Digix, Request Network) are effectively in ""beta,"" on Ethereum which is also effectively in a working ""beta,"" pre-L1 scaling.  These dapps, and others still to emerge, will be battle tested and ready for prime time as L1 scaling hits.  And most of them will only reinforce the security token value proposition, as the protocols can be upgraded to support them.  And virtual / in-game property and L2 will add fuel to that speculative fire.

Like anyone here making a prediction, I may be wrong, but I'm betting on it over that timeframe by just holding most of my ETH through whatever remains of this bear.  Let the games begin.",2018-07-11 07:28:11

https://www.tradingview.com/x/WPjYI2qL/

The pattern bears have set up isn't strong, though. It looks more like a [descending broadening wedge](http://thepatternsite.com/dbw.html) (inside a much larger falling wedge).

https://www.tradingview.com/x/SKSm1EWJ/ 

Bears can make the case a little better when you zoom in to the 4 hour chart. It's possible there's a much larger correction that's needed. Maybe we need to confirm the double bottom we made on the 12 hour chart?

If we don't at least do that then we're destined for an iH&amp;S on the 12H

Pair that with the divergence we're seeing from the OBV and you're back to a strong bull case again.

e261oez,knifeproz,36,"I'll try to make it simple:
Bitcoins are a form of online currency. Besides buying the currency from other people that already have it, you may wonder how those people have acquired this currency. 
Basically there's a system on which they are formed, called a blockchain. On this blockchain, it is what it sounds like, a chain of blocks, with each block containing transactions. Those may be things such as X Y Z user acquired X amount of coins, or spent coins, sent coins to X Y Z user, etc. For the chain to progress, users dedicate their CPU or GPU power to the blockchain and attempt solving complex puzzles only the computers can handle.This is called mining. Hence the term mining bitcoin originated. There are other coins on the market such as ethereum, litecoin, etc. that also use blockchain technology in order to generate the currency. In the beginning of the chain, puzzles are very easy, take less time to solve and give you a bigger reward, say 500 coins. Each coin (bitcoin, ether, litecoin, etc) have a different ""max amount"" of currency you can acquire from its respective blockchain before the chain is depleted and will not generate any further currency. Because of this, the further you progress in the block chain, the less of a reward you get from mining, but the value of the coins also rises, as the necessary equipment, time, and energy spent on mining needs to somehow be worth it. Users have created these things called pools, which is like a collection of people that you can join, on the same ""server"" and they all put in their efforts to mine a block. If someone on their server is sucessful at mining a block, everyone gets a share of the reward as a split, and it moves on to the next block.",2018-07-11 11:02:33

I wrote a mail to her. Feel free to hate me for my pseudoknowledge and add things:

1. That is not true - if you would check by in the subreddit you would definitly see that the main community is mostly interested  in the tech and that there are a lots of people who try to help and to analyze anything thats going on. I guess you are somehow living in a social platform bubble - where people just act as we all know they act in every single social platforms, like assholes  and ignorants. \[maybe I should have added that they should look at their own community and their way of hating IOTA.\]
2. They obviously have a roadmap for their scalability. Please read up on Economic Clustering, Swarm Nodes and Local Snapshots. Sure the PoW is done by wallets, thats their protocol design? It's there to prevent spam on the network. ""and research suggests their security does not hold unless all users near-24/7 do PoW. obviously this presents a scalability issue.""--&gt; It is designed for billions of IOT-devices and sensors, so there may be a lot of spam someday, rightwhich directly points us to the coordinator - which is in fact a serious thing to talk about. But as you said the network is not safe at the moment - because there is no real throughput at the moment and so it's very easy to get 33&amp;#37; of the network throughput  --&gt; which is why the coordinator is in place.
3. As far as I understood they want to shift to something like network bound proof of work - but thats a point where im not quite familiar with their plans to be honest! Sorry about that.
4. Its not called beta. But I did adress this in 2) and I think that training wheels is quite a good description - despite the  fact that the system wouldn't work right now without the coordinator - so 1 point for you and 1 point for IOTA I would say  :)
5. 
6. There will always be the question of how decentralized /distributed you want to or you have to be.But I guess If something like IOTA reaches their goals there will be thousands of big full nodes.Blockchain is decentralized because they have a lot of decentralized ledgers but they aren't decentralized when it       comes to their miners, because there are \~9 farms at ethereum and bitcoin which provide most of the hashpower in the network  (not quite decentralized, right?)
7. there is a viability plan and I guess there are much more projects out there which aren't close to the professionalism of the IOTA-Team. Some people are investing in it because they want to earn  alot of money with it. Some are investing because they want to give them money to reach their quite complicated goals - which is quite a big part. In either way people are supporting the project because THEY want to.
8. \--&gt;1.

There are going to be hundred of services that get built on top of Augur, ranging from sophisticated betting platforms, to derivative financial markets, to insurance markets, and a variety of tools that will help root out corrupt and opaque behavior around the world- by allowing market betting on the outcome of just about *anything*.  And yes, there will be some negatives that come along with the creation of something this powerful, as there always are with revolutionary technologies and financial concepts.

It's going to take years, but they have just started something that is very, very big with profound implications that I can barely wrap my head around.

e28mhqz,PRC20,40,"Aside from the recent price action, there’s a genuine need to address key factual errors now circulating around the CBOE applying for a Bitcoin ETF.  Above all else is the fact that the product in question is not – technically – an ETF structure rather a Trust (only slightly different than GBTC).

The distinction between an ETF and a Trust is critically important. The former is where price impacting volume and demand would originate. The same does hold for the latter, just nowhere near the same level of amplification as an ETF. What the Trust does provide, and a point not to be downplayed, is a much clearer signal of the intentions of accredited investors and sell side trading desks. 

What I would like to advise is that those of you looking for actual information on the product in question read through the Notice itself:

[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2018/34-83520.pdf)

What should be addressed at this time are the following three, inter-related, points all gleamed, and referenced, from the above-linked Notice. 

First, on page 3, it states that the product will be physically backed – not a synthetic product – meaning that the Trust (again, not an ETF) will be backed by BTC and not derivatives. 

Second, on page 4, is a statement that “the Trust intends to achieve this objective by investing substantially all of its assets in Bitcoin traded primarily in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets”. 

Third – although worded enigmatically – on page 10 “the Sponsor estimates that the US dollar OTC Bitcoin trading volume globally represents on average approximately fifty percent of the trading volume of Bitcoin traded globally in US dollar on US dollar denominated Bitcoin exchanges.” 

As always, I’m aware that this is a trading sub. The commentary and points above may be of very little value to many of you here. That said, it remains my personal opinion that since April we have been witnessing a period of aggressive price discovery by parties (however defined) unfamiliar with the entire crypto ecosystem.

For Bitcoin, I find 2 &amp; 3 the most troubling. Being the old boy, it has a huge advantage in attracting talent, but the community has done a poor job of converting that talent to productivity. Ethereum much better.

1 &amp; 5 will be fixed by 2020, so not long-term concerns. First Gen cars were huge polluters, not as much now.

7 is the most profitable question to answer. Granted I know it's a morale question, in a way, but whomever solves Governance ON blockchain will secure a significant advantage. But largely I agree the tech is too new, but I'll also add political systems are sort of 'new' as well.

When you increase the speed of communication, new political systems form. Blockchain provides reliable global communication, which will create new political systems. This is not a maybe, it must, it's as unstoppable as humans. However, this new system will be the first Global system, that is not Highly management based.

Today you have two major systems, the Swiss / US system, and the China / Russia / Iran system. These two systems have methods of elections for those who rule, but citizens are not involved directly (as they are for Mayors). The Bilderbergs, for example, are the old guards of the Swiss / US system.

In either case, we are likely to move toward a merger of these systems, which would (presumably) reduce global war posturing. Likewise, having citizens more directly involved and knowledgeable will reduce anxieties and fears. Lastly, you will have pocket scientists getting distributed globally, as opposed to only being able to find work locally. Tesla trains people, Harvard does, but sometimes a rando in Nigeria loves physics and gets paid $1 / hr. These situations will be better arbitraged.

The cumulative effect of reducing war posturing, lowering citizen anxiety, and amplifying the current level of genius to the cutting edge, will in turn create an innovation boom. At this stage of human development, we are preparing to terraform Earth, and discover infinite energy (it's a misconception that energy is costly, it's free if you can manipulate the Earth).

After this, what you will see is an explosion in robotic planters, animal breeders, and human caretakers. A bit more like the Jetsons, than the Matrix, but much more like Johnnie Appleseed with an adderall addiction. Less 'random flying' and more ass tons of crop and animal production, grown via robots, in a healthy natural environment. This concept will be exported to the Martian planet.

Prior to the colonization of Mars, around the time we discover 'infinite energy', we will create a electrified magnet field which will mimic the properties of gravity, and deflect nuclear radiation. Currently the Sun nukes everything outside of Earths magnetic field 24x7. The space station is like 400 miles up, the moon is 80,000 miles. That's ass tons of radiation, similar with any real space travel, and colonizing Mars. Deflecting the radiation is the primary problem, which will be solved through a magnetic shield, which will also act as something of a force field (for energy waves), and will create gravitational forces simultaneously.

From Mars, we will access infinite amounts of Metals, which we will use to build space craft, without depleting the Earth of mass. Humans will (likely) become a scarce resource, as spacefaring will kill many, and populating new planets requires a few million at least, I would think, and then space another several million. I suspect the Earth might need to produce 250 million new humans annually, just to account for the massive deaths and colonization of space and planets. Something like that (that may not be necessary, who knows).

Maybe 300 years later we might make reciprocal contact with a foreign species, not native to our solar system. Perhaps communication will only be through light waves, but in 300 years, after colonizing space and mars, we will have a much better idea of what to look for in discovering other similar forms of life.",2018-07-13 23:54:03

Immediately random bursts of laughter emitted from the darkness.

“I hold a bit of litecoin..”

Immediately -  deep laughter bellowed from the crowd.

”I also hold a bit of REQ for the long term“ - Everyone in the crowd began laughing hard 

”But my main holding is VTC” - the room shook like a thunderstorm as people began simultaneously laughing and crying. They bent over grasping for breath through their uncontrollable laughter.

Boys, what the fuck happened the past few days. Anyhow we move forward, and far as hell away from CIS counter strike since they are trolling my bank roll recently. I can understand a bad beat, but damn did I lose some cash yesterday.

Todays pick G2 2-0 against Virtus Pro. We're going to declare this the clash of the trash. Virtus Pro have won 2 matches since beginning of June. Both of those being MDL matches against Vexed Gaming, and Fragsters. They have looked absolutely awful in the recent months, and yesterday nearly got 16-0'd by Fragsters on Train. Train is one of the current VP's goto maps for some success. They managed one T side round. This after losing one of their star players Snax to mousesports and picking up Morelz from a tier 2 Polish team Tomorrow. Virtus Pro has fallen off as far as to ban Nuke against Fragsters yesterday. A virtus pro team who is scared to play notoriously one of their best maps. That goes to show how far this team has fallen. Overall they don't have the motivation to match this new G2 lineup. Yeah G2 has played like shit as well, wouldn't be called the clash of the trash for nothing. That being said KennyS is still playing extremely well, and did so against BIG in Cologne. You have to remember BIG took down FaZe as well, it wasn't a fluke that they dominated G2 on one of the maps. They were peaking individually.  Just seems to me these odds on a newly formed G2 team is worth the gamble in comparison to this Virtus Pro team who blatantly doesn't give a shit anymore. Lets take the French squad to get a 2-0 over VP tomorrow, and likely get way overrated for their next match in which we'll fade it.

e2b1xg7,53r0coo1,37," The Bitcoin market failed to test the resistance zone again, and soon  after, we found the support levels to weak to sustain the previous run.  Bitcoin dropped quite sharply to about $6100 where we saw the buyers  showing their interest again. What to look out for going into the  weekend, [lets take a look at the contradicting signals](https://cryptosignals.trade/forums/topic/bitcoin-btc-price-analysis-july-2018/#post-17919) on the chart. 

I see quite a lot of market reports on Tradingview and in our  community focusing on the possibility of a inverse H&amp;S pattern  forming. It is important to remember that this formation will only be  considered when ALL the conditions are met. Until then it is just a  “possible Inv H&amp;S”. I see that many traders are stating that it is  already a confirmed pattern, this is false, we will need to see the  prices break above the neckline to confirm this as possible bullish  reversal pattern.

Notice how the possible Inv H&amp;S is busy trading inside what some  would call, a massive bear flag. I will take both situations into  consideration and will prepare myself in the following manner. Should  prices drop below $6100, i would expect the $6000 level to get tested,  should this fail as support I will consider going short on the markets  again, target will most likely be the previous lows that got tested.

Should the prices consolidate above $6380, I will expect a retest of  the previous resistance levels, which happens to be our INV H&amp;S  necline. There could be a quick long to play between $6400 –  $6600/$6800, if the market graces us with the above mentioned scenario.

For those looking at the safest entry into the market, be patient and  wait for the market to consolidate above $6800 – $7000 before going  long.",2018-07-13 17:01:09

So the wallet got kind of thick now, and it's more convenient to exchange those 40 notes for a few larger ones if you can.

Similarly in Bitcoin, each transaction you receive gives you a separate ""banknote"" with some bitcoins. It doesn't cost anything to keep them, but it costs more in fees to spend them than one large one, so it makes sense to make use of periods when fees are low to exchange those smaller banknotes into larger ones, so when you actually need to spend them later when fees might be larger, you only pay for 1 and not for 40.

e2hcdqg,freework,81,"Roger Ver, I really like what you're doing in regards to spreading the word of censorship, but I feel your focus on r/Bitcoin is diluting your message. Way more important that reddit censorship is the censorship of the bitcoin-dev mailing list.

All open source projects have an official dev discussion group. Sometimes it's a forum, but most of the time it's a mailing list.

I've been involved with open source development for the past 2 decades and I've never come across a single open source dev discussion group where censorship has been employed like it has with bitcoin-dev.

In my opinion, you should shift your efforts away from telling everyone about reddit being censored, and towards telling everyone about bitcoin-dev being censored.

I remember back in 2015 when I made my first post to bitcoin-dev. It was right after Gavin made his BIP101 pull request. There was a thread on bitcoin-dev about the topic, and it was Gavin vs. like 20 other people who were against it. I though the people arguing against Gavin were making bad arguments, and so I decided to join in and give Gavin some backup. My first 2 or 3 messages went through, but once the moderators caught on that I was not toeing the small block party line, they immediately put me on the black list. To this day when if I try to make a post to that mailing list, it'll go straight to the moderator queue, where it will likely never see the list. Also the moderators of bitcoin-dev claim that all moderated messages get posted to the bitcoin-dev-moderated list, but I've posted stuff there that has neither made it to the mail list, not has it made it to the moderated list. In other words, their ""mod logs"" are bogus.

I also remember back in 2016 when the segwit debate was goin on, some people would say things like ""Obviously 100% of the developer community supports segwit, just look at the dev mailing list, 100% of everyone who posts there agrees with the segwit roadmap!""",2018-07-16 23:09:16

People in this market are high-risk/high-reward speculators by and large.

I'm a bit of a long-term guy so am holding my current VEN in MEW (waiting for the Ledger support), and as we go down I am accumulating more. Then when the price rebounds to what it was previous to the token swap (and it will get there), then I'll sell my excess VEN (which will be VET by then), and then I'll have the profits from that, and my original Xnode amount as it was before, producing me regular VTHO.

every shorter thinks they are an experienced scalper because they had months and months of being able to make money just by shorting any kind of quick rise.

same way bulls think they are an experienced scalper when they make money in a bull market by buying the dip 

changing your mind set is hard, its human nature to double down when you suddenly start losing money. Its basics psychology.

$6,400 didn't hold? its ok, I'll open another short at $6600 and average down my position. BGD to $7,500? Has to be a fake out, I'll double down again. And on and on and on, until they get to $10,000 and spend the next 2 days without sleep because they have to baby sit their position and pray that $10,000 holds. Then even that goes down, and not only do they lose all the money they made during the bear market, they also lose their original investment. And then you get another /r/buttcoin user who'll tell anyone who'll listen that Bitcoin is an overpriced scam.

Thats why the market doesn't just go up or down. It oscillates to give people like that hope, because when they suddenly see it going down again, they get full of hope, but never close when they are only down 5%, they keep holding hoping to break even. And if breakeven comes, they then continue holding to make a tiny bit more profit.

That's the difference between real traders and gamblers. Real traders know when to cut their losses when the market reverses. Gamblers continue using the same strategy they've been using for months.

Trump, ?thank for writing back . . . do ?nd anyt[h]ing interesting in the docs i posted?? On or about August 17, 2016, the Conspirators added, ?please tell me if i can help  anyhow . . . it would be a great pleasure to me.? On or about September 9, 2016, the Conspirators, again posing as Guccifer 2.0, referred to a stolen document posted online and asked the person, ?what do think of the info on the turnout model for the democrats entire presidential campaign.? The person responded, ?[p]retty standard.?

Also corroborated is that the Russian government was in total control of the personas ""Guccifer 2.0"" and ""DCLeaks"". On pages 16/17 of the Indictment:

&gt; 45. The Conspirators conducted operations as Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks using overlapping
computer infrastructure and financing.

&gt; a. For example, between on or about March 14, 2016 and April 28, 2016, the Conspirators used the same pool of bitcoin funds to purchase a virtual private network account and to lease a server in Malaysia. In or around June 2016, the Conspirators used the Malaysian server to host the dcleaks.com website. On or about July 6, 2016, the Conspirators used the VPN to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The Conspirators opened that VPN account from the same server that was also used to register malicious domains for the hacking of the and DNC networks.

There's probably more. The indictment is pretty comprehensive and detailed. But TL;DR --&gt; A candidate for Congress reached out to the hackers and was given stolen data/information about their opponent (which is illegal). Roger Stone was all-but verified to have been in contact with the Russian government, and the Russian Government was behind ""Guccifer 2.0"" and ""DCLeaks"" refuting their previous assertions that Guccifer was a lone Romanian hacker.

EDIT: I'd like to add one additional piece of information here, and that is that this indictment revealed also that on the *same day* that Donald Trump said:

&gt; “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Mr. Trump said, referring to emails Mrs. Clinton had deleted from the private account she had used when she was secretary of state. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”

They attempted to hack the personal offices of Hillary Clinton.

On page 7 of the Indictment:

&gt; For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the conspirators attempted after-hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office,” according to the indictment, referring to spearphishing, a common tactic used to target email accounts.",2018-07-17 01:35:32

e2hrogg,djphan,74,"I was particularly interested in the charges and how specific and detailed they got... it sort of gives you an idea the breadth of the sources they must have pulled from...  

For example in the [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download):  

&gt;In or around September 2016, the Conspirators also successfully gained access to DNC computers hosted on a third-party cloud-computing service.  These computers contained test applications related to the DNC’s analytics.  After conducting reconnaissance, the Conspirators gathered data by creating backups, or “snapshots,” of the DNC’s cloud-based systems using the cloud provider’s own technology.  The Conspirators then moved the snapshots to cloud-based accounts they had registered with the same service, thereby stealing the data from the DNC.

This was most likely AWS but can't confirm which cloud provider they used... but it is a pretty trivial thing to prove once all that information is contained within a provider... This also contradicts a lot of popular talking points about 'not having access to the servers' because as it turns out.. they actually did through the cloud provider....  

Another thing to note on that... you don't necessarily need physical access to 'the servers' to prove that you got hacked and by whom... Most actions you take on any computing device leaves a log.. either on the server, pc or network device.. and most large companies will use a [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)... which is a centralized logging server which sends logs from all the other endpoints to it... [Logs are admissible in court](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/08/12/using-log-data-as-forensic-evidence/)... 

That is relevant because you would deploy a SIEM for situations just like the below from the indictment:  

&gt;During the hacking of the DCCC and DNC networks, the Conspirators covered their tracks by intentionally deleting logs and computer files.  For example, on or about May 13, 2016, the Conspirators cleared the event logs from a DNC computer.  Conspirators deleted logs from the AMS panel that documented their activities on the panel, including the login history. 

The use of a SIEM is speculation on my part but that is a tool that can be used to prove the above... someone deleting logs on a device to remove their trails... There are other ways to get this evidence however none of which necessitates having physical access to the device...  

The below also looks to be a key link:

&gt;More than a month before the release of any documents, the Conspirators constructed the online persona DCLeaks to release and publicize stolen election-related documents.  On or about April 19, 2016, after attempting to register the domain [electionleaks.com](https://electionleaks.com), the Conspirators registered the domain [dcleaks.com](https://dcleaks.com) through a service that anonymized the registrant.  The funds used to pay for the [dcleaks.com](https://dcleaks.com) domain originated from an account at an online cryptocurrency service that the Conspirators also used to fund the lease of a virtual private server registered with the operational email account [dirbinsaabol@mail.com](mailto:dirbinsaabol@mail.com).  The dirbinsaabol email account was also used to register the john356gh URL-shortening account used by LUKASHEV to spearphish the Clinton Campaign chairman and other campaign-related individuals. 

To translate that... domain registration usually lists information of the person/organization of the registrant... it's a WHOIS record and it's listed for every website in the public domain... There are services that anonymize that information for you and replace the contact information with their service's contact... It looks like they linked the payment to that service with an online cryptocurrency service which they also linked to a cloud server(possibly same as above) they paid for using the same bitcoin account and that was also linked to a URL shortening account(Bitly) involved in the Podesta breach... the GRU controlled bitly account was also referenced in [Crowdstrike's report ](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/russia-responsible-podesta-wikileaks-hack-230095)of the DNC breach btw...  

There is a lot of great detail in here including the section on how they funded everything through bitcoin, the various personas they used and how they tried to obfuscate everything...  By and large.. the special counsel's sources are surely both wide and deep as you can see from the indictment... ",2018-07-17 02:50:31

Ryx not playing any FPL since the minor, means I doubt they have been practicing much for this upcoming match at all. Outside factors alone are worth the shot at the +4.5. Much more important to [Vireo.Pro](https://Vireo.Pro) since they only have two matches left and already have 3 losses. Dignitas are 9-0 and have some matches left against teams out of the running for MDL playoffs and already considered easy wins. Lets hope Dignitas come up a little jet lagged and burnt out of CS.

You mean to tell me that these master hackers that were Russian agents somehow knew enough to ""spearphish"" the DNC to break into their computers and install ""X-Agent"" but these same master hackers were stupid enough to not completely cover their tracks?

And somehow, the DNC hired a security company to try to stop the master hackers, but the Russians were still hacking up until October 2016 because they were so good...and yet...these same master hackers tried (unsuccessfully) to cover their tracks with CCLEANER????

This, in a paragraph that followed another one talking about the DNC's Linux servers. WHEN CCLEANER IS A WINDOWS PROGRAM.

I'm supposed to believe that somehow, two years after the fact, the FBI's crack cybersecurity team was able to retroactively track down all of this hacking activity, including stuff that was searched on internal Russian servers, including the dates (of or around) when all this happened, even though they had no clue that this was going on while it was going on?

Oh, and Bitcoin isn't as anonymous as we previously thought?  


I've got enough technical knowledge to know that logs are generally rotated on an ongoing basis or they will quickly fill up a damn server. So I'm supposed to believe that the master hackers tried to but did not fully delete logs that the idiots at the DNC were not monitoring as well as they should have been, and two years later, the FBI has proof of these hacking attempts, despite multiple VPNs and Bitcoin dummy accounts being used...  


So either the FBI has a master database of all Internet traffic and a massive AI to sort through all this data, or this is a reconstructed pile of bullshit.

As we moved closer to 6.8k, the shorters had mostly gotten their positions earlier and didn't have fuel to push the market down, and the bulls had already built up positions at the sub 6k, but tons of people realized what was going on (everyone in my group, and every other group I'm in was very long, one dude banked 33btc off the move), and started longing at 6.7k.  Eventually, they broke through 6.8k, causing all the shorts that had stops or liquidations at 6.8k-6.9k to close or get liquidated.  This pushed the price up as 10's of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin contracts got liquidated.  Meaning, people who had short positions had their position closed and the remaining value of it was thrown into the bitmex liquidation engine which had to buy and equivalent amount of long contracts to their original short positions.  So 10's of millions of dollars were forced to buy bitcoin contracts to close out their short positions automatically by the margin trading engine of sites, and that pushed the price up till it started hitting new stops.  7k, 7.1k, 7.2k, 7.3k.

Dana Rohrabacher the maximum allowed $5,400 campaign contribution in Bitcoin weeks after he claimed to help arrange a meeting with Rohrabacher and Julian Assange. 

Rod Rosenstein presented the latest indictments against the 12 Russian Intelligence officers July 13.  During this short speech, Rod Rosenstein stated: “In an effort to conceal their connections to Russia the defendants used a network of computers around the world and they paid for it using cryptocurrencies.”  ^[[2]](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/07/13/rod-rosenstein-doj-mueller-indictment-russia-12-officers-hacking-dnc-2016-election-sot.cnn/video/playlists/russia-hacking/)

Rohrabacher traveled to London in August of 2017  to meet with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails.  Rohrabacher says Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[4]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)

It was Chuck Johnson who, oddly enough, helped set up the meeting and wrote in an email to The Times that the meeting was the result of a “desire for ongoing communications” from both Rohrabacher and Assange.

Rohrabacher would detail some specifics to The Times, but in an interview with the Daily Caller, he was more explicit, saying he and Assange talked about “what might be necessary to get him out” and suggested they discussed a presidential pardon in exchange for information on the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. ^[[5]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-right-wing-blogger-charles-c-johnson-1502992726-htmlstory.html)

This is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8opgjn/charlottesville_hate_marcher_elected_by/e05d4ga/?context=3) to a post detailing the gesture.

The article, written by Michael Isikofff, co author of Russian Roulette, reports that Chuck Johnson is not looking to cooperate ongoing investigations: 

&gt;A controversial “alt-right” journalist and provocateur who met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London this week says he is refusing to turn over documents and emails requested by the Senate Intelligence Committee about any contacts he has had with Russian agents, telling Yahoo News he has no intention of cooperating with the panel’s investigation.

Johnson claimed he would “absolutely not” cooperate:
 
&gt;“They’re going to have to subpoena me and then they’ll  be sorely disappointed,” he added. Johnson said his lawyer would raise journalistic “privilege” issues to resist turning over any communications he might have had with Russian nationals or agents. 

The article states Johnson appeared to be the first figure in the Russia probe to make such a defiant position publicly, “refusing to cooperate in any way with the committee probe”.

A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting between Assange and Rohrabacher stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[6]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

 An exchange in an interview in Jan 2017, Hannity inquired if Assange could say to the American people that he didn’t get his info about the DNC and Podesta’s emails from Russia:

&gt;”Can you say to the American people, unequivocally, that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's emails, can you tell the American people 1,000 percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?"" -Hannity

&gt;”Yes,"" Assange said. ""We can say — we have said repeatedly — over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party."" ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

It was not addressed if Assange knew that the people behind Guccifer were Russian agents, but it is unlikely that a hacker/cypherpunk like Assange would not have understood the implications based on the coverage blaming Russia for the DNC hack.  ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

This means that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly spread disinformation about the Seth Rich conspiracy that he was the source of the leaks without confirming it outright. According to the Associated Press:

&gt;It was Assange who first floated the idea into the mainstream, bringing up Rich's case in an interview with Dutch television the following month…

&gt;…During all this time, the indictment alleges, WikiLeaks knew full well that Guccifer 2.0 was its source, cajoling the account's operators to hand it more data and ordering rival journalists to steer clear. ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

**Also**

Julian Assange and Wikileaks have asserted that they benefitted handsomely from Bitcoin, claiming %50,000 return.  Assange tweeted in October of 2017.  

&gt;“My deepest thanks to the U.S. government, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCad, Paypal, AmEx, Moneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin—with &gt; 50,000% returns.” ^[[8]](https://www.coindesk.com/julian-assange-bitcoin-major-intellectually-interesting-development/)

e2k1yo7,shiznx,129,"Tl;dr Had 60 bitcoins when the market jumped to 14,000 a piece, sold everything.

I have a succesful answer to this question. I spent a lot of time in the black market. I would buy weed from time to time, but most of my money was spent on cheap giftcards for food and grocery. I always had a surplus of bitcoin in my account, because I hated going through the process of adding into my account.

At one point I had over 100 bitcoins back when I was buying them for 20-30$ a piece, I entered the market originally when they were about 1c a piece. I always knew the value of the bitcoin would rise simply because it’s a finite resource. Before the first leap of one bitcoin jumping up to 300$ I had probably had a good 60 bitcoins in my account, which if I had cashed out at the time would have still been a lot of money. 

Most of my income is made of investing into stock and currency, so I had faith in bitcoins so I let them sit in my account for another year, knowing that the price was going to rise. The craziest day of my life ensured when I saw the prices rise into the thousands, having previous investing experience, I let them sit till the price hit $14,000 a piece, and liquidated my bitcoins. I had 60 bitcoins that I sold immediately, I sold early because I wanted to be better safe then sorry because I knew when the price would drop, it would crash completely. 

I was very lucky and fortunate that I’d been dealing with bitcoins for over a decade, and because of my experience with them and investing, it turned into a successful venture. I had made close to a million, I immediately put that money into a savings account with compound interest and it’s been sitting there ever since.
 
Edit: My apologies in regards to the timeline, more of what I meant was I’ve been exploring the black market, dark web for a decade. I didn’t put too much thought in the timeline as I’m working and didn’t think this would pick up. 

Edit 2: So to clarify certain things, I didn’t expect this to pick up traction at all so I didn’t go in depth to what I did because I didn’t want to end up with an essay. I didn’t mean an actual “savings” account. I recirculated that money back into my portfolio, invested large heaps of that into bluechip stocks where I knew it’d be safe, bought bonds, etc. ",2018-07-18 03:38:42

Tyloo coming in after some easy wins to start off the minor. Skating through tainted minds and winning against another decent mix team 5Power. Renegades looking shakey as usual. Losing to a japanese team, a japanese team on one of their best maps. They are still likely to take second place and make the major but I don't see them coming in and taking this from Tyloo. Tyloo recently won against Renegades with ease without their secondary leader CaptainMo. Well guess whos back. Mo. This is the first chance Tyloo will have at legitly making the major. In boston they had to pull out due to Roster issues not allowing them to get a visa in time. This time Tyloo has a roster major ready and aren't going to put this opportunity to waste. The firepower lies with Tyloo. The motivation lies with Tyloo. Ustilo and AZR against a team that is unpredictable and has one of the highest pistol win rates in csgo. Don't dog the chinese, they coming to make it count this minor. Bntet best polish player.

e2khfsb,[deleted],72,"A short is just a position on margin that basically gains value when the price rises above the position price, and loses value when the price falls below the price. Basically you are borrowing Bitcoin from the exchange and settling that loan at a lower price (if it falls), or settling it at a higher price (if it rises). When a short is liquidated it means that the position was sold (liquidated) at the price where the margin was insufficient to cover the further losses. Basically the position went far enough into the red that the account could no longer suffer further capital losses. Price is simply the mark price, which is the average of the price of the highest unfilled buy order and the lowest unfilled sell order. Price rises when liquidity is taken off the order book, namely a buy order comes in with more volume than the current lowest sell order, then the remaining volume fills against the second lowest sell order (the new lowest), and so on. That is, this buy order works up the order book until its volume has been totally filled. If the buy order is large enough, such as the liquidation of a $190mm position, then the order will work its way far up the order book, driving the price higher and higher (remember that the price is just the average of the highest buy price and lowest sell price, and the lowest sell price is getting higher and higher).",2018-07-18 07:14:21

Same with seeing nudity and sex in different places. Seeing sex and nudity on youtube is special because it's rare and forbidden fruit. Seeing nudity on a twitch stream is rare and exciting. Seeing sex and nudity involving your favorite video game or cartoon is neat. Everyone wants to see Bulma naked. Everyone wants to see Sandy lick Squidwars's butthole at least once.

e2nex3w,[deleted],227,"&gt; Well, I’m a couple of beers in but my first thought is that the article doesn’t elaborate on what the evidence of hacking and disinformation actually disclosed.

*GUYS I GOT THIS*

I am a couple of beers in too man. I'll walk you through it. 

**The best evidence I have found the concrete evidence of hacking is this: [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)**

In here we have actual code, IPs that are linked to Russians directly -- derp Guccifer fucked up and didn't always use a VPN. Hacking not so ez [wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/guccifer-elite-hackers-mistakes/)), and malware that was used.

**Mueller's indictment from last week that outlines all of the bitcoin connections between DNC leaks, Guccifer, and the Russian government; a congressman using Russia to get dirt on his opponent: [PDF warning-justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)**

Just read it man, honestly. Please. There aren't many links. Just go through and see what kind of evidence they have right now. There is 100% evidence of Russian hacking. Honestly - and a lot of people have said this in congressional testimony - the shocking part about Russia hacking our election wasn't that it happened, but that they were *so fucking brazen about it*. They didn't really attempt to hide their tracks. [Youtube - Clinton Watts, testimony to Congress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyjVT1BywAw)

At the same time as the hacking, disinformation was put out by the Russian government that is fake but is reported to be news. There are specific stories in during the campaign that the Russians pushed, and that likely swayed the election. [PDF warning-Gunther, Beck and Nisbet, 2018](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4429952-Fake-News-May-Have-Contributed-to-Trump-s-2016.html)

[A summary from the Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/03/a-new-study-suggests-fake-news-might-have-won-donald-trump-the-2016-election/?utm_term=.890c3e96c238)

&gt;Here are the false stories, along with the percentages of Obama supporters who believed they were at least “probably” true (in parenthesis):

&gt;    * Clinton was in “very poor health due to a serious illness” (12 percent)

&gt;    * Pope Francis endorsed Trump (8 percent)

&gt;    * Clinton approved weapons sales to Islamic jihadists, “including ISIS” (20 percent)

&gt;Overall about one-quarter of 2012 Obama voters believed at least one of these stories, and of that group 45 percent voted for Clinton. Of those who believed none of the fake news stories, 89 percent voted for Clinton.

**The House released the ads bought by Russia on Facebook here. [intelligence.house.gov](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/social-media-advertisements.htm)**

Overall, over 126,000,000 Americans (~38.6%) saw Russia-bought ads on Facebook. [guardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/30/facebook-russia-fake-accounts-126-million)

That means the total that Trump won by in three states - 80,000 votes - is only 0.0634% of the amount of people who saw those ads. Put in another way: Even if the Russian propaganda was ineffective 99.99% of the time and only swayed 0.01% of it's viewers, Russia just gained 126,000 votes for Trump.

""But you don't know if those 126,000 votes were in the crucial states Trump needed to get elected""

This is a good point but also why the Trump campaign and Russia used Cambridge Analytica to target specific groups in specific states.[cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/17/technology/cambridge-analytica-data-facebook-russia/index.html)

&gt;A wannabe butter monk messaged his Master about an altcoin he wanted to buy. The Master told him it was fated to moon. ""It's only $0.10 per coin."" ""Buy me 1000 coins,"" replied the wannabe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The following day, the coin was at $0.20. Seeing this, the monk texted his master and told him to buy him 5000 more coins. The day after the monk checked his exchange and the coin was at $0.40. Eager to contact his master, he told him to buy 10,000 more coins.

e2n54dh,OzFreelancer,78,"They have their genesis in the original myth of snuff films. The first known use of the term ""snuff movie"" is in a 1971 book by Ed Sanders, *The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion*. In that book Sanders relays a story about a stolen super-8 camera that was used to film the decapitation of a young woman with short blonde hair on a beach. Such a murder was never verified, but Sanders coined the term ‘snuff movie’ to describe true murders on film.

The term gained wider popularity when it became the title of a 1975 low-budget horror flick, called *Snuff*, which was a ""found footage"" film like *Blair Witch Project*, where they wanted to make a film that would be passed off as real, found footage. In it, a filmmaker kills and disembowels his assistant, whilst being surreptitiously filmed by his cameraman. The makers spread the rumour that a movie had been made in which a genuine torture and murder scene took place, and many news services ate it up. 

Then the movie *Hostel* stepped it up a notch, with the idea that shadowy rich people could pay to carry out tortures themselves. Hostel’s director, Eli Roth, said the idea came to him after a conversation with a friend who had sent him a link to a site that allowed a person to travel to a place in Thailand, and for ten thousand dollars, walk into a room and shoot somebody in the head to give you the thrill of taking another human life.
 
In the Hostel films, a shadowy eastern European outfit lures foreign tourists to a hostel. The tourists soon find themselves bound to a chair in an isolated location. Rich western businessmen bid for the right to torture and kill the victim, whilst others get to watch.

The dark web version provided the opportunity for people to take part without having to physically carry out the torture and murder. For a fee, punters would be provided with login credentials to a virtual “room” at an allocated time. In that room, cameras would be concentrated on a person – invariably female – tied to a chair or bed, or chained to the wall by her ankle. 

The entry fee provided the right to be a voyeur to the proceedings. Participants could pay extra to direct the action, typing commands into the chat section on the screen, which would then be carried out by a hooded man.

The sites became known as Red Rooms.
 
The enabling technologies of the dark web - Tor and Bitcoin – provided such scenarios with new plausibility. Tor technology meant that videos could be hosted without revealing the location of the film. Bitcoin allowed for instant, anonymous payment by the audience to watch or participate, directing the action.

They still don't exist though :)

e2modo8,insette,70,"This community tends to have a very healthy skepticism for the idea of ""UASF"" (i.e. ""muh full node IS the consensus""); as such it's highly perplexing to see so much support for OP_RETURN based protocols.

And I say this as a very outspoken proponent of one such protocol.

I *strongly* feel this community fundamentally misunderstands the OP_RETURN function; namely many fail to understand OP_RETURN proposals operate under a new and largely unproven consensus model which is utterly devoid of PoW miner validation. Any and all activity which occurs on OP_RETURN protocols such as SLP and Counterparty, is only valid to the extent the ""full nodes"" of said protocol *say* it's valid.

Let me give you an example. Say a major centralized exchange like Poloniex lists XYZCoin built on some OP_RETURN protocol like SLP. A theft occurs, and Polo decides it wants to roll back the XYZCoin balances. Polo releases a modified SLP client. Their SLP client ships with the rollback of XYZCoin's OP_RETURN data, which is totally possible for them to do because OP_RETURN data is a mere **suggestion** which gets **interpretted** by ""full nodes"" or ""colored coin clients"", whatever you want to call them. They can go right out and do this.

And since they're the biggest liquidity provider for XYZCoin, what are you supposed to do about it?

FYI a version of this event *recently occurred* with Tether USDT. No OP_RETURN protocol can be safe from it, because despite what your personal wallet shows you about an OP_RETURN based coin, the only version of the coin's history which matters is the history as dictated by the biggest liquidity providers: the ""economic nodes"". It's freaking UASF consensus, but for real this time.

And this is what people on Bitcoin Cash want? They don't want GROUP?

All of these OP_RETURN schemes suffer from an identical issue: Bitcoin PoW miners only validate the raw nulldata-containing transactions, but do NOT validate the tokenized system itself.

Anyway, this is all just a repeat of 2013-2014, when everyone and their mother had a colored coins scheme that was so much better than all the other colored coin schemes. And when people disagreed with *those* schemes, they'd bikeshed their own new ones: https://xkcd.com/927/.

At Counterparty, we basically threw our hands up in their air and said ""fuck it, let's do Ethereum on top of Bitcoin"". This is because:

1. If you're going to build a derivative blockchain without PoW miner validation and with pseudo-SPV support at best, which SLP certainly seems to qualify as, then you might as well get the most out of your experience.
2. Ethereum exists for a reason: once you have tokens, interoperability becomes critical. People will want to use tokens for all manner of things which are likely best expressed with a very high level language, for unlimited creativity. Colored coins protocols don't allow for this.

IMO the Bitcoin Cash community should strongly support GROUP; it's the only colored coins protocol worth a damn. The current batch has been done before. Maybe it's different this time in that we have the hindsight of knowing Ethereum eats Bitcoin alive should no action take place. But I'm just saying, there are technical reasons why OP_RETURN protocols suck, and there are also technical reasons why Ethereum doesn't suck.

Bottom line, Bitcoin Cash would be best served by pouring resources into GROUP, and maybe doing a Counterparty-like system as a supplemental approach. With all the other tokens protocols, nothing fundamentally changes.",2018-07-19 07:07:22

Dana Rohrabacher the maximum allowed $5,400 campaign contribution in Bitcoin weeks after he claimed to help arrange a meeting with Rohrabacher and Julian Assange. 

Rod Rosenstein presented the latest indictments against the 12 Russian Intelligence officers July 13.  During this short speech, Rod Rosenstein stated: “In an effort to conceal their connections to Russia the defendants used a network of computers around the world and they paid for it using cryptocurrencies.”  ^[[2]](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/07/13/rod-rosenstein-doj-mueller-indictment-russia-12-officers-hacking-dnc-2016-election-sot.cnn/video/playlists/russia-hacking/)

Chuck Johnson apparently sat in on a meeting between Rohrabacher and Sen. Ran Paul in the Capitol.  Rohrabcher’s spokesperson, Pitkin, says they discussed cannabis and Assange’s legal situation, among other things.  ^[[3]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-far-right-blogger-chuck-c-johnson-gave-1508457881-htmlstory.html)


Rohrabacher traveled to London in August of 2017  to meet with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails.  Rohrabacher says Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[4]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)

It was Chuck Johnson who, oddly enough, helped set up the meeting and wrote in an email to The Times that the meeting was the result of a “desire for ongoing communications” from both Rohrabacher and Assange.

Rohrabacher would detail some specifics to The Times, but in an interview with the Daily Caller, he was more explicit, saying he and Assange talked about “what might be necessary to get him out” and suggested they discussed a presidential pardon in exchange for information on the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. ^[[5]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-right-wing-blogger-charles-c-johnson-1502992726-htmlstory.html)

Chuck Johnson can be seen [here^[6]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html) flashing the co-opted white power hand gesture while posing for a picture with Dana Rohrabacher. 

This is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8opgjn/charlottesville_hate_marcher_elected_by/e05d4ga/?context=3) to a post detailing the gesture.

The article, written by Michael Isikofff, co author of Russian Roulette, reports that Chuck Johnson is not looking to cooperate ongoing investigations: 

&gt;A controversial “alt-right” journalist and provocateur who met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London this week says he is refusing to turn over documents and emails requested by the Senate Intelligence Committee about any contacts he has had with Russian agents, telling Yahoo News he has no intention of cooperating with the panel’s investigation.

Johnson claimed he would “absolutely not” cooperate:
 
&gt;“They’re going to have to subpoena me and then they’ll  be sorely disappointed,” he added. Johnson said his lawyer would raise journalistic “privilege” issues to resist turning over any communications he might have had with Russian nationals or agents. 

The article states Johnson appeared to be the first figure in the Russia probe to make such a defiant position publicly, “refusing to cooperate in any way with the committee probe”.

A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting between Assange and Rohrabacher stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[6]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

 An exchange in an interview in Jan 2017, Hannity inquired if Assange could say to the American people that he didn’t get his info about the DNC and Podesta’s emails from Russia:

&gt;”Can you say to the American people, unequivocally, that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's emails, can you tell the American people 1,000 percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?"" -Hannity

&gt;”Yes,"" Assange said. ""We can say — we have said repeatedly — over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party."" ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

**We know now that this was not true**

The Justice Department’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers, if proven, would show Wikileaks received the material from Guccifer 2.0, a persona controlled directly by the GRU, and gave hackers advice on how to disseminate it.  It was not addressed if Assange knew that the people behind Guccifer were Russian agents, but it is unlikely that a hacker/cypherpunk like Assange would not have understood the implications based on the coverage blaming Russia for the DNC hack.  ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

This means that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly spread disinformation about the Seth Rich conspiracy that he was the source of the leaks without confirming it outright. According to the Associated Press:

&gt;It was Assange who first floated the idea into the mainstream, bringing up Rich's case in an interview with Dutch television the following month…

&gt;…During all this time, the indictment alleges, WikiLeaks knew full well that Guccifer 2.0 was its source, cajoling the account's operators to hand it more data and ordering rival journalists to steer clear. ^[[7]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

**Also**

Julian Assange and Wikileaks have asserted that they benefitted handsomely from Bitcoin, claiming %50,000 return.  Assange tweeted in October of 2017.  

&gt;“My deepest thanks to the U.S. government, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCad, Paypal, AmEx, Moneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010. It caused us to invest in Bitcoin—with &gt; 50,000% returns.” ^[[8]](https://www.coindesk.com/julian-assange-bitcoin-major-intellectually-interesting-development/)

Coinbase has a team of former Wall Street executives building out a business to lure big money into the crypto market. 
The prime broker business launched earlier this year as Coinbase Prime. But the Coinbase team is working on expanding its services. 
Prime brokers are commonplace on Wall Street, but don't exist in crypto which is keeping out big money, experts say. 
Coinbase is best known for being one of the largest venues for mom-and-pop investors in the US to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum.

But the San Francisco-based firm also has a band of ex-Wall Street executives working on addressing the biggest pain point in the crypto market: the lack of a full scale prime-broker.

On Wall Street, middlemen called brokers sit between institutional investors, like a hedge fund or money manager, and exchanges and other trading venues. Such operations are hard to come by in the crypto world because the barriers to entry are high.

Coinbase, however, is looking to overcome these barriers. It launched earlier this year a prime broker business, Coinbase Prime, joining a family of businesses spanning asset management, venture capital investing, and retail trading. 

As part of the business, Coinbase is offering some of the services of a traditional prime broker, including the onboarding of large institutional clients and custody, which had previously been announced by the firm. What's new, however, is that Coinbase is preparing to offer margin finance as early as the end of the year, people familiar with the matter said. 

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong
Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Anthony Harvey / Stringer
That would allow institutional investors to borrow to trade, which can help magnify returns, or leverage a short position, according to the people.

In the future, it is possible that Coinbase's broker business could help clients find the best venue to make a trade, even that means sending it to a rival trading outfit, a service known as best execution. 

""Coinbase is pursuing a lot of different initiatives that make sense and take it closer to or are more similar to traditional finance: custody, financing, lending, security tokens, and the institutional portal,"" said Greenwich Associates' consultant Richard Johnson. ""They have the resources to fund them and will surely have some successes.""

Already, the firm has onboarded a $20 billion hedge fund through its prime business, the people said, declining to specify which fund. The team is working on getting other large hedge funds onto its trading platform. 

At the same time, the firm is actively building out its teams in New York, Chicago, and London. Notably, it hired Christine Sandler from the New York Stock Exchange as cohead of institutional sales, as well as Hunter Merghart from Barclays as a sales trader. 

Prime brokers arose in the equities markets in the early 1990s, about the same time the hedge fund industry started to take off. According to the banking research firm Coalition, the 12 largest banks collectively brought in $4.9 billion from their prime-broker units in the first quarter of 2018, the highest level in three years.

Colleen Sullivan, the head of the crypto venture firm CMT Digital, said the lack of a end-to-end prime broker was among the bigger issues holding back large Wall Street firms from entering the crypto space.

Having to self-finance at each exchange opens the firm to above-average risk on Wall Street. She described the lack of prime services in crypto as CMT Digital's ""biggest pain point.""

""Without a prime broker, trading firms are directly subject to events that an exchange may suffer like hacks, regulatory issues, operational issues, technology issues (and many more) — all of which may lead to loss of the trading firm's cash and coin,"" she said.

Coinbase's decision to enter into the broker business is a bit ironic. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency on the market, was founded in the aftermath of the financial crisis as an alternative peer-to-peer financial system to Wall Street that would render middlemen useless. Coinbase's entrance into the institutional broker business also raises red-flags to some market observers. 

""There are many potential conflicts of interest in such a vertically integrated model,"" David Weisberger, a market structure specialist and CEO of CoinRoutes, said. 

The SEC, according to Weisberger, has been keen on keeping strict barriers between different Wall Street businesses because of the various conflicts that could arise. Specifically, Weisberger said he was concerned about confidential exchange info — who is trading and what funds are sitting on their accounts — leaking over to the broker side, which could be used to provide color to trading partners.

Institutional exchanges have historically taken steps to address potential conflict of interest. 

NYSE Group spun off Wave Securities, a brokerage unit, which it acquired when it bought Arca in 2005, after the SEC expressed concerns about conflicts. 

There are parallels between the two situations, insiders say, although it may take some time to play out since the crypto market is so nascent. 

""But right now, there's so many mature players, it is probably a good thing for Coinbase to do this because it is filling a much bigger gap,"" said Kyle Tuskey, a former Wave technologist, and current COO of Deep Systems, a financial technology firm. 

Since Coinbase is not a registered securities exchange, it isn't clear whether the SEC would have the authority to step in and create firewalls or flat out prohibit Coinbase from operating such a business. 

A representative for the SEC could not be reached for comment about Coinbase's ambitions. A spokesman for Coinbase also could not be reached for comment. 

Still, Robert Hockett, a professor of law at Cornell University, said ""it seems likely the SEC will take interest in Coinbase's intention to offer prime brokerage services.""

""This raises conflict concerns, given Coinbase's also running a coin exchange, reminiscent of those that the Commission has found when securities firms have attempted to combine these two roles.""

Bitcoin broke out of the summer doldrums this week with a sudden jump that cheered investors who have watched the digital currency lose more than half its value since December.

But the outlook for bitcoin is still poor: light trading volumes, no clear catalyst for another rally, and little interest from the retail investors who fueled the last one.

Bitcoin shot nearly $700 higher in one hour Tuesday afternoon, ending weeks of relative tranquility. It reminded investors that cryptocurrencies remain a Wild West marketplace, where it’s often difficult to know what’s driving price moves, as The Wall Street Journal’s Markets newsletter noted on Wednesday.

Bitcoin spiked from below $6,800 to above $7,400 in minutes, leaping more than 11% from where it had been trading the day before. Until Monday, the digital currency had spent 15 consecutive days hovering between $6,000 and $7,000. It has since held onto most of its gains, trading at $7,336.86 late Wednesday afternoon.

No clear news development drove Tuesday’s rally. The move came after bitcoin had been creeping up for much of the day and accelerated when it touched $6,800, which suggests traders had set up stop-loss orders that automatically started buying once that level was breached.

Stop-loss orders, which exist in stocks as well as bitcoin, kick in once prices reach a particular threshold. They’re often used by investors to limit losses by selling when asset prices drop too far. But they can also be used by short-sellers–who bet on falling prices–to start buying when prices rise too much.

To support that theory, some traders pointed to a large “short squeeze” on BitMEX, a popular cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, which coincided with Tuesday’s surge. In a short squeeze, short-sellers cover their losses by buying the underlying asset, whether it be stocks or bitcoin. That can result in a sudden rally.

Some social-media accounts marveled at the heavy trading on BitMEX. “Seriously… carnage @ bitmex today,” a Twitter user named CryptOrca wrote.

BitMEX chief executive Arthur Hayes said in an email that he “would not be able to offer any definitive comments in absence of clear data.”

The exchange, which is legally incorporated in the Seychelles, was recently in the news after it parked three Lamborghinis outside a virtual-currency conference in New York.

One reason for the abruptness of the move, traders said, was a lack of buyers and sellers ready to step in and trade–a lack of “liquidity,” in trading jargon. Markets that are less liquid are more prone to abrupt moves. “Insufficient liquidity in the market added to the rapid increase in price,” one U.S. cryptocurrencies trader said in an email.

In a sign of thinning liquidity, bitcoin trading volumes have slumped from the go-go days of late 2017. So far this month, around $363 million worth of bitcoin has changed hands on an average day on major exchanges, down from nearly $2.5 billion a day in December, according to CryptoCompare. That reflects the fall in bitcoin’s price as well as slower trading activity.

It’s been a while since bitcoin had a drastic price move. In December, the average daily price move in the digital currency was 14.6%, according to an analysis of CoinDesk data by the WSJ Market Data Group. But since then such big price swings have become more unusual: So far in July, daily moves have averaged 4.1%.

It remains to be seen whether the swift rally will draw retail investors back into bitcoin–or scare them off. Inflows from small investors were pivotal to bitcoin’s huge price run-up last year.

But in recent months, bitcoin has been out of the headlines, and many investors have shifted their attention elsewhere. Worldwide Google searches for “bitcoin” peaked the week starting Dec. 17. Last week, Google searches for “bitcoin” were 9% of that record level.

“If the news media isn’t covering it and there isn’t price direction, people mostly stay on the sidelines,” said Kevin Beardsley, a London-based managing director at cryptocurrency-trading firm B2C2.",2018-07-20 12:04:08

Tainted Minds ban dust 2, Renegades bans Tainted Minds best map NUKE. Renegades are favored on Train, Cache, Inferno. Maybe its a 50/50 on overpass? Hell both teams don't even play it, so i'll still favor Renegades slightly. I think they went back to their hotels, really concentrated on this next match and come out very strong. I can see a solid 2-0 leading into the grand final, which i'll be skipping all day to avoid the heart attack. Highly likely Tainted minds pick overpass, but they almost lost it to the team from Israel so its not like they are all that strong on it.

Liquid have not looked solid since picking up Taco. At ESL Cologne their defensive set ups were a complete mess. Their map pool was basically absent. Their coach ZEWS will not be able to attend the event. He is the main reason they stay motivated in matches, and is basically their hype man. Overall the team is 5 beta males who tend to bitch and argue when they get down early in the match, if MIBR comes out hot it could tilt them pretty heavily wihtout a neutral party to control the meltdown. I don't see them doing exceedingly well without their coach to push them along since they are still under roster development with the pick up of Taco. MIBR with a major roster change. Picking up arguably one of the best riflers in NA Tarik to team up with Stewie2k his teammate in which they just won the csgo major together. The two best players from c9, just joined the 3 best players from the most successful modern csgo roster. Its their first event together, the odds hold some serious value. Yeah its a bo3, and its MIBR first match, but your talking 5 of the best players in the world, on one team. Chemistry might be a worry, but I think the fractured chemistry of the three Brazilians, and the two former c9 members will still be better than a struggling TL without their coach. People are forgetting that even with Boltz, and a team struggling to rediscover themselves. They still managed to take down North, and narrowly lost to BIG last event, who went on to upset Faze. Now you replace a useless puzzle piece with one of the best riflers in NA. You better believe Coldzera comes out motivated to prove the haters wrong as to why they picked up Tarik.

\&gt; I would like to seek immediate legal action on this company if I end up  losing the house, losing money from being sued by the seller. I do not  want to be at risk at being sued by the seller for not having the money. 

Quadriga's not responsible for your short timeline, or for your decision to buy something before you had the money (bitcoin is not money) in-hand. If the BTC aren't in your wallet anymore then they're probably liable to you for the amount you tried to withdraw, but holding them responsible for incidentals might be a trick. 

Isn't your real estate deal conditional on you getting the money? That's a pretty standard clause in Ontario for financed purchases, I presume it'd be the same if you had to liquidate some asset to raise the cash too. Did you tell your realtor where the money was coming from?

&gt;  he had paid me back 20k loans before

What might be happening is that he asks for a small amount and acts in a trustworthy way to in order to facilitate a larger loan which he then runs away with. Sometimes crooks will even pay good interest on the loan in order to get people to send them more cash. Could he have known about your bitcoin holdings from social media? He may have befriended you after finding out about the total bitcoin you had from social media. Thus making returning 20K to get 200K a worthwhile risk for him. If this is the case he is quite possibly a professional scammer who will have covered his tracks better. If he is genuinely just an opportunistic scammer then the odds of him being caught are slightly higher. Judging by there being other victims the odds are tipped towards pro scammer but he could be just starting out. 

You might want to band together with his other victims to increase your resources, information about him and chance of catching him. 

Is he gambling with your bitcoins? If you can get some sort of court order on the bitcoins you *Might* be able to get then seen as ""proceeds of crime"" which *might* mean you have some claim on them which *might* lead to the gambling site freezing them *if* you can show he's gambling with stolen bitcoins. 

If you can get enough information about him - real name, real address and link to his scamming and threaten to sue/instigate legal proceedings (it has to be a credible threat) he might repay. Be wary of ""payback in instalments"" as that is usually an avoidance strategy to trick you/the courts into thinking he is intending to pay when there isn't really any intent. You may find if you can get his real name and address and perhaps with help from his other victims evidence of his scamming ( the more people the better ) then there may be enough to get the Dutch police to open an investigation. You may find you have to collate a lot of information to figure out his true identity and some sort of specialist professional investigator might be helpful. However potentially it could cost you a lot of money without catching anyone or getting any money back.

Also before this giant bubble bitcoin was still a dark horse and barely existed on the outskirts of awareness of general population.

Many families have ""that guy"" who shilled crypto relentlessly and tried to get more people onboard and now that the whole thing crashed he can't even show himself on family gatherings without a huge shame. Or companies where ""that guy"" was shilling crypto to every colleague like some mlm god and his life depended on it aaaaaaaaaaaaand it's gone! 

That my friend is a natural vaccination process that reminds people from new generations why unsustainable money grabbing schemes are a bad idea to get into. Those kind of things reoccur naturally every now and then once new generation forgets or doesn't have the experience how those schemes unfold in the past. People get burned, they learn their lesson, other people learn from their example and then new people come who didn't see how it worked before and get burned again thus repeating the vaccination process.

This already happened over and over. For example back when I was just a kid there was a small emergence of many ponzi schemes in my country. Back then they were named with specific, regional name and even though nobody uses that name for pyramid schemes anymore and I didn't even care about such things back then I remember that specific name to this day, it seeped into my subconciousness and stayed there for decades. Their predictable collapse echoed through the media and society and their presence left a mark that teached people a lesson.

The vaccination works for a while. Few years ago another big ""too good to be true"" pyramid scheme emerged named Amber Gold, burned a lot of people and many learned about pyramid schemes and the name seeped into the public perception and will linger there for many years again, reminding people that those blinded by greed and abandoning reason and jumping on the huge gains without thinking will learn the hard way.

In order to answer your question you need to find out several things:

What are the underlying reasons the same thing could or couldn't happen again? 

Is the new growth of greater fools sustainable? 

What is the untapped supply of yet greater fools who could buy in and does it exceed the number of those who bought high this time?

 How badly the reputation of crypto is damaged? (I'd say very badly)

Are people still ignorant about the risks or maybe they're much more aware than before? 

How many people are already ""vaccinated"" against this idea and will further impact others' decisions? 

There is a mountain of questions to be asked and they can't be answered with previous data.

Starting with the *now*, channel capacity is **intentionally restricted** by the devs to avoid being too #reckless. What happens when you tell people not to use large amounts on the LN? Yeah... total capacity suffers. 

In case it's not clear - This is **not a bug** but an intentional design limitation ***right now***. As software matures, it will be removed.

Not only that, this will also be mitigated severely in the future by Atomic Multi Path payments - One (possibly large) payment, several paths. Neither sender nor receiver is none the wiser, but everything works automagically.

But it will always be a problem to send larger and larger payments. Even at full capacity, with all sorts of enhancements and optimizations, the probability of sending ~$1bn via LN will be effectively zero. Are you gonna say ""*LN is shit because you can't send $1bn*""?

**CASH GRAB IS-7 WHO'S GRIND IS EQUAL TO 3 FURRY TIGERS** 

*lolnoairfuckyou*

I've been one to throw money at Gaijin in the past as I've been playing since early 2013 and want to see this game be successful. This has stopped ever since the introduction of the marketplace and the attempted introduction of ""MODIFICATION BOOST TOTALLY NOT P2W"" that I guarantee you would have had some connection with the marketplace in order to cash grab it even more. 

The marketplace at least is somewhat reasonable, but what would make it better is a feature that actually gives it legitimate purpose to be in the game. In it's current state it's essentially just a way for Gaijin to sell ~~gambling~~ lootboxes to children. But imagine if it had a full fledged trading system similar to MMORPGs/Steam. Imagine being able to trade unwanted premium vehicles for things like GE/SL/other premium vehicles/wagers/boosters/decals/and skins directly with other players instead of using a global market that has less stability than the value of bitcoin.

&gt;But wait this event vehicle was meant for older players that have showed commitment to this game since it's beginning.

Bullshit because that's ignoring the fact that Gaijin seems to have also forgotten that Asian players, Dutch players, Belgian players (and possibly more European countries), and console players will be separated and prevented from completing the marketplace portion of the IS-7 grind. Of which includes players that may have began playing since 2013/2014.

I've been one to actually grind for almost every single one of these event vehicles for their rarity ever since 2013, I love the Pakwagen, the Type-62, the ZiS-6 LVT, M8 Greyhound, Furry Tiger, 262 A2, Ki-94-II, and many more. 

I can accept not having the WarCrime Panther nor the E-100 because missing those were my own mistake. I had all the chances to actually get those vehicles if I actually put in the commitment (even if they were a living hell to get). But with this event the IS-7 even if you're willing to put in the commitment, if you're in the Netherlands, Belgium, Asia, use a VPN to access any of these markets, or play on Console... you are absolutely boned even if you've been with this game since it's beginning, helped support it's development, and/or have worked with the community to better the game as a whole.

Oh and all of this is also on top of the fact that if you had any prior commitment in life such as a job, a family, or school then you're pretty much also equally boned because Gaijin doesn't realize that if they make us choose between a virtual tank or our jobs/families/education then obviously we're gonna choose the latter.",2018-07-24 10:47:45

e2ye9cg,CryptopherWalken,295,"**I highly recommend reading the thread below to understand that the SEC is very likely to postpone approval of the VanEck and SolidX ETF until February 21, 2019.  The only reason it hasn't delayed these so far is because the SEC doesn't delay until they reach the current deadline.  It delayed the other ETFs because they were at the deadline/end of a period as described below.**

If the SEC uses every opportunity it has to delay and extend the deadline, it has until that date.

https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1021795224958455810

""The timing of the ETF approval process follows a standard formula:

- the ETF files a ""proposed rule change"" with the SEC;

- the SEC posts notice of the filing in the Federal Register and solicits comments; and

- the SEC has 45 days from posting to approve or deny the ETF.

Except the SEC doesn't have to decide within 45 days. It can extend the deadline up to three times:

- 45 more days if ""a longer period is appropriate"";

- 90 more days for the ETF to address grounds for disapproval; and

- 60 more days if again ""a longer period is appropriate.""

This means the real deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an ETF is 240 days after it files notice in the Federal Register (45+45+90+60).

...

**@Coindesk reported: ""Notably, none of the ETF proposals being postponed are from VanEck and SolidX[.]""**

**But this isn't notable at all. The deadline to approve or deny the Direxion ETF was July 23. As explained, the SEC waits until the deadline before issuing another extension.**

**The SEC wasn't making a decision about all of the pending bitcoin ETFs today; it was just handling the next step in the process for the Direxion ETF.**

**It had absolutely no reason (or justification) to address the VanEck/SolidX ETF. The fact it didn't do so is meaningless.**

...

I understand if hopium has you thinking ""okay, but just because the SEC *can* delay doesn't mean it will.""

Sure, that's fine in theory. But I can't imagine the SEC will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF without taking all the time allowed by law. """,2018-07-25 02:13:19

e31tvzw,Peter__R,101,"TLDR: Graphene is a technology used to transmit new blocks with fewer bytes than ""just sending the block in full.""

##Details &amp; Historical Context

Historically, when a new block was found, a Core node would transmit _all_ of the transactions in that block verbatim, even though nodes would have seen most of those transactions already.  Transactions were essentially sent twice: once when the transaction was originally broadcast, and a second time when that transaction was included in a block. 

It was obvious to many people that improvements should be made; however, Core was not interested in making them.  BS/Core leader Greg Maxwell at the time suggested that miners should use the Relay Network and non-mining nodes should use ""blocks-only"" mode to save bandwidth.  

####Xtreme Thin Blocks

Peter Tschipper (/u/bitsenbytes) was one of those people who wanted to improve block propagation, and so he designed and implemented ""Xtreme Thin Blocks"" (Xthin) in Bitcoin Unlimited. A Xthin node sends a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) of its mempool when it requests a block from a peer, allowing the peer to determine which transactions the node does and doesn't have.  The peer then sends the transactions in the block by a ""short hash"" for the transactions the node already has, and in full for the transactions the node is missing.  Xthin was a huge success, [reducing the number of bytes required to transmit a block by a factor of 24 and the time required to send a block by a factor of 6](https://medium.com/@peter_r/towards-massive-on-chain-scaling-block-propagation-results-with-xthin-5145c9648426).  

Core's feet were being held to the fire with the positive reception of Xthin, and so they were motivated to create their own version of the same idea, known as ""Compact Blocks.""  Today, Bitcoin ABC uses compact blocks, BU uses Xthin, and XT can do both.  

####Graphene

Brian Levine, George Bissias and colleagues [invented a different scheme](https://youtu.be/BPNs9EVxWrA) to send blocks using even fewer bytes, based around the ""crazy math"" of invertible-Bloom look-up tables (IBLTs).  Graphene may be able to send blocks using an order of magnitude fewer bytes than even Xthin or Compact Blocks! 

In Graphene, when a node requests a block from a peer, the node sends the size of its mempool (rather than a Bloom filter of its mempool as was the case with Xthin).  The peer than sends the node a custom Bloom filter of the block's contents, and an IBLT of the transaction hashes in the block.  The receiving node next filters its mempool with the Bloom filter to find the transactions that are _likely_ to be in the block, and then use the IBLT to find _exactly_ which transactions are in the block.  I said ""crazy math"" in the previous paragraph because the receiving node is able to determine all of the transaction IDs in the block _even if he does not already have all of the transactions_.   It's almost like the IBLT contains ""stem cells"" that can transform into missing TXID X for Node A, but transform into a _different_ missing TXID for Node B.   

####Real World Testing Required

Graphene is still very new and it's possible that some hiccups might be encountered in practice.  How well it _actually_ performs with respect to Xthin or Compact Blocks will require real-world testing.  Another challenge is that Graphene allows the receiving node to determine the TXIDs in the block, but _not the order_ (unlike Xthin/Compact Blocks).  For Graphene to really shine, nodes using Graphene block transmission must agree on a canonical ordering of transactions in a block.",2018-07-26 13:01:59

Quite a few of them as they develop in real time because one of my monitors is 100% 24\7 running a bitcoin price chart (https://i.imgur.com/KjoBuLW.png). This is why I believe there is no replacement for seat time. You simply need experience just watching how the market moves. Eventually after about 3 or 4 months I started taking trades based on what I was watching. I had an intuition that ""if x happened, then Y happens"". And slowly built up over time - the goal at first was never to become a ""pro"" or any of this shit. I think that's a dangerous goal to have at first, most people seem to ""naturally"" grow into it. 

You need to have your own opinions and natural intuition, signal trading or following someone else is... yeah. Those who I see that are successful always have some intuition or gut feeling that allows them to be profitable over the long term.

""courses"" are mostly bullshit IMO. 90% of what you need to learn is personal psychology and personal risk management. If you don't have that under control, it doesn't matter how many indicators or what FA stuff you look at, you'll still be shit at trading. As far as indicators, IMO they're over used. FA metrics are important in their own little unique way to help form the bias of which you execute your prop trades by. I still haven't properly figured out a way to ""teach"" this. There are some very basic things that guide this, but overall, it's a very personal and indivigual case by case basis. Everyone trades differently. There is no ""right"" way. 

Paper trading is a waste of time. The lessons you need to learn come from real money, real stress, real implications of your actions, real second guessing, real risk management. Paper trading teaches you none of that because you know it's fake.",2018-07-26 06:04:52

e30d3sa,Talonias32,62,"TL;DR, there is definitely a case against you in civil court, criminal maybe but depends on details. get a lawyer and a bankruptcy trustee depending on what the lawyer says.  
 The big problem here is you did nothing above board. You aren't a licensed, well, anything, be it a broker or company (I assume). Without seeing how you presented yourself to these people, it's impossible to say definitively whether you committed fraud. If you can somehow show that these people knew there were risks and that you never demonstrated any misleading credentials or promises, you might make it. In civil you are definitely going to face some kind of action. For that amount of money it can't be ignored, someone will try to shake you down. Again, without seeing evidence I can't say how good of a case is against you, but there will be an argument about the kind of agreement and/or contract you made with these people.
 On the plus side, the lack of paperwork and your lack of credentials hurts the cases against you more then it hurts you, as these people should have known better assuming you weren't actively defrauding them. And your lack of any assets will make bankruptcy relatively painless and quick (they will seize any remaining bitcoin you have, if you lie about it or hide it and get caught expect serious repercussions).

You screwed up bad but you know it and own it and I can respect that. You have intelligence and character, you just suffered from pride and overconfidence. Get out ahead of this and it'll make you feel so much better. I hope you the best",2018-07-26 00:04:03

&gt;Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Thursday blocked a resolution from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that backed the intelligence community's assessment of Russian election interference and demanded President Trump speak with special counsel Robert Mueller.
Sanders asked for unanimous consent to try to pass his resolution, saying senators ""must act"" if they are ""serious about preserving American democracy.""

&gt;…Under Senate rules, any one senator could block his request.
Sanders's resolution would also demand already passed sanctions legislation be fully implemented, move to protect the election system and ""not accept"" interference in Mueller's investigation, including the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.


Rohrabacher traveled to London in August of 2017  to meet with Assange in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where they discussed potential presidential pardon in exchange for information on the origin of the leaked emails.  Rohrabacher says Assange “emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved”.  ^[[5]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-report-rep-rohrabacher-says-white-1507155591-htmlstory.html)

It was Chuck Johnson who, oddly enough, helped set up the meeting and wrote in an email to The Times that the meeting was the result of a “desire for ongoing communications” from both Rohrabacher and Assange.

Rohrabacher would detail some specifics to The Times, but in an interview with the Daily Caller, he was more explicit, saying he and Assange talked about “what might be necessary to get him out” and suggested they discussed a presidential pardon in exchange for information on the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. ^[[6]](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-right-wing-blogger-charles-c-johnson-1502992726-htmlstory.html)

Chuck Johnson can be seen [here^[7]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html) flashing the co-opted white power hand gesture while posing for a picture with Dana Rohrabacher. 

This is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8opgjn/charlottesville_hate_marcher_elected_by/e05d4ga/?context=3) to a post detailing the gesture.

The article, written by Michael Isikofff, co author of Russian Roulette, reports that Chuck Johnson is not looking to cooperate ongoing investigations: 

&gt;A controversial “alt-right” journalist and provocateur who met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London this week says he is refusing to turn over documents and emails requested by the Senate Intelligence Committee about any contacts he has had with Russian agents, telling Yahoo News he has no intention of cooperating with the panel’s investigation.

Johnson claimed he would “absolutely not” cooperate:
 
&gt;“They’re going to have to subpoena me and then they’ll  be sorely disappointed,” he added. Johnson said his lawyer would raise journalistic “privilege” issues to resist turning over any communications he might have had with Russian nationals or agents. 

The article states Johnson appeared to be the first figure in the Russia probe to make such a defiant position publicly, “refusing to cooperate in any way with the committee probe”.

A spokesman for Rohrabacher did confirm that Johnson arranged the meeting between Assange and Rohrabacher stating: “My understanding is that there is not yet a concrete proposal, but that Dana does believe that if Assange does turn over the proof he’s promised, then he deserves a pardon” ^[[7]](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alt-right-figure-set-assange-meeting-refuses-cooperate-senate-intel-probe-172020121.html)

 **An exchange in an interview in Jan 2017, Hannity inquired if Assange could say to the definitively that he didn’t get his information on the DNC and Podesta’s emails from Russia:**

&gt;”Can you say to the American people, unequivocally, that you did not get this information about the DNC, John Podesta's emails, can you tell the American people 1,000 percent you did not get it from Russia or anybody associated with Russia?"" -Hannity

&gt;”Yes,"" Assange said. ""We can say — we have said repeatedly — over the last two months that our source is not the Russian government and it is not a state party."" ^[[8]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

*We know now that this was not true*

The Justice Department’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers, if proven, would show Wikileaks received the material from Guccifer 2.0, a persona controlled directly by the GRU, and gave hackers advice on how to disseminate it.  It was not addressed if Assange knew that the people behind Guccifer were Russian agents, but it is unlikely that a hacker/cypherpunk like Assange would not have understood the implications based on the coverage blaming Russia for the DNC hack.  ^[[8]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

This means that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly spread disinformation about the Seth Rich conspiracy that he was the source of the leaks without confirming it outright.

According to the Associated Press:

&gt;It was Assange who first floated the idea into the mainstream, bringing up Rich's case in an interview with Dutch television the following month…

&gt;…During all this time, the indictment alleges, WikiLeaks knew full well that Guccifer 2.0 was its source, cajoling the account's operators to hand it more data and ordering rival journalists to steer clear. ^[[8]](https://apnews.com/amp/69b28dd8fc034cb0a2528048638d7893)

**Also**

Julian Assange and Wikileaks have asserted that they benefitted handsomely from Bitcoin, claiming %50,000 return.  Assange tweeted in October of 2017.  

&gt;“My deepest thanks to the U.S. government, Senator McCain, and Senator Lieberman for pushing Visa, MasterCad, Paypal, AmEx, Moneybookers, et al, into erecting an illegal banking blockade against @WikiLeaks starting in 2010.

e32ongp,Rehrar,78,"Sorry, I'm just not seeing what's so great about Brave/BAT. Let me break down why. I'm a hardcore privacy advocate, and there is so much misinformation about what constitutes good privacy. People here may understand blockchain technology (if that), but not privacy technologies (a completely separate fields), and definitely very little about merging the two.

1. Brave does not equal BAT. Brave will implement BAT, but they are different products. I do not see a reason for BAT to exist. They could have done the same thing with blocking ads but voluntary compensation for content creation using Bitcoin.

2. I appreciate the UX of making Brave fairly idiot proof. As in, you don't have to mess with add ons for Firefox (which work just as well). You just turn it on, and you're pretty good. But a good privacy suite of add ons (ublock origin, privacy badger, https everywhere) work just as well. Basically, the solution already existed.

3. It's based on Chromium. The development of Brave is where I'm most likely to be wrong, so I appreciate anyone willing to correct me, but Chromium is still a Google product, and has a history of still implementing surveillance. The fact that there is an [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is a deal breaker for me. While I assume that Brave did their due diligence and disabled many of these portions, I would really just rather not give Google the market share.

4. Despite liking the UX as mentioned in point 2, the recent addition of Tor tabs is a little concerning for me. I like the idea, but most people don't know that Tor does not equal anonymity, and there are many ways to fingerprint users using cookies, javascript, HTML canvas, and other means. I worry people will do stupid things thinking they are safe with Tor tabs (happens with the Tor software all the time).

5. BAT is a public ledger Using blockchain analysis you will still be able to track what a person gives their BAT to and make profiles on them. They really should have implemented something like Monero into Brave.

So yeah, in short, I think it's a solution looking for a problem that has more or less already been solved, the token is 100% unnecessary, and the success of Brave does not necessarily equal the success of the token.

EDIT: Sorry in advance if I ruffle some feathers. I understand people get really uppity about this stuff because they want to make money and don't like dissent on that front. If you have disagreements please say so, but also please know what you're talking about when it comes to privacy technologies. :P",2018-07-27 00:43:33
e33fizt,ethswagholder,67,"&gt; By precluding approval of cryptocurrency-based ETPs for the foreseeable future, the Commission is engaging in merit regulation. Bitcoin is a new phenomenon, and its long-term viability is uncertain. It may succeed; it may fail. The Commission, however, is not well positioned to assess the likelihood of either outcome, for bitcoin or any other asset. Many investors have expressed an interest in gaining exposure to bitcoin, and a subset of these investors would prefer to gain exposure without owning bitcoin directly. An ETP based on bitcoin would offer investors indirect exposure to bitcoin through a product that trades on a regulated securities market and in a manner that eliminates some of the frictions and worries of buying and holding bitcoin directly. If we were to approve the ETP at issue here, investors could choose whether to buy it or avoid it. The Commission’s action today deprives investors of this choice. I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation—a role very different from (and, indeed, inconsistent with) our mission of protecting investors, fostering capital formation, and facilitating fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Accordingly, I dissent.

Miners maintain security on the network and are rewarded for their efforts. They also distribute hash power to keep the power out of any one entity's hands.

Oh really? So governments don't manipulate the value of their own currency?  Bitcoins are deflationary and short term prices are determined by the market. That's what all capitalists want right?

People are using it whether he likes it or not. For example in places like Venezuela where they are literally exchanging it for food to stay alive.

e342c5w,Daleeburg,35,"Yes, you are generally correct in that attacking blocks closer to the end is easier. Since you would need to forge less new blocks.  The way most people protect against this is by not honoring a transaction till it is buried X deep in the chain. This is normally called “confirmations”. Merchants have to decide how secure they want to make sure their payments will be (more confirmations) versus how fast they want to be able to deliver the service (less confirmations).

In theory if I controlled more then half the hashing power of a chain I could start my own line of blocks that nobody but me is aware of and record that I never sent bitcoin anywhere while on the public chain I can be spending my bitcoin on various things that are immediately delivered to me, the while whole time my private chain excluded all my transactions. Once I am done spending my bitcoin on the public chain and have received my goods and services,  assuming I was able to create more blocks on my private chain then the public chain (which I have over 51% of the hashing power, so it should be possible) I can then send my private chain to the public chain, basically forking the chain. At this point the miners have to choose which chain they will continue to work on, my chain that is now public or the original chain. Minors are programmed to always pick the longest chain since the most work has been done on it (so thus it must be true) so they choose my now public chain and all of a sudden I have all my bitcoin back and still have the goods and services I bought with the other bitcoins on the other chain.  This is a 51% attack. 

But all this doesn’t apply to XRP. The ledger has something that most cryptos do not in that it has “finality”.  When a block is produced and that ledger is closed, it is absolute truth and can not be reopened, modified or second guessed.  It goes into the records and can never be touched again by anything.  Since the majority of validators agreed with it when it was made, now everybody agrees with it.  This is part of the reason why XRP can be transferred in under 4 seconds, which requires 1 confirmation (the block the transfer happened in) to insure it will never change, versus bitcoin, etherum, and other Proof-of-Work chains, which generally require many confirmations before it is considered truth and not likely to change.

e362xje,ReadTheArticleBitch,137,"**SEC Commissioner: Bitcoin Is Regulated And Mature Enough To Have An ETF**




On July 26, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially rejected the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application filed by the Winklevoss twins, citing lack of measures in the ETF to prevent price manipulation.


The official SEC announcement read:


“The Commission addresses each of these arguments below. In Section III.B, the Commission addresses BZX’s assertion that bitcoin and bitcoin markets, including the Gemini Exchange, are uniquely resistant to manipulation and finds that the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.”


The SEC further emphasized that the proposed ETF by the Winklevoss twins, who oversee a major US crypto exchange known as Gemini, does not have sufficient tools to identify and deter fraud and manipulation that could impose a negative impact on the price movement of Bitcoin.


Almost immediately after the release of the SEC’s statement, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce expressed her disappointment with the decision of the agency to reject the bitcoin ETF filed by the Winklevoss twins, noting that Bitcoin, as an asset, is regulated and matured enough to be worthy of US markets.


“Apparently, bitcoin is not ripe enough, respectable enough, or regulated enough to be worthy of our markets,” Peirce said in a personal statement, referring to an official public statement she published to refute the disapproval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF.


Peirce added that the premature decision of the SEC undermined investor protection by dismissing the institutionalization of the Bitcoin market, which has seen an increase of adoption by regulated financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley over the past several months.


Despite the optimistic comments of SEC commissioner Peirce, the price of Bitcoin dropped by more than 4% within a one-hour period, from $8,315 to $7,930, heavily affected by the rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF.


Over the past week, Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market had experienced a strong rally supported by a spike in volume. Within two days, between July 25 and 26, the volume of Bitcoin surged from $3 billion to $6.3 billion according to the market data provided by CryptoCompare, suggesting an increase in demand from investors in the public market towards Bitcoin.


Analysts have generally attributed the climb of the Bitcoin price to the anticipation around the approval of the Bitcoin ETF filed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), but the disapproval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF has led a portion of the cryptocurrency community to reevaluate the probability of the approval of the Cboe ETF.


In its statement, the SEC emphasized that the commission disapproved the filing of the Winklevoss twins because their ETF was not able to meet the requirements of the SEC, and it had an issue with the involvement of Gemini in the process of establishing the value of the Bitcoin ETF.


Hence is possible, given the enthusiastic stance projected by commissioner Peirce, that the Cboe ETF will get approved in the near future, especially if it successfully covers the issues the SEC had with previous Bitcoin ETFs.

[You recently said you would consider BCH more legitimate if it were not for some of the extremeness of our community and some of our leaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/922mve/why_does_rbitcoin_criticizes_merchants_who_move/e33nidt/).  I have heard this from a few other heavy BCH critics as well.  I hope you can begin to understand our point of view, we had to fight tooth and nail just to stay alive in the face of many attacks.  We were a small flame that could have been extinguished if we did not tirelessly fight.  However, now that BCH is almost one year old we seem to have solidified our existence as a community, we have repelled the ""bcash"" renaming attacks and other attacks.  We have won and lost battles.  But one thing is certain, we have proven that we are here to stay.  

I think if we try to take a more reasonable tact towards our critics we might be able to persuade more people like you to take BCH seriously. You claim that there are ""lies"" being spread, but most of that is just that we have a different perspective than you.  Yes you may have some decent criticisms of our narrative at times, but that does not mean we are outright ""lying"", things are often interpreted in different ways, such as this meme post illustrates.  Then it spirals into a war of you calling this meme a lie, and then the OP calls you a banker shill. We on the BCH side can try to accept criticism better, and you critics can also try to understand us as well and it might result in a more genuine understanding. Maybe stop calling it ""bcash"" for example, and maybe we can stop calling it the ""real Bitcoin"" and instead say there are ""two different Bitcoins"".  Maybe if we learned to work together and compete against each other in a respectful way, it could allow both Bitcoins to be the best they can be.",2018-07-28 14:49:26

All of the stuff you mention came later.  Only later did it become clear that mining would go to ASICS, that POS was even possible, or that centralization of miners in pools would be a problem.  The huge influence of China on the price of crypto was not even on the horizon.  That was the bitcoin of Satoshi.

This mini BTC rally is not over yet and alts will continue to bleed against BTC until dominance is over 50% (imo). 

ETF hype is still in the air, more people who got involved in shitcoins are starting to realize why Bitcoin is different and significantly safer than the rest. Every fucking crypto exchange will list Bitcoin by default. Every logical institutional investor is going to have a bag of Bitcoin by default, not necessarily your shitcoin. Every altcoin’s ultimate dream is to be where Bitcoin is right now. The supply is still mind blowingly limited, probably less than 10M BTC even available to purchase. 

So fuck the ETF for now and look at the big picture. Does Bitcoin deserve to go all the way down to $3K? Fundamentally I would say no. But in a bear market anything can happen. 

Speaking of ETF, this is a good thread about the CBOE ETF:

https://twitter.com/cryptoqf/status/1022601530770247682?s=21

At this point, if the SEC denies all and every Bitcoin ETF all they’ll be doing is restricting their citizens from getting exposure to the massive gains that will likely come from Bitcoin, just like they did in 2016.  

Honestly, I think the best outcome would be to delay the decision until end of this year or 2019. That way there will still be some ETF hopium for the rest of the year while useless alts continue to bleed like they should. The longer we extend the bear market the greater the next rally will be.

Quote:
The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges.

The bid-ask spreads varied widely across exchanges, the SEC said. The volume in bitcoin futures markets are small: 20 percent the volume of platinum, and 2.5 percent that of silver.

As for assertions that bitcoin is uniquely resistant to manipulations, the SEC ""finds that the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.""

There is one silver lining. There is 1 commissioner who is pro crypto and wrote a dissent against the Bitcoin ETF rejection. She will be on the vote until 2020. The remaining 3 commissioners are either getting replaced or term will be up before then.

e38csoq,vbuterin,141,"\&gt; Ok? With respect to finality, this is probabilistic (like bitcoin so that's now somehow an issue after 9 years!?)

It's absolutely an issue in terms of what kind of applications it *deters*. Businesses are less likely to put high-value apps on chain if Bitmain can revert transactions costlessly (yes, a 51% attack on PoW is costless if it succeeds). If Bitmain can revert transactions only at a $1B cost, on the other hand, then that's a better security model.

\&gt; Long time to guarantee safety?

Which at current parameterization, occurs within 5 minutes

That's still a long time. Casper (FFG or CBC) can achieve that level of safety within \~1 slot, because of how it uses GHOST and a large number of messages per slot. This is an inherent tradeoff; optimal rate of achieving statistical safety is proportional to consensus overhead.

\&gt; VRFs are bad!? Why exactly? Not following this at all. Even Micali is using them for Algorand.

They're not bad, but they are ""yet another technical dependency"" (eg. when quantum computers come along you'll have to replace the VSS scheme etc etc, you might have to worry about upgrading curves, etc etc). You also lose the benefit if more than 50% of participants are offline at some particular time.

\&gt; Resistant to the manipulation of randomness is just bizarre

Why? The algorithm being secure even if (as a worst case) the attacker can choose the RNG seed is a great thing; it means that you don't have to worry if there's an issue with the RNG.

Then, people started realizing they could use GPUs (the processors on graphics cards) to mine at a much faster rate.

This makes GPUs well suited to mining Bitcoin, since mining involves doing the same simple tasks many times in parallel.

Then, people started building ASICs to mine Bitcoin.  An ASIC -- Application-Specific Integrated Circuit -- is a chip that is custom designed for a specific task.  It does not use a CPU at all; it is essentially a huge collection of logic gates like AND, OR, NAND, etc. that are chained together to do what the designer needs.  Because it is limited only by the speed of the underlying hardware, a properly-designed ASIC is *far* faster than anything that uses a CPU or even a GPU.  It also uses less power.

Bitcoin transactions can't be reversed and some aspects of it can be confusing, which allows a scammer to take advantage of someone who doesn't have much knowledge. And once stolen, there's usually no way to recover what was lost.

Next up is securing backups. If your uncle had ""several bitcoin"", then that adds up to a 5 digit number in USD. You don't want to lose that due to a harddisk crash. Try and find out which Bitcoin wallet application your uncle used and then search for the best ways to backup its data. Store this backup in a secure location!

In order to sell the bitcoins for Dollars, you can use an exchange service. Multiple exist, each with their advantages and disadvantages and people can have endless discussions on which is best and which is to be avoided.

However, if you're just looking for a quick way to sell, you should look at Coinbase. This is a US company with a long history in this market. Many long time Bitcoin supporters aren't the biggest fans of this company, but their (legitimate) objections don't really apply to your situation. 

After signing up to the service, you may have to provide some documentation (ID and such) for anti-money-laundering purposes. Once you're fully setup, you can use the service to create a sell order. The website will show you the address to send the bitcoins to, which you copy/paste into the Bitcoin application on the computer/phone (or scan the QR code) and from there you send the bitcoins. Once they're fully received and ""confirmed"" (a process that can take anywhere between a few minutes and more than an hour, depending on a number of factors including random chance), the sale is finalized and the USD can be withdrawn to a bank account you provide.

It's important not to rush into things. Bitcoin is still relatively new and experimental technology and costly mistakes are easily made. If you've created a secure backup of the wallet data, then you can take your time researching exactly how to sell the bitcoins and figuring out how the website of the exchange you've picked works before going through the process of actually selling. If possible, perform the steps of selling the coins using only a small portion (keep in mind that bitcoins can be divided into fractions, with each bitcoin being divisible into 100,000,000 smaller units. You don't have to transact entire bitcoins) so that you can properly test the procedure with little risk.",2018-07-30 18:05:08

• I use Bread Wallet on iPhone. 

• I don’t know who their processor is. 

• It wasn’t Lightning as far as I know. 

• No, they didn’t wait for confirmation, but looking at the transaction it confirmed before I got the food anyway. 4 minutes. 

• Yes, those are beans. It was an English breakfast burger. It also had mushrooms, an egg, a sausage, a hash brown, and bacon, as well as the usual burger bits. 

• It was delicious. 

• The £23 includes my wife’s food too, as well as drinks and a starter. 

• Yes, it probably will end up to be the most expensive meal I’ve ever bought. 

• No regrets. ",2018-07-30 07:07:54

e38o560,SarangNoether,53,"Hello once again; Dr. Sarang Noether here with my monthly report for July. As always, my thanks to the Monero community for supporting my work and that of the Monero Research Lab in general. We work to keep Monero on the cutting edge through quality research and analysis, and this month has been no exception.

[Bulletproof audit results are coming in!](https://github.com/SarangNoether/research-lab/tree/master/audits/bulletproofs) Kudelski Security has completed their final report, which includes responses from our researchers and developers. The gist is that a few minor issues were found that have been patched; of course, these issues were only found in our non-production code, and were all considered to be of low risk with no exploits identified.  QuarksLab has provided their initial draft report as well. They identified issues that have been patched, but were also unable to identify any direct exploits. A third independent review from Benedikt Bünz has finished, and he has provided an initial report as well, finding issues only affecting the prototype implementation that do not apply to production code. Additionally, the transaction fee model is being updated to reflect the space savings offered by Bulletproofs, and you should see at least an 80% reduction in fees. Kudos to the many people who have worked hard on the math, code, analysis, and testing leading up to this point.

I spoke at a blockchain event in Portland on the importance of privacy and fungibility in digital assets. While this wasn't formally representing the Lab, I did use Monero as an example of good technology. My travel and hotel were covered by the organizers (with a small stipend for food), with no community funding used. In August, I will be speaking at our DEF CON village on design principles and attacks across different asset projects; my hotel, travel, and food will be covered thanks to generous community donations. In September, I will be delivering two similar talks at a privacy-focused event in Houston, where my expenses will be covered by the organizers. I think there are great benefits to educating the public through talks and presentations, and I like being transparent about how they are funded. Relating to this, lecture material and exercises from my summer course (which took place last month in Atlanta) have been [posted to my repository](https://github.com/SarangNoether/research-lab/tree/master/publications/course). There are undoubtedly the usual typos and other mistakes present, so any corrections and additions are welcome!

My latest work has focused on a new confidential transaction model in the works by a group of researchers affiliated with Tim Ruffing, with whom we've interacted before. You may remember that name from some earlier work on sublinear ring signatures. Their team provided us an internal draft of a new paper that describes a clever way to integrate several aspects of confidential transactions, like ring signatures and range proofs, into a single compact structure. The scheme could allow us to scale to large ring sizes without the associated cost in transaction size. I've been working on some prototype code to help me better understand the math and scaling of the proposal, which are complex. We have no immediate plans to transition to this, but it's exciting new research that deserves a close look as it's being developed. Incomplete (and ongoing) code [has been posted to my repository](https://github.com/SarangNoether/research-lab/tree/rupol/source-code/rupol). To my knowledge, this is the first test implementation of several of the underlying mathematical building blocks.

Ongoing work for the next month will include several projects. I will complete my study of the prototype sublinear transaction model with more concrete data on scaling and feasibility. I will assist lab partner Surae Noether with review of his newly-completed multisignature scheme security proofs, which have been a formidable and comprehensive effort. There is interesting analysis to be done on how a CoinJoin-type model for transaction merging might (or might not!) be a future option for users who want such a thing. And I want to continue some early work on generalizing the Bulletproofs math to arbitrary numbers of outputs, which could have applications for other zero-knowledge systems. There is always plenty to be done!

As always, my thanks to everyone for supporting my work and that of the Monero Research Lab. We work hard to keep Monero safely on the cutting edge, and it's all thanks to our excellent community. Comments, questions, and suggestions are always welcome.

And now to Sarang's Reading Corner, a short list of some papers that I've found interesting recently.

* [Flux: Revisiting Near Blocks for Proof-of-Work Blockchains](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/415): A method of using so-called ""near blocks"" (whose proof-of-work does not quite meet difficulty restrictions) to incentivize honest mining strategies.

* [Efficient Batch Zero-Knowledge Arguments for Low Degree Polynomials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/045): A zero-knowledge framework for polynomial relations that has many applications. The techniques in this paper were adapted for use in the proposed sublinear confidential transaction scheme by Ruffing and collaborators.

* [Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin](http://zerocoin.org/media/pdf/ZerocoinOakland.pdf): The original paper describing Zerocoin, a way to use zero-knowledge proofs for anonymity as a Bitcoin extension. This work was the basis for later papers that led to Zerocash and the Zcash project. I revisited this paper while writing a talk on design principles and attacks on asset projects.

That green arrow is supposed to indicate decreasing volume over time, but I think it got messed up while the poster was readjusting the chart. To be honest I am not sure if the symmetrical triangle (the smaller triangle) will form anything, but I believe that the ascending triangle (the bigger triangle) will result in a run up. 

&gt;The ascending triangle pattern represents a period of consolidation during an uptrend, so the volume tends to contract as the pattern develops over time. When the breakout occurs, traders usually look for a significant increase in volume as confirmation of a breakout. The absence of volume during a breakout could lead to a false breakout - or a bull trap. ~https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingtriangle.asp

Indicators are pointing to at least some major change. MACD is pointing towards bullish, RSI is at a perfect neutral 50, and Bollinger Bands are squeezing which also indicates a major change. 

If y'all want some *fundamental* analysis, ethereum usually trails bitcoin's bull runs, and should run up soon. However, if we see a drop in Bitcoin were probably going to come down to the $420 support level. Honestly, there is no news that really points into any change. The recent announcement by [China that they will be using ethereum to develop China's dream city](https://www.ccn.com/chinas-dream-city-taps-ethereum-dev-studio-consensys-for-blockchain-push/) did absolutely nothing to price, so if anything fundamentals are pointing sideways until Constantinople.

I don't have NW 25x my salary, but isn't that always the situation? To your point, 5% of $2.5M is certainly more than 5% of $1M or $500k or $250k, etc., but the principles of investing remain the same for everyone--you invest because you believe in the market/your ability to grow your funds over the long run, and you set your investment allocations commensurate with your risk tolerance.

Absent inheritance or lottery, someone with $2.5M NW (or any large figure) has almost certainly (possible exception of real estate and bitcoin..) invested heavily in, and reaped the benefits of, the market, and would presumably not sweat a 5% drop since the next week may very well have a 5% gain.

In fixed numbers, 'losing' $125k (5% of 2.5M) in unrealized gains in a week or month would be distressing, but what about the same person who whose $2.5M portfolio would've probably grown ~20%/$500k in 2017?

e3bfd9n,dieyoung,122,"&gt;This allows for value to go to people who produce nothing 

Define nothing? What about the collective most powerful computer network on the planet? What about a payment network that can never be shut down? Don't forget that miners, unlike banks, have to actually eat costs instead of getting printed fiat on a whim to cover up exotic derivatives products that go south, which truly produce nothing.

&gt;However, the system is so broken that the barrier for entry is too high 

Blockreward is 12.5 BTC every ten minutes, that's a hefty chunk of change, the barrier to entry will obviously be harder because of economies of scale, but even so, I'm seeing used 13.5 th s9's on eBay for 800 bucks. This, to me, is hardly too high to run a miner, if you want to get price exposure to bitcoin, just buy some bitcoin. 

&gt;forcing many miners to LEAVE THE ECOSYSTEM

Where are you seeing this? Hash rate has been going up consistently.

ASIC fab monopolies are bad, but the market is already coming with solutions to Bitmain (innosilicon is one that comes to mind). Bitmain was first to act and will enjoy huge profits for a time, but crypto is the most ruthlessly capitalistic environment out there. Given we have basically hit the physical limits for the size of transistors we can produce, we have effectively hit Moore's law like a brick wall. Bye bye 10000x hashing improvements a year. Bitmain singlehandedly put the money up to accelerate the progress of hardware advancements and has first first mover advantage, but I anticipate that this is, as Andreas puts it, ""peak mining centralization""

Now as for the pools, I'm with you dude. I got out of btc and went all into eth in feb 15 for a lot of reasons, but I'm bringing it up to make the point that UNLIKE the legacy banking sector, we actually have a free market. If you don't like how btc is doing things, you can put your money somewhere else. 

&gt;A truly decentralized system would reward every node or user equally. 

Regardless of input costs for potentially larger returns? A truly Decentralized system would NOT reward every node or user equally, it Should be directly correlated to the quantifiable amount you are contributing to the network, which, in our case, is defined by the hash rate of your machine.

I think that btc has lost the plot but that's besides the point...I think you have some good points but I would say that the remedy to the problems you are pointing outis a free market, which we have. you have the ability to move YOUR hash power  and YOUR money wherever you want without asking permission from any greasy bastard in the middle.",2018-07-31 07:24:22

e3bke5o,NeoBag200kgDeadlift,107,"Neo back, reporting. I took the weekend off and now I am coming back to spread some motivation. I am not going to promise you that OMG will hit out superficial targets of $50, $100, $200, $500, $700, $1,000 Februari 2018.  

This is what is happening right now. Ethereum is in a tough spot for the short term and I will tell you why. See below.

1. Delays in 1st layer solutions: Casper and sharding, which were highly anticipated this year, are now being pushed back until 2019-2020. This is a bit of a surprise for everyone, but the general consensus is that if ETH is to survive in the long run, it needs more time, more of its dedicated developers to formulate the proper solution.

 2.  Shitcoin/ERC - 20 money grabs are tired: Lets face it, 2017 was a shitcoin tsunami. You could write a whitepaper promising the world, put together a roadmap with some liberal arts major college buddies disguising their credentials as experts in their fields as your advisors, and make tens of millions in an ico. Those days are over and its a good thing, but the money grabs will reflect as time goes on and they fail to deliver. 

3.  Bitcoin sentiment from VC/ETF/the global face of crypto: Bitcoin is, and always will be king. Its time is here again, and it is in a crossroad where the CBOE futures will decide if it breaks $11.6k double top this year, followed by another test at ATH, or if it gets rejected and finds new lows. We don't know at this point. What we do know is ETH is still pegged to it, and as a result of OMG being pegged to ETH, OMG is pegged to BTC. Some thoughts - 

\-People want to see BTC hit another ATH. By people I mean scared retail investors who are curious about cryptocurrency still, and VC funds that trade on margin, have ties to the giants in the industry such as Bitmain, Coinbase (Aka, normiebase), and re-emerging exchanges in China. It needs its time, and if it does go for another ATH, we can expect the general sentiment of cryptocurrencies to follow through as well. 

Some good points about ETH:

1. Despite the delays, there are several projects working on secondary scaling solutions for plasma (\*Cough OMG cough\*). If successful, this will only expand the capabilities of ETH and OMG in unison. 
2. China has recently proclaimed their adoption of it over standard cryptocurrencies such as NEO. China is a market mover, for good or for bad, and they never took a deliberate stance on Ethereum until recently. I view this as bullish. 
3. Head over to /r/ethtrader and you will find many recent articles about banks testing ethereum as a platform for their business, including banks in Australia, Europe, Asia, and USA. For every emerging bitcoin maxamalist is an ethereum maxamalist that wants to have a less centralized solution (IE: BTC mining heavily controlled by Bitmain) to explore this technology.

So where does OMG fit in all of this? 

\-&gt; Consistent exposure with new exchange listings as of recently in London, Australia, China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and United States.

\-&gt; Curiosity from non-cryptocurrency businesses looking into the sdk, looking at crypto amicably because of OmiseGO, and if all works out, integrating on the network. I'm still convinced that Line, Alibaba, and Japanese companies have at some point collaborated with OMG. We will see if they follow through.

\-&gt; Plasma. ETH needs a project to operate as a child chain with a bigger use case than developing dapps with games. If OMG is able to deliver on plasma for financial inclusion and successfully increase the capabilities of ETH from tx/s scalability, it will have a ton of spotlights on it this year. Some of the biggest criticism of ETH comes down to its slow speeds of 15 tx/s.

\-&gt; OMG has the exposure, globally. it fell on deaf ears in Q1-Q2 as other projects who were better at communicating got more exposure, more price movement, and more leeway with interested parties. If OMG has been establishing its network, has been working rigorously on plasma, and delivers its intention of plasma this year, it will survive as a top 5-10 token. That is a fact.

Lets put aside the angst of the market. OMG team, keep up the good work and don't get discouraged as you have already made it this far. ",2018-07-31 08:45:17

It is confirmed as more and more blocks come in. Looks like bitcoin won't be torn apart after all. The price recovers, slowly at first but then shooting up higher than it's ever been before. The UASF plan worked! Segwit is ours!""*

1st August 2018 marks exactly one year since the activation of the segwit UASF (user activated soft fork). An extremely important event in bitcoin's history.

Segregated Witness (segwit) is an update to bitcoin that fixes one of bitcoin's long-standing bugs and makes off-chain contracts possible. It is necessary to make Lightning Network work on bitcoin.

Segwit was scheduled to be added to bitcoin as a soft fork, but bitcoin's enemies started spreading lies about it. Lies like ""miners can steal bitcoins stored on segwit addresses"", ""segwit is too complicated"" and ""segwit goes against Satoshi's vision"".  Some large mining pools used these convenient excuses to stop segwit from happening. In reality there were secret agendas at play, such as [the realization that Lightning Network would make coin tracking startups ineffective](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/860826532650123264) and [the patented covert miner attack ASICBOOST](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/63otrp/gregory_maxwell_major_asic_manufacturer_is/).

User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is a way to activate soft forks like segwit even if the miners are blocking it. This works because bitcoin's consensus rules are enforced by users who use full node wallets, not by miners. The BIP148 proposal was made to do this with the activation date: 1st August 2017. In the weeks leading up to that date there was lively debate on all the forums, and supporters of the idea including some bitcoin business ran the BIP148 client software as their full node wallet.

This was all risky. If some miners had still refused to back segwit it could have led to a damaging chain-split. For this reason UASF is sometimes controversial to this day. But in that atmosphere of cripplingly-high miner fees, lots of people took the view that the risks were worth it.

In the end the UASF was successful. Miners actually got together to create a plan called BIP91 where they would activate segwit slightly ahead of the 1st August deadline. With segwit added to bitcoin, the mining group Bitmain who were opposed to segwit created an altcoin called bcash which didnt have segwit and which was fraudulently marketed as ""the real bitcoin"".

In the year since segwit activation, [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) implementations have been released on mainnet. They are regularly used to send payments that are much more private, are instant, ridiculously cheap and do not burden the full nodes or miners that are essential to bitcoin's decentralization. A true revolution that makes entirely new applications possible, such as [satoshi's place](https://satoshis.place/).",2018-07-31 19:58:35

Cash proponents are more than happy to openly discuss the Core chain, it's pros and cons; Core proponents desperately shut down discussion, condemn any perspective that isn't enthusiastically critical of it, and argue in ways that are disingenuous or downright incompatible with everything that Bitcoin stands for. 

The market will decide. You're right, that's how it's meant to work. I'm confident that most rational, well-informed people will see the superiority of the protocol rules on the Cash chain. Can you honestly say the same of Core?

e3bzt3n,kegman83,49,"But there is cost to using gold, its just not apparent or upfront. You have to expend energy to physically hand the coin to someone else. The cheapest way is to walk, but usually you have to drive or travel some distance.

Thats cost.

Then there is storage. You dont leave gold on your coffee table. Its secured usually through a safe. Thats cost. That safe usually exists in a house thats rented or mortgaged. Cost. 

That is not to forget that gold is mined, just like crypto. Energy and time are expended in order to take ore and make it metal. Thats also added into the cost. Miners know this, and will only mine if its worth more than it is to dig it up. The day it isnt is the day gold is worthless. 

Whereas the cost to mine bitcoin usually is fixed or pegged to the difficulty adjustment code in bitcoin.  Where there is a dramatic loss in miners, the code adjusts its difficulty accordingly! Recently a flood took out several mining farms in China. And the difficulty adjusted automatically. You cant do that with a mine, not to mention there are a thousand more points of chaos you need to consider down to physical acts of god.",2018-07-31 13:10:02

e3aulyj,devoidz,46,"The dark or deep web is just another part of the internet that is basically kept off google's radar. You need a special set up to get to it. I have a usb with a version of Linux on it, that is made specifically for tor. It is called tails. The web sites themselves are hard to find. Once you get in there it is hard as hell to find anything really. But there is google like things that work in there that can find some sites, that could give you a starting point to finding other, better more legit sites. There used to be a site called silk road, you could buy almost anything there, drugs, counterfeit money, weapons, supposedly hit men. It used bitcoin mostly for transactions. Risky because once you sent it, it's gone. You don't know who you sent it to, and you don't know if they are going to send you what you bought. Yeah man send me $10k in bitcoin and I'll send you a ton of weed. lol.

e3awe5v,jessquit,46,"I want to say thank you for the BU team taking a leadership role here and implementing something proactively that the community has been asking for.  This is very healthy when various teams spearhead various initiatives.  It would be a detriment if one client became the defacto leader of the entire BCH initiative.  It's really exciting to have a working implementation of Graphene, too.  This is good for Bitcoin (BCH).

I would implore all the teams to work together to draft implementation guidelines to allow other teams to implement Graphene in a manner which is compatible.  I would expect BU to take the lead here and work proactively with the other teams to ensure that Graphene gets implemented in a consistent manner across the interoperating clients.

I would also expect members of other teams to work together to help BU identify the minimum necessary documentation needed so that we are not imposing inordinate work on BU and / or slowing down implementation unnecessarily.  With documentation the KISS principle is always the appropriate rule of thumb.",2018-07-31 02:56:04
