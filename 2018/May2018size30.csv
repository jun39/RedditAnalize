dy9aj24,RequiemAA,590,"Sometimes dreams are real. You'll know it for truth the first time you linger in the dream through the night, and in to the next morning, then beyond. You'll know when you wake, and sleep, and dream while dreaming, living your life one interminable breath at a time, each moment seeming as real as your moments before the moment you began this decade dream. 

Eventually you wake.

You go from wherever you were on your twentieth birthday back to where you went to sleep on your tenth. A complete reset.

No questions asked.

You remember everything as well as anyone can remember a previous decade.

At first I was overjoyed. All my mistakes, all my growth, all my wildest dreams and hopeless despairs... all the things I missed out on. I could fix them. I could be so much more than I was.

But then you think, ""What if this is a *dream*""? You've been dreaming so long you forgot you were doing it. The first day is a bit of a haze. You're still unsure if you're going to wake up and be twenty again, or if this is really the miracle it seems it is. You think of all the things you'll do - you won't miss out on Bitcoin, you'll date Blake, you'll meet all your best friends sooner and know them for longer. 

You fall asleep that night and wake up the next morning ten years and a day old. It sets in. You aren't dreaming, this is real.

You go through your life giddy. Each day feels more real than the last and you start to forget that hazy feeling from the first. You forget that you're dreaming.

You're nineteen years old, almost twenty, and your life couldn't be more perfect. You've got the girl of your dreams, the riches from all your preternatural investments, and your life is *right*. Your life is the way it should have been the first time. 

You go to sleep the night before your twentieth birthday expecting a dreamless sleep. Instead you wake to a ten year old nightmare.

A hundred year nightmare. A thousand.

It doesn't end. I'm stuck in a time-loop. I've lived every possible variation of my life. I've been Uncontested Ruler of the World by seventeen. I cured cancer and aging and every other ailment, and invented perpetual energy machines. No matter what I do, after a full decade from my tenth birthday, I reset. 

I can't take it anymore.

This is my suicide note.

The dreamer grabbed a knife from his parent's kitchen and walked in to the bathroom. He sat in a tub filled with hot water, holding his forearms out in front of him, placing the knife along the vein just under the wrist. 

*down the tracks, not across*

He traced a vein with the blade down his arm from wrist to elbow. Hot, dark blood began to pour from the wound. As the blood began to flow, our dreamer laid back in the tub, submerging the bleeding arm with a sigh.

*it's done*

The long sigh draws tight and becomes shallow. His breathing becomes labored, then tired, then stops. Our dreamer is unconscious. Then dies.

dy8hsw5,Snowaeth,196,"In this specific case the point of blockchain is the fact that it secures the bitcoin which makes bitcoin a trusted source of money which in turn becomes accepted money for other payment methods such as this.  
Also in this specific case when accepted in its bitcoin form the sender does not need to convert their bitcoin to the local currency.  

Just like with any other kind of money you can spend bitcoin in more than one way so in this specific case off-chain, for something that doesn't require an on-chain transaction doesn't mean the blockchain securing the whole currency becomes useless while this specific payment itself does not need to be trustless (trusting Bitflyer in this case).  

So this doesn't diminish bitcoins use-case of being usable as trust-less on-chain payment options when it's needed directly from your own private wallet owned by you instead of an exchange if you need that layer of security for your transaction which would come at the cost of transaction/confirmation speed.",2018-05-01 07:02:48

dy7z1vg,FauxShizzle,117,"The benefits of cryptocurrency mainly involve decentralization (as long as the benefits of decentralizing said network outweigh the inefficiencies of removing centralization), but also immutability of a ledger. So as long as you trust that central authority not to tamper with the blockchain records, then it's an improvement because all their orders will be easily auditable.

I personally don't think this is an improvement though because the point of decentralizing is so you don't have to inherently trust any central authority to be fairly keeping records.

On a separate note, no one mines bitcoin on a GPU, they use ASICs. People mine Monero on CPUs (a lot of time through unsuspecting visitors to websites) but GPUs are generally mining things like Ether, ZenCash, MonaCoin, et cetera.",2018-05-01 02:10:11
dy9f5vx,jessquit,114,"&gt;Interesting. So why did Satoshi choose to reduce the block size instead of increase it to combat spam? 

This is a common misunderstanding.

There are two different attacks under discussion.

The first is a ""poison block"" attack. This is the attack the block size limit was created to prevent. At the time it was created the level of ""spam"" on the network was zero, and the coin had no real established market value, very few miners, and extremely low mining difficulty. It cost almost nothing at all to mine at home. A malicious miner could generate a giant block full of transactions to himself, and basically cause all the other miners to choke on it while trying to validate it. This attack is described [here](http://gavinandresen.ninja/One-Dollar-Lulz).  The limit was set at 1MB which was two orders of magnitude larger than the largest typical block - ie, *extremely* high with respect to the network demand, with [the expectation that it could be easily raised long before it was an impediment](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/485/). Having a block size limit was a way to keep anyone from making a poison block without getting automatically orphaned.

""Spam"" is a different thing altogether. Spam is when someone creates a large number of low fee transactions with the purpose of ""padding"" the real transactions with fake ones to *fill the block size to the limit.* Maybe miners do it in order to jack up fees. Maybe altcoin pumpers do it to degrade performance of the Bitcoin chain. Maybe there's some other perfectly benign reason for these transactions.  Maybe they're just a user trying to make a lot of inexpensive transactions. Whatever the reason, the point to understand is that in a spam attack, *the block size limit itself is the attack vector.* By raising it we make it harder to spam the chain.",2018-05-01 20:02:18

dya9g2m,brendantheaney,321,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

dybjn0d,StopAndDecrypt,94,"Here's Giacomo at HCPP17: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwW7XZCKPU

And on Bitcoin Uncensored: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWSfMmLGtc

I am no /u/kanzure but I'll give combining Giacomo's thread a shot. Someone linked a site that aggregates tweet storms but the formatting is still bad so here it is pieced together:

.

Ok, here I am. I'll write down some bullet-points. This isn't a rebuttal of your article (no time for that, at least not now): it's just my own list of arguments about what specifically I think makes you, and every other bcasher who isn't intentionally malicious, stupid.

1: Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history. If anyone interested in wealth &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid. I get from your other tweets that you're not interested in wealth (I am), so at least this point doesn't really concern you.

2: Bitcoin is one of the greatest opportunities for the advancement of personal freedom in human history. I think whoever qualifies as a ""libertarian"" in the anglo-saxon ""free market"" tradition (I guess this is the case for you) &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid.

3: When I say ""misses it/fuck up w/ it"" (1,2) I mean, in a crescendo of stupidity level: 

1. privately dismissing it
2. publicly dismissing it advising others to do the same
3. publicly &amp; actively attacking it
4. going down in history as an enemy of Bitcoin (zenith of stupidity).

4: Bitcoin is a complex topic: I don't think who don't understand it fully qualifies as stupid just for that, but who, w/o understanding it, voices very strong/controversial opinions about it, taking extreme stances under the effect of his own cognitive dissonance, does qualify.

5: Since Bitcoin is complex (4), I don't think everybody should/could come to understand it deeply, subtile trade-offs included, but I think everybody who isn't stupid can easily use basic heuristics to distinguish/compare other people's expertise, skills, integrity, honesty. Thus, even w/o discussing his ability to master this complex topic directly, whoever systematically, continuously &amp; exclusively conflates experts w/ solid arguments with obvious/blatant scammers, fraudsters, con-men, manipulators &amp; compromised/bad fully qualifies as stupid.

6: Slight change of topic (it will make sense later on): I think I understand Bitcoin enough to say it's very likely an unrepeatable experiment. Altcoins, even if they weren't the scammy, clumsy, useless, inferior Bitcoin clones they all are, are inherently stupid, because:

1. their success would undermine the only thing that make the ""digital gold scarcity"" value proposition possible (focal point around the original issuance)
2. they can't replicate Bitcoin's ""immaculate conception"", they're compromised since day 0, by definition.

So, I think that, while the Bitcoin experiment COULD very well still fail (even if I think &amp; hope w/ all my heart it will succede), altcoins couldn't possible win. I think it's very stupid to bet on the altcoin-takeover or (even worse) on the multicoin-coexistence scenarios.

7: Another slight change of topic: it's obvious to me there is a fundamental problem w/ a global-state network designed in such a way that it will FOREVER require EVERY single node to get &amp; process EVERY single past &amp; present state change. I think only a stupid would disagree. Luckily, I don't think Bitcoin as a whole is doomed to be such a system (even if we could say it has been for a while). There're are several techniques, some already imagined by Satoshi &amp; even by his predecessors, that could at least mitigate this (obvious) inherent problem:

* trusted 3rd parties for little/fast txs, where counterparty risk is minimised anyway, + on-chain settlement (Finney),
* trustless nSequence-based payment channels, + on-chain settlement (Satoshi),
* few big ""masternode"" enabling trustless SPV via fraud-proofs (Satoshi),
* trustless sharding: nodes get/verify only some relevant information, ignoring other parts of the global state (Todd, Maxwell, alt.),
* trustless pruning: nodes get/verify only recent information, discarding all the old information eventually (Todd, Maxwell, alt.).

Unfortunately, not all these theoretical techniques turn out to work in practice: 

* trusted 3rd parties turned out to be a systemic risk
* nSequence channels idea was broken &amp; we had to wait years to be fixed (SegWit+LN channels) &amp; improved (LN trustless onion routing),
* Satoshi's fraud-proofs turned out to be unfeasible, making SPV basically trust-based &amp; the ""few big masternodes"" model easy to censor/attack
* trustless sharding (aka Sidechains???), while being sold as a buzzword by Ethereum scammers, is still a difficult/unproved topic,
* trustless pruning turned out to be unfeasible as well, leaving syncing nodes w/ the need to get/verify ALL the past information, to discard it only after sync to save space.

It takes a stupid to think that difficult problems are magically solved just by some (smart) idea.

8: I think I know Bitcoin enough to say that, as long as the aforementioned fundamental problem (7) still exists (thus excluding future advancement &amp; current off-chain 2nd layers, finally in production), there's a difficult trade-off between easy-validation &amp; easy-transaction.

* An hypothetical blockchain w/ 200kb blocks every 4hrs would be cheap/fast to validate: we'd run full nodes on our mobiles, orphan-rate would be low &amp; mining decentralized. But only few use-cases (big/slow settlements) would fit on-chain, forcing everything else off-chain.
* An hypothetical blockchain w/ 10Gb blocks every 2secs would be trivially cheap/fast to use directly for every use-case, including the most stupid ones, but it would be too expensive/slow to validate for anybody, centralizing Bitcoin completely.

There's a spectrum in between.

9: While I can accept different opinions about this (w/o necessarily considering stupid who would make the opposite point), I think there're solid arguments hinting at the fact that Bitcoin as-is could be too much shifted into the easy-to-transact extreme of that spectrum (8) just empirically, a lot of people are transacting on-chain (even for very stupid use-cases where you DON'T need censorship resistance at all) while very few people run validating nodes, most relying on centralized 3rd parties that could easily compromised/corrupted/censored.

10:While maybe debatable, the above argument (9) for Bitcoin being, as is, actually too much transaction-friendly (as opposed to validation-friendly), could/should be already pretty concerning already in the current context, that we could/should consider a BEST-case scenario:

* Internet infrastructure is not likely to be partitioned in the next months because of global wars (hopefully), 
* Bitcoin mining isn't (yet) illegal in China, 
* Bitcoin users can sync even without using Tor because Bitcoin is not (yet) fought so hard by government, etc.

But Bitcoin should be able to survive &amp; remain censorship resistant in the WORST case scenario! The same could be said about orphan-rate &amp; mining centralization: arguably too high since years in an overall good case scenario! What could it become in the worst case one?

11: Even if my assessment about the position of Bitcoin as is in that trade-off (9) was wrong (I really think it isn't), I guess it takes a special kind of stupid to ignore the fact that the different failure modes at the 2 extremes are actually NOT SYMMETRICAL at all:while in the ""crippled extreme"" there will ALWAYS be use-cases that will pay/wait enough to be mined, by definition, there are not ways to survive government censorship in the ""centralized extreme"". Given Bitcoin's goals, it's very stupid not to be conservative about this!

12: Regardless of the kind of update/change we are talking about, EVEN if it was super-safe from a validation-costs/mining-centralization point of view, every possible change of rules, good or bad, IS in itself an attack surface that could be used to corrupt/attack the project! This would true ALSO for changes I personally approve, like Segwit (I elaborated further about this very topic in my old ""Split"" article, but it seems to have been taken down by Crypto Insider, i don't know why: https://cryptoinsider.com/split-thoughts-bip148-uasf-segwit-bitcoin-life-universe-everything/ … ...ping @CryptoInsiderCI!!!). 

13: Arguments against contentious ""on-chain scale"" increases (9, 10, 11, 12) are reinforced by the fact that, while for things as fungibility &amp; decentralization it's race against time, for throughput increases THERE IS ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, there is NO RUSH by definition! Many said we should rush to avoid that ""altcoins will take over"", but this is just logical non-sense. Either my argument about altcoins (6) is true or it's false. If it's true, then altcoins CANNOT take over, because they can't possibly deliver what Bitcoin can deliver. If it's false, then fine: what's the problem in getting financial freedom with one or more altcoins, expecially if we are here for the ideological goal (2) and not for the financial one (1...but even in the case, we can just dump some btc to buy the winner alts). Win win! If that argument is false, there's no need to change Bitcoin in contentious/dangerous way: we can just wait for the ""better altcoins"" (lol). On the other hand, if that argument is true &amp; we DO compromise Bitcoin's security, even just a little, we screwed up our only chance.

14: Even if I was wrong about the current state of Bitcoin (9), the simple fact that there isn't/cannot be ANY RUSH (13) makes obvious the choice to prioritise study/development/adoption of long-term sustainable solutions (off-chain), instead of kicking the can down the road.

dybjn8k,StopAndDecrypt,70,"15: Now I'd like to get back to a more general topic. I honestly think it's a clear sing of stupidity to fall for the old, typical, standard, obvious trick of populist conspiracy theories! These theories are all very similar, &amp; they all basically go like this: ""the world would be perfect, everything would come for free, w/o any scarcity, any sacrifice, any trade-offs...if not for an evil minority who creates ARTIFICIAL scarcity ù6 trade-offs, all to get some power over us with extremely complex &amp; not well defined machinations!"". I think only stupid people falls for this kind of cheap rhetoric, but don't get me wrong: that's a lot of people! Most persons are more stupid than the average person, &amp; the average person is indeed very stupid! That's why populist myths are widely used by politicians.

16: While populist conspiracy theories are stupid in and of themselves (15), the particular one used in the ""Bitcoin scalability"" circus is an astonishingly idiotic variation around the basic plot. I really thing only very stupid people could fall for something like this (5). In this case the explanation of the conspiracy is more cumbersome than usual. To begin w/, basically all the cypherpunks that pioneered the discovery of Bitcoin (Back, Szabo, Todd, Finney) inexplicably do agree on the existence of the ""artificial"" trade-off/scarcity. Weird! Then some of those pioneers are even recruited by the usual conspiracy villains (Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever) to create a company, Blockstream, committed to destroy Bitcoin through conservation/promotion of the ""artificial"", fake limitations/trade-offs. Wow, much evil! There isn't a very clear explanation of the exact motivation behind the Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever evil plan...probably they're just afraid of Bitcoin since they ""control all the banks"" (Duh!). Don't tell anybody but...I think they may even be JEWS!!! Spooky!!! Since dumb conspiracy theories don't have to be consistent, this goal is confused w/ another one, aslo very typical: PROFIT!!! Sooo evil! Apparently, Blockstream ""will make money w/ commercial sidechains, because people will use the Lightning Network due to small blocks!"". Ok, LN isn't really a commercial Sidechain, but an open, permissionless layer on top of Bitcoin, characterized by negligible-to-inexistent fees, developed by many independent company/developers &amp; run by thousands of independent, competing parties. But who cares, right?

17: On logical ground only, we can already say this particular flavour of populist conspiracy theory (16) is so stupid that only very stupid people would fall for it. But it's also based on many factual lies, all actually very easy to debunk: ie the number of Bitcoin Core developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Bitcoin Core developers NOT employed by Blockstream, Lightning Network developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Lightning Network developers NOT employed by Blockstream, and so on. There are also a lot of economical/political misconceptions (about ""censorship"", for example), typically used to promote this idiotic conspiracy theory. I tried to list some of them in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwW7XZCKPU …. Only very stupid people would believe this stuff.

18: Simple heuristics aren't just useful to be skeptical about non-sensical conspiracy theories, but also (&amp; especially) to beware clear, obvious, blatant fraudsters/liars. So, the ""big block"" field is now mostly lead/sponsored/pushed by: Craig S. Right, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver. The first is a confirmed con-artist, who tried to impersonate Satoshi Nakamoto w/ false (delirious) claims, fake digital signature, fake pre-dated blogposts &amp; PGP keys. Every single con attempt was publicly debunked. Purpose? Visibility, but also patent-trolling vs Bitcoin. The second is an Asic monopolist (I actually hope not for long), connected w/ the Chinese government, who is playing since years an obvious monopoly troll-game against Bitcoin, completed w/ kill-switches, backdoors &amp; covert optimisations built on stuff sold to other people. The third is a pathological, narcissistic liar, who was caught lying about not using sock-puppets &amp; who spent the last month spreading fake news &amp; FUD vs Bitcoin &amp; using his online channels to defraud newbies, selling them Bcash while they where looking for Bitcoin. There're actually other, embarrassing minor characters in that pathetic circus, one more ethically questionable than the other, from the ""bamboozled"" disgraced former developer Gavin Andresen (who supported the CSW fraud), to academic-plagiarism-hero Emin Gun Sirer, etc. Only someone extremely stupid would think this kind of brigade could really replace Bitcoin as the new private, censorship-resistant, global, sustainable, digital gold standard. To think that Bitcoin could be replaced by an altcoin, for whatever reason, is generally stupid. Even if Bitcoin was really doomed by some convoluted conspiracy (16), any attempt to replace it would fail (6). But EVEN IF one really went down this road, literally ANY other altcoin (maybe ""big-fast-blocks"" LTC?) would have more chances than the embarrassing scam Bcash!

19: For all these reasons, I think you're either stupid or malicious. I hope you don't take this as a personal offence. I don't think stupidity is ""genetic"": I think it's mostly a choice, some kind of intellectual dishonesty/laziness. People can stop being stupid. You should.",2018-05-02 21:30:30

And with that said, yes, we went live on futures on the CME and CBOE. Sweet. And yes, now GS is going to be offering products derived on the price of Bitcoin. The fact is this, both are derivatives built on the “price” of Bitcoin and do little to directly drive the price of any crypto asset up or down (half true as in given current state open interest is more easily manipulated with the relatively low volume). 

For shit to hit the moon, what we need is both Institutional and Wealth businesses directly investing in the underlier. What’s an underlier?

dyfqvb8,k_plusone,66,"I've been obsessed with Bitcoin/crypto since the ""Cyprus bail-in 'bubble'"" in spring 2013. I'd heard about it before and vaguely knew what it was, but I thought it was complete bullshit and never dove into it before that. Seeing ~$150 prices and thinking about how anyone who had invested in 2009-2012 could have made generational wealth on a tiny, tiny initial investment gave me pause and led to me reading everything I could find about it. 

After doing my research, I was one of those annoying jackasses in fall 2013 talking about crypto to all of my friends and anyone who would listen about how it was the future. I guess I kind of believed it back then, but mostly I just wanted to encourage interest and be able to discuss it with other intelligent, open-minded people that I know. As anyone else involved in the scene at the time knows, this wasn't an idea that anyone other than software folks and/or anti-government folks was amenable to. 

Based on my own experiences and observations of a significant proportion of people currently involved in crypto, it is my belief that you have to be cognizant of 2-3 bubble cycles before you really sit down and think to yourself ""Bitcoin, wtf is that? how do I keep hearing about this and how does this keep happening? Maybe this is something I should look into"". 

EVERYONE heard about it last fall. When we convincingly pass $10,000 again everyone is going to hear about it again. A lot of people who wrote it off are finally going to do some level of research to see what it's all about and realize that they were wrong. Even if they don't fully grasp *why* they were wrong, they'll throw a couple hundred bucks at it hoping for another ""bubble"". 

For the last 5 years (! where is the time going?!), I've had a bitcoin price widget on my phone's homescreen and I've spent roughly an hour every day following developments in this space. I'm not at all claiming to be any kind of expert, but between being accustomed to the usual price movements and closely following general sentiment (both online and amongst people I know in real life), I'm thoroughly convinced that this about to fucking explode. 

I very well could just be drunk, but this just feels so blindingly obvious to me. Does anyone really think this experiment is fully played out? There's just no fucking way that $9,600 is the highest price we'll ever see. I've diversified into some other cryptos (mostly ETH), but my fundamental message is that I'm all in on this as of 5/3 and I'm more confident than ever that it's going to make me rich.  

Wish me luck. ",2018-05-04 22:27:51
dyebzvp,DCinvestor,61,"*Why don't I care much for EOS in the long term?*  There have been plenty of critiques around EOS that focus on technical tradeoffs and possible future collusion among block producers.  [This recent article is my favorite.](https://medium.com/@matteoleibowitz/eos-dont-believe-the-hype-c472b821e4bf)  I won't rehash those here, as my concerns around EOS are more foundational.

I've been around long enough to realize that in non-monopolistic spaces which rely upon on strong network effect for success, having *""good""* people at the helm is essential to long term viability.  Here, ""good"" refers to not just the technical aptitude of the team, but also to how they conduct themselves and the factors that drive their behavior.

Warning Sign #1 - The EOS ICO launched with outlandishly ""greedy"" terms that have raised billions of dollars for Block.One.  And in reality, a tiny fraction of that ICO money was actually needed to develop EOS.  In theory, some of that money will be reinvested into the ecosystem, but we shall see.  But there is no doubt that the founding entities of EOS will walk away with a lot of *cold hard cash*, in the form of ETH (sold for fiat)- not just EOS tokens.  Compare this to the Ethereum presale which raised $18M, nearly all of which went toward funding development costs, with developers partially incentivized to make ETH useful because they held ETH, and mostly because they were driven by ideology.

Warning Sign #2 - The behavior of members of the team itself.  They openly chose to brand their platform as an ""Ethereum Killer"" to score cheap points among the uninformed.  Does that sound like the behavior of a ""good"" team to you, focused on developing the best platform and community possible?  Did Ethereum call itself a ""Bitcoin Killer?""  Do the EOS team seem like strong leaders who care about changing the world to you?  How many members of the Ethereum Foundation dev team would you say are in this just for the money?  I'd say none- they seem more interested in changing the world for the better.  Yes, business is about hand-to-hand combat at times, but this isn't business, this is the establishment of a *public* blockchain that will be used by billions of people around the world.

Warning Sign #3 - Network effect cannot be bought, it must grow organically if it is to be sustainable and resilient in the face of real adversity.  The fact that EOS leaders write off the importance of this network effect is not surprising, given Warning Sign #2.  *People who don't understand the value of being seen as good, moral leaders with an ingrained sense of social responsibility do not understand how difficult or important it is to create a network effect.*  They literally plan to spend money to buy a network effect, unfortunately, the world does not work that way.  Then go to r/eos.  The discussions there feel shallow and exhibit poor participation.  Not to mention that there is no meaningful engagement by EOS with the commercial world, and it's probably not because they haven't tried to create it.  The real world isn't biting, and neither am I.  Compare this to the EEA which has hundreds of companies and other organizations in it now- only 14 months after it was launched.

Warning Sign #4 - Finally, to expect that EOS will operate worry-free from day one under adversarial conditions is absurd.  Ethereum has gone through a three year shakedown process and endured through the strength of its community.  EOS will launch day one with on-chain governance.  Will Block.One continue to support EOS after it launches?  Or will they throw up their hands, say its up to the community, and move to Puerto Rico to save money on taxes from their new windfall wealth?  For my thoughts on that, see Warning Sign #2 again.  Even if it does work, how long will it take EOS to develop a community as strong and as useful as Ethereum's?

Community is *everything* for a public blockchain platform.  Ethereum has *by far* the strongest developer and user community in the ecosystem.  And we are not taking centralizing shortcuts to achieve scaling.  It will likely take longer to bake than some of the competition, but Ethereum and all of us will be better for it in the long run.",2018-05-04 04:13:51

Correct me if I’m wrong, but from what Ive gathered second hand of this debate...BTC people are accusing BCH people of misleading unwitting investors to believe they’re directly associated with Bitcoin Core (if not actually investing in Bitcoin Core)? Where as BCH enthusiasts feel they have superior technology and are victims of a smear campaign by BTC enthusiasts?

Briefly looking at the BCH website and taking their name into consideration, it does seem pretty damn deceptive and probably shiesty with how similar they brand themselves to Bitcoin. At the very least, it feels like a  douchey move. And I don’t want to invest in a douchey team or brand. So for that reason I will probably never invest in BCH unless I’m proven they’re not douchey.

On the other hand, BTC devotees seem to act superior as hell. And they also tend to never admit any other crypto tech has comparable or better potential....which BCH very may well have. Their technology feels like the MySpace of the crypto world at this point. It’s old news. It’s boring. For that reason, I will probably never invest in BTC directly.

In any case, all else aside there is too much shit talking and misinformation flying back and forth (with a lot of money on the line) to make me feel comfortable getting near either.

To make a kind of parable out of what I’m trying to express I liken it to- if at the dawn of time, mankind journeyed through the biblical deserts and stumbled upon a large body of water.  

Like discovering some vast freshwater lake, but they hadn’t invented containers or any way to transport it yet. That will be way in the future. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Machines and mills and water wheels all lie further down the road. Nuclear power plants, yachts, and bottled water on grocery store shelves still further.

I’ve got some remarks about the opposing forces in the market right now.  

#*The Non-believers*    

I can see why some people are bearish:  
There’s so much hype and bullshit. 

Really, who the fuck needs a blockchain –I don’t? 

SQL databases have long ago conquered the demands for scaling and atomicity that the majority of ridiculous alt coin projects are claiming to be hard at work solving. 

Now we have the decentralization craze. Does something like Ripple even need to be decentralized?  I don’t think so. Just because Bitcoin is “a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency” doesn’t mean we need a decentralized music sharing platform. Or a clunky, hard-to-use decentralized exchange that nobody asked for or needed.  

So right now there’s a ton of hype and not much substance. I’m not focused on that, because it won’t affect anything in the long run. Just like how people buying ~~EOS~~ pets.com didn’t stop the Internet from evolving. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Now another common sentiment I hear often - *’there’s not enough blood in the streets’* or my favourite *’there’s still toooo much greed in the market’* sound like people traumatized from the recent stomach churning plunge. 

Thing is, it’s *a market* → Greed is a permanent fixture. 

There is nearly always *somebody’s* blood in the streets. Either it’s your own or the one who traded against you. 
They will be times for both.

#*Why are people so bullish? Is this a cargo cult?!*  


Here’s a fact: there’s an entire subset of the global economy that spends innumerable man hours stressing about where to allocate significant amounts of capital for both diversification and the seeking of returns. 
In 2014 crypto was only on the radar of the institutional investors who make it their business to always be on the bleeding edge of emerging markets or technological developments.  

&amp;nbsp; 

It’s gradually getting to be on everyone’s radar. The rise to 20k was a wake up call that put crypto on the front page of newspapers and for a hot minute - it was on the center of the world’s stage.   

&amp;nbsp; 

The institutions and hedge funds saw Bitcoin and Ethereum and several others make a meteoric climb to the stratosphere, come plummeting back to Earth, and at the end of the day still be up 1000% over last year. That’s next level returns right there. If you think the major financiers out there aren’t paying attention now, idk think again.

[Just to give you an illustration of how these people view this market](https://i.imgur.com/kmCQ6mG_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)  
I’ll relate an anecdote.  

So back in December a fairly big investor (equities) was asking me where to buy BTC for the first time. I referred them to GDAX. It didn’t work because Coinbase had gotten swamped and didn’t have their act together. Their verification system was offline for days smh. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Anyway the market crashed and I supposed they moved on, thankful not to be stuck holding any bags. So February 6 rolls around and the market tanked. The mood around here was doom and gloom, you all remember. Anyway, so I take a call from them the next day and we’re talking and they brought up Bitcoin again. I was surprised. They asked what the current price was and I told them. They replied rhetorically: **”So, now would be a good time to buy then wouldn’t it?”**  

They didn’t see the end of the world, don’t know or care wtf a Tether is, or whether or not China is going to ban Bitcoin a 6th time.  They saw it as an opportunity to buy something that *can* go to 20k (or higher) for half the price[^(**1**)](http://reddit.com)  

&amp;nbsp; 

*****  

#*But why is there no VOLUME?*  

From this cloistered perch upon built atop a little section of Reddit real estate, the market may seem somewhat small and even knowable, but it’s a misleading view.
In my view, the market’s larger han any one person can comprehend. 
But right now it’s not being driven by day traders spending countless hours on a weekend attempting to make sense of random market noise. 

&amp;nbsp; 

The fact that the price is rising while exchange volume remains unreflective of what we’ve seen in the past simply indicates that the makeup of the market is changing. I posted about how this would play out a few months ago.  
Despite the claims of “wash trading” and “manipulation” by noobs who think that having a million dollars makes the market easier to trade (it doesn’t, you simply have a new, much larger set of problems to overcome) —the paucity of current daily turnover indicates that the current momentum is being driven by larger players.  

&amp;nbsp; 

Trades taking place OTC are not explicit in exchange volume reports. If they’re present at all it’s simply because the OTC desk used the exchange to acquire/sell the coins. They’ll do this over time so as not to move the price too much. If the coins were acquired or dispatched in a different manner then there will be minimal overt effects. 
Also note that these people don’t trade 24/7. Some of them may make 1 trade a month/quarter.  
They’re positioning themselves. Pay attention. Volume is NOT the same as turnover. 
Turnover will come later when people are checking their Coinbase app every 3 minutes.  

&amp;nbsp; 

*****  

###*Footnotes*  

[^(**1**)](http://reddit.com) **Ah but OP’s Mom - that’s extrapolation is it not?** After all, past performance is not indicative of future yada yada - true. 
It is indeed the case that one cannot determine a future probability distribution simply based on the distribution function of past returns (or see [here](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/extrapolating.png) for the easy-to-grasp, Internet meme version of same). But therein lies the catch-22 of investing: that there is actually not much else to go on lol.  

&amp;nbsp; 

You see, it doesn’t matter if you harvest terabytes of market and sentiment data and run it through abstruse machine learning algorithms or employ the most advanced autoregressive models smart minds have brought to bear on the problem. Ultimately, no amount of computation short of *Laplace’s Demon*[^(**2**)](http://reddit.com) can pierce the veil that separates the known past from the unknowable future. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Thus it doesn’t matter if we’re talking about traders who are attempting to divinate directional price trends by utilizing Technical Analysis, investing in things based on their opinions on trajectories or fundamentals, or employing sophisticated mathematical models for doing statistical arbitrage, in a philosophical sense it all amounts to the same thing: placing bets on the future using *information*, knowledge, and experience to hopefully skew the odds in your favour.  

[^(**2**)](http://reddit.com) footnote to a footnote: Laplace’s Demon is the name of one of my ATS’s.  
Laplace obviously stole the name from me.  

&amp;nbsp; 

*****  

#*Where’s all of this going?*  

I think this will come to one of two ends: 
 
It’s possible people will look back on this  period of time and think

‘WTF were these people thinking.. Oh wait, this was the same society that [dressed like this](https://imgur.com/G7AVW0V) a mere 3 decades prior; and, more recently, thought that *Farmville 2* was a good way to spend their free time. Figures.’  
However what I think is more likely is that people will look back on the present time and see investing in these “crypto-not-quite-currency” things **as being the biggest no-brainer ever.**  

&amp;nbsp; 

Sometimes I think about all of those people in the Midwestern United States back in the 19th century, who had millions of gallons of oil beneath their feet in their backyards. Land that they sold for pittance. They made a suboptimal choice and their descendants are not billionaires today.  

&amp;nbsp; 

Just as a hypothetical: if you could peer into the future and discovered that one decade from now Bitcoin was by then one of the world’s staple foreign reserve currencies, would you be surprised? I actually wouldn’t. I mean, I’m not at all saying that it will happen, only that if it did it wouldn’t be the most mind-blowing turn of events ever. 
There’s a consistent path to that outcome that doesn’t depend on a wide deviation from how things are at present.  

&amp;nbsp; 

*****  

#*I’m tired of reading this now*  

Fair enough. Maintain a sense of the bigger picture, the bigger market. One day the digitalization of currency (and contracts) will appear so obvious that it will seem almost quaint. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Even my own, more near-term, somewhat saner version of the McAfee bet [might well prove to have been a lowball estimate](https://www.moonmath.win).  

&amp;nbsp; 

*****  

#*Epilogue*  

View the hype objectively (always) and try to shrewdly assess the magnitude of the paradigm shift we could be at the forefront of —futurology isn’t a science so we can only expect the unexpected. 
Even if right now we are all basically just standing around with dumb facial expressions on, starting at a big lake.. metaphorically speaking.

Not only him, but *many* other supported, including Mike Hearn, a hands down good dev who also did so much for bitcoin and was persecuted by greg maxwell. These core douches took over the repos and started blockstream. They patented a lot of shit out of it an outright denied to increase the block size to push layer 2 instead. Crony.

Segwit is a bad solution for Tx malleability and it is a big mess. Now I ask you, from the bottom of your heart, isn't BTC junk? Did you forget the disaster in december? All your alts or whatever you have took a crap in the face afterwards because of their incompetence (this was warned over 2 years prior the disaster).

Lightning Network is awful to use, full of bugs, it is not better than just sending BCH for 1 cent of fees. Seriously, it is just a big disaster, let's get real here, it is a joke!!

What happened is very simple: they took the project to modify it for their crony friends to profit on top of it because they were not successful BTC miners, investors or traders, period. This includes charlie ""dumpster"" lee who also is an investor in lightning labs (public information, just goggle) and was more than happy to shill LTC and that BTC was going to ""layer 2"". Dumped ALL coins after shilling it. Do you trust this guy? He is an investor in LN!!

We are putting down the scammers who took over the project. Now, roger ver is annoying as fuck sometimes, but he doesn't own the project and this is just another piece of propaganda to shit in the face of the original ""unblockstreamed"" bitcoin. Take a look at what that guy did to bootstrap bitcoin from 2011 until now, he is responsible for a lot of adoption, being him an asshole or not. But, ultimately, he doesn't own BCH project, far from it, he is just obsessed to see it working out.

dyh5428,110101002,58,"&gt;The point of the tweet is that bitcoin (core) added segwit which removes signatures from the blocks which makes it technically a fork of bitcoin.

It's a soft fork, which is an upgrade mechanism satoshi used a half dozen times, from his fix of the integer overflow attack, to his fix of the vulnerability which made it so anyone can redeem any transaction.

Soft forks have been used by the core developers to introduce P2SH (used in whats sometimes called a ""multisig address""), and the fix for the database bug in 0.7. It was also used to remove a critical vulnerability caused by open ssl not being consensus-compatible (libscpk).

Then segwit was added through a soft fork to increase the transaction throughput, decrease the size of the utxo database, and to make malleability optional.

Interestingly, a fork of Bitcoin Cash will also be Bitcoin, broadly speaking, even though it wouldn't share recent history with Bitcoin Core. I don't get why people don't get that Bitcoin is a tree. The whole thing that makes it awesome is the decentralization and being permission-less / un-owned.

dykrcnj,Thefriendlyfaceplant,103,"Monica's comments on the securities and utility tokens may have sounded like 'babble' but it was completely on-point and more informed that most people hanging out at r/cryptocurrency are.   
She was entirely right about how giving the coin some form of utility may avoid it from being classified as a security by the SEC.  
This is something most ICO's that launched in the last two years didn't do. They were just quick and easy fundraisers for companies that had no real use for the blockchain. The SEC is starting to come down on them and now they're scrambling to invent some contrived utility for their token in hindsight.   
There are three forms a cryptocurrency can take:  

* A commodity: These are the old fashioned coins, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin etc. These coins are launched ""fairly"" through mining or some random seed. Some are premined giving a share to the launchers which put them in a grey area.   

* A security: These are most of the ICO tokens. Companies sell their coins and also keep a part of the shares for further funding. The problem is that most use this launch to *avoid* regulation and all the investor protection they would have to comply to otherwise. Many people in crypto mistake tokens for company shares, which is far from the truth. Most tokens don't entitle you to anything. No accountability, no transparency, no protection against insider trading and any promises of revenue or dividend are completely at the discretion of the company.  

* A utility token: Still an ICO, but the token itself has some inherent use. Like being collateral for running smart contracts, or being a redeemable coupon for the company's services (sort of like Airmiles). Depending on how big and genuine this token can be, this may be the difference between having to comply with the SEC or not.   

~~Just to show how informed this show is: The SEC has a meeting with the largest ICO, Ethereum, today to address exactly what Monica was saying.~~  
EDIT: Turns out that as per today that SEC meeting was fake news.   ",2018-05-07 17:08:02

dyk31nj,nuc1e4r5n4k3,96,"Man, I feel you.

When I got involved with this community (about a week before mainnet launch) it was buzzing. Everyone was excited. I spend hours every day on the main discord talking about the tech, how the mainnet would compare to the testnet, helping people setting up their miners... We spend time confirming the ccminer solo mining block height bug with a bunch of people. Later I patched it and someone else put it on github (as I did not yet have an account at the time). We got to know a set of 'regulars' and it was great hanging out, helping each other out and dreaming about the future.

About 36 hours before the launch I decided I wanted to set up a pool similar to Eligius, which I remembered from mining Bitcoin in 2013/2014. About 1.5 hours before the launch I got it to work. 1 hour after the launch I finally got my node to sync and got a handful of people to join the pool.

We had the absolute worst of luck, every minute that went by I was fearing more and more that there was some catastrophic bug in my code and people were mining on my pool for nothing. Then, finally, we found block 3940 and the reward was instantly divided between the ~ 100 miners on the pool. It was an amazing feeling, fortunately recorded on the blockchain forever.

In the days afterwards we grew to about 6% of the network hashrate, peaking at about 8% I think. Someone asked me to set up a discord server. Until then we had been hanging out in #pool-support on the main Garlicoin discord. I did not really see the point, but said ""if you think so, why don't you set one up for me"".

Man, was I wrong. We got a bunch of amazing people on it. We added a webhook bot to shout out whenever the pool found a block, which generated a wave of memes and excitement every time it happened, especially since due to the instant payout everyone got a wallet notification within the next 15 seconds (slow Garlium is slow) as well.

Till this day my most fond memory is still the one of us missing block 12345 while getting both 12344 and 12346 (https://www.freshgarlicblocks.net/neverforget/).

But then the inevitable happened. I don't know if it was because of the ASICs, the price drop, the state of the main Garlicoin discord or just the lack of any long-term vision, but it seems the community bled dry. For a long time I though that at least to some extend it was isolated to my pool and caused by my own mismanagement, but it seems that this is not the case.

It looks like the main issue is that this community does not have a strong attachment to cryptocurrencies and their fundamentals and because of that doesn't really have a strong attachment to the coin itself. Now, don't get my wrong, both the subreddit and the main discord have always been very meme'y and that is great. In the end, that is part of the history of this coin. But it seems these days even that part of the community is slowly dying out. Like you said, the amount of active people on this subreddit is way lower than you would expect. And outside of that there is just not much happening. We both seem to have a shortage of vision as well as developers who want to do something with the coin.

When we started, we had a bunch of people just CPU mining on shitty machines, or GPU mining with similar hardware and similar results, but it was _fun_ to do so. It was exactly for people with these kind of mindsets that I made my pool 0% fee: to give back to the community I enjoyed being a part of. But these days it seems that most of the people interacting with the coin are purely mining an altcoin for profit. I am not saying that all the other people are gone, and there are definitely some bubbles where stuff is still happening (the rather, eh... 'interesting' GRLC Gang, Last Week GRLC Tonight, there are at least some people working on some kind of point of sale system) and you still see now and then the 'I mined my first whole coin' posts. But it is just a very minor subset.

At some point I was attempting to build some kind of second-layer token system on top of GRLC. Not as a way to actually tokenize things, but just for people to have fun with, ""Create your own meme-token on top of a meme-coin"". But halfway I realized that even if I would ever release it, probably no one would use it.

At about the same time (I guess 1 - 2 months ago?) I was also starting to wonder if I should just shut down the pool. The discord server where I once spend 10 - 12 hours a day on was just a graveyard. The community I was giving back to did not really feel like a community any more. What was the point? ...

In the mean time I have made a couple of decisions. I want to keep running the pool for as long as people want to mine on it (i.e. as long as it has a decent chunk of the network hashrate. And let's be honest, having the 2nd largest pool is quite an achievement, however undeserved and only because the 0% fee it might be) and occasionally people on it are still coming to me with technical questions which are fun to answer (well, when I have time at least). I also want to keep checking the subreddit for interesting posts, as well as the Support channels in the main discord. But apart from that I think I am mostly done with Garlicoin, besides the occasional stupid idea I might come up with (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/8dzh5y/the_garlicoin_fullnode_reference_client_source/).
I will probably keep mining it (as Allium is actually a rather energy efficient protocol) but sell most of it whenever the price looks nice and that's it.

Sorry for the ramble, but I guess you hit something me and some others I know have been feeling for a while. Maybe it was wrong of us to expect anything else. To be honest, the cryptocurrency scene at large has been focussing more and more on money and profits as the years have gone by and why would you expect anything else here.

Just know that someone, although I never used it, appreciates what you tried to do.

Have some gold.

&gt;Most importantly, the overload would eventually go away …. because the users would go away. The backlog would clear. Fees would fall to the minimum again.

&gt;So life would go on.

&gt;Bitcoin would survive.

&gt;But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else.

dyn3j5m,unwriter,55,"Hi, I've been working on a new type of block explorer, and would like to share it with you today.

While traditional block explores are focused on displaying account balance and transactions between accounts, I decided to build one exclusively designed for transactions that contain messages--the OP_RETURN transactions, which power the recently popular apps like Memo.cash and Blockpress.

The end result looks more like a realtime Facebook newsfeed (or Tweetdeck) than a traditional block explorer. You can use it for many different purposes:

1. Monitor the entire blockchain for OP_RETURNs in realtime
2. Track keywords like Tweetdeck (Example: https://chainfeed.org/filter/bitcoin)
3. View all your OP_RETURN transactions across multiple OP_RETURN protocols in a single place (Example: https://chainfeed.org/@1A85VU9gnXEuVwhFzvupmxc81hp8q5yfxx)

Some highlights:

1. Data-only: Unlike traditional blockchain explorers, Chainfeed is built from scratch to ONLY specialize in transactions that contain data (OP_RETURN transactions).
2. Profile: Try clicking on any account link, it will take you to a ""profile"" page, which contains a comprehensive log of all OP_RETURN transactions for that address. Even if you signed up to multiple apps (or protocols) using the same address, you should see the ""activities"" from ALL of those apps show up on the feed. Think of it like a Facebook activity feed, but for Bitcoin.
3. Avatars: The avatars are auto-generated from each user's address using a random avatar generator in order to ensure cross-application visual identification.
4. LIVE Filter: The search bar lets you filter the incoming live feed. The filtering currently takes place purely on the frontend in order to minimize centralization.
5. Shareable and Bookmarkable: Every filter query and every Bitcoin address has its own feed and the corresponding permalink that can be shared and bookmarked.
6. Apps: There are currently two tabs: ""all"" and ""featured apps"". ""All"" is the raw OP_RETURN feed. ""featured Apps"" is for applications that have their own overlay application protocols (such as memo.cash or blockpress so far). It's still early days so there aren't many apps that make use of the OP_RETURN data transaction feature yet, but we will probably see a lot of exciting apps soon..
7. Modular: The feed is basically a collection of ""cards"". The cards are constructed on-the-fly by parsing the incoming raw transactions on the frontend using custom modules, each written in a single JavaScript file.

There are some nifty things you can do if you play around with the site. Please try it out and let me know if you have any questions. Also I would appreciate some feedback, thank you!",2018-05-08 23:03:42

dyntlrd,YukonJordan,191,"I feel like everyone is arguing about cryptocurrencies by mistake, when the argument is more about consensus mechanisms \- which is a good argument to have. Crypto will go through multiple variations of consensus mechanism before perfected. There are more emerging mechanisms being tested daily \(PoW, PoS, dPoS, PoA, pBFT, proof of signature etc.\) So Far PoW has been the best way to secure a network, but proven unscalable.  

As a reminder centralized consensus systems are what we have now in the real world, and it obviously works or else the world would be in chaos so it's not inherently bad. Is it perfect, no, of course not, but that's why we are all excited about blockchain anyways? So just because Bitcoin tech brought a valid decentralized system to the world, doesn't mean everything needs to be decentralized. Do you want decentralized heart surgery – where everyone who holds a token has equal say on which piece of you to cut? Or would you rather an expert? Ever hear the expression 'too many cooks in the kitchen?' Full decentralization will bring problems \- especially to governance. Anyone every work in the government before and realized nothing gets done.. Decision making is hard when spread to far and usual results in a stand still and constant bickering and in the cryptoverse forks \- see BTC 2017

 So before everyone loses their minds that just because VeChain probably isn't as decentralized as ETH \(in its final PoS state\) isn't important. If VeChain is decentralized enough to provide tamper\-proof and cost effective results for businesses but is centralized enough to provide a lucrative governance model then that is great \- it serves a purpose. And we've seen huge partnerships come from it \(PwC &amp; DNV GL\) who are confident it will succeed. 

Basically the way I see it, VeChain may have given up a touch of decentralization \(still to be seen at this point\) for scalability and governance. ETH is still trying to have the holy grail of pure decentralization, scalability and governance \- which in theory may be possible, but hasn't been implemented. No need to shit all over things cause they are different.",2018-05-09 05:30:58
dyo4l2v,Cries_in_shower,150,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

&gt;the individuals or entities must voluntarily disclose their identity (and reputation by extension) to the VeChain Foundation in exchange for the rights to apply to be the ones produce blocks.

They also then say...

&gt;We summarize the main characteristics of the PoA protocol implemented as:

&gt;Low requirement of computational power;
No requirement of communications between block producers to reach consensus;

So its centralized, OK big deal for some not for others, whatever, but block producers don't even have to communicate to reach this (inaccurately named) 'consensus'? Information silos anyone? 

But that's not the main part, they then go onto talk about 51% attack protection, and there literally is none

&gt;In theory, the PoA protocol is vulnerable to the so-called “51% attack”. This term is originally used to describe an attack to a PoW based Blockchain systems such as BitCoin and Ethereum.[...] In PoA, the “51%” means more than half of the current available Authority Masternodes who collude.

&gt;This attack sets the requirement to not only on the number controlled in an attack but, more importantly, on the assumption that the rebelling Authority Masternodes collude. In reality, the PoA consensus significantly increases the difficulty of carrying out such a 51% attack.

They say ""here's what a 51% attack is. We're vulnerable to it but it probably won't happen because the small number of nodes we select won't collude"". That's absolute insanity, and its even worse because if 51% of the nodes DO collude, the other nodes have no reason to even be suspecting since nodes reach 'consensus' in their own little silo.",2018-05-09 02:00:33

You browse your favourite bitcoin discussion forum and suddenly all these threads are popping up mocking ""bagholders who bought at the top for $1"".

There have been plenty of times in the history of this market when things have looked very, very bleak. Even just last year there was a crash around the middle of last year which I'm sure many people thought was the end of Ethereum. [I stumbled across this video the other day from just July last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiXS_jjJYY8). This was right after Ethereum crashed from its all time high of ~$400 all the way down to sub-$150. It's literally making fun of holders. ""Mum, it's going to recover, right?"" etc. Of course, as we know it did recover and went all the way to $1400 in early January.

Everything always seems so bleak in the moment. This market is a wild ride.

dyqhbo7,Danced_Myself_Clean,73,"**Round 1:** 

This is gonna be all Gymbro.  Two years of getting jacked is going to give him quite the endurance.  All he has to do is do the Muhammad Ali [Rope-a-dope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope-a-dope) until Bladebro is too tired.  

I used to work at a school with a kendo club.  I would place their athleticism somewhere between the ping pong team and the softball team.  So if Bladebro is anything like the average kendo-kid, he is gonna be low on endurance.  Besides, if you take that glorified walking stick out of his hand, and he is gonna be up shit creek without his paddle.  

**Round 2:**

This one is harder, but I'm still going to give it to Gymbro.  I am going to assume that ""pick up"" does not mean to have sex with.  I know in a typical context it would, but if we are making this a competition, and it is only one night, sex with more than one woman would be a pretty high bar.  

So for the sake of argument, lets say ""pick up"" means phone numbers.  Hard to who can swoon better without knowing the personalities of the competitors, but since it's a cowboy bar, I see Gymbro taking his shirt off and hoping on the mechanical bull.  Giving all the ladies a peek at that six-pack he has been cultivating is probably going to result in some digits.  Bladebro is going to be too bogged down in one-on-one conversations to get more than one or two phone numbers.  

**Round 3:**

This is Bladebro's time to shine.  Given his involvement in the Bitcoin community, not only does have a lot of money to utilize, but he also has some connections to some unsavory types he met on the dark web.  I see him getting some of his buddies to help frame Gymbro for a crime.  

Now Gymbro has a good defense in this situation because of his lawyer, but it is going to be hard to fight because Bladebro's friends have a lot of experience in organized crime.  They will be able to plant evidence, bribe people, etc.  All the while Bladebro is going to mount a huge online campaign to smear Gymbro.  He will have everyone and their grandmother thinking Gymbro is guilty.  Legal battles can go on for years, and Gymbro simply doesn't have the resources or connections to fight Bladebro.  

**Round 4:**

Again Bladebro is going to be the main player here.  It is going to be hard convincing his Bitcoin contacts to turn away from their life of crime, but I imagine he can convince some.  So now we have a crack team of former drug dealers, and dark web aficionados, but none of them look like someone who would be into meth.  This is where Gymbro comes in.  Slap a stained wife-beater on that guy, and get him a severely dented 1996 Honda Accord.  Now we have our undercover agent.  

Send him in to buy some of the meth, while Bladebro and team run surveillance with help of the FBI.  I think we can catch our meth dealer by the end of the month.  ",2018-05-10 11:31:38

Bitcoin halvenings every 4 years only cut inflation by 50%. ETH inflation is going to be cut by 80%. In addition there's expected to be 10% of ETH supply locked up with staking. Inflation will be even lower than Bitcoin at this point (4% vs 2%).

[Nexon US website.](https://www.nexon.com/main/en) Online games.

[Nexon Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexon) Global online games and cell apps.  Started in SK by billionaire and scandal riddled Kim Jungju, now headquartered in Tokyo.  Jungju lives in SK.

Nexon was implicated in one of the scandals that led to the impeachment of S. Korea's president.  [accused of paying bribes to the administration and president.](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-history-of-a-scandal-how-south-koreas-president-was-impeached.)

[Gaming giant Nexon buys South Korean bitcoin exchange Korbit for $80m](https://www.techinasia.com/japanese-gaming-giant-nexon-buys-south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-korbit), September 2017.  VERY INTERESTING.

If I were to guess right here... I'd say that the money is going through Demeter, moved through another LLC managed by Ko (PK2?  there''s a few more), then on to SK.  I don't know if it would be washed first through Korbit, and then filtered through  billionaire and computer/cell game developer Kim Jungju's Nexon Corporation, or go through Nexon first to be further washed by Korbit and turned into ecurrency.  This is really damn easy when dealing with in-game and in-app purchases and bitcoin. (Bannon and Goldman Sachs foraged through this frontier, mining WoW gold with IGE in HK back in 2005) 

These guys are also into other raunchy biz; the model biz, Sirens Entertainment (found by volcanohiker) gives me a very bad ""crime syndicaty"" vibe.

But I am guessing that the Nexon connection is the bigger dealio. 

And, thanks to mid0nz, we know that sometime in Feb. of 2017, [developers removed the donald trump character, that acted as the mailman in Maple Story, one of Nexon's biggest games.](https://mmos.com/news/donald-trump-npc-kicked-maplestory)  Reason for the removal; they didn't want to be ""political"".  This is hilarious.  And even further cements my hypothesis. Demeter Direct registered Feb 2017, right when they got rid of don the mailman. '

*Thought about it overnight.  The donations probably moved through Nexon first (in-game or in-app purchases are a stupidly easy way to wash money).  Then they move to Korbit and turned into e-currency.

In 2014, [the FEC decided that bit coins are aok for political contributions:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/05/08/federal-election-commission-approves-bitcoin-donations-to-political-committees/?utm_term=.4939af116c38) 

&gt; The Federal Election Commission on Thursday gave a green light to donating bitcoins to political committees, one of the first rulings by a government agency on how to treat the virtual currency.

&gt; In a 6-to-0 vote, the panel said that a PAC can accept bitcoin donations, as well as purchase them, but it must sell its bitcoins and convert them into U.S. dollars before they are deposited into an official campaign account. The commission did not approve the use of bitcoin to acquire goods and services.

This seems poorly thought out, IMO, and makes it even easier to abuse foreign donation ban and donation limits.

Is this even possible?  Bribes paid to Cohen move through a US LLC or two, through a game developer to ""clean"", exchanged into e-currency, back to US to move through a few more LLCs where everyone gets their slice of the pie.  The remnants make it into Superpacs or Pacs and funds are used to either support the candidates, or pay the propagandists in order to control the candidates and the messaging and the government (in the long term).

[According to Huffington Post, ](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-bottari/kochs-brothers-freedom-pa_b_8606038.html) (Dec. 6, 2017):

&gt; The **Koch data operation**, “Demeter Analytic Services,” is one of five “C-Corporations” listed on the tax filing as wholly owned by Freedom Partners.  

.

&gt; Demeter Analytic Services” looks to be the funding conduit for the Koch data analytic operation that is giving the Republican Party a run for its money. It received $11 million from Freedom Partners in 2014, and is described in tax filings as one of five C-Corporations wholly owned by Freedom Partners.

.

&gt; Although Demeter doesn’t have a web presence, it appears to operate from the same address and same suite as the entities associated with the Koch data operation (the nonprofit Themis Trust and its for-profit arm i360), according to the address on FEC filings describing payments to Demeter.

Remember i360 was Cambridge Analytica/SCL operation in Canada.  They are currently under intense scrutiny for breaking campaign finance laws with Brexit.

&gt; One way the operation collects voter data is by buying it directly from states. Demeter is the sole funder of a Super PAC called “VFA PAC” that hasn’t made any independent expenditures—but which did purchase voter lists from the Secretaries of State in places like Virginia, Illinois, and North Dakota.

.

&gt; Carson’s campaign has paid Demeter Analytic Services around $11,000 per month to access its voter database, according to recent filings. Carson’s presidential exploratory committee also paid $21,196 to Demeter for list rental.

[Here's the FEC filing for Carson&gt;Demeter Analytics.](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;cycle=2016&amp;data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00573519&amp;recipient_name=DEMETER+ANALYTICS+SERVICES+INC&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=12%2F31%2F2016&amp;line_number=F3P-23).  All listed as ""rent"".

Read the article.  Interesting and depressing as hell.  Kochs are all wound up with Mercers who are all wound up with global mobligarchs' crime syndicates.  

[Here's the corporate ""web"" for Demeter Analytics.](https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2ztqsy/demeter-analytics-services-llc).  At this point in time, I am really overwhelmed and disheartened.  I guess we have SIC, SCO and Avenatti looking out for us.  And the rest of the world is hoping that we come back from this coup, I assume.

dyto8m9,RandomJoe7,71,"Personally, I don't consider ""diversifying"" inside of crypto to be much of a diversification at all (at least not yet until things are decoupled from BTC). So you might as well put ""all of your crypto eggs into one basket"", as long as you are confident that the one you picked is a good choice. Real diversification would be real estate, stocks/funds, precious metals, etc...

Some act as if Bitcoin is king and can't fail you, and I personally don't believe that. While Bitcoin gave us the start to all of this, I do think it's a dinosaur and will continue to lose market share (which it has been doing for a long time now). So why put money on a coin that most people believe will continue to lose market share compared to others? That being said, I do think bitcoin will appreciate, just not in the same ratio as others.

I personally have decided to put a good 95% into IOTA (before that I used to have a good portion of Ethereum). Why? Because I think that out of the 1000's of coins a big percentage (90%+) will completely disappear. This could take 1 or 3 or 5 years, but I'm confident it will happen at some point. So I am not comfortable putting a big amount into unproven/small coins, just with the potential of making short term gains. Because that to me is pure gambling, and also the problem with taxes (every trade is a taxable event in my country), so I prefer to hold at least a year before doing trades.

And out of the bigger ones (Top 10 or 20), I just believe IOTA has the biggest upside/potential while still being a safe bet (safe in the context of crypto). I believe it will be here to stay even after 90% of all coins disappear, because it has the technology to be able to do what most (if not all) other coins can do, and that in a feeless/scalable matter. There's no reason to keep these 1-trick-pony coins when a bigger/more proven platform can do the same and do it better.

IOTA's vision is great and they have set up an amazing team and amazing partnerships to put themselves into the right spot. While Ethereum might be a bit of a safer bet, IOTA has a way bigger upside (it can still go x12 to reach current ETH Market cap), and ETH is also limited by its scalability and fees (just look what CryptoKitties did to it). And I see a very ""limited"" use case/future for a technology with such a bottleneck. Any crypto that wants to achieve REAL WIDESPREAD adoption (we are talking billions of devices/people using it, not just a few hundred thousand or millions) will need to be much more scalable than current blockchains, which is why I like the concept of the Tangle.

Short term trading = gamble. If you wanna do it, sure - but it's not for me. However, to think that crypto in general (overall market cap) will go up in the next years, that to me is a relatively sure thing. And within this market cap, I think IOTA will keep gaining market share, while Bitcoin will keep losing it.",2018-05-12 03:26:00

Bitcoin is the most egalitarian way to introduce a new form of money and will also turn a tiny percentage of the population who got in first into a new wealthy elite.

You can't both say that bitcoin is going to make the first people who got involved into a new wealthy elite and also say its egalitarian and intended to make sure as many average people as possible could get involved. If that were true there would be no elite, the average person would be ""elite"".

How exactly were the billions of people who have no internet access and no disposable income meant to get access to Bitcoin in the first 10 years when for the first 5 of those 10 years almost no one outside of ""programmers and nerds"" were even aware of it? How was someone born 10 years after Bitcoin launched meant to have an equal opportunity as someone who was 20 years old?

The majority of bitcoins were distributed before the average person even knew about it. The average person has 0 bitcoins. How exactly is then shutting off the supply of bitcoins before the average person has any supposed to make it more egalitarian for the average person?

&gt; In a 6-to-0 vote, the panel said that a PAC can accept bitcoin donations, as well as purchase them, but it must sell its bitcoins and convert them into U.S. dollars before they are deposited into an official campaign account. The commission did not approve the use of bitcoin to acquire goods and services.

This seems poorly thought out, IMO, and makes it even easier to abuse foreign donation ban and donation limits.

Is this even possible?  Bribes paid to Cohen move through a US LLC or two, through a game developer to ""clean"", exchanged into e-currency, back to US to move through a few more LLCs where everyone gets their slice of the pie.  The remnants make it into Superpacs or Pacs and funds are used to either support the candidates, or pay the propagandists in order to control the candidates and the messaging and the government (in the long term).

[According to Huffington Post, ](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-bottari/kochs-brothers-freedom-pa_b_8606038.html) (Dec. 6, 2017):

&gt; The **Koch data operation**, “Demeter Analytic Services,” is one of five “C-Corporations” listed on the tax filing as wholly owned by Freedom Partners.  

.

&gt; Demeter Analytic Services” looks to be the funding conduit for the Koch data analytic operation that is giving the Republican Party a run for its money. It received $11 million from Freedom Partners in 2014, and is described in tax filings as one of five C-Corporations wholly owned by Freedom Partners.

.

&gt; Although Demeter doesn’t have a web presence, it appears to operate from the same address and same suite as the entities associated with the Koch data operation (the nonprofit Themis Trust and its for-profit arm i360), according to the address on FEC filings describing payments to Demeter.

Remember i360 ~~was Cambridge Analytica/SCL operation in Canada~~ that was AIQ. i360 is part of the Koch data mining enterprise. 

&gt; One way the operation collects voter data is by buying it directly from states. Demeter is the sole funder of a Super PAC called “VFA PAC” that hasn’t made any independent expenditures—but which did purchase voter lists from the Secretaries of State in places like Virginia, Illinois, and North Dakota.

.

&gt; Carson’s campaign has paid Demeter Analytic Services around $11,000 per month to access its voter database, according to recent filings. Carson’s presidential exploratory committee also paid $21,196 to Demeter for list rental.

[Here's the FEC filing for Carson&gt;Demeter Analytics.](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;cycle=2016&amp;data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00573519&amp;recipient_name=DEMETER+ANALYTICS+SERVICES+INC&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=12%2F31%2F2016&amp;line_number=F3P-23).  All listed as ""rent"".  It's in the $100Ts, maybe north of that.  I didn't bother to add it up.  And, it's NOT RENT dammit.

Read the article.  Interesting and depressing as hell.  Kochs are all wound up with Mercers who are all wound up with global mobligarchs' crime syndicates, and little Korean money laundering offices in CA.

[Here's the corporate ""web"" for Demeter Analytics.](https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2ztqsy/demeter-analytics-services-llc).  At this point in time, I am really overwhelmed and disheartened.  I guess we have SIC, SCO and Avenatti looking out for us.  And the rest of the world is hoping that we come back from this coup, I assume.


And, I'm really fucking curious why Steven Bannon consulting, Glittering Steel, Breitbart, Cambridge Analytica, and Keith Davidson (THE ATTORNEY for Stormy and Karen McDougal and Eliott Broidy's supposed abortion affair, that all negotiated with Cohen) are all housed at the same building at 8383 Wilshire Blvd (which coincidentally is a 10 minute drive from the korean launderer/crime syndicate member/Koch goon).  FFS.  You all need to be indicted for conspiracy and treason, and then be hung in the public square.

The technology is extremely advanced, and without a solid grasp of blockchain technology most of the implications will go over a typical nocoiner's head.

As a consequence people who dislike cryptos truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the importance of ""HODL,"" which itself is a fantastic investment strategy for a speculative asset that can only go up.

I wasn't comfortable with it because if I told him my address, he'd be able to see how much I have. So I decided to make a new wallet just for receiving his payment. Then I realized he'll still be able to see my original wallet because I'm going to end up transferring that money to my original address anyway, and all transactions are public.

What I ended up doing was using an exchange to receive his bitcoin, then converting that to monero to hide my money (unnecessary hurdle).

dz0iqxs,kekjuice,549,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

Decentralized essentially means there isn't one source or central hub to control, monitor, and/or maintain something.

Right now, the internet is controlled heavily by internet service providers like Cox Cable, Comcast, etc.

Richards idea is to allow people to provide a host of connections through their own cell phones or individual connects to essentially create one big network out of a web of small connections.

Imagine a spiderweb. Each strand would be a host that is linking to another to create one strong web. Right now the spiderweb we know and use is completely controlled by big entities like the ISP providers mentioned above.

If a decentralized system existed, in order to manipulate it, you'd have to manipulate millions of people involved.

* Here is a rough Google translate of the questions that Dutch high school students (17-18 years old, pre-university) had to make during their national mathematics (with a focus on statistics) finals. 


**Bitcoins**
The bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. He
exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay in
online stores or for other online services.
Bitcoins are not, as normal money, by a central bank
circulation. Instead, all bitcoins that are in circulation are
created by letting computers work on solutions from
selected mathematical problems. That works like this:
Anyone can run special software on his or her computer
contributes to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner
of the computer that finds the solution to a problem
25 (newly created) bitcoins as a reward. Because in 2014 every
10 minutes such a problem was solved, were there in this way
every 25 minutes 25 bitcoins are put into circulation.
On 1 January 2014 there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoins in circulation.

*Calculate the number of bitcoins in circulation starting from this year
above 18 million as the rate at which bitcoins are in circulation
not be changed.*

In reality, the speed with which bitcoins get in circulation
not equal to 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. This speed is taking
namely. During the first four years, from 1 January 2009 to
January 1, 2013, the reward per solution was 50 bitcoins. The
reward for finding a solution is every four years
halved: from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017, the remuneration is per
solution 25 bitcoins, for the next four years 12.5 bitcoins per solution
and so on.
*From which year calculate the reward for each solution less than one bitcoin*
will be.
The total number of bitcoins that can be put into circulation is limited.
This is a consequence of (among other things) the fact that the remuneration per
solution is always halved. The total number of bitcoins that are in
circulation, can be approximated with the formula:
C=21 - 21 * 0.5 ^0.25 - t
Here C is the total number of bitcoins in millions and t the time in years with
t  0 on 1 January 2009.
*Use the reasoning of the formula to determine the
limit value of the total number of bitcoins in circulation.*

To regulate the total number of bitcoins in circulation is not
only the number of bitcoins per solution is made smaller, but also
the difficulty of mathematical problems is increasing
made. There are more and more people who bring their computers
let it count.
The difficulty of the problems increases exponentially according to the
formula D=3.65 * e ^0.533 - t
Here D is a measure of the degree of difficulty and the time in months
with t = 0 on 1 January 2013. The larger is D, how
harder to solve the problem.
*Compose the formula of the derivative of D and explain how to handle this formula can see that the graph of D is increasing.*
The formula can be rewritten in such a way that you can use a difficulty level
fill in and calculate the time in months needed to do so
level of difficulty.

dyyr0yp,Mercurial_Illusion,110,"A CPU (your main computer, central processing unit) generally has a few cores (mine has 4, some have 2, 6, 8, I think up to 12 now? maybe more) that can do a lot of different things. The problem is you can only do as many things at once as you have cores (this is a broad generalization).

A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, a video card) has a LOT of cores that do relatively simple tasks compared to the CPU. The reason they can have so many cores (over 2000) is that the operations they can do are more limited and each core is generally going to be doing the same operation on different data. This is how displaying graphics on a monitor basically works.

Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are mined using operations that graphics cards work REALLY well with. The more blocks of data you can chug through in a second, the more money you make. 

If you have one card with 3000 cores you're making some amount of money per second. Buy another card and you double how much you can process. Buy 12 video cards...you can see where this is going. 

I'd argue your standard gamers want 1 or 2 video cards generally and those used to be a certain price. With Bitcoin taking off it's damn near impossible to find new video cards for a reasonable price because people buy a crap ton of them to mine and then sell off their used ones (that have been running hard for quite some time) for a rather high price (what used to be the new price) because they're still quite valuable for mining.",2018-05-15 01:03:23

dz0dbe9,DCinvestor,78,"Interesting responses from [Jimmy Song regarding his debate with Joe Lubin and Amber Baldet yesterday.](https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996250135041576960)  It feels like he is quietly backing out of his on-stage bet with Lubin.

I can't help but think that Song completely missed the point, with his remarks on stage and now in these Tweets.  He doesn't see the point in using blockchain for many things- fine, put me in that camp as well.  He thinks that centralized servers *could* do more of them better (read faster / more efficiently)...yes, that is true for many apps, if not all of them.  But there is a *problem of trust* in actually agreeing upon and creating such systems among parties who don't trust one another, even when it would make economic sense to do so.  Even if you are not totally adversarial with one another in a given system, people, companies, and organizations often don't want to cooperate with one another under such centralized conditions because *someone* has to control said system, and they can't agree upon who that someone should be.

I think Vlad Zamfir's recent analogy of Ethereum as being like ""digital international waters"" was apt for explaining how one could consider Ethereum.  *No one controls it, anyone can sail it, and we all rely up on it for commerce.*  So while Song is quibbling over metrics to determine if blockchain is actually being used, the Ethereum community will spend the next 2 years and beyond *building* that future and shared resource, knowing that it will be used for a great many purposes.  And even if those solutions aren't perfect, they could very well be far cheaper and more inclusive than current alternatives.  I don't just care about ""numbers of users""- I care about economic and societal impact.

So sorry, Jimmy, ""Bitcoin 1.0"" isn't the future, and it is certainly isn't the end of the road for the real world applicability of blockchain.  For sure, some use cases will be tried, and they will be dismissed for adding no new value beyond existing solutions.

dyyqxqi,rowdy_beaver,70,"I wish you the best of luck in trying to stay neutral.  It would be a challenge.

Like many here, we want a bitcoin that can work for everyone, everywhere.  I used to participate in meetups and tried to get merchants to adopt Bitcoin.  Back in 2014, when someone asked what would happen when blocks got full, the stock answer was 'increase the block size'.

Some groups made very loud noises that this would not work if everyone did not upgrade.  They proposed other options that could fool old nodes into thinking following along.

This started years of debates.  I simply wanted to be on a chain that could grow and expand.  We weren't near any technical limits, so there would be no harm.

Then Lightning Network was proposed as a way to handle micropayments (transactions where even a 1-cent fee was too large).  Channels would be funded with maybe $10 and all would be good.

Then LN got morphed into being the only way normal people would be able to transaction on the BTC chain.  This was not the goal of LN, and creates many other problems.  The foremost problem was that LN did not exist yet, and that even if it did, more on-chain transaction capacity would be needed.

But they stood firm on holding to the small blocks.

I stopped going to meetups.  I definitely stopped promoting to merchants.  Until the scaling debate was resolved, it was not wise to suggest bitcoin to others.

I am very happy that Bitcoin Cash continued the scaling approach that was described by Satoshi.  Scientific testing has shown that this can work without ill effects.  Now, real world activity has proven it.

The two sides can go their own ways.  Maybe both will win.

I think, if LN eventually works and scales, BCH can adopt it.  It will be an alternative for small transactions, not a mandate.

dyzcn4y,Sesquipedalian_EUW,57,"Ok let me help you out here as you are apparently not really into crypto to understand different types of blockchain technologies and how to value their part of centralization and decentralization
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
decentralizing means that there is no 'one party' that controls the network, so in case of a giant fire, you cant reach your network. in case of bitcoin this is thanks to the POW structure of mining, some alts for POS and XRP is using consensus ledger.

&amp;nbsp;

the safety of the network depends on the amount of people that are helping you to 'carry' the load and process it. for POW you have mining, POS is staking, and consensus runs on validators/nodes. There is an incentive to POW and POS and the incentive of validators is voting right in a network. POW comes with costs - your electricity. POS comes with costs - you have to hold a large number of the altcoin and consensus has no costs but no direct incentives, but you will be able to get a say in the network. When it comes to POW the hashpower is your drive. YOu have to keep upgrading it to be able to 'beat' the costs you have to pay your electricity bills with - in a way, you are exchanging crypto mined and give it to electricity companies who are not investing this into crypto. 

&amp;nbsp;

POW starts very decentralized, but as its driven by extrinsic incentives - its purely driven by greed. If you can mine a coin whtere you receive more $, you stop mining what you were mining to mine that coin instead. POW means you have to invest alot of money to upgrade your rig, alot of your profits end up at electricity companies and as this is purely driven by hashrates - that you can purchase - the network is 'for sale' as you can possibly buy enough hashing power, or 'bribing' them by offering a better return at another coin, and a doublespend/51% attack is possible.  the extrinsic model where a higher hasrate brings higher rewards means this could theoraticaly lead to a more centralized future. Already we see 3 mining companies on bitcoin that control the entire network. 

&amp;nbsp;

when it comes to POS its important that the amount of coins are divided amongst the people who are staking. If one party owns 'alot' this means the network is more centralized. Also this person will get more as it owns more, thus it drives people to get more for a better reward. Again the reason for people to buy is an extrinsic incentive. Decentralization means that it would be best if not just a few parties own a large part of the staking. the extrinsic model where a larger amount of coins brings higher rewards also means this could theoraticaly lead to a more centralized future.

&amp;nbsp;

now consensus, its harder to decentralize as you start off more centralized, but as there is no extrinsic intensive but purely intrinsic driven rewards, there is no bribing (your goal is to run a good-validator, else the network will ignore you) and with new nodes popping up every day - nodes that have the same power and no need to 'increase the amount of nodes' to control the network as it will eliminate the bad actors and because there is no greed or chance of doublespend in case of XRP, this meas that the network is on a liniar upward movement in case of decentralization. With thousands of nodes running - new ones added every day - where each node has the same power instead of btc (3) and eth (5) this makes the network itself more decentralized than you would think. So XRP in this case becomes more and more decentralized with no chance of becoming centralized in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are referring to 'decentralization' in regards to 'amounts on top 100 accounts' - please know that in case of xrp, 38% is owned by the top 100 accounts and this is including several very big exchanges that are being counted as 1 address as they use destination tags to split it amongst the users. So that 'centralized' arguement is extremely outdated and gives a very wrong perception of what is actually happening. Please stay up to date!",2018-05-15 06:27:50

Bitcoin has little meaningful (read working) innovation to cite, so desperate BTC maximalists lash out at almost anything that is looking to expand how blockchain can actually be useful to the world, beyond digital gold.  *Newsflash:* ""Bitcoin 1.0"" will not be the future of the blockchain revolution.

I am a BCH maximalist, and IMO you did come off as being biased in favor of BTC, but I can forgive that as I don't believe anyone who is involved in this space can truly be 100% impartial.  I do think it's great that you are at least interviewing both sides of the debate and trying to remain neutral.

One critique I will give is that in the beginning of both interviews I listened to (Roger Ver and CSW), you spent a lot of time explaining why you were interviewing them, and it almost felt like you were apologizing to your audience for conducting the interviews.  If you want to be as impartial as possible, then eliminate the pretext and just let the interviews speak for themselves.

And while you may not have a technical background, I would encourage you to do some more research into the technical aspects of Bitcoin.  It's true that Bitcoin is a very complicated protocol, but you don't need a programming background to understand it -- a high-level knowledge of cryptography, computer networks, and economics can get you most of the way there.  Understanding the technical details better will also help you as a miner.

dz2945h,Tip-Toe-Crypto,71,"|\*| Some late night shower thoughts if you will as to the current state of crypto.....

* The rise of Bitmex is one of the reasons why BTC has become this volatile.  BTC has never been this volatile ever.  It is being shorted and longed on every single piece of new information no matter what.  The degenerate gamblers of Bitmex have turned BTC into an altcoin.   What I mean is that with the leverage these gamblers are addicted to and combined with the FUD and twitter TA traps, whales on Bitmex and other exchanges have turned BTC into a high capped volatile altcoin.  You may be thinking, ""well how can btc be treated like an altcoin by these ppl when even on its worse day it only moves 15&amp;#37; in either direction....."".  Answer: Bitmex leverage.  Those 5\-10&amp;#37; swings at 100x are massive.  And this is happening over and over and over and over.  And will continue to happen unless the flood gates of BTC are opened or permanently closed.    Bitmex may have been around 1 year ago \(not sure\) but it's never had this big of a market impact.  Will not shock me if another 2 Bitmex clones come out later this year with better liquidation rates.  

* The sophistication and the further development of trading bots have ruined altcoins as a result of the above Bitmex BTC manipulating idiots.    The bots we have today are different than 1 year ago and will only get better, cheaper and more idiot friendly in the future.   These bots are reacting not only to BTC price movements from the Bitmex idiots but they are also using twitter scraping keywords such as ""partnership, listing, airdrop, etc..."" and are pumping coins milliseconds after any announcements, and inflating the prices of any of the alts with news.   The news scrapers, I don't mind much but the BTC swing bots are destroying alts.   Think about it.  Right now the only alts that are doing the type of gains we saw in 2017 are on new exchanges \(hadax, etc\) and/or ETH based exchanges \(Idex, etc\).  Both of those types of exchanges don't have anywhere near the level of moronic bots that Binance has.  In fact with Binance's low fees, it easily has the most bots of any exchange I can think of \(not sure about the strictly Asian ones\), since these cheap ass bot owners want to spend as little on fees on the hundreds of transactions their bots take part in every day.  Simply put if your altcoin is strictly on Binance you are royally fucked.  This was evident for anyone that held WTC/VEN/ICX when Binance was the lone exchange at hand \(although whale suppression was also a reason for some of those coins as well.....\).

Moving forward, not sure what to do, started in May 2017, still way, way up, already cashed out my initial 10 fold and still have a good chunk in alts.  But Im thinking about just staying in BTC now and playing days like today, catching the bottom of the alts I like and either flipping on the upcoming recovery days or hodling and DCA'ing only on days like today \(these types of days will prolly be common moving forward\).

I'm thinking maybe if Bitcoin ETFs get announced that will be a big enough catalyst to stop the Bitmex mafia from capitalising on BTC volatility and will clean the bears right out........truth be told no clue about what is true or not......these are just musings late night after a long hard shower......",2018-05-16 16:35:23

dz4g19a,turboNOMAD,352,"Bitcoin power usage will decline with every halving of block reward, algorithmically spaced out approx. every 4 years. Next halving is estimated to occur in Spring 2020. When mining profits are slashed in half, many miners are priced out by electricity costs, so they shut down.

Over time, new emission will get close to zero and the only remaining profit for the miners will be collecting of transaction fees, which currently form a negligible fraction. This will lead to the huge decrease in mining, and therefore its power usage. As a side effect, the no-longer-profitable mining equipment (which are task-specific chips and cannot be repurposed) will simply become electronic garbage.

One factor that could possibly mitigate this decrease is a huge increase of BTC prices. But this would signify an increase in demand (=usefulness of Bitcoin as a currency), no longer qualifying as energy wasting. Also, in 2015-2017 there already was a rally from $200 to $9000 today, spiking at $20000, which was largely bubble-like. I don't think another such bull run is possible in the coming years.

dz4lz5z,talks_about_stuff,118,"The purpose of crypto currencies in general at the current stage is mainly a vehicle for people to get rich quickly, because right now it’s drawn in mostly speculative investors who know or care little about underlying technologies. Bitcoin is no different. The proof of work consensus algorithm was experimental and has not kept up with time despite hundreds of talented programmers and developers contributing to its technology over the years. It DID however bring about the Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) that major tech firms are heavily investing into - eg. The Hyperledger Collaboration project, IBM Blockchain, Ethereum Alliance, etc. 

Because the technology itself has many many real world applications that at the end of the day, improve the human condition. Whether it’s bridging gaps between global remittances and cutting down time and costs by removing middlemen; or saving supply chain logistics companies Tens of BILLIONS in QA, data monitoring, tracking, with smart contracts on the blockchain; Or enabling fast, traceable micro transactions across all digital platforms so service providers/users get paid/billed on a per use basis with virtually no fees. The DLT can accomplish all of this while maintaining transparency(if the consensus chooses, if not there’s also private blockchains as an option), with immutable ledgers for record keeping among other things. 

The DLT, or blockchain technology is not going to “kill the banks”, or “destabilize world governments”, it’s an emerging technology like any of its predecessors that will revolutionize many industries. It will reduce friction and increase efficiency and connect the world like the internet has, in a whole new way. while creating new market sectors with applications of the technology. It’s the second layer of the World Wide Web that will connect us even more so than before - Web 2.0 if you will.

Every technology can be utilized by criminals and evildoers to create chaos in the world - eg. Facebook being used for propaganda or connecting terrorists, internet being used to traffic child pornography, drugs, murder solicitations etc, Planes being used for terrorist attacks. But the argument is that the technologies bring about many more good things than the bad, and that should be enough for us to want to invest in it(the future). Like one of my favorite comedians - David Chappell once said “He rapes, but he also saves. And he saves more than he rapes.” ",2018-05-17 22:01:32

dz4n303,PM_WHAT_U_GOT,103,"Not that I necessarily agree that it needs to be banned, but banning it would be relatively simple. The weak point of crypto currencies is at the crypto-fiat money exchange. Implement strict regulations forbidding exchanging crypto-fiat money and transactions in crypto, and you have a de facto ban, resulting in a likely drop in value. Hell, Bitcoin has taken several precipitous dives when China has threatened/imposed regulations.

Of course every country would need their own regulations: the US for example couldn’t easily dictate what Japan or the EU does with crypto exchanges/transactions. But if the US or EU (or even China) fully banned crypto transactions, it would probably shake confidence in the markets, resulting in nearly worthless crypto currencies (and thus reducing miners’ incentive to use extraordinary amounts of energy to generate coins).

It is probably worth discussing whether the extensive energy consumption to generate crypto currencies is something valuable to us as a society.

Edit: Since the crypto fans seem easily angered below, I’m not advocating that a ban is the best way to tackle the clear problem of energy intensive coin mining. I was merely giving an example of how such a ban would be technically feasible. I think nearly 8 GW (32 TWh) of consumption, which is growing unsustainably, needs to be addressed. We could literally nearly run the entire country of Denmark off that consumption. Hopefully, there’s a technological solution available rather than a political/economical one.",2018-05-17 22:23:11

Today, according to marketcap.com $6.1B dollars worth of bitcoin changed hands. We all know the vast majority of these are flipped back and forth on exchanges (mostly by trading bots), but assuming each trade was for a bitcoin that was not traded further in the 24 hour period, only 753,000 bitcoin are in the 'liquidity pool' (as if bitcoin in themselves are NOT liquid, duh). 

That is only 5.3% of the 14M bitcoin already mined.

The vast majority are HODLed, as in, will NEVER be traded back to fiat at any price. This HODL wall scares the shit out of the legacy financial system incumbents. They are desperate to change their fiat wealth into bitcoin. THEY have an unlimited amount of fake fiat to 'buy' bitcoin in exchange for that fake fiat created by THEM out of thin air.

The intention is to use this artificial 'price discovery' in bankster owned 'exchanges' in conjunction with lame stream media narrative manipulation to try to get us REAL HODLers to part with our Bitcoin.

It won't work.

My recommendation to you is to forget about 'the price', zoom out, learn what HODLing actually is compared to holding, learn what the bitcoin  revolution is actually about, and make sure you pass the message on.

dz5y5hd,jls8705,72,"Holy shit, everybody. ** You need to watch this video.** 

I’ve only watched 30 minutes of it, but here’s the insight/info I’ve gained if you don’t want to watch it. I’ll also throw in my interpretation of what she’s saying:

**Ripple and XRP are The Chosen Ones.**

Why?

Because they have all the signs of being, to quote Susan, **“The biggest thing since The Internet”.**

- They received seed funding from mainstream FIs *over a decade ago* to build out their tech. 

- Companies don’t invest in their financial systems unless they are prepared to commit to it long term. It is a **huge deal** for a company to bother with investing into their financial IT. They don’t invest like this unless they’re absolutely certain they have a good, working, long term product at their disposal. This is why SWIFT has managed to stick around as long as it has, even though it is obviously such a shitty service. 

**Caveat**

- Regulation (which could mean many different things) is imperative if any truly game-changing price increases are to be realized. 

- XRP and every other non-bitcoin cryptocurrency will be regulated like (or as if they were) securities. It’s just a matter of time.

- ** This is actually good for us.**

- Securities always reflect the value of the underlying asset or company behind the Security.

-  This means that XRP’s Price will be a reflection of Ripple and any of the other companies utilizing XRP like Coil. ^and ^^there ^^^will ^^^^be ^^^^alot ^^^^more!

- This is great for us because Ripple, as a company, is very profitable and promising. 

- Ripple has **$25 billion at its disposal and no debt.** They also have paying customers already using two of their products.

- Institutional, traditional investors will flock towards XRP as a future investment. 

- Again, none of the institutional money can come in because crypto‘s aren’t yet regulated.

- Post-regulation, we will see an influx of money coming into exchanges that will increase volume and price to levels we’ve never seen before.

- The people we have always referred to as “whales” will be like minnows compared to the arbitrators of the greater financial markets of the world. 

Here’s the bottom line: ** you have made a smart decision if you’re a hodler of XRP.** 

We have a true professional here who, for some reason, is making extremely informative videos available to laymen like us, for free. 

And she’s literally saying that Ripple is the biggest thing since the internet and we all get to piggyback and make some crazy money from their efforts. 

** Edit:** Holy shit. 

**Edit:** Folks, she’s *not necessarily saying that  the SEC will legally declare XRP a security.* That’s not her point at all. Her point is that, post-regulation (whatever form that will take), institutional investors **will invest in XRP as if it were a security, like a bond or stock, because Ripple is crazy valuable right now.** That’s simply what they do when they spot a good investment opportunity.

dz7gopb,PrettyFlyForITguy,175,"I posted a thread that didn't get much traction yesterday... There are two things that could happen when tether is created:

When someone sells crypto for (newly minted) USDT, they take their crypto (e.g. Bitcoin) and give it to the exchange who has to give it to tether.  The end user gets USDT in exchange for this.

So Tether either has to 

1) promptly sell that BTC for money

2) Sit on the BTC and use it to ""back"" the tether.

-Number 1-  is fine, but one has to question how they are unloading all of this BTC.  It could be they are doing what Mt Gox trustees are doing - selling it to the side market, probably wall street types who are building a fund.  They then have money to back the tether.  If they aren't selling to big funds, I have doubts about their ability to sell that level of cryptocurrency on the side market for cash.

-Number 2- is a problem if BTC, or whatever cryptos they hold continue to drop.  If they sold 2.3 billion worth of USDT for 2.3 billion worth of BTC, and BTC drops to $0.000001 tomorrow, those 2.3 billion USDT's are backed by $17 worth of bitcoin. When people go to cash out of their USDT, the buyback will lift the price somewhat, but there will likely be hundreds of millions in losses.

On the other hand, if they are doing this, and bitcoin goes to $50,000... now they have 11.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and owe 2.3 billion to USDT holders.  The price of tether isn't going up, so they get to pocket 8 billion when people take their USDT and buy back into the market.

It could also be a combination of both. I have my bets on choice number 1 though, and here is why:

Institutional investors will not want to enter in through the open market. Its not liquid enough for investing in large quantities. That will drive the price up, and they will be holding the risky bag at the top.  They want to get in during sell offs, which is essentially what tether creation is. Its the same reason the Mt Gox trustee is able to unload all of those coins without touching the market. Who do you think he is selling $100 million in crypto to?

On top of that, USDT is not a US dollar.  In order to convert it back to US dollars, you'll have to do something like buy BTC and send it to GDAX/coinbase and sell it.  That means the institutions are guaranteeing themselves that they aren't holding the bag.  They're going to be the ones selling you the BTC when you try to cash out.  

If this is what is going on, its brilliant really.  The bad news is there will never be any institutional money flooding into the market.  The money flooding into the market will be people converting their USDT to crypto. The good news is that most institutional investors aren't they type to buy and flip... so they are likely doing this to get in for the long haul...",2018-05-19 06:06:51

Been lurking for months. Bought my first ETH at about $250 last September. Had known vaguely about this ""bitcoin"" stuff for years, but never invested. Set up a Coinbase account in July 2017 one day when I was bored. 

Made my first purchases in Sep 2017 - logged into Coinbase and bought the 3 coins on offer having no idea about anything. 45% BTC, 45% ETH, and 10% LTC. I didn't know it at the time but it was during a bad moment of China FUD and I got quite a good deal. 

I thought I would just let it sit on Coinbase and HODL (didn't know that word either) for a few years. That McAfee guy (didn't he invent the antivirus?) sounded like he knew what was up on CNBC and was promising bitcoin would reach $1 million and he sounded trustworthy (In retrospect - LOL). 

Of course once I started reading, I couldn't stop. In Nov/Dec, I went deep into alts (37 alts at the height) and 7x my original investment. I lived by something I read on the Daily Altcoin Thread: ""If you see any coin mentioned twice independently on this thread, just buy it.""

Then the bottom fell out in January and kept dropping, but I stayed in crypto as most of the people I FOMO'd in with last year dropped out and people stopped talking about crypto in the office. 

Kept reading. Started reading this thread every day, the way I used to read the Altcoin thread every day when I was buying a new one and flipping constantly. 

I was lucky - I am uncomfortably overinvested in crypto like many here, but I never went into the red. At the worst point I was at breakeven, which helped a lot. Only because I bought during the China FUD. 

Learnt a lot about Ethereum and blockchain, mostly by reading here and following links from here. Read about sharding, read about Plasma, about scaling and Proof of Stake and felt like I was being given early insight into something that's gonna be BIG. Started using dApps - Peepeth is cool, ETHLend is cool (new UI sucks a bit), I am a big fan of Ethorse (player and investor both). 

I'm not sure where I find the time but I'm probably averaging a couple of hours reading crypto stuff daily. 

Emailed an ICO and offered to help set them up with an advisor and it actually worked out - the contact I suggested is an advisor now. Felt like I did a small bit to help the space along.  

Then ETH went below $400 and I went completely all in and bought what is probably a stupid amount (relative to my income that is!). I basically have no fiat savings left. 

But that's turned out well at least. It was just so obviously undervalued in the $300s, I couldn't believe I was able to buy back in there. I may be overinvested, but I draw the line at borrowing to buy crypto, which is the only reason I didn't buy more. 

Plus it's just a good crowd here - I like it both when it's moonbois and when it's doom and gloom. Feels like a good crew to navigate the choppy crypto waters with. 

Finally, I actually got myself a Reddit account and started building enough karma to post here - reading's not enough anymore.

I've been in bitcoin for about 4 years, and that is not what it's about. It was designed with the game theory that people are greedy as fuck so they will act somewhat rationally and not want to lose money for stupid reasons. Rules such as for spamming the network costing transaction fees, or using the longest chain to make sure crappy forks don't become the main chain are 100% about profit. It wouldn't work otherwise. 

Most people including myself, came for the technology but stayed for the money.

There is this weird neo-libertarian  idea in the community that bitcoin will destroy banks and governments or that they will get #REKT and that's the point of bitcoin. This is not the point, in fact banks and governments have just as much right to participate and make profit like everyone else. The point was to create an antifragile new money and value transfer system that protects individuals wealth from POTENTIAL bad actors that control the legacy system and allowing trustless transactions. There are many functions that banks and governments serve and that can't simply be replaced by digital cash or even smartcontracts. But the existence of an alternative money system insures that they will have a harder time acting badly. Bitcoin has created a new, more fair nash equilibrium between the powers that be and the people but it's not a direct assault on banks or governments.

Bitcoin is not about some conference with a bunch of self-important douches. If you think bitcoin has been ""hijacked"" then fork it. If you think the conference has been hijacked then fork that too.

&gt; Step 2​­ Tether Limited generates and credits the user's tether account. Tethers enter circulation. Amount of fiat currency deposited by user = amount of tethers issued to user (i.e. 10k USD deposited = 10k tether USD issued).

&gt; Step 3​­ Users transact with tethers . The user can transfer, exchange, and store tethers via a p2p open­ source, pseudo­anonymous, Bitcoin­ based platform.

&gt; Step 4​­ The user deposits tethers with Tether Limited for redemption into fiat currency.

&gt; Step 5​­ Tether Limited destroys the tethers and sends fiat currency to the user’s bank account.


&gt; Users can obtain tethers outside of the aforementioned process via an exchange or another individual. Once a tether enters circulation it can be traded freely between any business or individual. For example, users can purchase tethers from Bitfinex, with more exchanges to follow soon. The main concept to be conveyed by the Flow of Funds diagram is that Tether Limited is the only party who can issue tethers into circulation (create them) or take them out of circulation (destroy them). This is the main process by which the system solvency is maintained.

&gt;Luke Dashjr: The only fix is to decentralise mining. Hence the desire for a PoW change.

dz6ur77,CaerbanogWalace,47,"So as this forum slips into a day-trade, bart metaphor driven, synthetic phallus pattern finding mode, I find myself needing to step back and make a more macro evaluation.

We are currently in the correction phase of what most classify as the 3rd bubble in bitcoin (this first bubble happening in the teens and the data being quite old). The previous bubble took the price to 1000 and corrected it down to around 150 from where it slowly climbed back up to around 20k inciting calls for infinite parabolas and wagers involving unsavory self-amputation culinary adventures.

Most should agree that the ICO wild-west gold rush fueled much of this pump, Btc and other major crypto's being the entry points to join the quest for the el-dorado. New as it was in old, the ones selling the shovels got rich off the ones digging the holes. In the end, few were left holding nuggets, most found their pockets lined with pyrite, some still call themselves rich even though they have not attempted to cash out the contents of said pockets.

This correction was inevitable for crypto as a whole, so obviously it would effect BTC regardless of how good or bad its fundamentals might be. Regulation is turning out quite open but it doesn't matter, countries are experimenting with crypto but it doesn't matter, solutions are live for scalability but it doesn't matter, institutional investors have crypto exposure but that doesn't matter.

What does matter is that there is uncertainty for the future. The best sovereign storage of value solution means little is the volatility of the value it hold can swing 90% in a few months. Steam backed out from bitcoin payments for the same reason. The reality of tax obligations corrodes the notion of absolute sovereign control. 

There are plenty of valid reason market actors can (and should) be weary of bitcoin and crypto, even more of other newcomer coins.

Yet I am still bullish long term. A corresponding correction to 2014 would make the price wick down to the 3000$ area, at which point the supply of bitcoin would be severely hit with massive miner operations cost restructurings. I see very little need for market agents to wait for retesting the 1k top to reenter accumulation. There is massive amount of demand waiting on the sidelines for bitcoin with the highly correlated nature of legacy markets today, portfolio managers are desperate for a low correlation asset, they just want a good deal for it, they wont buy the top like a fool buying the prospect for a used up gold mine.

I have no doubt BTC will revisit and surpass 20k in the next two years but before that happens three main events need to happen:

* The ICO/shitcoin space needs a purging event. 95% of newcoins need to go to 0. Its the only way to restore the other 5% as non-ponzi legit investments.

* The price action needs a long accumulation phase. Given the size of institutional investors and the current low market liquidity I would estimate at least 3 times the previous one during 2016, making it likely over a year of range trading, likely around the 4k-6k area. Nothing wrong with 6k-8k either.

* A catalyst event will be needed to regain the public trust. That may come in unpredictable forms like a government collapse, a large supply-demand chain developing a copyable crypto-based clearing house, affordable retail-investor exchanges coming into play...

Meanwhile I understand the bearish sentiment, but the recurring off-the-cuff questioning of bitcoin fundamentals and its equating to ponzi schemes is just silly. Fundamentally BTC is at one of its strongest points ever, its simply too expensive right now for the corresponding demand. Do not pass the opportunity to take advantage of the discounts of the next few years. Its very likely the last one you will get.",2018-05-19 00:24:58

dz90osc,HotelMehrio,125,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

When he gave the project to Gavin, he told him to raise it at some point. Well, he tried with Mike Hearn with Bitcoin XT, and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening. Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas. Segwit2x was the last hope for a compromise between the two camps, and even that failed. Much more detailed summary here: https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada 

Why does the history matter? Because that same hostility against big blockers is STILL happening.

Bitcoin Cash finally split the camps and now there are two different Bitcoins that have different scaling solutions. Saying Diamond and Gold (while still versions of Bitcoin, yes) are the same is just false, look at the community behind Bitcoin Cash and all of the new developments happening. 

The scaling debate is now in the markets. Some people think 'the one true bitcoin' is BTC, others BCH, even some others BTG. It's really just a subjective thing.

dz9zuuz,b24t,50,"\(FYI I posted this over in r/bitcoin as well\)

Bitstamp is starting to ask some pretty spooky questions. I only recently filled in the KYC questionnaire.

I  have been a loyal customer of theirs for years. Suddenly the KYC  questionnaire pops up and I'm thinking ""fine, I'll fill that in, too"".  This is bearing in mind I am fully verified. They have my passport,  proof of address. You would think that would be enough.

Then  they suddenly ask where my bitcoin originate \(mining\), how I heard  about bitcoin, how much I am planning to withdraw, how I am planning to  use my bitcoin.

So I'm still thinking  ""fine, I understand they are getting regulated up the wazoo and need to  cover their asses against money laundering"". I tried my best to answer  accurately, but honestly, it was mostly guess work.

But that wasn't enough either. Now they are asking for proof of purchase of my mining equipment. Like, what?

So  I resisted a bit and asked them if they can at least promise me that it  will be enough information once I provide them an invoice for the miner  \(no idea if I will even find it\). I also asked them what the  consequences are, if I do not provide the information. They just ignored  that question in their next communication.

Along  with their messages, they keep saying ""you are welcome to provide  additional \[insert ridiculously private and personal information about  wallets and transactions\] and any other information"" without specifying  exactly what they need and how much of it. So I just simply won't know  when this process ends? That is nuts! Nobody has ever asked this much  information of me in such a bizarre manner.

ON TOP OF THAT they have now asked me to 'elaborate' on 3 extremely specific transactions I made. To specific addresses.

Like,  how on earth am I supposed to know what that was for? I interact with  the bitcoin ecosystem everywhere, like, some random number strings on  blockchain don't tell me why I made some random transaction and it's not  like I keep a spreadsheet with them in it.

This  is extremely worrying and I have moved all my funds out of  Bitstamp, while I ask them more questions. After this many years of loyalty it seems that I need to find a  new home for my Bitcoin trading. This is extremely disappointing.

Has this happened to anyone else?",2018-05-20 19:16:25

dz9uoru,Lord-of-Bananas,46,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

Depends on what you mean, [Post Quantum Cryptography is being standardized now](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions) and has been talked about in an organized fashion [for quite some time](https://pqcrypto.org/). If you've ever used Google, you may have been part of one of their [PQ Crypto experiments](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html).

In short, the people that secure our systems are preparing for it and Y2Q will probably be historically looked at in the similar vein to Y2K (an event that never happened). If you're inclined, [start integrating today](https://openquantumsafe.org/)... in the next 5 years this will likely be pretty standard stuff integrated and ready to go in whatever language you use and browser sessions everywhere. If IE11 is still a major thing 5 years from now, shoot me. It will be easier to systematically transition a centralized system than a decentralized system, so in that way I don't think the rest of the world will be melting down but it will be business as usual, maybe (hopefully) with less political craziness.

There will likely be data leaked from people (ahem, three letter organizations) storing data that can be opened with QC's in the future, and so that's where the world might melt down (if that's what you meant). 

**In the end, however likely or far out QC's may seem, my ultimate stance is that BTC should be taking QC's seriously as a black swan event, while very unlikely, would be *very* devastating to Cryptocurrency as a whole.** ",2018-05-20 16:13:12

We pre-purchase power from the Montreal Hydro Electric Grid at a certain rate, once we exceed that amount we are allowed to purchase more but at a much higher rate. 

The ban was a temporary six month hold on new crypto mining businesses and not a ban on individuals. As of now the ban has been lifted, the result being companies that cause the town to go over the pre purchased amount of power are responsible for paying the difference.

* They claim this is going to help the world going green because it lets societies store value when solar or hyro are in excess of power.

* this is false. Bitcoin is designed to exchange hands. Most processes are done in real time, and bitcoin has no inherit mechanism and no incentive to prioritize real time vs delayed payments. What we have seen in countless cyrpto spaces is miners sending coin back and forth among their own wallets to artificially cause transaction demand so the miners can keep working. This is a movement of value from wealthy individual's pockets to the miners pocket with no value being done in the real world.

* They claim Bitcoin is better than data centers and office towers processing credit card transactions.

* This is false. Bitcoin is design that the miners brute-force attack cryptographic problem. This inherently is a harder computational problem than a  server receiving notice of a transaction and running checks to see if it's valid. 

 * The user base is willfully ignorant on this topic too; this is the first hit comparing CC and BTC consumption

 * So total consumption for banks during a year only on those three metrics is around (I am rounding) 26Twh on servers, 58Twh on branches and 13Twh on ATMs for a total of close to a 100 Twh a year.

 * According to the article that trigger this discussion, Bitcoin annual Twh consumption is 28.67 , **so currently more than 3 times more efficient than a very conservative calculation of the cost of the global banking system.**

 * this leading google hit article doesn't compare that there are ""U.S. noncash payments, including debit card, credit card, ACH, and check payments, are
estimated to have totaled over [144 billion with a value of almost $178 trillion in 2015](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/2016-payments-study-20161222.pdf)"" compared to BTC's less than [200 million global transactions 
](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-total?timespan=2years)

 * **that's 100 TWH hours for 144,000 million transactions with CCs to BTC 33TWH for 200 million transactions.**

* They claim mining (and energy consumption) will level off as the BTC rewards get smaller

* this is misleading. If the BTC miners aren't working for a BTC reword, they are going to be working for BTC transaction fees. It already costs 3-6 dollars per transaction in fees to actually spend BTC. Who the hell is going to use a coin to buy a 80$ meal when you're spending 3-6 dollars for using that coin instead of CC. Some users will correctly point out that CC's charge the restaurant a 3-6$ fee that you're not seeing, but that's already built into prices, so if you're paying with BTC, you're paying the built in CC fee and the BTC fee.

To clarify, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash share the *exact* same algorithm. And the hashpower (or power consumption) is entirely **unrelated** to the transaction throughput of *either* coin.

The hashpower is high because the price is high. The hashpower is a measure of how *secure* (or difficult to cheat/double-spend) a proof-of-work coin is.

The entire point of proof-of-work is that it's inherently difficult (see: requires energy), as to be impossible to spoof. What that does is assure that this distributed ledger with all the transactions cannot be reversed and the balances cannot be double spent.

The current power consumption is ""high"" because mining is profitable (the price for coins is high enough to warrant capital investment in mining rigs + electricity and infrastructure costs). What that means is that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are **incredibly** secure.",2018-05-21 13:35:42

Don't fucking Johnn***E***  Test me. 

All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

It’s a lot less flashy and has a bad reputation because past “attempts” (they weren’t actually collectivist) have included a heavy dose of authority, but capitalism is really not ideal for long term survival at this rate.

Think about how capitalism accelerates consumption and waste. The only time when we see a slowdown in those departments is when it becomes economical. However, the point at which it becomes economical usually comes way later than it should - at a point when it is too little too late.

Capitalism is built upon competition, which is an unsustainable mechanic. Look at how Bitcoin mining is taking up so much of the world’s energy right now. This is a bunch of individuals acting recklessly so that they can earn a buck.

And even if they earn enough money to last them their entire lifetime, they’ll still try to get more. And more. And more. There’s this fear that what you have isn’t enough, even when it totally is. And then there’s this megalomania that possesses people that drives them to achieve higher heights. And they don’t care who they run over to get there.

dzfvmpd,Troll4ever31,102,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines).
Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess.
These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect.
And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test.
Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body.
My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery? It's not my fault if you can't handle my de trop of definitions or my lexical linguipotence! Get back up there and read it, even if you have to go through it with dictionary in hand.

The market is healthy, but they dont want it to recover yet before they have transferred enough btc into USD for banking license. 76k btc has been transfered from the coldwallet since the announcement. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

You hate banks but you dont see how new 'banks' are forming that hurt the price of BTC. Exchanges - the gateways for crypto - control who gets listed and who not, asking for high listing fee's. They ask for too much trading fee's ending up with big bags - just like coinbase/binance and others. They pull money out of crypto and we end up with this dump that happened the last few days. Yet lets hate a transparent company that actually invests back into crypto, tries to get the crypto-ecosystem out there, advocates for us - brings in new people to the market. Sounds logical?

announcement of bittrex to acquire license to list USD: end of october 2017. Total amount removed from wallet since announcement: 76k BTC. (total added: 70k BTC end of December) they dont dump directly after movement, they wait for volume to hit. But they do control our price. Is that our 'governmentless' control we want? give massive hate to ripple for the potential - that every coin has - to dump, yet when it happens to btc massivly ignore it?
 
Can we be sure about this? no, we cant. They keep us in the dark, so a lot of people are not sure what is going on, paniccing on dips. A movement can mean something else, but i've been following this wallet for 2 months and can say that i find it weird that every time there is a random drop they moved out right before the drop. For now its speculation, but if you have the feeling crypto is greater than ever and heavily manipulated in price - this might calm you down a bit.

[0:00](https://youtu.be/rfOlE-mmYBo): Craig: Excuse me, have you had an affair?  Did your wife know about it?  When you did, can you show me the credit card records, because I'd like to know how much you earn each month, and how much the hotel costs?  I mean, this is what privacy's about.  Are you willing to answer those questions?

[0:38](https://youtu.be/rfOlE-mmYBo?t=38s): Craig: Do I really care?

[0:40](https://youtu.be/rfOlE-mmYBo?t=40s): nChain guy (to Craig's right): At nChain group, we don't think it matters anymore whether people believe *anyone* in the world is Satoshi Nakamoto.  Satoshi Nakamoto is a concept and a myth that birthed Bitcoin to the world and while there may be many people in the world that believe Dr. Wright is we don't think it's important to the future of Bitcoin and we are here to focus on the future of Bitcoin Cash.  And we are happy to have people believe what they want to believe or not.

[1:06](https://youtu.be/rfOlE-mmYBo?t=1m06s): Craig: The only thing that's important to Bitcoin is the future, not what came before, what is coming and what is being developed.  And we're about to release a whole lot of technology and other things, and nothing there should matter about who someone was.  Proof of authority is not what Bitcoin's about.

I am not a commodities trading regulation expert, but have done a little bit in the field regarding commodities pool operator issues, fraud, and am pretty familiar with the base reqs of the commodities exchange act. So, please take my opinion with a grain of salt, as I don't claim to be an expert. A few points to caveat the REEEEEEE FUD stuff here:

1) US regulator jurisdiction doesn't stop at US shores. There are plenty of situations where they can bring action against overseas individuals and exchanges. Bitmex isn't magically immune because they don't operate in the US.

2) Bitcoin doesn't need to be on a regulated exchange to be regulated. CFTC has already brought enforcement actions plenty of times for law breaking outside of CFTC regulated exchanges. It isn't some magical escape hatch to claim that spoofing and wash trading are okay because the exchange isnt CME.

3) CFTC does and will take pretty heavy-handed action against spoofers and wash traders and other manipulators and exchanges all the time.

&gt; Jack:
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to explain it in Chinese. 
&gt; About who is Satoshi Nakamoto, there is a very fair standard in our industry.
&gt; Bitcoin is based on Mathematics. We believe in math.
&gt; In fact, there is only one question you need answer, do you have the private key?
&gt; Everyone can be Satoshi Nakamoto, if you don’t have the private key.
&gt; I can tell everyone here, I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; 
&gt; (Argument)
&gt; 
&gt; Jack: Good bye, faketoshi!
&gt; 
&gt; I was talking about the standard, all of a sudden, he was so pissed off. He told us to choose a side. Is this a normal person’s logic?
&gt; Okay, let me continue. 
&gt; All of us sit here can be Satoshi Nakamoto, because there is no way to prove you are not. No one can provide (Satoshi’s) private key. 
&gt; Before a private key can prove you are actually not the real Satoshi, everyone can say they are Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; That’s why I said, all of us can say ourselves is Satoshi.
&gt; It is really easy to prove you are Satoshi Nakamoto, you just need to show us your private key signature.
&gt; We are now using math to ensure our assets, so all of us should believe in (math), otherwise your money will be controlled by others. 
&gt; Why did we choose (to use) Bitcoin? Why don’t we choose fiat, or we invest some parts of our assets in digital currency?
&gt; The reason is we believe in math. Let’s do not rely too much on human nature, logic or emotion. 
&gt; What we need believe is, who has the private key, who then is Satoshi Nakamoto.
&gt; If you lose your private key, even though you are Satoshi Nakamoto, you have no evidence to prove you are Satoshi Nakamoto. 
&gt; 
&gt; Craig is a fake Satoshi, and he’s extremely rude. 
&gt; When he was talking, I respected him.
&gt; I was just talking about an industry standard, a matured standard to define who’s Satoshi Nakamoto. All of a sudden, he was so pissed, even told us to choose which side should we stand?
&gt; 
&gt; This is an insult to a democracy society. We are here attending this meeting, we should respect everyone’s opinions. Craig Wright is just a shame of our community. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was about to discuss this issue peacefully, he offended me again and again. He told us to choose a side yesterday, today he continued (to ask). He’s Australian, he’s a shame of Australians. He’s also a shame of our community. Thank you!﻿",2018-05-24 03:09:47
dzgc5iu,crypto_pepe,71,"I recently spoke at an invite-only conference organized solely for fund managers in my state. Attendees were mostly hedge funds but also a few large endowments, pension funds, etc. Roughly 75 people and about $500B in combined AUM. 

I run a small crypto fund myself (organized mostly for friends and family who keep referring me; I only manage a few million at the moment) and was brought in to serve on a crypto Q&amp;A panel along with a high-profile lawyer specializing in setting up crypto funds and ICOs. The conference organizer created three panels that rotated throughout the afternoon, so my co-host and I were given the opportunity to speak to groups of about 25 for an hour apiece, which provided for a much more intimate conversation than one might otherwise get at a larger conference.

Here are some of my major takeaways from the event:

-The excitement about crypto was palpable. My co-host and I were treated like minor celebrities. I would be talking to someone about what I do and two minutes later we'd be surrounded by another half dozen people wanting to listen in on the conversation. 

Every other session over the course of the day somehow found crypto interjected into it. The state's SEC director gave a talk on audits and mock exams; someone asked how they were planning on regulating ICOs. A local tax attorney spoke on how Trump's new tax law would affect their business; people wanted to know how crypto assets would be taxed and how their accountants ought to manage them. An hour-long panel on AI, machine learning and disruptive technology became a de facto blockchain discussion. It was like trying to keep schoolchildren focused on the last day of school when all they can think about is summer vacation.

-Despite the interest, not a single person there (aside from my co-host) had an even basic understanding of how anything in crypto works. I frequently found myself explaining what a blockchain is, how Bitcoin and proof of work operate, what ICOs are, and why you can't simply aggregate all these assets under one giant ""blockchain technology"" umbrella.  

These people are movers and shakers, Masters of the Universe, yet it was clear they had done next to no research on any part of our industry. Many of them sheepishly admitted as much, but said they felt overwhelmed by the amount of technical learning they'd have to do and that it would be easier to simply stick to their core competencies. 

I quickly stopped answering questions with technical answers and switched to big-picture ideas, and that worked much better. When I explained smart contracts and how an internet of value would allow us to do business with people around the world without having to trust them (or other third parties), eyes would light up throughout the crowd. I was approached after each panel and thanked for my explanations; many told me it was the first time they understood the zeal behind our movement. 

-While a handful of the younger managers admitted to buying some Bitcoin on Coinbase last year ""with beer money,"" no one was seriously invested at a personal level and only one hedge fund had allocated a significant amount (just Bitcoin, via GBTC). He described his fund's focus as ""crypto and cannabis"" but the fund was on the smaller side and he admitted knowing next to nothing about Bitcoin itself - he simply traded the volatility.

-Despite the ignorance, there was very little nocoiner sentiment or resentment/animosity towards our industry. Everyone was intensely curious about what's happening and you could tell these people were salivating over the possible returns. The consensus seemed to be that while no one wanted to make the first move, they were all quite eager to be second once someone else tested the waters. While many were skeptical of the ICO boom (obviously for good reason), everyone acknowledged that Bitcoin/crypto as a whole is an asset class that is here to stay and should be taken seriously. 

-The most common reasons for not investing were, in order of popularity/significance:

1. Lack of regulatory clarity (top concern by far)

2. Lack of custody and security options (in addition to not understanding private keys and how the bearer nature of crypto asset custody works) 

3. Liquidity and infrastructure navigation (exchanges were made for retail not institutional buyers and can barely handle the former; landscape is fragmented and it's difficult to aggregate liquidity; UI/UX is awful and not user-friendly for non-technical investors)

The good news is, the last two issues should be solved relatively soon (i.e. in 2018). Coinbase recently released a [suite of institutional products](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-institutional-deea317d23af) as did Ledger in [their recent announcement regarding their new venture Komainu](https://www.ledger.fr/2018/05/15/nomura-ledger-global-advisors-building-komainu-secure-digital-asset-custody/), in addition to existing providers like Xapo. The demand from major institutions is obviously there, and the market should continue to respond with an increasingly sophisticated assortment of picks and shovels.

The bad news is, every single manager I spoke with was concerned about the regulatory ambiguity surrounding the space and seemed determined to remain on the sidelines until further clarification was provided. 

When asked how the various hodgepodge of government agencies (SEC, CFTC, IRS, etc.) would determine who among them would lead the charge in sorting out the industry, the state's SEC chairman shrugged and said ""I have no idea."" He emphasized how the numerous differences between various types of crypto assets (digital currencies, privacy coins, smart contract networks, DAGs, ICOs) made it difficult to determine not just who should be regulating what, but how any of those asset sub-classes should be regulated differently from the rest. He further emphasized how the extreme rate of change and development made it even more difficult to get a handle on what's happening (""it's like trying to analyze a chameleon that keeps changing color""). 

As I've mentioned here previously I'm a huge fan of the [hype cycle theory](https://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da) regarding crypto's boom/bust cycles. While I'm now 100% convinced we have at least one major cycle left (institutional money - we might get another if nation state involvement occurs after that), and thus super bullish for the future, I've become much more bearish for the short term (or however long it takes regulators to get their act together). 

Given recent price action (as well as the extreme bull market that just ended), I'm now more inclined to believe we'll see a return to recent lows and an extended consolidation period a la 2014-15. Smaller hedge funds, family offices, HNIs, etc. might start dipping their toes in, but I just don't see big money proper getting involved until regulatory uncertainty clears up (and that could take a year or more). My fund was stopped out of most of our positions last week and I'm sitting in cash until the volatility dries up and things get tight and boring. On the upside, maybe I'll actually be able to take something resembling a summer vacation now.

I'd love to be proven wrong, and I'm cautiously optimistic that regulators in more advanced crypto markets like Japan or Korea might help pave the way for clarification here in the U.S. But if we have to wait on our own bureaucracy to jump start rocket ignition, we might be waiting for a while.",2018-05-24 02:09:20

There is also a conflict of interest because everyone has skin in the game and must convince themselves and others their decision (irregardless of whether it's sound or not at the time) is never wrong. 

Do you expect people here to say ""no, it's fucking stupid, save your meagre funds to slowly build your financial safety net that will save your ass when some random incident will disrupt your security or goals""? Of course not. They'll say ""Do it, go all in!"". Ask yourself is this the best place to seek sound investment advice? You want to just speculate a bit? It's your money and your loss or win, good luck. You want to invest? Prepare to think critically and do your research. No, asking here to get some bullish hype responses  is not research unless you're just looking for validation in which case you will get it promptly.

What is smart idea? [Reading carefully this post written by /r/bitcoin mod that was stickied during the peak of the hype is a good start.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/) 

What is stupid idea? Asking here if you should blindly speculate on a very volatile asset on the most predatory market on the planet with a history of manipulation and shady actors with substantial portion of your current earnings is a stupid idea.

What you need is to critically exame your goals and your current condition.

1. Do you have a basic financial safety net that will ensure you will be able to handle random disasters when your life shits the bed? If not, build it immediately. I don't care if you have no expenses, live in your parent's basement and they pay for everything. Life can shit the bed at any time, you need to be able to handle random situations with a flick of the fingers. If your situation is more safe you still should have some money for less important FUBARS, if you can, good, this is a first step towards financial safety.

2. Do you have **any** kind of savings that you can pull out in case good opportunities arise? I remember a post some time ago on coinbase subreddit of a mother that lamented and wailed that there was a problem with her coinbase account and transfer of funds and she couldn't withdraw her money quickly because she had all of her savings (lol) on coinbase and there was a flash sale with a laptop she could buy for her children birthday for about a third of a price. Of course coinbase had to shit the bed and she lost excellent opportunity that would save her a lot of money on this goal. The children were devastated and so was she. Don't be like her.
Also people often spend too much on things they want **now** because instant gratification is easy and nice but not save enough to afford things they could buy cheaper at a later time. Or they buy shitty things over and over because they break more often instead of buying one good thing that will last them much longer if they saved. But people don't want to pay more for quality sometimes, it's a mistake. This gives you advantage and saves your money. If you don't have opportunity money (and I don't care what your goal is, whether it's a car, or new printer, or a very nice pair of shoes) you are already losing son. You are losing and you're not even aware of it. Be aware.


5. Do you have any kind of savings that you can lock in for a longer time frame that you don't want to pull out at a moment's notice but you can move them should there be an absolute necessity? I assume not, not at this time of your life. But it's good to have at least some.


If you answered yes for all of those questions however, congratulations, you may have enough financial security to begin investing and maybe even speculating on risky instruments with a portion of your portfolio. Sounds boring? Welcome to investing, you've barely arrived at the starting line, if you didn't answer yes to every one of them you should invest in your financial security ASAP. I don't care you have no expenses, that's even better, build your future from the beggining and you will be better off than your peers that waste their money on newest iphone or some other stupid shit and lament they can't afford really nice things when it really matters. Invest in your financial safety net first, invest in yourself ASAP, then after you're safe and comfy, ready to push a button and snatch a good opportunity at any time you want and you have some nice additional savings (relative really) then you're ready for high seas. And even then you need to spread the risk and diversify. 

But before that, no, it's fucking stupid. Investing isn't about jumping at every promise of getting rich quick. No matter how good the promise may seem. Financial security and investing in yourself will never fail. ",2018-05-25 18:29:52

Bitcoin Gold, Verge, and similar projects are supported and driven by investors wanting to make a quick buck. The daytrading kind of people. I do not say that this is necessarily a bad thing, but for me, that would be too stressfull. They do not care about long-term feasibility or even practicability. 

There are other investors who put their money in something they really believe in, and if it goes -20%, or heck, even -90%, they still hold it (sometimes there is no other choice), because they know long-term everything will work out just fine. 

Truth is, there is a lot of garbage out there. Not only XVG and Co., also EOS and Hashgraph still have to prove their adoption potential.

NANO in its current form is just.. ""boring"". I mean, we already have a mainnet, so no FOMO. We already have a perfectly fine product, no real ""releases"" coming up, besides a wallet, which is quite boring, too. NANO IS already ready for adoption and now it is the real world's turn. And the real world will take a while. 

I sleep tight. Maybe I will buy NANO more when it is &lt;4$. It's really cheap. 

_______

We are just one ""bang"" away from FOMO and domination. NANO just needs one IBM- or Apple- or Facebook- or Major-OEM-announcement and suddenly everything will explode. Because while these kinds of ""partnerships"" or collaborations of other cryptos such IOTA are just about use cases and a little bit testing, a NANO partnership is a collaboration with a working-product, to be integrated from Day One in its final form. The same is true for Litecoin and Dash, all of them waiting for a major partnership. This will take time. Maybe even years? Micropayments is the holy grail of DLT, and the most complicated one due to overabundance of crypto companies, complexity, volatility problems. ",2018-05-25 18:39:42

dzkcub3,AdmREQ,68,"From a developers point of here's my take on the dynamic road-map update.

With a static roadmap it can be difficult to hit deadlines (a few weeks / a month or two isn't bad), the longer the roadmap the harder it is to estimate + hit deadlines. This is the case for a normal business' but as crypto is insanely fast paced this is even more prevalent. In the normal development world you typically work in weekly / bi-weekly sprints to produce features consistently which contributes to the final project as a whole.

I think biggest issue about committing to a firm date for things is that crypto adoption is moving at a fast rate, non-blockchain businesses are getting involved with cryptocurrencies and a great platform like Request is an attractive option for them. Onboarding these businesses takes money, expertise and most importantly team resources. The team is growing but for now the time spent with these partners needs to come from somewhere and unfortunately, features can sometimes get affected.

Let's take BTC / ERC20 support - if the team focused 100% on these features I would have no doubt there would have been no delay. But, PwC came along which took up development resources which did unfortunately impact the deadline. Long term though having PwC onboard will have a more positive long-term effect on the overall Request Network ecosystem. Partnerships won't wait around, Bitcoin / ERC20 support will.

With these partnerships there will be a push for features they want to see. PwC for example, would be focused on the accounting so they would likely be pushing for an account-like dApp (http://accounting.request.network/) - when the roadmap was first created the team could never predict such a huge entity like PwC would come onboard so changing focus is sometimes required from a project.

Another reason is that the team is growing and each new member will have a different skillset. Benjamin, for example, is a full stack developer who will be focusing on dApps - the old roadmap didn't account for new team members + their skills so updating to account for these new members is important.

Changing the roadmap is a fantastic move in my opinion, the team never know what is around the corner and being able to quickly shift focus if needed is important. In the most recent announcement with Wikimedia, it is clear big companies are interested in Request, on-boarding these companies are critical for the long-term viability of the network. Yes, from an investors point of view it's not ideal knowing exactly when a feature is available but realistically the team needs to be as flexible as possible.

The team have already recruited more devs + they are still recruiting more - as the team expands there will be more development resource available to focus on the core platform. The project is still young but the team are juggling everything very well at the moment.",2018-05-26 01:15:29

We can even look at the DaddyOFive case where he was abusing and exploiting his children in order to make that youtube cash.

People still throw a decent chunk of their paychecks in the lotto every time the prize goes up to over $100 mil.

dzklvxa,circuitloss,42,"I also started buying in 2013, and while I'm not a daytrader and have absolutely nothing to contribute in regard to TA, I will mention something about the psychology of the market.

In 2015, I truly believed that Bitcoin might be dead. The price got down into the $300s. It felt like the bottom had come out of the market, it felt like the tech was stagnating, it felt like this grand experiment might be abandoned, or at least would become a sort of weird, nerdy collector's item at the most.

Now, despite the challenges in regards to scaling (which I won't address at the moment) and the ""blood in the streets"" of a 66% drop, I feel none of those things that I felt in 2015.

Bitcoin consistently surprises me with its tenacity. I think that, precisely because its supply is limited, precisely because Bitcoin is the first incarnation of digital scarcity, it has and will maintain long-term value. The ecosystem has also matured a great deal and it makes Bitcoin an asset that can actually be used in transactions with some ease, unlike the 2013 era, where we were forced to use all sorts of idiosyncratic means to buy or sell for fiat.

This infrastructure isn't going anywhere, and in the meantime, Bitcoin's inexorable, hard-coded math, it's digital monetary policy, is taking effect, halving after halving, until it becomes a rare, scarce commodity. 

That basic idea -- true scarcity, true deflationary properties -- has not and never will change. It continues to be, despite all the FUD, despite all the bullshit, despite all the political machinations on all sides, the slow, steady realization of financial freedom.",2018-05-26 03:31:37

dzlnmfb,padpad-,38,"hey Vitalik. I didn’t even realize that response was you at first - and thought this might be a good time to ask you a question I was thinking about. Not a technical one, or even specific one. But a more general one. But nonetheless an important one.

What is your honest opinion on mass surveillance? Sometimes I feel like technologies around blockchain could potentially be humanity’s last hope in balancing out the power between the state and its people. 

Sorry to get so deep about it. I really respect your views and philosophies around this industry you are helping to create. I am glad you think the way you do. I can imagine nowadays it must seem like nothing in your head is private. That nowadays people will use the way you think to make money instead of helping in their own way to make the world a better place instead. 
I suppose all I’m really trying to say, is thank you. Thank you Vitalik. 


p.s. I always find it interesting thinking about Satoshi. I have my beliefs about who it is - but ultimately it doesn’t even matter. Because Satoshi realized that having a face to Bitcoin goes against the whole nature of technology in the first place. 
My point being, What people don’t commend you enough on is your bravery. Being the face of a technology and being under a microscope. And that you are not alone in your quest to make the world a better place. One not about corporations, money, lambos, tokens, or reputation points. But about something much deeper than that.

dzl4x46,biba8163,38,"What everyone is saying about EOS is sounding exactly like what everyone in Bitcoin used to say about Ethereum: centralized, pre-mined, immutable hah...King Vitalik can just roll back the changes (DAO hack).  Sadly, I bought into that and never bought ETH when it was in the single digits.  

Decentralization is not binary.  We have different levels of decentralization in the crypto space.  It also doesn't just have to do with who is running the software and validating the transactions but also the distribution of the wealth and the governance protocol itself.   

If some of these blockchain platforms/protocols ever become huge and part of the economy it's possible that imagine a Too Big To Fail insurance SmartContract/daPP what has 15% of the circulation of Ethereum or EOS locked up and a vulnerabilty is discovered where the funds are being maliciously stolen.   Ethereum would have to make the choice again like in the DAO hack to hardfork the entire blockchain.  EOS consensus would allow the specific dApp/SmartContract to be modified without rolling back the entire blockchain.  

Bitcoin since adoption (in the 1st year I think there was a problem) hasn't had to deal with this sort of issue because it aims to do mainly act as a currency with only simple programmable mechanisms.  But the more adoption and complexity you have in the smart contract platforms, the bigger this concern is going to be of whether you can have true immutability.   If you're followed Nano/RaiBlocks, you notice that even in a pure currency there were people who lost money to Bitgrail wanting a rollback/fork because a lot of people lost big money that would have had a significant impact on their lives.

1. You never entered your email into breadwallet.
2. I explicitly told you the recovery phrase is EVERYTHING. No password resets.

1. I securely generate a BIP39 phrase offline.

4. If they deposit 0.0001 BTC or 100BTC, I don't steal it. (to be honest I don't even watch the addresses...)
5. Then one day when they come asking me to ""help them login"" I pull it out and recover for them.

dznl1mc,kamchii,39,"**Question 1**
&gt; Then why didnt the Bitcoin Devs made the certain changes to stay as a cash system? 

The developers slowly centralized into primarily just the Core developers. Other developers were driven away, and the new vision of Bitcoin became that of the Core developers. Obviously those people and developers driven away either quit crypto, or reluctantly stayed on a restricted Bitcoin until a viable alternative finally appeared once all compromising was proven to be impossible.

&gt;What is the purpose of keeping it or aiming to make Bitcoin a store of value? 

No clue, and a primarily SoV experiment doesn't interest me so I don't hold any BTC anymore. Looking at the past, all that experiment has done so far has delayed Bitcoin growth/adoption, and caused Bitcoin to lose market share to alternatives - all of which was predicted by the big-blockers side.

&gt; These solutions look not at all to be harmonizing with the idea of a cash system, which should be liquid and not stored.

Indeed they don't, which is why the argument that BTC no longer resembles what the Bitcoin whitepaper outlines has merit.

**Question 2**
&gt; Bitcoin Cash with its leaders Roger Ver...Craigh Wright

They are just two users of BCH, like anyone else. They believe the BCH network has value, and as such are invested and trying to improve it in their own way, for better or worse. Neither of them 'leads' you or me.

The point is, if you let your decision about whether a crypto is good or bad for you based off who uses it you're doing it wrong. Criminals/terrorists will use any crypto that becomes successful - it wouldn't be a good money if they couldn't - that doesn't mean we should not use it because of that.

&gt;Why on hell does he with many of his followers fuel the destructive discussion of the scaling debate.

The discussion wasn't destructive itself, but the censorship and refusal to allow the community to come to consensus is what was destructive.

Big-blockers wanted an increased block size.  
Core argued against it, and after some time designed SegWit hailing it as an alternative scaling solution.   
Big-blockers wanted an increase to 32MB. Core fought it.  
Then 8MB.  Core fought it.   
Then a gradual increase of 2MB&gt;4MB&gt;8MB.  Core fought it.     
Then 2MB.  Core agreed! But only if the entire community wanted it, and only if miners promised to run Core's software. Core decided the community didn't want it, then Core fought it.    
Then SegWit first, and 2MB block increase later.  End result: SegWit was activated, Core fought the 2MB increase.  
Then the Bitcoin fees continued to skyrocket out of control, as was predicted to happen. Core's solution is still to wait for Lightning - of which even the LN whitepaper states it requires 133MB blocks in order to allow 7 billion people to open two channels each per year.........


BCH is essentially the result of Bitcoiners finally refusing to bend the knee to the Core developers and submit to their rulership. The Core developers decided that years of arguing, stalled adoption and development, and permanent fracturing of the Bitcoin community was worth it in order to keep the blocksize smaller than a floppy disk.


In short, it's not us. It's them.


&gt;...and uses ways to confuse people on bitcoin.com

One page on Bitcoin.com listed Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin (BCH). Could be confusing for some, but if it had been Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin (BCH) I would fully support it. Nobody today gets confused with Dollars (USD) and Dollars (CAD) today. In the end, Roger wasn't even aware of it, and it was changed back soon after.


&gt;Is Roger Ver the leading position of this movement    
  
He isn't, he's just invested and speaking out like many are.


&gt;as he did doubtful actions in the past (Mt. Gox)

There is much more to that story. He has explained it in videos already - if you don't know the details you may want to look into it if it concerns you.

&gt;and is acting highly disruptive on social media promoting Bitcoin Cash and defaming Bitcoin

So are fans of sports teams against their rivals. Just like sports fans, some involved in crypto are rude and divisive. Add in the anonymity of the internet and their courage and volume only escalates. It doesn't mean you should view the entire ecosystem based off their actions.


&gt;Why not showing off with innovation, adoption and true perception that Bitcoin Cash is the Coin of cryptocurency movement?

That's the goal and likely what many here are doing in their own way. For myself at least who has been here for many years it's hard not to resent 'the other side' for allowing Bitcoin to fall like this, and a few comments may be made. We're all human after all. :)

&gt;Also why the hell is Craig Wright in the Bitcoin Cash team

Because he values the network and wants to be a part of it, and you and I have no power to say no to that.


&gt;This lowers drastically the creditabillity of Bitcoin Cash...

Does a drug dealer lower the credibility of the US Dollar if he uses it?


&gt;...since he is ""not"" Satoshi and comits fraud.

There's no concrete, public proof one way or the other. There's also no concrete, public proof that you or I are not Satoshi. In the end, it doesn't matter. Satoshi was a person/group, not a god, and could be wrong. Even if he is, it doesn't change the current situation of BCH or BTC, and would just be yet another user of the network.

You can't just put a price on electricity and say 'Bitcoin is wasting an entire countries power. It's not, it's moving and gravitating towards places that ALREADY waste power.

Secondly, it's in the miners best interest to find other sources of power like renewable. The cheaper your Electricty, the more money you make. They're going to chase the cheap power.

One would think the threat of a 51% attack should game-theoretically limit ""death by a thousand clones"", at least for Proof-of-Work coins. For example, ZCash is the Equihash reigning champ at a whopping 514 Mh/s (see https://whattomine.com/ and https://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency), meaning that systems like Bitcoin Gold (25 Mh/s), BitcoinPrivate (7 Mh/s) and ZClassic (32 Mh/s) are at a huge, constant risk of 51% attack. In other words, ZCash has 20x the mining power of Bitcoin Gold, so miners could easily switch back and forth and double-spend on these smaller hashrate chains.

dzorhzz,cartmanbeer,77,"To me, this is the biggest issue with cryptocurrencies for the long term: wasteful and ever-increasing power requirements. We can't have entire hydroelectric dams dedicated to this (keep in mind most of the network is powered by coal plants in China at the moment).

Current power requirements for the bitcoin network is estimated at nearly 70 TWh per year - that's about as much as the Czech Republic and is nearly triple what it was just a year ago. It is projected to be more than double that amount within a year. Also note that simple *transactions* consume a large amount of energy: hundreds of kWh *each* - roughly 500,000 times more than a single Visa transaction (!). 

The problem is, this is inherent in the design of the system: coin creators want the hashing algorithm to be ""difficult"" (and become progressively more difficult) so that all of the coins aren't mined in a month and it roughly emulates a steadily decreasing inflation rate of the currency. But that implies ever-*increasing* power requirements. Note that this was intentional, so as to roughly emulate the requirements in mining something like gold - problem is, you can't mine gold *anywhere* there is a power outlet....

Bitcoin unwittingly dodged *some* of this power efficiency problem by moving to ASICs (custom chips designed solely for one purpose, in this case, mining bitcoin) which are roughly 10x more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs. But this has resulted in a bitcoin mining rate that is likely much higher than its creator(s) ever anticipated. Bitcoin has a hard cap on the number of coins that can be mined and we will hit 90% of that by 2022. Other coin creators saw the use of ASICs as a flaw since you generally have to deep pockets to afford them and designed algorithms that can be modified and/or are inherently difficult to run on an ASIC design. But in doing so, they have made power consumption even larger for the long term.

I think some of the ideas with cryptocurrency are quite good - but this sure doesn't look sustainable and at some point we have to ask if it makes sense to keep powering such a system. Even if it *all* works out as imagined and in 20 years we have: a working, world-wide currency system free from government control, that is impossible to create fraudulent transactions in, and doesn't require a trusted third party for verification - Is having that worth it if it takes up say, 15% of total worldwide energy consumption?

Note that some disagree with these power consumption estimates and put them at numbers say, 5x lower. But we're still several thousand times higher than any other payment system out there and it is increasing at an exponential (aka unsustainable) rate.

This is big. This is, perhaps, an epochal change in how civilization works and if it is it really hasn't even gotten started yet. The things that have been big, positive societal changes historically have been changes towards democratization. Democratizing politics through actual democracy, democratizing access to information through free press and eventually the internet, democratizing individual violence through man-portable arms and in a more meta sense democratizing international violence through nuclear arms (I can explain this more; essentially we can't just go roll into any nation we choose and put our boots in their face because even the small ones are becoming nuclear powers - bad for us as an empire but good for humanity). Well, in 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto democratized money. Holy shit. Be excited and a little scared. Bitcoin is a good buy at 7k; it'll be a good buy at 70k and 700k too.  
 



Tim Draper in-eloquently said that Bitcoin was bigger than the internet and he was chastised for it. But it kind of is, at least in its implications. If widely adopted it will reign in the ability for nations to exert control without direct consent of their people because it will shift what has traditionally been a top-down concern and what is the source of most control - the creation of money - to the masses. The internet reigned in what lies governments can tell (think Wikileaks), but Bitcoin will reign in _what they can actually do in a technical sense._ If a future government wants to wage a future war they'll need to get the money from somewhere besides a printing press. They will have to get it from their people, and those people can say no in a coercion-resistant, mathematically immutable way. This is all besides the fact that its just better money. It may not seem like it if you use the US dollar, but we're 21T in debt and rising. We've already seen people in countries with failing currencies switching to crypto - the Turkish Lira, the Bolivar, etc. Currency just became a competitive enterprise and if you think the dollar is going to win on its merits against something that you can't censor, inflate, block, etc - in a world full of people who don't like the US that much to begin with - I've got a bridge to sell you. This genie is fully out of the bottle and its not going back in. Bitcoin isn't the bubble, fiat is the bubble. Bitcoin is the pin. This is a monetary revolution all dressed up as a get rich quick scam/bubble/pyramid scheme.



This is a complex issue so if you still don't see it that's fine. There's a lot that can go wrong. Put in whatever you're willing to lose and pretend you lost it for the next 10 years or so. You might lose it. But I'd bet money (fiat not Bitcoin) that you'll thank me and wish you'd been willing to lose more.",2018-05-28 00:38:30

**Do those solved data have any practical usage?**

No, these have no practical uses.

**What are these algorithms (the maths) that the miners solve?**

Imagine this. I give you a number, 15, and ask you which 2 prime numbers are multiplied together are equal to it. Easy right? It’s clearly 5 x 3. But what if you couldn’t just figure that out? You would have to guess a bunch of prime numbers and check each one. Is it 2 and 7? Let’s check, 2 x 7 make 14. Is it 3 and 7? No. Finally you try 3 x 5 and yup, it’s 15.

Seems silly to do it by guessing right? But what if the number was 8,876,044,532,898,802,067? With such a large number it becomes very difficult to factor it, since it is a product of the prime numbers 5,915,587,277 and 1,500,450,271. A computer could guess its way to it, but it would have to check every prime number from 1 to 1,500,450,271. And those are relatively small numbers for what is used in cryptography – [this page](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/small.html) shows a list of primes up to 100 digits long. Checking all the primes up to ones 100 digits long is just not possible in a reasonable amount of time.

A “cryptographic hash function” is somewhat like this in the sense that it is a **one-way** function. You run a function on a big number, and it gives you another big number. The key is, it's super quick to apply the function (a computer can easily multiple 2 100-digit numbers in less than a second) but it *can’t* work backwards. So all these bitcoin miners are GUESSING numbers, plugging them into the function, looking at the answer, then going “nope, that’s not it.”

Because the numbers are so big, they have to guess, check the result, say no, and guess again millions and millions of times a second.

Imagine you’re a blind guy trying to solve a Rubik’s cube. You spin it a bit, show it to a guy, who says nope that’s not it, then you try again. This was done in the 1989 movie UHF, and it is exactly what bitcoin miners are basically doing!

https://youtu.be/TYM4QKMg12o

So that should answer question 1, what are they solving. They’re guessing, checking the answer, and trying again. This sort of answers question 2, yes they are dummy problems in a way. Finally, for question 3, nope, these calculations do not help us in any way, and other than helping the bitcoin system, they are a waste. The only benefit could be the research in the design of systems to optimize the guessing and do it faster.",2018-05-29 02:57:36

1. I actually thought that the price would be higher than $525 by now.

2. I wouldn't have believed that the price would be $1,400 in January 2018

3. I wouldn't have believed that the price of ETH would remain in the 200-300s for 4+ months in the second half of the year.

4. Finally (and I hate to admit this one), I didn't understand that Ethereum was a platform for DApps and smart contracts for the first week after I bought it. I thought it was just another currency like Bitcoin. I also thought that the currency was called ""Ethereum"" rather than ""Ether"" for way too damn long.

In the last year I have learned so much and now I could easily explain Ethereum, what it can do, it's use cases, how to use different wallets and sites like etherscan.io, smart contracts, DApps, the many proposed scaling solutions, differences between consensus algorithms like PoS, PoW and DPoS as well as trends within the cryptocurrency market as a whole/signs to look for in the market.

We think about this when designing UX for the SDK, Plasma, the decentralized exchange as well as the projects we contribute to through the Ethereum Community Fund.

We also would like people to understand the historicity of this project. It’s the quest for free \(libre, not gratis\) and fair money. An earlier incarnation of this quest was Bitcoin. Another one before that was Paypal \(the really early idea\). But the OMG network is different. It’s not just a new currency or even a new payment network. It’s a worldwide financial system that can very easily integrate and be inclusive of existing financial infrastructure, and it’s a system for participants anywhere in the world to voluntarily help run and profit from their value\-add participation. In short, this is the Holy Grail of the decentralization\-via\-blockchain movement. This is the liberation of money.

The original vision of bringing cryptocurrency to the masses was too simplistic. OmiseGO isn’t about convincing people to adopt new or better \(crypto\) currencies.

dzt3c0o,makriath,57,"Simple answer:

Decentralization refers to the operation and validation of the network.

OP appears to be conflating this with wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.

-------------------------

Lengthier answer:

Decentralization ensures that there is no single point of failure for the network, and no authority can censor transactions, halt the network, etc.

The uneven distribution of wealth is an entirely separate issue.  That is not to say it's not a concern, but it has nothing to do with decentralization in the sense we usually speak about here.

Also, the statistic quoted in the OP isn't as damning as it might seem at first bluff.  This is because the division of wallets aren't necessarily representative of the division of users in the network.

To begin with, there are a TON of unused wallets, that would count toward the bottom 96.81% of wallets by BTC holdings.  This will include wallets that have acquired dust and are still in use from a technical perspective, but de facto aren't.  This will further skew this metric.

Also, as has been pointed out elsewhere, a lot of users keep their funds on exchanges (even though they shouldn't) so that will appear to be a single entity holding Bitcoin, when in reality, it is hundreds or thousands of different people.

Now, it's entirely possible that the situation is even worse than the statistic indicates, if less than 3% of the users are in possession of the 3.19% of wallet owning most.  There isn't, however, any evidence to support this, and seems extremely unlikely to me.

For a last point, unequal distribution is almost certainly going to decrease over time to reflect the wider economy as time goes on.

dzt23dl,sarysa,55,"To be fair, wealth distribution has absolutely nothing to do with centralization as it is generally defined. Bitcoin has no Federal Reserve and no one can add coins out of established parameters. The fact that, say, Satoshi could dump his stash all at once and crash the market is moot.

That said, it's pretty much dependent on exchanges to be viable at all given technical concerns. So it's really more of a ""meet the new boss"" situation, as ultimately it would be impractical for more than a couple of these exchanges to exist to serve their purpose. In fact, I'd predict that one will become the Facebook of exchanges, because most people in general want the convenience of virtual trades.

dztkrok,A_Year_Of_Storms,46,"You're in the right place. We like honest questions.

Hate is a strong word. I dislike it. I'll list the reasons.

**Its fans.** Oh man, this shit is like Rick and Morty: a fanbase that makes you want to take an electric drill and jam it into your eyeball rather than be involved with them. Bitcoiners falls into two categories: **mad cultists** and **libertarians.** 

**The mad cultists** are mostly just insane. They will not listen to any criticism of bitcoin. They will not take any flaw seriously. Anytime problem with bitcoin as a currency? ""Its the tech, bruh."" Any problem with blockchain? ""You just don't understand the tech bruh"". Its infuriating, particularly because no one has yet been able to give me a legitimate use case for an actual decentralized blockchain (as opposed to internal, centralized blockchains).

**Libertarians** are the worst. If you're not familiar with libertarian philosophy, [In the most general sense, libertarianism is a political philosophy that affirms the rights of individuals to liberty, to acquire, keep, and exchange their holdings, and considers the protection of individual rights the primary role for the state.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/) But more specifically, libertarians (particularly of the bitcoin variety, usually ancaps)  believe that taxation is a form of theft, that industry should be unregulated by government, that all regulation should be only what the market does. The poor, etc, are not entitled to any care from the state. Roads, buses, everything would be better if it was private. All around, its just terrible. Bitcoiner libertarians will rail on and on about how terrible banks are, 'destroy the fed,' how an inflationary currency is worse than genocide. However, if you pay careful attention, what almost always emerges is that what they REALLY want is to get rich, to not have to work. Its damn infuriating.

Bitcoin 'investors' also show an extraordinary level of hypocrisy: they claim they want a totally 'unregulated' market place (regulations by government, after all, are terrible for some reason), but the minute something goes wrong, they will advise you to contact your bank, charge back your funds, etc. They rely on the government regulations that they routinely deride, as soon as those regulations are in their favor. It shows you time and again that what they're really trying to do is just get rich.

Furthermore, they are smug about it. Bitcoin is the most arcane and technically opaque system of payment transfer I have ever seen. It is extremely difficult to use and requires a ton of research. If you make one mistake, they will blame you for your loss of money; they will literally blame you when someone steals from you, because you didn't prevent by being tech savvy enough  to anticipate all the ways in which you could be swindled. I'm not a tech person. I rely on other people in the tech field to make things accessible and easy for me to use, while I fulfill other functions. If I were to use bitcoin for even a small transaction, because it is so complicated, I would undoubtedly lose my money and (because there are no regulations) no one would help me and everyone would shrug and say 'sfyl'. Yet they act like this is the future, like people should actually be using it? Come on!

That brings me to the scams. Scams, and scams, and scams every single day! All you see is people being taken to the cleaners, robbed, constant pump and dump groups. And if you hang out on r/bitcoin, you will find people openly talking about the pump and dump groups, about how they know the market is manipulated to hell (by wealthy people, particularly those who control the exchanges). Their goal is just to time their buys right so that they can make money off the manipulation (or to 'hodl' through). Yet people lose money all the time, they get taken advantage of all the time, and no one is held accountable because 'free market, bruh'. And in the same breath, turn around and say this should be mainstream? This grossly manipulated, scam-infested market is fit for mainstream adoption? Are you kidding me? I hate scammers. I hate people who take advantage of others, and that's the whole bitcoin community.

I'm not a veteran, and far from an expert but I think I've come now to a pretty good understanding of the situation we're facing and what to expect in this market (I'm speaking of BTC which impacts everything).

Basically, since the crash from 20 to 6k there is no new money flowing in. Normies are disgusted and won't come back until they see +600% in 2 months and it makes the headlines.

So the movements we see are mostly traders moving the price by opening longs, shorts, with or without leverage, but with the intention to secure a profit quickly in a very insecure market.

As such, the overhead to move up is absolutely insane because as soon as btc moves +400$ we have underwater longs closing at a loss or breakeven, shorts opening, and simple lower buys getting sold. 

The barts we see everywhere are not really manipulation as many think, it's just leveraged trading doing its work (profit taking + rekts).

So when you see a big green candle like we just had, there is nothing to write home about because it's shorts closing on a support + bottom shorters getting liquidated + longs opening. No, my grandma is not suddenly buying bitcoin like in December at 15k, and probably won't until 2019/2020 at 32k.

I read everyday very misinformed people who think evil bears are suppressing the price with their shorts but it's the most bullshit argument ever, they are simply following the trend. From a psychological point of view, this people refuse to be wrong with their ""investment"" that can only grow (if they want btc, everyone should) and blame an external, evil entity for breaking the parabola (say Wall Street).

Now think about it, did wall Street crash eos at 23$, or is it just collective greed gone wrong? Nothing can do x48 in a few months and keep going. It's extremely resilient actually to be still at 12$.

I advise against gauging the price in % down from ath. The ath is an anomaly and not a reference if it's a parabola. Rather look how much 1 btc cost 1 year ago. Think out of the crowd and that might give you a good entry (no, it won't go to 0).

Now how to survive this : it is clear that bitcoin must ""die"" and all the longs get liquidated, weak hands must sell at a loss etc. to start fresh. Do not get carried out, bitcoin won't die if it goes to 4 or 3k. The goal of smart money is to make people think it will never, ever see a new ath and have you release your coins for cheap, in a long period of boring, extremely low volatility. That's where you BUY. Not V bottoms, or only to sell higher.

Hedging your cold storage would be a great idea tho.

If you want to trade this, buy the supports if you want but sell when it tops out. Because the downtrend is not over. And short the tops (made a post how to spot them if you scroll lower), and hold your shorts through bounces, because it will turn in much less profit to hesitate and overtrade in the end than just patiently wait for the price to plummet (still no new money, no sudden bullrun out of nowhere. It simply won't happen).

If this market really crashes (is that a if?) We might see incredible opportunities to make money on long term shorts. Litecoin, I'm watching you. If 100$ breaks this thing will basically go to 0 as all hope is crushed forever and a new wave of disgusted sellers appear (community is ripe for capitulation).

Good luck.",2018-05-30 03:16:40

dztgiry,skythe4,40,"&gt;We also would like people to understand the historicity of this project. It’s the quest for free (libre, not gratis) and fair money. An earlier incarnation of this quest was Bitcoin. Another one before that was Paypal (the really early idea). But the OMG network is different. It’s not just a new currency or even a new payment network. It’s a worldwide financial system that can very easily integrate and be inclusive of existing financial infrastructure, and it’s a system for participants anywhere in the world to voluntarily help run and profit from their value-add participation. In short, this is the Holy Grail of the decentralization-via-blockchain movement. This is the liberation of money.

This is why I'm here.

dztj56w,expatMT,38,"&gt; **No one is backing it**
&gt;
&gt; Bitcoin it is not issued by a central public authority. When you hold a €10 note, for example, the ECB guarantees your right to pay with it anywhere in the euro area. No one ensures your right to use bitcoin or works to keep its value stable. 

Mathematics and the laws of physics does. Far more preferable than the laws of man, which are known to be selective.

&gt; **It is not a generally accepted form of payment**
&gt; If bitcoin were a currency, you could expect to be able to use it widely. But, in fact, there are very few places where you can pay with bitcoin. And where you can, transactions are slow and expensive. 

Fear, uncertainty and doubt. I'm happy with the growing number of places that accept bitcoin and use 0-conf with confidence. ECB sure looks scared.

&gt; **Users are not protected**
&gt;
&gt; It is possible for hackers to steal bitcoin. If this happens, you have no legal protection.

The ECB only guarantees up to 100,000EUR of depositors funds in EU banks. The remainder is available for banks to take. Therefore it is clear that EU banks are able to steal funds and, when this happens (as in Cyprus in 2013), you have no legal protection.

&gt; **It is too volatile**
&gt; 
&gt; A currency should be a reliable store of value **so that you can be sure that the money you have will buy more or less the same amount of things today as it will tomorrow or this time next year**. Bitcoin is not stable. Its value has both skyrocketed and tumbled dramatically all within the space of a few days.

Generally speaking, Bitcoin seems to outperform in this area. Certainly deflation beats the shit out of inflation.

&gt; **If it’s not a currency, what is it?**
&gt;
&gt; Bitcoin is a speculative asset. In other words, it is something that you can gamble on to make a profit, but with a risk that you will lose your investment.

Sounds more like the Euro. Must be shitting their pants on the Italy situation.

&gt; **Will the ECB ban bitcoin?**
&gt; 
&gt; It is not the ECB’s responsibility to ban or regulate bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. But, given the lack of consumer protection, it is important to exercise caution.

Lame, thinly veiled threat. You cannot take my bitcoin. You cannot make war with my bitcoin.

It's track record doesn't show that it can be some kind of reserve asset, it shows that it's a highly volatile, speculative tool used to make fiat. 2/3/4) What BCH has going for it over other Alts is the network effect. It has the name bitcoin in it, it's used by bitpay, it has a large community behind it pushing for adoption and not just hodling, and it is actually usable as a currency since it scaled. The average joe is not gonna question bitcoin cash bc they they are misinformed about when it originiated(they prob wouldn't bother to ask this question anyway or care) they just care if it's easy to use, fast, and cheap.
