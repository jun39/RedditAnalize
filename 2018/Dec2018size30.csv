eastnq4,windowtothesoul,554,"Crazy theory: PUBG attracted all the Bitcoin short-sellers

New theory: PUBG Corp uses all microtransaction revenue to buy BTC

Threw up some [stats](https://imgur.com/a/r8rpyNm) since someone asked. My other comment has variable descriptions.

Sources: Steam charts, Yahoo Finance

e: As pointed out, **labels should be ~~""thousands""~~ edited for PUBG to reflect the correct peak of 1.5 million (ie, multiply the shown numbers by 100 (long story..)) and just ""$"" for BTC**

e2: PUBG [data](https://steamcharts.com/app/578080). And November is closed! PUBG averaged 418,160 players (would show as 4,182 on the graph) and BTC averaged $5,357. This is a decrease of 10.9% for PUBG and 17.3% for BTC-- bringing the lines closer together and further supporting my theory of PUBG running on the Blockchain.

easjlhh,Whatsapokemon,163,"The proliferation of blockchains really confuses me.

Even with a computer science degree, I can't see _why_ blockchain would be preferable to a normal database in pretty much _any_ use case you could imagine. The (very limited) benefits it does provide are virtually never worth the costs associated with it.

I mean, for a decentralised currency it makes sense _I guess_, but for any other use case I've ever heard for it, it seems completely unnecessary.

I haven't exactly studied blockchains a lot, but why are people so excited about it? Is there a reason, or is it just dumb hype which is following the flash-in-the-pan success of Bitcoin?",2018-12-01 00:47:38

easty5z,Elstrelli,48,"&gt;Capital is essentially capitals, at war among themselves. It advances only through disintegration. If—not at all unreasonably—the basic vector of capital is identified with a tendency to social abandonment, what it abandons most originally is itself.[8] That is why the left finds itself so commonly locked in a fight to defend what capital is from what it threatens to become. Bitcoin tells us—more clearly than any other innovation—what it is becoming next, by escaping transcendent governance in principle.

&gt;[8] Marx is not blind to any of this, although he tends to complacently bracket it as a self-destructive contradiction. The Communist Manifesto is especially stark in this regard. Continuous auto-liquidation of the establishment is modernity’s installed regulative idea. Recent history has only confirmed the insight. Capital revolutionizes harder, deeper, and faster than “the Revolution”. Its lack of attachment to itself exceeds anything the left has been able to consistently match. Capital’s scandalous immortality is derived solely from its inventiveness in ways to kill itself. There is no serious way in which it could die that is not more intensely effectuated as a functional innovation within itself.  Revolutionary capital proceeds through disintermediation. It bypasses what it marks for extinction.

This is some dank badphil to be honest. Capitalism killing it's old modes of production and making new ones faster than the left can criticize and destroy it is actually a pretty interesting take. Of course, the writer also believes that cryptocurrency is the new wave of 'revolutionary' capitalism. His faith is almost heartbreaking.

Also, love the furries in the diagram. I don't know why they're there, but they're amazing.",2018-12-01 02:54:35

eatfyk8,omise_go,47,"The main distinction here is that with the Cosmos spoon there were a lot of external dependencies, in terms of actual implementation as well what information was available to us and the way things were communicated. We made the announcement based on the information we had at the time; factors outside our jurisdiction obviously changed between then and now, but until very recently we really did believe that the spoon was going forward and were doing everything we could to facilitate that.

There would have been one possible path forward for us to keep to the storyline that started in April, which admittedly would have saved us some face: when the third party steward pulled out and Cosmos made the decision to focus solely on generalized DEX software, we could have taken on the project of building the new DEX ourselves. But that felt like an irresponsible move right now, with our own plasma DEX on Ethereum still very much under construction, and our top priority was to stay on track with our core objectives.

To address your specific items of concern, if this post isn't long enough yet, here's a recap on the state of each of those items: 

* **DEX (Practical implementation, atomic swaps, etc.)**: we have a clear path forward on this, and have published [details](https://blog.omisego.network/omg-dex-update-6245812a7b2d) of our design, including an honest assessment of the tradeoffs we're making in the first iteration. 
* **Network Volume as Omise is a real business**: As we’ve stated before, we’ll encourage and support existing Omise customers to integrate OMG but we can’t force it upon them. It will be a gradual process - the more functionality we build into the network, the more incentive merchants will have to make the switch. That said, OMG's success is not specifically dependent on Omise's payments volume - we're also doing business development specific to OMG and OmiseGO. 
* **PoS**: this was addressed in the recent [State of the Ecosystem](https://blog.omisego.network/state-of-the-omg-ecosystem-75260c71a053) post: ""Similar to how the DEX design couldn’t really be finalized until the Plasma chain was in a pretty advanced state, it doesn’t make sense to finalize the PoS design until the DEX design has been built out to some extent. Although we have a general framework, there isn’t much to report in the meantime because that framework doesn’t really get defined in a granular way until the time comes to put it into action."" The most immediate challenge with PoS is burdensome hardware and network requirements for stakers looking to run their own validator nodes on early iterations. This is something we’re looking into more deeply now so that we can put out more detailed guidance as we get closer to the PoS phase.
* **Very high TPS (25k, 50k, 100k and higher)**: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/omise_go/comments/8ys9t9/omg_network_from_100tps_to_1_million_tps/e2dh8jw) by Kelvin addresses tps roadblocks and is worth a full reread, with the caveat that it's from a few months back and a lot of research progress has been made since then. The gist of it is that we're focusing first on having a really solid, secure base layer capable of handling enough transactions to get the job done, and then will build in more complex functionality that will allow us to raise or eliminate the tps ceiling.
* **Multiple child chains**: It's been a while since we talked about nested chains specifically, although it does tie in with the [EVM-on-Plasma](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/why-is-evm-on-plasma-hard-bf2d99c48df7) conundrum. It seemed due for a revisit so Kelvin just published a [blog](https://medium.com/@kelvinfichter/ee9d66d33536) with a more thorough analysis. The bad news is that nested chains are more complicated than the plasma white paper implied; the good news is that it looks more and more likely that they won’t be needed. Advancements in Plasma Cash research in particular have increased the scaling potential of a single-chain construction by reducing the computational load per transaction. That research needs to be substantiated but it’s definitely a promising path right now.   
As an aside: nested chains was the idea from the plasma white paper that was probably the least befuddling to the average human brain (and the one that best lent itself to visual representation), so it’s stuck in a lot of people’s minds as the defining characteristic of plasma. We’d argue the most essential feature of plasma is actually the exit game, which allows the plasma chain to maintain the security properties of Ethereum while processing transactions much more efficiently. Nested chains were just a proposal for how to cram in even more transactions, so if they go out the window in favor of a different scaling solution that is as effective or more, then it’s not much of a loss. 
* **Cross blockchain support**: on a cautious note, we’re taking this one step at a time - as specified in our post about publication of the [OMG Network repo](https://blog.omisego.network/omg-network-repo-is-now-open-source-5d4376a6c4ef), ""Tesuji Plasma is built for cheaper, faster transactions without sacrificing safety, with native support for ETH (as opposed to [Wrapped Ether](https://weth.io/)) and ERC20 tokens."" That said cross chain support is actually pretty straightforward in the case of blockchains that can run on EVM, i.e. most chains other than Bitcoin, by using the core Ethereum chain to mint ERC20s representing tokens from other chains and depositing them into the plasma chain. As far as Bitcoin goes, the recent [Wrapped BTC](https://medium.com/republicprotocol/wrapped-bitcoin-wbtc-a-bitcoin-token-community-project-started-by-bitgo-kyber-and-republic-599c9abc8139) effort is a step in the right direction although at this point it requires federated custodianship (via a DAO, which we will participate in along with a number of other projects), which will suffice for users but is obviously a less-than-perfect solution in terms of full decentralization.

Multiple child chains (or their replacement), cross-chain support and very high tps without sacrificing security are all great examples of the kind of generalized plasma development that Kelvin in particular has been working on. Our dev team is building the infrastructure needed for our own implementation; but the ability to deploy EVM to run smart contracts on plasma, continue to increase potential tps, and support cross-chain transactions more efficiently are of pretty universal interest. At this point these are not implementation challenges specific to one project but rather research problems better solved by having as many eyes on them as possible; so our best strategy is actually to support (and contribute to) the community-wide efforts to solve these problems. 

The reason that the limitations of our implementation in its current form are known is that we've been up front about what the problems we still need to solve; we share what we know about challenges. Anyone who has read posts written by Kelvin or David, or follows Kelvin on Twitter, or read the recent Coindesk article, knows that both of them have always been exceptionally candid about the state of plasma research and development. 

We can't say with certainty that we'll never encounter an insurmountable obstacle. But the roadblock with the spoon wasn’t technical challenges, it was a breakdown of cooperation and communication. Unlike efforts that rely on collaboration with specific external actors, we have full visibility into our own in-house development and, for as long as OmiseGO remain its primary architects, we are the ones making decisions about its direction. To whatever extent development of OMG Network becomes a more distributed effort (something we would love to see more of), OmiseGO will always have agency to continue development regardless of anyone else’s participation.

Finally, can you expand on what you mean by difficulties with plasma research? If you're referring to the Coindesk article, we've already clarified that the statements from Kelvin and David were mischaracterized. They were referring to the need for industry-wide standards around the plasma framework (an effort we wholeheartedly support) rather than roadblocks in the specific plasma implementation being worked on by OmiseGO. If you’re talking about something else that isn’t covered above, we’ll be happy to address it.",2018-12-01 07:29:22

&gt;8/ Deluded people who use ridiculous and laughable terms like “post-capitalism” don’t know what they’re talking about. Capitalism is only just beginning. This is the first reemergence of truly ‘free markets’ since pre-Babylonian, primitive times.

eaye91u,lucidPrelusion,535,"It boggles my mind when cryptos that are clearly for the people such as iota get hurled abuse when coins like ripple are praised. Any coin where the owners have more than 10% of the supply should be closely examined and vetted as to why. Moving a couple decades from now where some cryptos will be valued in trillions not billions, we really need to ask who we are giving this power to. 

The gensis of bitcoin was to circumvent the banking system. Coins like ripple are wolves dressed in sheepskin. Its insanity we are investing in what is essentially bank coin. Now I've picked out ripple here because it's the easiest example. I'm a firm supporter of coins that give back the power to the people such as iota. When qubic is up and running it's the people who will benefit. 

Imagine having decentralized community platforms like YouTube, spotify, Netflix and steam where the services are run by qubic nodeholders.  Platforms will be paying via micro transactions to content creators for every single song, video, and game that is played. Removing greedy service providers cuts. It will be the most economical method because qubic providers will be incentivized to keep costs down to remain competitive. This is undoubtedly the direction we need to move to make the world a more prosperous place.

Look around the world, depression rates are growing by the day and we cant quite pin why. Corporations are selling us out left right and center. Facebook is selling our consumer profiles, YouTube is taking hefty advertising profits, spotify is taking artists cuts and selectively promoting artists, uber is monopolizing the transport industry killing off competitors, Instagram has become a platform to push beauty standards and products. 
These platforms are responsible for shaping the minds of today's youth. Technology like iota has the power to break up these platform giants and create more morally sound platforms by removing the need for third parties to make money on them.

With so much mud in the water surrounding the crypto sphere when it comes to bickering and he said she said debates, it's time we start burying hatchets and look to the bigger future. We cant build  better future if we are fighting each other for it. Start supporting community driven projects that are in it for the people. Eth, neo, iota ect. 

Please don't give your money to greedy and questionably aligned projects. Think about what projects are trying to do, dont get so caught up in the tech details. Technology can always improve and adapt, not so easy to change personalities and mantras aligned with greed and selfishness.

A) we have prospecting, surveying and sub surface scanning B) Bitcoin mining is more/less set up as a probability program and always intended to be so.

eb23usl,throwawayLouisa,61,"Here's what's dodgy about this exchange, and why anyone who remembers BitGrail should be very afraid:

 *  The domain NanoTrade.co.uk was registered only two days (one working day) before the site went live - meaning it only could have been tested very briefly
 *  The domain was registered by NameCheap, with an obscured registrant
 *  The site was not pre-announced on /r/Nano Currency nor /r/NanoTrade
* The site was announced first on /r/nanotrade (6k subscribers), but only here on /r/nanocurrency (44k subscribers)  three days later, demonstrating a lack of knowledge of Nano relative subscribers
 *  The announcer claimed Facebook Ads existed prelaunch - but no one of you here saw them because you would have excitedly told us if you had
 *  No such advertising for the site was noted by me, yet I would have been a key target for it
 *  Since the domain was not registered, such advertising could not have included, say, a register@nanotrade.co.uk mail form, which is incompetent in itself
 *  The Nano Associates Limited company address is registered to a London mail forwarding company
 *  Its only Director Orlando Carugo has no Google history of being associated with Nano, Cryptocurrency, or finance at all
 *  Its director's profession is listed as Sales Director
 *  The Google and LinkedIn history of a Orlando Carugo, sales professional can be found, with no reference to cryptocurrency but with references to being willing to work for stock options or commission
 *  The announcement on /r/NanoTrade was made by a /u/Paradise2GE account with a few questions on Bitcoin two years ago, a single comment one year ago, then absolutely nothing until this weekend.
 *  We know nothing of the reputation of the owners
 *  The company uses a payment processor https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/VirWoX which has a daily limit on PayPal withdrawals of 2500EUR. The NanoTrade website however states that up to 90,000 Nano can be sold per PayPal transaction. It seems impossible to reconcile this for me. If 90,000 Nano is sold to PayPal, when would the seller get their money?
 *  If the answer is that such payments cannot be made, when were the company planning to tell the sellers?
 *  On being asked on /r/Nanotrade, the company has avoided answering this question in their dissembling answers
 *  The company is not registered by the FCA
 *  The company is not registered by HMRC as a money service
 *  It is a legal requirement for UK based companies to register as money services.  
* It is not a get-out to just deal in USD and not GDP, yet /u/Patadise2GE has attempted to use that get-out in their answers  
 *  /u/Paradise2GE has dissembled when answering questions as to why Nano Associates is not registered with FCA or HMRC
* /u/Paradise2GE claimed 1000 trades on their first day... for an unannounced site...purely from a posting that had around 40 up votes at the time.  It's a lie. Not even Nanex gets that many trades on a good day.
* Given a supposed 1000 trades in a day, 1440 minutes in a day, and 25% of Nano staked on Binance, we should expect to see &gt;5Nano transactions coming out of the Binance hot wallet at least every 10 minutes or so. I don't see those
* The site works poorly on Android, showing a lack of technical skill in its developers
* /u/SMcArthurs account is one year old, with few postings, and no history in the /r/nanocurrency or /r/nanotrade subs  
* Someone downvoted my reasonable questions on /r/nanotrade. I can think of only one person who would want to do that, if malicious
* Someone downvoted someone thanking me for my questions on /r/nanotrade. I can think of only one person who would want to do that, if malicious

eb07kln,kmeisthax,42,"The Bitcoin network assigns difficulty every two weeks' worth of blocks. That is, if there's a sudden reduction of mining capacity then there won't be enough hardware to compute the 2016 blocks necessary to reduce the difficulty target. Furthermore, the target is only allowed to go up or down, at maximum, by a factor of four. So you could have a situation where a large number of miners exit all at once and it suddenly takes 4-6 weeks for Bitcoin to become usable again. And that retarget that eventually does come might not be enough to bring block times back into the 10 minutes per block design parameter. If that happens, there will be further pressure to pull out of Bitcoin, which reduces the value of the coin, which pushes more miners out of the system, which pushes the next retarget further out and so on.

(Furthermore there is a limit to how low the difficulty can be, though I am pretty sure if we ever hit that point Bitcoin is already worthless.)

There has been attempts in other coins to change difficulty adjustment to something more flexible, but it comes at the cost of security. Bitcoin Cash launched with a hastily-conceived emergency adjustment algorithm that was easily manipulated by miners strategically delaying blocks until an emergency retarget happened, and then mining the shit out of a now-easy coin. This pushed out BCH's inflation schedule and made a bunch of miners rich.

The core problem is that the difficulty adjustment is used to calibrate Bitcoin's sense of time. Blocks too fast? Difficulty up. Blocks too slow? Difficulty down. But we also use that block-count time to determine when we actually change difficulty. Periods of fast mining run the Bitcoin clock faster, so the retarget will come quicker. Periods of slow mining run the Bitcoin clock slower, so the retarget will come later.",2018-12-04 01:03:01

While there's all the obvious things - spending more time working out/staying in shape, knowing enough to choose better jobs or careers, figuring out some things that I messed up, invest in BitCoin, the usual stuff... I think that by the time I'd be old enough to do anything, I'd have gone absolutely insane.

Don't forget that you're now the mind of a full grown adult in the body of a ten year old. That means all the things you're used to being able to just... do, you can't. Either legally, logistically, or physically. Want to go somewhere? Can't unless your parents drive you. Want to watch that movie? Get mom's permission first! Hungry? Better wait for dinner! Hop on the internet? Even if you have it (which you might not!) get ready for kid blockers on most ISPs for a long time.

You're also going to become entirely isolated from your peer group. Again, you're a full grown adult that now has to relive years of elementary and middle school among kids. Yeah, it's cool you're smart enough to blaze through the school work, but you still have to have social interactions in a way that would be stimulating or interesting. It's going to be *years* before you can have discussions, debates, or even just conversations on the level you're used to having. You can't talk about your favorite media if it hasn't been made yet, your favorite book if it hasn't been written, your biggest interest if the research hasn't been done yet.

And then let's not get into the crushing burdens of future knowledge. I was 10 years old in 1999. That's two years to prevent September 11th! Only... how do I do it? I'm gonna be 10, then 12 years old. How exactly am I supposed to convince a pre-9/11 world that something like 9/11 could happen. How do you do that without people or your parents being convinced you're just nuts? How do you try to report or warn of something like that without getting in trouble? And then you have to just wait... just wait for it to happen. You *know* it's going to happen. You *know* it's going to change the world

And you can't. Do. Anything.

Add onto that all the little things like that. Family members fighting with each other, breaking up, dying from illness or accidents, all things that you'd have no way as a kid or even teenager to influence or impact. No matter what you do, that blood clot or stroke or tumor is still going to be there in that loved one. And while there's a certain joy to getting to spend more time with them, you still have to watch them die again.

And then what if you're married now, or have kids? How long is it until you meet your spouse? How many relationships did you have before then? How many did *they* have? How long did you know each other before you'd actually started going out? Imagine seeing someone, someone you *know* you're meant to be with, someone you love with all your heart, but not only are they possibly far too young to really understand what you're expressing, but you're going into a relationship fully formed with all the knowledge and experience with them, and they might not even know you. 

My wife and I were friends for almost a decade before we started dating - that would be a decade of seeing her going through other relationships or being with other people until the time was right. And if you try to change that, to get together sooner, how do you not come off like a total creep? You know all their little secrets, their likes and dislikes, things you don't even register consciously about them that you know or account for. Imagine a total stranger coming up to you and interacting like they've known you for ages, and you've never even met them before. How freaked out would you be?

And what if you have kids? Assuming you actually manage to get with the same person you were originally with, will your kid in the new timeline be the same one? What if you had a son and suddenly a daughter, or even something where your child acted or looked a certain way, but a different sperm and egg connected because of your new life and they're entirely different? How do you handle that?

So you've got to deal with a sudden and total lack of independence, down to things like when you go to sleep, no relatable peer groups or interactions, foreknowledge of events that you'll be utterly helpless to actually influence, and the constant worry about relationships or entire people that might not even properly exist yet... it would drive you mad. It would be hell. And there'd be no one you could talk to about it that would believe it was true.

At best, you're that weird kid who thinks he's from the future and everyone just kinda looks at you weird. At worst, you're put on medication or therapy that will slowly break your mind and convince you the whole other life you had was just your imagination, erasing your entire reason to relive your life and fix things - after all, it was just a delusion, and thanks to your meds you can't even really remember that much about it anyway.

While I'm sure there are people who are in positions where it would be a blessing to go back... I'm definitely not one of them. And I think realistically most people wouldn't be either, if you really think about it.",2018-12-05 19:41:02

I'm 10.

I become the most depressed and intelligent tween in the history of the world, due to the abrupt loss of my wife and children. My parents don't understand what's happening, and I don't tell them, because it sounds absolutely crazy. I am not taken to a psychiatrist for years because we don't have insurance and can't afford it out of pocket.

I have behavioral problems at school. No one can deny my seemingly preternatural intelligence, but I'm so bored by the required work that, instead of doing what's assigned, I make up and solve my own calculus problems. I write code in programming languages that don't exist yet. I do not have access to a computer, and frequently demand access to a computer. My grades tank, I'm often sent to the principal's office for disrupting class. But, this is America, so I graduate grade after grade after grade. My fourth grade teacher recognizes how much I already know, and feeds me high school textbooks. It's a good year. The next year returns to normal, and crushes me.

In 8th grade, my mom's insurance coverage shifts, and psychiatric issues are finally covered. I go to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been living retrograde for about four years. The sharp edges of grief have somewhat dulled, but the boredom of an adult living as a child has not. I extract a promise from the psychiatrist. A promise not to tell my parents, or my teachers, or the police, FBI, or anyone what I'm about to tell him. He agrees.

I tell him I've been transplanted back into my own life from 2018, that I should be 35 with a wife and kids, and I've been dealing with this alone since I was 10. He doesn't believe me. I write him some computer code in versions of languages that don't exist yet. I write calculus problems and polar equations that I shouldn't understand. He thinks I'm a prodigy, but crazy.

I tell him George W. Bush will win the Presidential election. He thinks I'm guessing. I'm shouting now. I scream at him about 9/11, one year away. He's no longer laughing. I've made a mistake. He thinks I'm dangerous. He thinks I am planning 9/11. I try to backpedal, to say that it's Al Qaeda. He asks me if Al Qaeda speaks to me. I know I've lost him.

They put me on anti-psychotics. It kills my mood, stunts my mind, ruins my enthusiasm for everything. I'm no longer ""depressed"" or ""acting out"", so the treatment is hailed as a success. I get regular checkups from the psychiatrist.

9/11 happens. I'm dragged into a meeting with my parents, the psychiatrist, a police officer, and two men in suits. My parents don't understand what's happening. They try and get me to talk, but I refuse. They have all internet traffic from my house, some of which is embarrassing, but none of which is incriminating. I demand to be taken off the drugs and allowed to return to baseline. They agree. I am under house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I can go to school and home. I don't care; I never made friends, even my old friends from my past life were too juvenile.

A month later, a repeat of the meeting. How did I know about 9/11? I ask for a lawyer. They deny me one. I shrug and stop speaking. They get me a lawyer.

I tell my lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. She doesn't believe me. But says she'll work on my behalf as if she did. I agree.

We tell them nothing. The house arrest is a violation of my rights, and the Patriot Act doesn't exist yet (barely) for them to be able to hold me on suspicion of anything. My lawyer threatens to go public. They back off.

My freshman year grades are terrible. I realize I need my grades up if I want to go to the right college to find my wife, so I double down on my school work. I go from a D average screw off to acing every class. My teachers are confused, but relieved.

It's senior year. I apply to only one college. My parents think I'm crazy. I get in. I apply to the Honors Program. The Honors Program, where I met my wife over 20 years ago on my personal timeline, where I'd live in the same dorm building as her, and work late on the same engineering team as her, the time when our relationship began.

I don't get in. My grades are too low, after tanking my freshman year. I'm going to the right college, but I can't replicate the circumstances of our meeting.

There's hope, but it's a slim hope. I go to college. I know what clubs she goes to, what friends she has. I contrive to be wherever she is. I spend months in her orbit, working up to asking her out. How do you ask out someone you were with for 13 years, then lost 8 years ago, who doesn't remember you at all? How do you approach her with the baggage of your entire relationship that she has no knowledge of?

Eventually I do it. I ask her out. She says no. I don't understand. My entire world is crashing down around me. She is my wife, doesn't she understand? I go crazy, it scares her and she runs away. I try to follow her, but she hits a campus safety panic button.

With my history of ""mental illness"", I'm involuntarily committed. I spend a month in the asylum.

Two men in suits ""visit"" me one day. They say they can get me out. But, I have to tell them about 9/11. It's the FBI agents from all those years ago. I've given up. I tell them everything. They get me out. I'm setup with a nice house in the middle of nowhere, a good computer, state of the art internet. And I have to keep feeding them information about the future.

In my free time, I'm a software engineering consultant. The FBI pays my expenses, so anything I make is spare money. January 2, 2009 I've built a GPU beast of a computer. January 3, 2009 I start mining BitCoin. I mine a lot. I mine far more than anyone expected someone could mine so early. The BitCoin economy never takes off, because no one else can get in on the early mining with normal computing hardware. ""Cryptocurrency"" fails before it can even get a start.

Two years later the FBI approaches me, looking for more information about the future. I've got nothing left; I've told them everything I can remember.

They kick me out, and repossess all the computers they bought me, and ""appropriate as evidence"" all the ones I bought myself.

I've got nothing left. I wander the streets of small towns, hitchhiking half-hazardly. I lay down on a park bench one night.

The next morning, I don't get up.

So that's a hard ""_No._""",2018-12-05 22:01:27

Edit: I'd just like to thank everyone for the outpouring of support and especially the generous strangers who gave me Reddit Silver and Reddit Gold! I've been transcribing for a while, and this is the first time getting any Reddit coin, let alone two. I'm so glad this hobby of mine has been deemed deserving of this response on a completely different magnitude than anything I deserved or expected. I still can't believe my few hours of work turned into this.

Also I noticed that [this markdown share](https://markdownshare.com/view/6913111e-6795-4c3f-972d-4fc63f8f582e) is a little more readable on mobile.

A smart investor looks at the price of USD and notices that the price has gone *down* due to government theft via inflation.  Ergo, post hoc propter hoc, they dump their hyper inflated petro dollars and go all in on Bitcoin--which is an excellent store of value.

Just because you fuckwitted shills here cannot see Satoshi's Vision, doesn't mean it is some fairy tail.  Just because we are going through a small Renaltö-Corlez price dip doesn't mean the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is worth any less.  In fact, it means it is worth more due to latent demand in the 8hr fibonacci band.  The price might go down a bit more due to wall street betting big on bitcoin, or it could break the resistance ceiling and shoot up to a new ATH of at least a conservative million per BTC.  The next week will be critical for Bitcoin.

Well there's an alternative.  

Donate the difference you would be willing to pay (as you correctly pointed out, even a small amount can make a huge difference to the worker, because worldwide economic inequality is so bad) directly to the people in poverty, where you want it to go to.  

You can use methods of direct cash transfer like Bitcoin or well managed (this of course, requires a bit of research itself) [charities](https://www.givedirectly.org/) which connect with and seek out people living in the most extreme poverty, that might bypass some of the middlemen more.

This was before major companies even paid any kind of attention to BTC too, and when I'd see people speculating that US government itself could make BTC illegal because of all the Silk Road shit. That was the most depressing time I've ever been through with Bitcoin. 

Does nobody realize the strides Bitcoin has made (and I'm not even talking about price)? If you would have told me back when I first bought that I'd be seeing my stock broker talking about Bitcoin one day, I would have gone six to midnight. It's amazing how accepting and interested many of the large players are, how many of them have changed their attitude towards Bitcoin. 

BINANCE SURPASSED DEUTSCHE BANK IN REVENUE. Of course they are interested. 

The market is what it is. We could still go down more from here, there's been no convincing bounce or support to say otherwise yet. But by the time it finds bottom, there's going to be more professional money involved, and therefore less volatility- they aren't reckless. When smart money is trading against smart money, the panic and euphoria are less and less extreme than when it is a bunch of retail idiots and computer nerds controlling a large portion of the market.

Every bull/bear cycle the smart players will accumulate a higher % of the market and therefore the highs and the lows will get less and less extreme until the market is pretty boring and stable.

ebck6se,JBlitzen,57,"The GITS franchise is a rare instance of the “postcyberpunk” subgenre, which focuses not on weird dystopian or apocalyptic futures but on a realistic quasi-utopian future where technology and communications advances fundamentally alter the human experience.

GITS uses a police procedural structure to explore those intersections of society and technology.  Individual and network.  Human and machine.  Mind and prosthesis.  Ghost and shell.

The second episode of SAC begins as a bunch of cyborgs chasing a runaway AI tank, but by the end of that episode it had touched on religion, familial duty, biotechnology, love, grief, regret, and a small host of other subjects.

SAC itself is “Stand Alone Complex”, a posited psychosocial phenomenon in which a vanishing mediator may unknowingly manipulate a network to plant an Inception-like thought which grows into a mass social movement of copycats with no actual original.

At this point we take that reality for granted, with memes, with the arab spring revolts, with wikileaks, with anonymous, with bitcoin, etc.

In many ways those phenomenon are best understood as subconscious thought processes within a larger technologically assisted gestalt, whose original individual synaptic triggers have been long forgotten if they ever even existed.

But GITS saw the coming impact of those kinds of things back in 2001 and earlier, and went even deeper.

It’s difficult to describe GITS because there are really very few movies or series like it that explore that terrain so eloquently.  And it does it alongside deep and intense personal stories with world class action sequences and perfect music and everything else.

If you really want to understand the next 30 years of society, go back and watch the last 30 years of GITS.

(You mention Asimov, which is interesting because if I had to pick one other media entry as being close to GITS in any way, I would probably pick the 2004 “I, Robot” movie.  It shares GITS’s interest in exploring a plausible quasi-utopian future of advanced technology and the accompanying changes to society, along with more than a little philosophy.  The trolley problem, “Can a robot... turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?”  “Can you?”, etc.  It’s more popcorn than GITS but it’s in the same ballpark.)",2018-12-08 19:27:59
ebas0qn,CamBattleysDick,55,"The blind optimism in this subreddit is dangerous and reminds me of /r/bitcoin on the way down from the 1200 bubble and again the recent one. This is no different than those users spamming [this](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/elementus-assets/stages_bubble.png) chart and saying to the moon. Fundamentals and market sentiment are very relevant here and it seems like this subreddit is ignoring all of that. The amount of people posting that they are trading options and buying this stocks on margin while ignoring the underlying fundamentals of this market and just saying, WEED TO THE MOON 500000KG * $5 A GRAM MOON is frightening. You all need to do DD past this echo chamber because this sector, even at these prices, still has massive risks involved. Good luck to all.

Edit: Before just downvoting, consider reading this quick post I made earlier today:
&gt; This rally could continue for a few more days no problem, but there is way too much looming over the sector.

&gt;The rollout of legalization was a catastrophic disaster in the two major markets(BC, ON) with no retail outlets in Ontario and few in BC while the grey market continues to thrive. It's likely that the government failed to capture even half of the black market in these provinces. Other than that international markets, despite what people think, barely exist other than Germany. Even in Germany, Canopy only managed to sell 600KG in the first half of this year. That's nothing. Australia last time I checked was consuming less than 50KG per year, and even then Canada has no place exporting a crop to Australia. The U.S markets are being taken over by companies listed on the CSE since TSX/Nasdaq/NYSE listed corps cannot participate. There is also arguably massive overvaluation plaguing the sector as most investors here are retail holders and institutions hold less than 1% of many of these stocks, APH is almost untouched by institutions. If Cannabis and its underlying derivatives(THC, CBD isolate/distillate, extracted terpenes, all key pharmaceutical) ingredients continue to be commoditized the companies that fail to capture significant market share based on branding or have large pharma plays will fall to valuations similar to their crop growing and farming counterparts. Margins will also get squeezed very hard soon as large expansions come online and we go very quickly from a shortage to an oversupply, which is not good for anyone but the consumer.

&gt;I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but I hope this helps some understand why the sector continues to get beaten down. There is clearly a significant risk mostly because of overvaluation and a huge surplus being created by the lack of distribution channels in to the U.S and slow growing international demand. Even once international demand comes online, why grow in Canada when you can grow in Australia? Way better growing environment, cost will be lower. Many of these corps are glorified tomato growers. Without branding and a big pharma play, valuations will sink as the market reprices these stocks away from growth companies and retail investors exit.

This sector could go lower, and stay low for a very long time. Please take appropriate risk and do not bet with money you do not have. Also many here should consider diversifying in to other sectors which are at very attractive prices right now and not putting 100% of your portfolio in pot stocks. Again, good luck to all.",2018-12-08 01:46:43

Not surprised to see further weakness here. That triangle took over half a year to resolve, you think its effects will only be felt for a matter of weeks? Look: falling through $6k sucked. It was a coin flip, but lady luck wasn’t on our side. Punxsutawney (TIL it’s spelled that way) Phil saw his shadow, and we’re all but resigned to another 6-12 months of bear winter. In the meantime, my gut tells me this market should be good for one more dramatic tumble before the bottom is in.

This shouldn’t be entirely shocking after what we just witnessed. It was incredible to watch unfold, but boy was it decadent. Ethereum hitting $1,400 at this stage in its life? Get the fuck out of here. Not to mention the likes of Ripple, and all that ICO shit? Absolutely insane. We all knew the day of reckoning was inevitable. The dotcom bubble couldn’t possibly have been that much worse, and NASDAQ took damn near 15 years to work through that.

Now, a less pessimistic view that I think a lot of reasonable folks are arriving at is that this puppy may need to sit on ice until the next halving. I tend to agree. Which as an aside, only really seems far away to cryptoheads who have had their psyche altered by following these 24/7 markets for years.

But I gotta admit, for the first time since I’ve been following Bitcoin, I’m also wondering about the medium term (read: next 3-5 years). We just don’t have the empirical evidence to surmise how Bitcoin will do if the broader economy tanks. 

If I’m being honest with myself, I have to concede the possibility that Bitcoin is not yet suited to play the part of global macro hedge. I mean, we’re all here on a Bitcoin trading sub after all, and exchanges are big business for a reason: Bitcoin today is still first and foremost a speculative, risky asset.

Look, it’s only a matter of time until the economy tanks. Cracks are there, and they don’t take much squinting to see. When the inevitable flight to safety happens, bitcoin may perhaps be destined to be more victim than beneficiary, one of the first baits to be cut by all those casual investors who still haven’t fallen down the bitcoin rabbit like many of us here have. 

But with all that said... longer term, this is still in all likelihood the best goddamned investment opportunity of your lifetime. Don’t blow it. Trade if you must, but for the love of God, build up a cold storage stash.

Buy. Hold. Forget. This is the easiest money you will ever make. Don’t let this market get in your head. Go watch some Andreas videos to remind you why you got so excited for this shit in the first place. 

The reality is that Bitcoin’s path to a $1T market cap is dramatically less daunting than any other coin out there, and it’s not even close. Look, there are no guarantees in life, but it sure seems to me like Bitcoin is on track to becoming the best and most sound form of hard money that the world has ever seen. No further upgrades needed. LN and all the other applications that will inevitably bubble up to the surface thanks to permissionless innovation? They’re just the icing on the cake.

So even if our baby gets dragged down by a floundering economy, the long term is brighter than it’s ever been. Bitcoin only gets stronger. More time means more credibility. What will help pull us out of the doldrums in the years ahead is an increasing realization on the part of portfolio managers around the world that Bitcoin is already every investors dream: the greatest portfolio diversifier you can find. High alpha, low beta. The next phase of BTC's inexorable march forward is increasing awareness that every portfolio should contain at least a 2-5% allocation to Bitcoin. Just have the patience to give ‘em time to make this realization. They will.

Happy trading.

ebaurrb,kybarnet,39,"&gt; Wouldn't reducing the block reward make ETH less attractive to mine

&gt; 'Excess expense' also added a TON of sell pressure to ETH, which makes it hard for the price to increase **or to remain stable**.

At the time 1 ETH was proposed, ETH was $300. Thus at $85 that is equal to 3.5 ETH today. Also ETH was *nearly* overtaking Bitcoin (the flippening, etc). I didn't go into it to prevent added confusion, but there is a monsterous difference for being 1st vs 2nd. Eth is now 3rd. What do you think happens if it becomes 6th to 8th? How much more does BTC offer in terms of usability, beyond merely being 1st? Some say it is even less useful (regardless of functionality, it **is** objectively more useful as a store of value).

From the time of that writing to today approximately 6.5 Million Ethers have been added to the marketplace, at a time when the average price was around $450 or $3 Billion in excess expense, all gobbled up. Without allowing the price to remain so low to meet demand, ETH would have overtaken Bitcoin in perceived market cap. This in turn would have increased demand even more.

This was a time and a place opportunity and that is why I acted so strongly as I did.

However, you must also be willing to anticipate the reverse. ETH was compensated for being 'solidly number 2'. If you did the math last year, annual expense was virtually equal to Bitcoin all throughout, 1:1. Today Bitcoin is given a premium, 4:1. Did Bitcoin change? Hardly.

ETH miners today receive less than they did 1 year ago. Not because the block subsidy has changed, but because the 'ETH premium' has declined 75% (or whatever). As this premium continues to decline, so will miner payout - increasing or maintaining the subsidy cannot change or stop that.

I am still a huge advocate of 1 ETH per block as a necessary step. I would preferable do it in stages, like maybe 2 ETH immediately, and 1 ETH 3 months after. This allows the price enough time to correct, and to not alter miner payouts all too substantially.

Delaying the next revision for another year could be the death kneel. There is an importance to being 1st or 2nd - you get paid a premium. ETH is now 3rd. 2 ETH / block might hold this position for a several months, but I have serious doubts it will hold it for 12. I don't want to be a doomsayer, but if three more projects usurp ETH, you could see the price decline more than you might expect.

1 ETH may hurt, but the pain will be short lived versus the sign of a killing blow. The ETH miners I know continue to mine at a loss. They believe in this project. They run a major rig, and still continue traveling the country looking for more investors. But today they are not selling them profits, they are selling the potential that one day it will return.

That day may come with 1 ETH per block.

&gt; You pointed this out a long time ago.

Thank you, and I appreciate the recognition no matter how reluctantly it has to be given. I know the risk that comes with associating oneself with an 'enemy of the state', etc. Again, I still wish the best for ETH despite how my actions have been perceived - or warnings construed to be wishes.",2018-12-08 02:22:18

ebf6v9o,aaj094,39,"I analysed gtrends data for 'Bitcoin' search as provided at

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/google_trends-btc.html#log

It plots against time the multiple of searches from 1/1/2012.

I have looked at the boring low (flatline) periods in mid 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015, late 2016 and the reason for choosing these periods are that searches there are as less polluted from speculators as possible.

A very uncanny relationship between price at those periods and search index is that price directly proportional to square of search index.

Now we have the advantage that the Oct 2018 was a very low volatility period so hopefully stripped out of speculators so if I take the Google search index in that period and extrapolate from the earlier observed trend, we could conclude that the price that can be supported is at least 3k.

Now what could be the rationale to expect price to be proportional to square of search interest? I think Metcalfe law on value of networks. If the number of users double, not only do you have more users but each user sees more value in the network because of the proportionally higher number of fellow users.

Data to support above:

2012: GT=1 Price=5

mid 2013: GT=4.34 Price=90

mid 2015 GT=6.5 Price=225

Early 2016 GT=8 Price=405

Late 2016 GT=9 Price=600

Oct 2018 GT=26 Price = ???

Note that it won't work to use such data for volatile, very bearish or very bullish periods because then searches are polluted by people just searching because of BTC being in the news for volatility.

Tldr: I see 3k having high probability of being a bottom due to being supported by the search interest based analysis above. This is a reason additional to 3k being the support level by being the low of mid Sep 2017 and being the same % decline from ATH as previous bear market.

ebdu459,Bondables,38,"**RECORD:** 9W-0P-2L

**Form (Last 5):** WWWW**W**

**Last Pick:** West Ham vs Crystal Palace - BTTS @10/11  (won)

**Sport:** Football/Soccer

**Competition:** English Premier League

**Today's Game:** (16:00 GMT) Newcastle vs Wolves

**Today's Pick:** Under 2.5 Goals @ 4/7

&amp;#x200B;

Explanation:

Chaps, West Ham have won 3 league games in a row - I feel on cloud nine, only 5pts from 6th and a run that looks very inviting - that aside, the bet won - was worried when Palace went one up as I said it the explanation we don't do well from behind, luckily that wasn't the case and the bet was settled just after half time. Gutted as I had another bet on 3-1 West ham (also hinted at that in yesterdays explanation). But congrats to all who tailed!

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I'm going to admit upfront that this is a ballsy bet, I'm not fully confident in it but I'm finding it really hard to find a winner for today and STATISTICALLY speaking, this bet should be sound, but as some of my longer followers know - context usually trumps stats and I can't get a niggling thought out my head that this will be a goal fest, but I have absolutely nothing to back that up.

&amp;#x200B;

Neither team can afford to lose this game, it will be a very cagey affair, but it also means if theres an early goal then it has potential to completely collapse in to a goal fest. But the stats do speak for themselves, Newcastle against ""smaller"" teams have rarely seen Over 2.5 goals, an interesting stat for side bets - Newcastle score the first goal of the game A LOT, Wolves on the other hand concede the first goal of the game A LOT. 

&amp;#x200B;

The h2h sees the last 3 meetings between these teams all Under 2.5, all 2-0, neither team has been scoring buckets - but like I said, neither team can afford to lose. Newcastle are in particular at danger of being relegated - they were trying to blitz games earlier in the season but have begun approaching games a lot more slowly and calculated. I think it's a case of walking before they run, 1 point is better than 0, and they won't want to run the risk of losing that 1 point in the pursuit of 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Wolves were also on a bit of a losing streak before a win at Chelsea - it might give them the confidence to go and play, on the other hand they're away to the toon - apparently a hard place to go and play, maybe they will be happy with a draw to keep points on the board and the momentum going.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone mentioned yesterday if I had a tip address for Bitcoin, unfortunately I do not. I had never expected anyone to even want to tip, I'm doing this purely to challenge myself and make some money for others. I'm not a serial gambler or anything like that - this is just a thing I enjoy doing. While I never expect it from anyone, if you'd like to donate a tip It would be welcome - I only have a paypal link to tip, but if you would like to tip please message me - I don't want people to feel forced at all and I really expect nothing but it was mentioned yesterday and I felt it should be addressed. Rest assured, I will be going nowhere and every single one of my POTDS and ANY future tips I throw out will all be completely free for all to view.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope the above doesn't come across in any negative way, took me back a little being asked in the first place and I didn't know how to go about it.

Incorrect.

Back in 2014, trolls like /u/Displayer_, /u/gurglemonster, and /u/fucknozzle were [making the same bunk arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2c4094/daily_discussion_wednesday_july_30_2014/cjcmmg5/) to ([wrongly](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2dp36k/daily_discussion_saturday_august_16_2014/cjt6mdt/)) claim that [Bitcoin wouldn't be able to hit $10,000 per coin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/8cah8c/1m_bitcoin/dxea2oh/):

&gt;Oh god you are really deluded, ""only an order of magnitude"" , do you even realize how much money needs to be poured in to even reach that figure? It is not the same to pump bitcoin from 1 to 100 than pumping it from 500 , wait 480 , wait 510 to 10k... There is a HUGE difference... I don't expect bitcoin to go over its ATH ever again... Its hard being deluded, I know where you stand right now, I honestly wrote this to try to help you get out of that delusion. 

&gt;Holy shit , dude if you honestly believe a bitcoin can realistically be worth 10k then I have bad news for you, you have spent too much time in /r/bitcoin and your state of delusion is pretty high, is never too late to wake up, so gl with that dude, from the bottom of my heart.

A few years later, others [continued to echo this fallacious reasoning](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/68y4dr/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_03_2017/dh3ld4p/):

&gt;It is going to take exponentially more money entering the market to raise the price from 1500 to 10,000 than it took to raise price from 225 to 1500.

I explained what is wrong with this ""logic"" in comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/68y4dr/daily_discussion_wednesday_may_03_2017/dh3y596/), and have had [my reasoning resoundingly validated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vxxrf/yahoo_finance_explains_why_bitcoin_is_poised_to/cewzsrg/) over the years.

ebe0euh,rain-is-wet,34,"As this is my second bear market, a few thoughts:

People have been saying that bear markets are a time to build. This isn't just trying to feel good about having your net-worth rubbed out, it's true. I might be one of the few that wants a pretty long bear market because of this. Like 2 years would be healthy, maybe a new ATH in 2022. *Why?? Don't you want to be rich???* Fuck yes of course I fucking do. But the fundamentals need to be better for the next rally. Frankly the Bitcoin fundamentals last year were awful, with all the forks, the seg2x drama, it should of tanked the market, just shows how disconnected bull runs can be from reality...

Number 1 on my list is Lightning Network fully integrated into all leading wallets and exchanges, including Coinbase. If we blow the top off 20k and we are still mainly transacting on the main-chain then things are going to get ugly again. Good news is that LN seems to be kicking arse. I hope it to be quite usable within 12-18 months.

Also, please for the love of Satoshi, we can't have shit like Bcash and Faketoshicoin and any of these other obvious ego-coin schemes in the top 10. It's frankly just embarrassing to the space. Let alone we have big players like Coinbase listing some of them. How on earth can we ever expect an ETF if we have shit like that as 'peers'. It's a joke. And I've never bought a single litecoin, but LTC fully deserves the on-chain cash usecase, it's been around the longest and isn't run by lunatics, the other forks can just fuck right off to obscurity where they belong. *Please LTC flip those shitcash twins soon.* It's close. Could even happen in the next few days the way it's looking. GOOD.

OK happy accumulating. That's what I'll be doing. I never thought a $1200+ BTC would seem cheap to me having bought the 2013 ATH, but there you go. Learn to love the winter, accumulate, and when you feel like the bottom is truly in, tell your friends to buy some too. Peace.

The value of stable coins on the Ethereum network may soon far outpace ETH itself. However, if Ethereum is widely used for smart contract execution and stable coin transfer, ETH will always have value as it must be purchased in order to use the network to perform any function. Unlike Bitcoin and many other cryptos, ETH has intrinsic value as long as the network is useful.  That value is likely to grow and  because of the above properties, would warrant considering a P/E ratio in value estimation.

On one end of the spectrum you have investments, which have proven track records, and are considered low-risk. 

On the other end you have speculations, which are considerably higher-risk but provide higher upside potential. 

Crypto is on the speculation end. Low certainty of success, so any money spent on it should be considered lost.

High risk, high reward.

ebigift,tousthilagavathywork,69,"u/pwolf88 a much needed reminder of the positives. 

u/omise_go u/nebali that surely is a nice list of things done.

Inspite of some negatives there actually are many positives. As we have criticized the team for the negatives, we must appreciate them for the positives.

Taking our criticisms and suggestions, the team has striven to improve. They have taken many insults, threats to life and yet continue to strive. There have been weekly updates, weekly AMA's, Community Updates almost monthly in recent times, they have an Internal Testnet and we saw/played Plasma Dog. Kudos for all of that.

Blockchains were in the works from the 90's but only private chains were possible. It's only in 2009 with the Bitcoin whitepaper that Public Blockchains became possible. From 2009 till 2018, public blockchains have had the time to iteratively improve. Lightning Network and Raiden have been working on payment channels for more than 3 years and are yet to release fully.
Layer2 based Plasma had it's first spec in Jan 2018 and inspite of the complexities related to security and UX we are inching close to a public testnet within a year. It would be good if we can consider and appreciate this.

A simple timeline

. Plasma MVP Spec out in Jan 2018

. Q1 2018 - Plasma MVP prototype code done and release

. Q2 2018 - Plasma MVP had bad UX so research was done to produce More VP, Fast Withdrawals, Fast Withdrawals for faulty chains and Fast finality

. Q3 2018 - First production version of OMG Network based on Tesuji design that produced an internal testnet.(Production releases are beasts as you have to get all details right regarding business parameters, security, performance, etc.)

. Q4 2018 - First round of formal verification, Plasma Dog based internal testnet, Production version to use More VP and towards a public testnet. There is quite a decent amount of GitHub commits to Elixir-Omg.

Sure there have been negatives in the past, but for all our sakes, it's time to let go of the past and move forward.

Dare I say that 2018 was actually a great fucking year, besides the price &amp; panic from newbies. The best part is that Bitcoin price is oversold in a brutal bear market, while fundamentally things are better than it has ever been. 


We hear a lot of talks about the failed hype behind ""blockchains"" and the failures of crypto projects... DO NOT confuse this with Bitcoin. Some of us have never confused the idea of this other garbage with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the BEST product of blockchain. Bitcoin itself is the killer app and people around the world, like it or not, are using Bitcoin for more than speculation. If speculation is going to on-board the rest of the world who don't need censorship resistant money then even better, but something like Bitcoin IS NEEDED in the world. With everything else.... we are still waiting for a relevant usecase. 


BUIDL on Ethereum: we made a lot of promises &amp; raised billions on fluff so we gotta build *something*, a killer app people actually need/use.

BUIDL on Bitcoin: We have the killer app, decentralized unstoppable money, lets continue building the infrastructure to support it.

ebj6tgo,rogerverygay,48,"I had been aware of bitcoin since 2011, but after looking into the Silk Road decided it was to sketch to buy DMT and send it through the mail. So I backed out. The friend I had talked with about bitcoin came up to me at the bar in 2013 when bitcoin hit its then ATH. I stared into my phone the rest of the night despondent, reading article after article thinking I had missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to be rich. Fast forward to Christmas 2014 I left a casino after a drunken night of blackjack with $5,000. I still felt like gambling but knew from experience that I was likely to give it all back if I kept going. I checked bitcoin and saw it was close to a 52 week low. My though process was basically hey this seems cheap in comparison to when it was $1,200 so I bought 22 coins for 5k. I had lost all my savings in college by day trading the stock market and was determined not to make the same mistake so I started reading as much as I could about bitcoin. Once I fell down the rabbit hole I became convinced that bitcoin was the financial black swan I had been waiting for and I started piling more of the money from my job into weekly buys. Basically bought all through 2015 when the price was low, no special thought process. I’ve paid $185 for a bitcoin and I’ve paid $16,000 for a bitcoin. I literally have no fucking idea when is a good time to sell and when is a good time to buy. I just buy and hodl.

I've been involved in the blockchain/DLT in one way or another since pretty much the beginning; I've always been here for the technology first and foremost. I never thought I'd see Bitcoin trading for a penny, much less a dollar or twenty thousand dollars. I'm active as a developer and the growth I've seen in the Ethereum development community over the past 18 months has been absolutely stunning; what I've learned is that the speculator crowd doesn't actually keep up on development and is increasingly composed of *very* inexperienced investors with unrealistic timelines. Every time I hear people complain about the timeline to full sharding/staking I laugh a bit inside, sure it's behind the schedule in the 2015 roadmap but it's also a very well researched and deep solution to the biggest problems faced by distributed ledger technology in general while maintaining ideological consistency with the core value of decentralization. I can't say the same about any of the ""Ethereum killers"" out there today.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember just over a year ago the complaint was usually that there's no working dApps and that they will never come - in the past month I've interacted with Maker and Compound repeatedly, there's a variety of games launched on the network, there's 2nd layer scaling solutions on the mainnet. Now the goalposts have been moved - oh, we didn't mean *working* dApps, we meant *adopted* dApps. This is the speculator's curse if they don't have a grasp of the necessary timelines involved in building a new technology like this from the ground up.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying I've never sold any crypto - I've taken out much more than my principal, and in general I recommend recovering your principal any time you are lucky enough to experience geometric returns on an investment. I think it's also important to invest with realistic timelines - 1 year does not a long term investment make. What I love about this bear market is that it's finally cutting the fat out, we're getting rid of the idle speculators that are too disinterested or lazy to learn and actively contribute to what is happening hear, and good riddance.",2018-12-11 05:19:00

eblveff,BitBurst,50,"I believe there are 3 primary causes for the “worse than expected” downturn, all happening together, with a multiplying effect:
 1) Bitcoin is down.  Ethereum (and most all other cryptos) are still heavily correlated with Bitcoin, most likely due to the on-ramps and off-ramps of buying altcoins with Bitcoin.  Exchanges have added more altcoins and more possibilities exist to move directly into Ethereum, but until people see crypto as a diverse asset class and not a synonym with Bitcoin, we will have a strong correlation.  I had two conversations with complete outsiders today about “crypto” and their firsts words were “oh, you mean Bitcoin?”.  They didn’t even know what Ethereum was.  This is at a very large American software company.  We have a ways to go until Ethereum is even recognized for what it is.  Until then, if Bitcoin drops (due to their own in-fighting, forking, SEC ETF rulings, etc...), we go down with.
 2) Bad ICO’s have imploded.  These mostly vapor-ware, copied white paper, animated node background website with “pre-sale” countdown clocks have all but evaporated, selling all the ETH they raised out of desperation.  What’s left? Some amazing working and well-funded startups, building the future on Ethereum.  Companies that now have working prototypes and even production releases. The ones looking to make a quick buck have sold off Eth and are now fearful of a more watchful regulatory market that may come after them with legal penalties and fines in the millions. 
3) Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP’s) have amplified the bear market.  Ethereum is unique in having MakerDAO, a decentralized CDP market maker, backed by a stable coin (DAI), with an investment token (MKR) that includes privileges for governance and incentives to keep the system in balance (by “biting” CDP’s to liquidate them when they fall below a level, and collect a spread).  Using this system is my first real experience with Ethereum based “smart contracts” and I have to say that after 5 years in the crypto space, my mind is blown and I can’t see how Ethereum could ever fail if this is a taste of a good DAPP.  Anyways, CDP’s are getting liquidated as the “liquidation price” is being met (as we go down) if the owners can’t afford to add more Ethereum as collateral or buy back more DAI that was borrowed.  In essence, this is dumping thousands of Ether on the markets each time that we break through a major psychological price resistance levels... usuallly at round numbers like $100, $90, $85 showing a stair-step down on our ETH price charts.  

The question is... where is the floor?  The common conclusion to all of these 3 downward trends is that they all have the same synergistic amplifying effect on the way up when:
1) Bitcoin is rising (even a little bit)
2) Good ICO’s are launching products they’ve been developing over the last year or two
3) CDP’s are being created to bet on the market going up more (buying and locking up lots more Ether)

Oh.. and should we also forget that mid-January reduces the ETH mining reward by 33%?  Limiting supply increases value (basic economics).  

We have lots to look forward to.  BTFD",2018-12-12 11:52:57

ebozms8,vbuterin,487,"Honestly I'd like to take this opportunity to challenge Bitcoin Cash a little as well. Fundamentally, the question applies to BCH exactly as much as it applies to BTC.

The BCH community was in some ways literally born out of fire (the literal fire being internet flame wars; the metaphoricalness of the flame happens one level higher in the definition of ""flame war"" so I am happy using the word ""literally"" in its older literal meaning here). It was born as an offshoot of the BTC community that was driven out by the BTC core developers adopting what it perceives as a perversion of the original vision, along with internet forum censorship and other forms of hostility, and soon after the new community's birth it was beset on by a divisive and opportunistic Donald Trump-like figure that knew how to say what the people wanted to hear, but ultimately only wished to exploit them for its own profit. And the kind of community that arises from these circumstances shows: almost every day the front page is filled with posts rallying the troops to fight against the evils of either Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Craig (BCC).

This behavior is understandable as a response to endless social attacks coming from Craig Wright and other sources, but at the end of the day the goal of BCH should not be to grow its community by grabbing off a few more supporters from BTC and BSV, it should be reaching out to larger communities in broader society that stand to benefit from what it has to offer. And broader society honestly does not give a crap about censorship in /r/bitcoin or social attacks from BSV, because there are much bigger cases of censorship and social attacks happening in the world that hurt the lives of far more people. So it looks very bad when the front page of /r/btc has threads about censorship and social attacks from competing bitcoin branches, rather than messages that explain to broader groups of people why BCH can be useful to them.

That said, there are signs of hope. I've been seeing more focus on making merchant solutions with good UX, improving the protocol with pre-consensus and similar techniques, and using BCH to help people in Venezuela. This is good and this community needs more of that. Also, the community seems to care less now about whether BCH is run by PoW or Avalanche or adheres to the ""longest chain rule"", and cares more about the chain surviving and being useful; this is also good.

However, the community still needs to figure out, for example, what its unique selling point is relative to Zcash, which is _also_ a coin that aims to support economic freedom but has strong privacy via ZK-SNARKs. Saying ""BCH is bitcoin"" can't cut it, because only a tiny portion of the world cares about weird religious arguments about the legitimacy of claims to some internet throne. The message must be first and foremost ""BCH is useful"". Once again, I have been seeing signs lately of the community going in that direction, but it needs to be a much stronger norm. But I do see reason to be optimistic.",2018-12-13 21:33:14

Yes, drugs are smuggled into the country in typical ways (across the border via fake doors in cars, small boats, nameless other ways).

The modern drug crisis is much more direct. You don't need to smuggle drugs into the country using expensive and very risky methods. You just use Bitcoin to various shops on the dark web and they ship USPS.

USPS does scan packages, but it's beyond impossible to stop every illicit prescription drug that comes into the system. You have to remember that it is legal to receive many prescriptions via USPS, even if you don't have a prescription in the US for it (Antibiotics, for instance).

So you have the postal service, scanning packages, many of them are prescription drugs, but they don't have the time or resources to open each package, inspect the contents, verify what it is and seize or repackage. That would halt our mail system completely.

Fentanyl is cheap as hell to make, so the sellers sell for cheap, people use a crypto currency and hope it arrives at their door. If it's seized, it doesn't matter, because the loss is so little, they just order again.

If you do get caught with a package on your door, people just deny it's for them or that they ordered it. There is no paper trail and no proof, so the USPS and federal government's hands are tied.

This is what makes the current crisis hard to manage. You literally can't stop it and even 16 year old kids can use their part time job to buy bitcoin and buy enough drugs to kill them and all their friends, in a single night.

ebnkgcw,BitttBurger,277,"As someone who has been at this since early 2012, I understand his sentiment about not bailing because the fundamentals hadn't changed.  

Unfortunately the fundamentals have now changed with Bitcoin, as it is owned by a centralized corporation that has $151 million in investors who want to monetize it.  That has become their priority.

Before, the top priority for Bitcoin was to become a worldwide Peer to Peer Cash system directly on the block chain.  Something that could onboard the poorest in the world and give them financial sovereignty from corrupt governments.  

While some projects are attempting to revive Bitcoins usability as a currency (Bitcoin Cash for example), Blockstream and the Core devs have done an outstanding job destroying its reputation and making every noob here think its a shitcoin.  This was accomplished through mass banning and blatant censorship of any dissenting arguments on the block size debate. 

So as a long term investor who did not cash out at the peak, I am now very concerned.  Because Bitcoin's Social Change imperative has literally been removed from the equation, and I strongly feel it was this social change vision that made it succeed at all in the first place.

That being said, I am stockpiling ETH and ICX, holding on to my gifted BCH, and using this accumulation phase to diversify to several other coins that don't have financially-illiterate developers in charge, or a corporation that has introduced a massive financial conflict of interest.  

And I wont be selling my BTC because even if it does become a corporate bank coin, it could still be a great investment.  I just worry that without that ""war cry"" for social change, it may fail to go as far.",2018-12-13 05:44:21

Steam did not originally add Bitcoin on a whim. It is people’s full time job at that company to keep abreast of payments technology and how their company can benefit.

The original draw for them was simple, instant, cheap payments without risk of fraud or chargeback and at a phenomenal saving compared to PayPal or credit cards.

They assessed the situation and knew full well that, while initially almost no payments would be made via bitcoin, if they continued support it would grow and in time the effects on their operations and bottom line would be astounding.

Then Blockstream/Core intentionally crippled bitcoin for payments, killing adoption and growth stone dead. Faced with spiralling fees and payment delays, bitcoin became a customer support nightmare and genuinely more trouble than it was worth. They dropped support.

However, those people at Steam whose job it is to pay attention are still paying attention. They have seen what BCH is capable of in the stress test, they have an established relationship with Bitpay, Bitpay support only BCH and BTC, enabling support for only BCH is a one tick box choice for Steam.

I still firmly believe that, if you're a long term proponent of BTC, this is when you start accumulating.  BTC was designed to be the new form of sovereign money for the digital age.  It's a completely unique and radical experiment that emerged as a natural product of the interconnected era.  When I first read the [Satoshi white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in 2013, I had that 'eureka' moment that many of you share - Bitcoin was designed to mirror all the incentive balancing systems that made gold a useful form of money for 6000 years whilst simultaneously making use of the portability and security offered in a digital era. Bitcoin is designed to be *sound money*, and borrows liberally from what humans know sound money to be historically: Fungibility, durability, portability, cognizability, stability.  Bitcoin from a functional perspective, *is* a better form of money than both fiat and even gold.  This is the core value proposition of BTC, and after 10 years now we're still in the very *early stages* of adoption.  These early years are chaotic only because it's such a radical experiment and thus speculation, a necessary part of the adoption and price discovery process, has pushed price around dramatically.  But, [global volatility is waning](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/volatility-index/) and will continue to decrease over time as a function of nominal price per BTC and adoption. The core utility of Bitcoin has remained unchanged from inception. Bitcoin will win through continued adoption by those who understand the utility Bitcoin offers - it's a better version of money impervious to inflation by central actors and seizure by representatives of the state.  

In my view, we're about to enter a long consolidation cycle where Bitcoin price vacillates between the bottom (wherever that is) and $6k. Based on prior cycles I think it's unlikely we break $6k until the later half of 2019 should the adoption continue (which I think it will).  This is the phase to accumulate and hold. 

Long term indicators are signaling that Bitcoin is now very undervalued historically.  The NVT ratio (network to value transaction) which acts as a kind of stand-in for PE ratio is [now lower than the bear market in 2014/2015, ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/OWj3Nn9M/) suggesting current prices are discounted.  Can we go lower?  Of course we can.. but as a long term buyer with the patience to wait 2-3 years at *a minimum*, then this is when you begin buying.

Likewise the Mayer Multiple, a BTC indicator that divides the daily price by the 200 day moving average, is also at an [ATL at 0.48.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eRuyz0pv/)  Bitcoin has spent about 95% of it's price history *over* 1 on the scale, suggesting these are highly discounted prices for those interested in buying for the long term. 

It's bearish as fuck out there... and honestly it can get worse.  Price can go lower and grind in this range for a year or more before any bullish enthusiasm arrives.  I do think we'll see another big run, but it's going to take some time... more time than the last run.  This period will shake out the lambo moon boys which is a good thing I think, and reward those with the patience and fortitude to buy value and hold it.  

Lastly, I was looking at the [primordial BTC chart and graphing bull trend angle from inception.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/UGPQZpra/)  Subsequent bull rallies have shown a tapering in trend angle, with subsequent bull trend angles operating at a little over half the value of the previous angle.  If this trend continues, we can guess that any potential subsequent bull trend lines leading into 2019 will grow at about 10-11%.  In this bullish, but historically consistent, scenario we're due for a rather subdued 2019 with prospects of breaking ATH in 2020/2021 and peaking sometime in late 2021 in the $80k - $125k range.

ebr5iwd,Thisisgentlementtt,70,"Rant/story time:

**Trading:**

I have been quite quiet here since it has been a bear market and I am what I would consider a perma-bull. I wrote my first post here 2½ years ago. The post was about the upcoming halving and how the price would 10-100x in the first year after the halving. (You can read it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/4q7is4/daily_discussion_tuesday_june_28_2016/d4qxr24/ )

After getting that prediction somewhat right, things have been harder. 

I was long the whole of 2017, I remember looking at my position going straight up. I closed my long at pretty much at the best possible time in December 2017. I had a fuckton of USDT in my account and what did I do. The FOMO kicked in and I put it all-in at pretty much at the top. 

Well at that point I was smart enough to not use leverage anymore since everything was screaming bubble. But not smart enough to stay in cash. I longed a couple of the bounces this spring but nothing to tell about them. Trading wise I have been on the sidelines for a long time now. 

**ETF:**

I have liked to comment on the ETF every now and then simply because I see it having such a huge effect on the price. 

Two years ago I wrote about Gemini starting a daily Bitcoin auction.

I speculated that it was because the SEC did not approve of the way Winklevoss had planned on calculating their ETF's NAV (net asset value). Meaning that the SEC was not happy with the current methods of coming up with a price for Bitcoin. (You can read about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/542zkb/daily_discussion_friday_september_23_2016/d7ynjty/ )

Well the auctions are live and the ETF has yet to be approved. Either I was wrong or the auction was not enough for the SEC.

Here comes in BAKKT (You can find this on their twitter feed): if you look at the message they have been conveying, it has been all about creating a ""system where there can be transparent and confident price discovery. Which could open the door for other products around bitcoin and crypto.""

BAKKT tweeted also this: ""Given the transparency/regulation of the futures markets, futures price in a one-day physically settled bitcoin contract will serve as a price discovery contract for the market

There's no reliance on cash platforms for settlement prices for pricing daily bitcoin futures contract""

Again, this is only speculation. But it ALMOST sounds just as it came straight from the mouth of SEC. We shall see, but with the BAKKT launch. I see the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF going way up.

**The BEAR:**

No contending that this a true bear market. What has caused it? More sellers than buyers. 

Who are these sellers? Well I think that a lot of Bitcoin/crypto where put in to the hand of the few during the bull. ICO's, crypto businesses, exchanges, miners, talented/lucky traders all printed money. 

In the bull run most of these entities did not have to sell [that much]. But as prices go lower, and their costs stay the same. They have to sell more crypto to stay in business. 

I feel that the last drop from 6k to 3k was mostly people getting their long positions liquidated in altcoins. With combination of the fact that the sideways action resolved lower.

The public/FOMO buyers obviously have disappeared. So the imbalance of buying and selling is opposite to a bull market. 

**The future**:

Well as I have liked to almost always point out, P2P volumes are an important indicator of ""true demand"". Localbitcoins and Paxful are both doing well (https://coin.dance/volume). So personally I am not that worried about Bitcoin's fundamentals.

A new halving would obviously help. Luckily it is not *that* far away. The ETF would help. The price touching its final bottom (before the next bull) would help. After that every new short would be underwater (in the long run). 

I think we will just have to wait. It will not take that long that the unprofitable businesses and miners are out of their Bitcoins.

If the price goes under 3k, I would consider it as good as a buying opportunity as 2015 was.

It may remain as a store of value and hold the title of cryptocurrency gold, but the world won't run on Bitcoin. A new coin may emerge that outperforms any of the aforementioned picks, but at the moment, I would say that the world will end up running on Nano for P2P payment currently. Yes scaling issues exist, but teams of all coins are working on these issues. However, the technological fundamentals of these coins are far more advanced than the technological fundamentals of Bitcoin, and it's going to be hard for Bitcoin to become what people want it to without altering some of the fundamentals of the technology, which is an inherently difficult task.",2018-12-14 07:17:25

It can be hidden anywhere because of its small size, it is not able to destroy the building structure, but if it detonates you will get many wounded people.
My recruited person keeps the building under the control. If he sees any unusual behavior, panic  or policemen the bomb will be blown up.
I can withdraw my man if you pay. You send me $20'000 in Bitcoin and the bomb will not explode, but do not try to fool me -I warrant you that I will withdraw my man solely after 3 confirmations in blockchain. 

&gt;My payment details (btc address)- [REDACTED]

&gt;You must solve problems with the transfer by the end of the working day. If you are late with the transaction the bomb will detonate.
This is just a business, if you don’t send me the money and the bomb detonates, other companies will send me more money, because this is not a one-time action.
To stay anonimous I will no longer log into this email account. I monitor my Bitcoin wallet every forty minutes and after receiving the money I will give the command to my person to get away.

ebskteg,xpvwws,76,"I've been here for a while.  The worst crash I went through was very early when the low price of ether caused Vitalik to post that the Foundation probably didn't have enough money to see Ethereum through the roadmap.  There was some ""hope"" held out that some other entity might rescue the development by providing external funding.  Go back and read this as if it were today:  https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-bitcoin-decline-9-million-funding-shortfall   It felt like getting socked in the stomach.  I felt sick about the prospect such a promising project would simply die.  I didn't sell simply because I was so sad that I figured I'd just ride it into the ground.  Lucky I didn't.  But pure dog luck.

Next, the DAO hack was bad.  I mean wretchedly bad.  I was dumb enough to put money into that fiasco.  Yes, I was that dumb.  The hack made me sad because I thought (1) what if smart contracts are too hard?  (2) the controversy over a rescue will tear this community apart.  The people who pumped Ethereum Classic did not seem to me to have the space's best interests at heart.  I fled from the BTC camp because the civil war over block size was getting too ugly.  I was sad that Ethereum would succumb to the same.  Decided to sell all my ETC and stick with the camp with Vitalik.  Once again, I just decided I would go down with the ship and let my ETH go to zero.  Got lucky again.  Whew!

The DDOS attacks.  Yeah, that sucked having some hacker(s) attack Ethereum right as the devs were at Devcon.  That was a nasty trick.  But honestly, I wasn't worried.  I mean all the devs were in one place and could coordinate a solution.  It took them, what a couple of hours?  Best drop ever because it increased my confidence in the devs.

This bear market.  Yeah, the price drop sucks and once again makes me sad.  (Can you see a pattern? Bad news makes me sad.)  But this is the easiest price drop I've been through.  If you can, forget for just a moment about the price and go read the r/ethereum sub as if your *only* way of judging what ether is worth derives from the current health of the chain and progress being made toward scaling and increasing the usefulness of Ethereum.  My guess is that if you somehow were able to learn anything you wanted to about Ethereum but unable to learn anything about the price per ether, you would be giddy with excitement.

I don't know when this bear market will end.  It's been longer and deeper than I ever expected.  Crazy, right?  But I've never been so optimistic about the development of the Ethereum space.  Summary: sad about price, excited about ongoing progress.",2018-12-15 03:44:26

ebt8auh,De_lonte,53,"Returning the Maker stability fee to 0.5% makes me excited about Ethereum again.

&amp;#x200B;

To understand my point of view, you must accept the notion that in the right context, numbers have an aesthetic and psychological component, and that price is narrative.

 

While stable tokens are getting a lot of coverage, and while Dai is a true innovation, the CDP mechanism is the most transformative tool for wealth management that I've ever encountered. There are a lot of caveats, and difficult hurdles to clear in order to maximize ones appreciation of how CDPs work. The biggest hurdles are 1) belief in the underlying assets and 2) Acquiring the over-capitalization for your loan. But if you can satisfy those two conditions, then MakerDao will provide a pathway for your family, your institutions, and your businesses to route around the traditional banking system, save you untold sums in interest, and even preserve wealth between generations while still being able to put that wealth to work.

&amp;#x200B;

First, my use case.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I paid off a big chunk of my home mortgage with a CDP. My interest rate from the bank was 4%. But as we all know, 4% on a mortgage is not really 4% in the classical sense because you are paying 30 years of interest UP FRONT. This is the reason why I FUCKING HATE MORTGAGES. But I live in the rational universe and because I did not have enough cash to buy a house outright, I got a mortgage.  Then CDPs went live last year, and I realized how lucky I was. I had a significant sum of ETH I could use as collateral. (This was, in a sense, my free pass over hurdle #2 above. Without winning the Eth lottery I would never have understood what Rune and the team have created.)  I took as much Dai as I could safely borrow, converted it to dollars, and paid it to the bank as principle on my mortgage. In that transaction I traded bank debt at 4%, for CDP debt at 0.5%. Perhaps in a universe where people were seeing thousand percent gains, this did not seem like a sexy trade. But for the way I see wealth, this was a life changing transaction. It makes my heart race thinking about the implications.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I will mix numbers with narrative. The narrative of MakerDao for me, is that with the right assets, and the right amount of starting capital, you can literally borrow from yourself. You even get to keep the assets you put up as collateral. As lender to yourself, you can pay off your loan as fast or slow as you like. You could even pass the debt on to your kids by handing them the keys to a CDP. I can definitely imagine some cases where I would advise this, because unlocking the underlying assets could represent a substantial gain. Regardless, the narrative of using your own wealth for leverage in a way that does not put your wealth in the hands of others has never been possible in the financial universe. Until CDPs. That is the narrative that makes me really excited about Maker.

&amp;#x200B;

When the stability fee went up to 2.5%, this all changed for me, because as I stated at the top, numbers have an aesthetic quality, and price is narrative. 2.5% is definitely a low rate, but 2.5% is still within the collective memory of what banks were offering after the sub-prime crisis. For anyone who shopped for a house between 2009 and 2012, you could get 2.5% from Any Bank, USA. 2.5% just doesn't tell the story that I want to tell for Maker, because when the rate gets above a certain threshold, I think the borrower has to wonder, ""Someone out there is profiting from my interest...who is getting my 2.5%?"" Whereas 0.5% just *feels* like a great deal, and one can easily write this off as a necessary fee you pay into the system to keep all the software running. As time goes on it I think rates in the 2.x% might become more and more attractive. From a narrative sense, as commercial rates rise, I do think there is room to raise the stability fee again and still maintain the Maker narrative. But for the moment, I think 0.5% fits much better into the psychology of a person who is trying to be their own bank, who does not want to feel as though there's any chance they are enriching someone else by borrowing from themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

CDP's at 2.5% feel like they are part of a financial services agreement. CDP's at 0.5% do not.

&amp;#x200B;

This bear market has been clarifying for me. I've had to be super hard nosed about what projects I believe in. What I came to in the last year is that I am only excited about Bitcoin and Maker. While I appreciate Ethereum, I can't quite get excited about it like I can about Maker. And by the way, this is how it was always supposed to be. It's as if a glimmer of Ethereum's original intent is now shining through, because ETH was never supposed to be money, or an asset unto itself. Ethereum is only a substrate. Without transformational projects like Maker, Ethereum is just potential.

&amp;#x200B;

A word on marketing. I've drifted deep into the Bitcoin Maximalists camp this year, and there is a growing awareness of ""crypto loans"" among some of the hardcore bitcoiners because BlockFi has engaged with that community. I think that what BlockFi is doing is cool, but Maker is much more interesting to me. I don't quite know how to do this, but I want people out there in the bitcoin world to understand the decentralized, ""you control your own keys"", advantages of MakerDao. If the stability fee goes back down to 0.5%, the message becomes a lot clearer in my mind. That's just an aesthetic judgement.",2018-12-15 08:58:00

A bear market is the time when we have the time to do the work to position ourselves for the next bull market.  It’s actually an opportunity, even though it may not feel that way when we’re  living through it.  Take the long view.

The light at the end of the tunnel for me came in the form of a coin desk article published at the end of August 2015 announcing the launch of the ethereum network.  I knew what ethereum was from the 2014 bitcoin conference in Toronto where they had been promoting it.  I had thought at that conference that they were just a bunch dreamers trying to steal bitcoin’s lunch and that they would never deliver, so it caught my attention right away.  After a couple of weeks of intense research, I got busy on the buy side.

The market turned up in January 2016, so that was about a 3-year wait.

The thing I would remind people is that all these crypto-tokens are just trading sardines.  Don’t confuse them for family heirlooms.  Don’t become so infatuated with one token (say like I was with Bitcoin in 2014) that it causes you to ignore serious competition and get all tribal about it.  The goal is to make money.

ebxpd5c,nullc,80,"&gt; (which seems like an easy and reasonable thing to implement) 

Unfortunately, litecoin copied the bitcoin P2SH version id, so you can't tell those addresses apart-- similarly to not being able to tell non-bc1 addresses from bcash addresses.

If anyone sent bitcoin to a litecoin address except due to that p2sh version copying they really screwed up and you should run far far away.

It's depressing that we can carefully develop and design things in Bitcoin to be safe for users by construction only to have third party clones that aren't as careful screw things up for Bitcoin users. :(  Hopefully the Bitcoin suggestive prefix on bc1 addresses make people a little less likely to clone them unmodified.

Our industry to reduce these problems by strongly encouraging users to use bc1 addresses-- as they don't (currently) have this problem.

Users can also protect themselves by avoiding altcoins and businesses that do business with altcoins, but I guess that's the sort of advice that people never take until after they're burned.

ebxudt4,Scoobytwo,73,"I commend your choice to make an educated speculation and back it up by placing some shorts in the market. I disagree with your position though, because there seems to be some fundamental misunderstandings about how the BAT ecosystem works. Some examples;

1) Advertisers pay for campaigns in USD or other fiat currency through a dashboard similar to Facebook Business Manager. This currency is frictionlessly exchanged to BAT behind the scenes. Advertisers will not have to buy BAT on open exchanges.

2) The token economic concerns are important, but also theoretical. Your cited source, Multicoin, has made numerous educated, although wrong calls into this bear market. The concern about token sinks / velocity has been addressed numerous times. Especially well put in this rebuttal to Buterin and Samani by some of Brave's leadership; https://basicattentiontoken.org/token-economics-considering-token-velocity/.

Advertisers will have demand for BAT. Here are some example sinks that will cause scarcity;

1) BAT will be susceptible to 30-day token sinks in user browsers.
2) BAT will be distributed back to advertisers in a proportioned fashion IE: own 100 BAT, donate 20 a month = 5 month total sink from original supply.
3) A large network will cause other scarcity situations; lost browsers, lost hardware, unclaimed, speculating out of browser etc.

I think you are underestimating the potential for network effects and Metcalfe's Law. Other browsers, games, and apps are going to adopt the BAT ads platform, and the network will grow exponentially from there. I personally believe this will be the largest single indicator of success - network effect. This happened for Bitcoin first, and then Ethereum. Do not forget Bitcoin was originally supposed to be a P2P cash system, but has evolved into something more akin to a SoV system, less utilized for smaller payments.

The system will take years to build out, so your short may be successful in the short term (pun). It may be susceptible to BTC movements for a while, but the future looks bright. Good luck to you.",2018-12-17 07:33:17

Bet for 12/19/2018 – Scotland Premier – Celtic v Motherwell – 2:45 pm EST

POTD **Celtic -1.75 (-129) 2.5u** (Also shown as -1.5, -2) 

Yet another win as Monchengladbach made up for their first half mistakes and scored 2 in the 2nd half to win 2-0!

POTD reasoning: Back to Scotland we go, where Celtic will be looking to avoid their second straight defeat in the premiership, which happened nearly 5 years ago. Fortunately, they have some things in their favor in this matchup. The pressure is on as they came out lethargic against Hibernians suffering a 2-0 loss in Edinburgh, and the fans are demanding more from the players and Brendan Rodgers. This is a matchup in which Celtic and the fans *should* come out flying from the get go, or else the fans will really begin to get on them. Celtic Park is a fortress and Celtic can go to the top of the table with a win; I expect them pepper the Motherwell goal early and often. Surely Celtic can pick up the pace here against a much weaker side and win like the team we know they can be.

Mnemonic phrases are fine but there isn't really one standard way that is supported by all wallets.  Bitcoin-core is different from pretty much everything else.  Various wallet's use different bip32 paths and there isn't any versioning built into the mnemonics.

The promise of micropayments was instrumental in my becoming an artist in the space. In 2012, I first read about the idea of combatting email spam/DDOS attacks by charging negligible amounts of money to send messages/login. These were the first creative use cases I had heard for cryptocurrency. It inspired me to think of ways micropayments could benefit artists. And in 2013 I began posting street art around the San Francisco Bay Area/Pacific NW with a public facing wallet so passersby could send small amts of bitcoin if they liked the work.

I’m excited about a future where micropayments are omnipresent. Artists paid by the view…writers by the poem…musicians by the listen. Every day interactions complemented by positive monetary reinforcement such as tipping someone who let you merge into traffic.

Hopefully this micro auction inspires others to think big about the future of Bitcoin.

ec6oxqw,45sbvad,112,"One of Bitcoins main advantages over traditional investments like stocks and other forms of abstract ownership; is that Bitcoin can be ""physically"" transferred securely and almost instantly anywhere in the world.

Because other investments do not have this property (including bank dollars) ; it is extremely common for financial institutions to sell more assets than they actually have available to sell (because taking physical ownership is nearly impossible). This inflates the number of assets and depresses their prices. 

With Bitcoin we can keep exchanges and custodians honest by forcing them to transfer Bitcoin to our own private keys. It is impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin transaction; but it is completely trivial to take your money and show you a balance on a website.

Withdrawing coins en-masse forces exchanges to come clean ; either they have as many Bitcoin as they claim or they don't.

 If companies like Coinbase are using your USD and your Bitcoin to fund their operations to lobby the government against your investments; that is belligerent behavior ; the kind of mentality that creates such perverse belligerent behavior would likely see no issue running a massive fractional reserve.

It should be noted that many times in Bitcoins history exchanges have been operating incompetently or fraudulently ; resulting in total or near total loss of funds. Regular ""bank runs"" on Bitcoin custodians should be a normal state of affairs.",2018-12-21 00:28:56

ec73afv,bobsburger900,67,"Coinbase is moving to significantly expand the number of digital assets listed on its platform – a process that has led to a radical rethinking of how the startup safeguards billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies.

To this end, Coinbase moved retail traders’ crypto assets – worth some $5 billion – into its upgraded storage model last week. According to the company, that migration included 5 percent of all bitcoin, 8 percent of all ethereum, and 25 percent of all the litecoin in circulation, respectively.

Phillip Martin, Coinbase’s head of security, told CoinDesk that the migration process took roughly four months to plan.

“This was a fundamentally new architecture from the ground up,” he said, explaining:

“Regulators and auditors were involved at every stage… One of the biggest things we were worried about is that we don’t move the market with this event, which is why we went to such lengths to coordinate with regulators and manage media speculation around the movements.”

It all began with a new key generation process in October, through which the Coinbase team goes to a secure location with new computers and prints out keys that are then split up using formats that include scannable QR codes.

“We take the private key and apply a cryptographic technique called Shamir’s Secret Sharing, which is an algorithm that’s used to take a piece of private data and split it into a bunch of chunks you can divide,” Martin said. “There’s a threshold splitting system because you can define a threshold by less than the total number of pieces that are sufficient to reconstruct the original.”

The binders full of billions of dollars worth of keys are then divided among various secure locations, requiring multiple Coinbase employees to work together over the phone in order to unlock the cryptocurrency.

While many other bitcoin custodians prefer to rely on multi-signature wallets – rather than a single key divided into parts – Coinbase devised this strategy to accommodate assets that don’t yet work with multisig wallets.

Expansion ahead

Coinbase may have applied this process to the highest volume of assets to date, but the institutional custodian BitGo has also used key sharding in custody solutions for diverse tokens.

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk his startup won’t support any asset that can’t accommodate a multisig custody model.

“In the case of ethereum, which does not support on-chain multisig, we are able to support ethereum by using multisig through smart contracts,” Belshe said, adding that BitGo simultaneously uses both key sharding and a multisig approach. “We’re looking for a much more robust custodial process that is really strong, rather than having a lot of breadth.”

BitGo’s VP of product marketing, Robin Verderosa, said BitGo and Coinbase follow similar reporting and compliance strategies, which could open the door for both companies to add support for new assets and policies in the following months.

“The regulators had to go very deep into our cold storage solutions,” she said.

Looking ahead, insurance providers, auditors and compliance experts will continue to be an integral part of evaluating such processes, which Martin sees as a sign that the market is maturing.

Bet for 12/21/2018 – Soccer- Germany 2. Bundesliga – Koln v Bochum – 12:30 pm EST

POTD **Koln -1 (-115) 2u**

**Most of us will be happy to push after witnessing that Legia performance. Congrats to those of you that got the win. I don’t think these headed goals could be fixed but who knows… Push.**

POTD reasoning: Koln at home is basically an auto-bet at this point. 5 wins in their last 5 all by at least 2 goals. Looking and going to return to the Bundesliga. In the reverse fixture Koln won 0-2 away at Bochum a few months ago. Koln will temporarily jump to the top of the table over Hamburg with a win at home, they should get the win the way things are going for them.

&gt;He's certainly not, the real Satoshi could easily have proved he was the real deal by simply signing a message from one of the known Satoshi-only mining addresses.

&gt;Satoshi mined the entire first year of bitcoin's history almost entirely by himself.

&gt;He also made a new wallet from each newly found block of 50 bitcoin.

&gt;Signing a message from an address is extremely easy and most clients support it.

&gt;Even if you argued doing so might in some way compromise the security of the bitcoin in that wallet, he'd only be risking 50 bitcoin to do so, and Satoshi is estimated to own 20,000 such wallets containing a total of about 1 million bitcoin. So such a concern would mean effectively nothing to him if he really wanted to prove his identity.

&gt;This article records the incident where Craig S. Wright lied about providing cryptographic proof to Gavin, that he was Satoshi, by faking a signature in front of Gavin.

&gt;The way he was able to fool Gavin was by sending an assistant to buy a new computer, then together they installed what was needed, and then CSW signed a cryptographic message in Gavin's sight. This seemed legit.

&gt;This fooled Gavin because Gavin believed the computer was indeed fresh out of the box since the box was opened in front of Gavin.

&gt;Later, when experts examined the cryptographic evidence they found that the proof was in fact fraudulent, but this was after Gavin had already proclaimed CSW to be Satoshi.

&gt;The only way CSW could have made his fraudulent signature appear to be legit would be to have purchased a computer in advance of the meeting with Gavin, then compromised it so that it would show the signature that he pre-programmed into the computer, then seal it back into the box to make it look new and untampered. Then he made Gavin think the demonstration was legitimate by sending the aid out to ""buy a new computer"" when in fact the computer had already been compromised by CSW.

&gt;Gavin accepted it at face value, without checking the signature himself.

&gt;It's little more than a magician's trick, make something appear to be true that wasn't at all true. And because cryptography is so cut and dry, Gavin accepted it.

&gt;But in fact, CSW completely conned Gavin in order to get Gavin to proclaim him as Satoshi.

&gt;On the basis of this, CSW has claimed that he owned Satoshi's 1 million coins which he claimed was held inside a trust and as such something he could not get his hands on until 2020. This is a classic claim of a conman. If true, CSW is currently worth about $4 billion in BTC, so he could use that as collateral to fund his companies in Australia, which it looks like he had actually been doing.

&gt;What it looks like actually happened is that CSW may have been one of the people in the room when Bitcoin was being created and programmed, and in my opinion, Dave Kleiman is the most likely candidate to be Satoshi.

&gt;For one thing, he had the programming ability, the training, and the cryptographic chops to have pulled off what Satoshi pulled off, not only to write the Whitepaper and all communication as Satoshi, but to do what is nearly impossible: to remain anonymous over a two-year period of communication.

&gt;CSW, by contract, is a neophyte programmer who couldn't even get the difference between bit versus byte right, and doesn't have any demonstrated ability in using cryptography in his own life.

&gt;It appears that CSW and Kleiman did converse, but that Kleiman did the programming and hard work.

&gt;Kleiman died tragically in 2013, that too fits the timeline of Satoshi going dark and his last known legitimate communications.

&gt;Kleiman then likely would've had control of all the wallets mined by Satoshi.

&gt;When Kleiman died, it's been alleged by Kleiman's family that CSW requested them to send him the wallet codes, without really telling that family what was being sent. They have been suing CSW for that BTC.

&gt;So it's possible that CSW currently has possession of the Satoshi wallet codes in some form. But it's still very unlikely that CSW has actual access to Satoshi's coins, because Kleiman was notoriously good at encrypting absolutely everything he does. CSW may have a thumbdrive with all of Kleiman's bitcoin, yet be completely unable to decrypt it, and thus have no access.

&gt;That's a funny thought, imagine looking at a thumbdrive that you know has $4 billion on it if you can just guess the password that Kleiman used.

&gt;Kleiman was reported to use 50+ character passwords on things, he was a security and crypto expert and fanatical about encryption; those who knew him said those codes would never be cracked if Kleiman didn't write them down somewhere.

&gt;And it's quite likely that Satoshi's coins are heavily encrypted.

&gt;So that leaves us with CSW having been involved, but obviously not being Satoshi. Anyone who's read Satoshi can also note that CSW's distinctive writing style is jumbled, confused, overly-intellectual and even difficult or cloudy. Satoshi didn't write that way, and he wrote for years. He was a fairly clean writer. He also never blew up at people the way CSW is famous for blowing his top.

&gt;No, it's quite clear that whoever Satoshi actually was, it definitely wasn't CSW. Satoshi kept his promises, and kept a cool head.

&gt;And if you ask me, the reason CSW wanted to take over BCH and why he kept BSV running after they lost, despite declaring ""no split"", is contained in his statements about recovering lost coins.

&gt;The people who are into BSV all tend to think that CSW is in fact Satoshi Nakamoto.

&gt;This being the case, he has only to convince them that lost coins should be returned to their owners, and then he himself will move to return Satoshi's coins to himself.

&gt;And why would they stop him, since they are part of his cult of personality? Plus he'd explode in anger if they did, and they've proven susceptible to that.

&gt;That's 1 million coins, although it would be in BSV only. Which means that CSW would instantly become worth about $100 million.

&gt;That's reason enough to do everything he's done up to this point.

&gt;And on the basis of that, he might even be able to convince other chains, like BTC or Bitcoingold, to give him control of Satoshi's coins too.

&gt;He gets control of Satoshi's BTC and he'd be worth about $4 billion.

&gt;That enough incentive for you?

&gt;I'm sure he won't get control of Satoshi's BCH, but it seems like only someone who knows for sure that Satoshi is actually dead could have the balls to try to claim to be Satoshi and to take his coin, when for all the rest of us know, the real Satoshi could come out at any moment and send a message from his actual and known sources saying that CSW is not Satoshi Nakamoto, and then it would be over for CSW.

&gt;Except, CSW, having been a contributor to Kleiman, knows that won't and can't happen.

&gt;CSW doesn't even have access to Satoshi's old email addresses, that too is telling.

&gt;CSW also seems to have a psychopathic need to be respected and held up as an authority figure. When he was first brought forward into the public eye, it was claimed that he had something like 7 PhDs, when in fact he has one PhD and a couple masters and bachelors degrees, as I recall. And the PhD isn't even in crypto or programming, it's in Law, again as I recall.

&gt;He's made dozens of broken promises, over and over again. Even in this very article he promised to prove he was Satoshi the next day, then if you follow the links in that same article comes out with some BS excuse saying he's ""not strong enough"" to do it. Even though he continues to claim he's actually Satoshi Nakamoto to this day.

&gt;The guy is an absolute con-artist and it's mystifying why he's still even talked about in cryptocurrency circles, he's a fraud and everyone needs to turn their back on him.

&gt;And unfortunately for the BSV guys, he's in control of their destiny, and they are likely to face difficult times ahead because of that.

&gt;But look for my prediction that CSW will eventually try to claim Satoshi's 1 million coins on the BSV blockchain. Once that happens, we will have confirmation that this has been the aim of his scam all along. And the reason he's upset that he didn't gain control of BCH is because it would've been a lot more profitable to suck the blood out of a real cryptocurrency like BCH rather than an essentially fake one like BSV. This explains why he gave up on BTC, their centralization was impossible for him to overcome, he couldn't replace Core as the controller of BTC.

&gt;He's got to move fast now on BSV, to keep fooling people about the prospects for BSV, but also to begin leading them towards this idea of creating permissioned chains that give leverage to the person or group doing the permissioning. Once he has that leverage, he will begin to talk more about ""consumer friendly"" methods of recovering lost bitcoin. He's already in fact talked about this, he suggested that the BCH sent to Workhole using proof-of-burn could in fact be recovered on BSV.

&gt;The only way the BSV chain survives is if they see this coming and stop him from doing it.

&gt;CSW's cash-out of BSV will prove far more epic than Charlie Lee's throwing Litecoin under the bus, because CSW will be able to steal BSV that rightly belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, purely through one grand social attack.",2018-12-22 18:12:17

* Data on global warming, and the spending that's been uncovered in various counter-studies that show where the money for them is coming from (fossil fuels).

* Some information on market trends so that I can pre-empt businesses that come in to fill niches, to help grow my wealth and hopefully my influence.

* The information of some promising carbon scrubbing researchers and engineers that I can fund.

* The information on where I can get land and set up factories for these things during the economic downturn that will just start happening as I start to gather wealth, so that I can use this timing to try and give jobs to people who need them as much as I can, and keep that train going.

* Information for which politicians end up becoming prominent, so that as a wealthy influencer, I can start making connections and buying favors early, to promote things like fair wages, science-based legislation, and a focus on green energy.

The guy is an absolute con-artist and it's mystifying why he's still even talked about in cryptocurrency circles, he's a fraud and everyone needs to turn their back on him if you don't want to get used by him.

And unfortunately for the BSV guys, he's in control of their destiny, and they are likely to face difficult times ahead because of that. 

But look for my prediction that CSW will eventually try to claim Satoshi's 1 million coins on the BSV blockchain. Once that happens, we will have confirmation that this has been the aim of his scam all along. And the reason he's upset that he didn't gain control of BCH is because it would've been a lot more profitable to suck the blood out of a real cryptocurrency like BCH rather than an essentially fake one like BSV. This explains why he gave up on BTC, their centralization was impossible for him to overcome, he couldn't replace Core as the controller of BTC.

He's got to move fast now on BSV, to keep fooling people about the prospects for BSV, but also to begin leading them towards this idea of creating permissioned chains that give leverage to the person or group doing the permissioning. Once he has that leverage, he will begin to talk more about ""consumer friendly"" methods of recovering lost bitcoin. He's already in fact talked about this, he suggested that the BCH sent to Wormhole using proof-of-burn could in fact be recovered on BSV.

The only way the BSV chain survives is if they see this coming and stop him from doing it--unlikely to happen.

CSW's cash-out of BSV will prove far more epic than Charlie Lee's throwing Litecoin under the bus, because CSW will be able to steal BSV that rightly belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto, purely through one grand social attack.

Ron Paul who was previously a critic of Bitcoin is now endorsing Cryptocurrencies and recommending a mixed economy where the FED is not the sole issuer of the currency.

&gt; Ron Paul has turned from a Bitcoin skeptic to a supporting tax-free Cryptocurrencies.

&gt; Mr. Paul is a proponent of commodity backed currencies where the free market gets to decide the price instead of the FED artificially controlling the monetary policy causing boom and bust cycles.

‘The crypto community hasn't helped, with paranoia over the potential fortunes at stake causing fractures and infighting. Bitcoin, for all of its sophistication, was so poorly engineered that the more popular it grew, the less usable it became.’

‘We live in an age when people are looking for a solution to what they perceive as degeneracy. Many of these solutions push for individualism, monetarism and the destruction of governments rather than a desire to live in a functional society. They espouse fringe ideas on how much freedom an individual must have that are troubling if left unaddressed.’


‘Proponents like cryptocurrencies because they offer freedom from taxation and regulation, handing power to so-called sovereign individuals. The end goal is to live in a world where the laws and protections that enable a working society are gone. Then only the strong, the savvy and the least scrupulous will survive in the perpetual desert that the world will become.

Bitcoin was never more than a vehicle for tax evaders and grifters to burn carbon in the hope of scoring a hot new Lambo. It represents all of our worst excesses, and it does so at a huge cost both to the people and our planet. Perhaps now that the investment has dwarfed the potential return, this collective hysteria will end. At least until the next one comes along.’

From what I'm piecing together, one of his coworkers stole the money, probably unplanned. Afterwards they realize the police are looking for this money, and they can't do anything with it.

Seeing an investment opportunity, OP offered to buy some bitcoin and then sell it to the thief at a huge markup for the stolen money. Since OP wasn't working during the theft, they can't blame him. The missing money may be the value of the bitcoin. Win-win, since OP gets all that money, and the thief gets some bitcoin he can actually spend.

OP thought he was in the clear, since they can't prove he was in the building or that the thief told him he was paying in stolen money. But he knew he was paying in stolen money, and now he's being charged with possession of stolen property. 

It also sounds like OP's lawyer advised him to take a plea deal, since he's obviously guilty of some crime. OP thinks he's a lot smarter than he is, and that he invented using crypto to launder money so no one else would ever realize what he was doing, and is instead pushing for a jury trial.

I just don't see him acting like he is if he was actually guilty of the theft. He seems much more the type who thinks he has to be ""technically"" innocent since it was never explicitly stated that he was being paid with the stolen money, and he thinks it can't be proven, even though it was obvious. It's the same kind of legal thinking that devolves into the Sov Cit movement if it's taken far enough.

I run a stock commentary Facebook page where I summarize my opinions on stuff but I'm actually critical of my own portfolio spread as well - because some corporate bullshit is funny.

Though they will report *factual* data the presentation is designed or targeted towards the business side and no commentary is given towards comparative reviews of products or services. There is a large disconnect in market reporting for investors and the actual market's opinion.

Take EA: Anyone on fucking Reddit will tell you why EA's stock is trash. Lots of people actually play videogames. We read game reviews. There was a huge backlash over Star Wars Battlefront and other similar issues over microtransactions, but the reports read like ""poor reception"" and ""possible legal issues"" and other similar readings.

Another major contribution is that bots trade stocks automatically based on those reports. Instantly. This creates a race for quick, simplistic reporting that doesn't exactly expand on details for the numbers.

And, of course, the press releases to investors are almost always bullshit when it comes to lackluster sales: But that's expected. Nobody is going to put out a release saying ""we fucked up with the lootboxes"" or ""we made a shitty Battlefield and realized it too late"" so they'll deflect or downplay issues to maintain stock value. In the case of Battlefield V they actually owned the bullshit to try to make it sound like it was because of a social innovation (women in games) rather than the actual issue (nobody wants another fucking Battlefield game doing the same shit, lootboxes, no real innovation, becoming more generic, etc).

Now imagine this ... But for literally everything. That is finance reporting.

The summation of this is a warning that people who write those articles are incentivised to tell you to keep holding on and that this is only temporary. The truth is that is could definitely *not* be fine. But nobody will tell you that because a panicked market is good for nobody. The only answer you will ever get in the worst-case-scenario is ""hold on and wait.""

\- [Here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/34256/sha256-security-what-does-it-mean-that-attacks-have-broken-46-of-the-60-rounds) is described what ""number of rounds"" means and why collisions in first rounds are not so significant

So the function is not broken at all. People talk about breaking 46 of 60 rounds of SHA-256 (Bitcoin) and it is still used as secure enough. We have 2 broken of 24 here, so there is a long way till breaking of Troika reaches the success rate of SHA-256 attacks.

ecgn53e,truemeliorist,45,"So here's the deal as I see it. Its really really easy to repeat the platitudes about blood in the street, HODL, whatever, when it is all theoretical.

The problem is a huge proportion of investors here have never been through a recession, a long correction, or a bear market as an investor. They started diving in to the recovering market, so the biggest drops they've really experienced have been relatively minor, in a market that had very little volatility. It's a good learning experience you really just need to survive.

If you have never seen days after days of everything going red, it can be really rough the first time. Hell, I've lost about 50k over the past few weeks (unrealized), my daughter has lost about 10% of her college savings, etc. 

Luckily, I locked in losses during 2008, and paid the price for it. So I know better than to let my emotions drive things. A lot of folks simply don't have that experience. And frankly until you have experienced it, it can be scary and you can't know how you will really react.

Also, there could be some folks on fixed incomes who just saw their retirement savings drop by 15% with no real signs of slowing, and utter incompetence at the helm. Remember, the college professor of economics who trained our president referred to him as one of the dumbest students he'd ever seen. And that the president literally has no understanding of the difference between micro and macroeconomics. 

That's scary too, and there's plenty of room for things to be scarier. It also really,  really doesn't feel like this is something that is going to just bounce back right away. Too many sectors are hurting 

There's probably also bitcoin bagholders,   or XIV bagolders who have fresh scars and may not be in a place to risk more losses.

So, I get it. Folks should do what is right for them and their tolerances, but IMO if your feet are getting cold when you look at the numbers, take a break and stop looking at them. This is the kinda market movement that separates long term investors from dilettantes. ",2018-12-25 01:01:36

ecnir8x,fek_,87,"Alright, let's do this one step at a time.

**What is a bitcoin?**

Each bitcoin is an answer to an extremely complicated math problem. It is a value, or a number, or a block of data, that satisfies a very complex algorithm.

In a way, ""a bitcoin"" is like ""a prime number"". At first, finding a prime number is easy. Most of us can probably do the math in our heads: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11... etc.

After a while, though, finding new prime numbers gets harder and harder, and it starts to take more complicated math to track them down.

Now imagine that each prime number belonged to the first person who finds it. For instance, the largest known prime number at the time of this posting is  2^(82,589,933) − 1 , which was just discovered a few weeks ago. The person who found that prime number now ""owns"" it. Other people might know the answer, but he got it first, so it's his.

In essence, this is similar to the concept of ""owning"" a bitcoin. Whoever ""finds"" a bitcoin first gets to keep it. The bitcoin system uses some very complex and toutedly-secure mechanisms (a ""blockchain"") to keep track of who finds each bitcoin first, who currently owns each bitcoin, and any transactions involving each bitcoin. The system also allows you to split a bitcoin up into parts and trade those parts. I can give someone 0.001 BTC, if I want, and the system will keep track of it.

**Why do bitcoins have any value? Aren't they just imaginary numbers?**

Like everything in life, bitcoins only have value because someone finds them valuable.

Bitcoins have the two ingredients necessary to serve as a measure of value:

* &amp;#x200B;

1. They are limited in availability / they are scarce.

* 2) More than one person wants to have them.

This is ultimately the same concept as any other currency. Or for that matter, anything else humans find valuable.

A gold nugget is just a shiny rock. But it's *your* shiny rock. You found it first. You like it. If someone wants your shiny rock, they're gonna have to give you something for it. Maybe a goat. No - *two* goats.

Each Bitcoin is just a math solution. But it's *your* math solution. You found it first. You like it. If someone wants your math solution, they're gonna have to give you something for it. Maybe a nickel. No - a dime.

When bitcoin first started out, that's all it was. It was just kind of a nebulous, silly thing on the internet. It was very easy to get a bitcoin, and they were worth next-to-nothing. People would laugh and trade a bitcoin for a penny, as a joke.

But there were a few people - collectors - who thought very highly of bitcoin. They liked the concept of a blockchain. They liked the idea of a virtual currency. So they started going around asking people for their bitcoins.

Some people gave their bitcoins away for free. They're worthless, after all, right?

But some people asked for something in return. A dollar, at first, maybe. Chump change. Beer money. And the collectors would pay it.

As bitcoins got harder and harder to find, people started realizing that their bitcoins were getting harder to replace. Suddenly, people didn't want to let go of their bitcoins for just a dollar. They started asking for ten dollars. And people paid it.

They started asking for fifty dollars. And people paid it.

A hundred dollars. Five hundred dollars.

Why did people keep paying it?

The same reason people are willing to trade you groceries for pieces of paper in your wallet: they think they'll be able to turn around and give those pieces of paper to someone else - hopefully for a little more than they gave you. (Or at the very least, at a fairly similar rate.)

People paid money for bitcoin because people paid money for bitcoin. It's cyclical, but that's how currency works. We only treat dollar bills as special because we know the rest of the world treats them as special, too. When we give up 8 hours of our life each day for a stack of paper bills, we're trusting that other people find those paper bills as valuable as we do. It's a self-reliant system.

**How do you spend/use bitcoins?**

At the very lowest level, it's as simple as ""Hey Joe, I'll give you 0.001BTC for that watch."" Then you use a bitcoin-trading app (there are tons of options, including mobile apps) to give him the BTC.

But that only works if Joe thinks bitcoins are valuable.

If he doesn't, you'll need to convert your bitcoins into something Joe finds valuable, like US dollars.

Fortunately, there are several sites that allow you to do exactly that. They will pay you US dollars for your bitcoins.

Why? Because they think they can re-sell your bitcoins for US dollars - OR they believe that bitcoins will maintain their value moving forward. Either one works.

Ultimately, these services - like any other business that exchanges money - operate under the assumption that this currency will continue to be traded for other valuable things.

**How do you find/mine bitcoins?**

Special computer programs (called ""miners"") that solve very complex math problems, trying to find correct answers (bitcoins).

Because it's so hard to find a bitcoin, nowadays, most people join ""mining pools"" - communities of people who all run these programs at the same time. When one person finds a bitcoin, the bitcoin gets split up between everyone who participated. The people who put in the most processing power get the biggest shares of the bitcoin.",2018-12-27 21:38:11

It works through the Bitcoin URI scheme. The payment terminal presents via NFC a Bitcoin URI that includes the recipient's address and the requested amount (in BTC). The Android operating system in the phone broadcasts a URI intent, and if you have at least one app installed that handles Bitcoin URIs, then it'll launch and parse the recipient and amount out of the URI. If you have more than one capable app installed and haven't chosen a default, then you'll be asked which app to use.

Just a list of other random shit this guy has done. Bought Avyd and fired the whole staff by basically saying they were all incompetent.

“When you come into a business that is not fully put together, a lot of times you come in and clear house, and that is exactly what I did. I know there has been a lot of speculation of people ‘leaving’ Avyd,” said Smith. “The only people that we kept was the front UI guy that I know personally and met up with to fire him out of respect for his well being. I then met him in person, and after speaking with him, I decided to keep him.”

“Procter and Gamble acquired a little brand called Gillette for $57 billion,” he said. “And they fired every single person. That’s over 6,000 people. Now does everyone stop knowing how to make razors? I don’t think so,” Smith said.

“If it was done, it would have been launched by now.”

The chatter i've heard from people in the scene is that he was thrown out of his partnerships with Allegiance and Str8 Rippin for basically not paying out what he was supposedly going to and general sketchiness. (I do not have a source for this, this is just what I have been told)

Employees of his company have targeted members of the Halo community using their own and fake twitter accounts, using homophobic slurs in one case with a prominent member.

He was involved at an organizational level during the Halo World Championships where the team submitted a fake roster involving players that were not on their team. This basically secured them a free ride to a million dollar World's tournament with players who no longer played for their org.

His partner in Denial has made his money pushing shitty Bitcoin alternatives and just recently bailed on Lindacoin which was his big push for something called SparkleCoin. His previous esports organization was tied into a league that Lindacoin was running and he lost the rights to it when he left.

These guys are all flash, no substance and shouldn't be treated as saviors of anything.

ecp16rg,etmetm,91,"Open your ledger nano s (apparently it's easy) and see if someone built in an long piece of wire as antenna to be able to press keys using UHF radio ;)

The ledger nano-s did get away pretty lightly. Basically most of the attacks are supply-chain related, so swapping out chips or implaning a radio device. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a failsafe way to tell whether your device is bugged. It's hard to do these kind of attacks on a large scale as it's involved to modify hardware - so buying it from a trusted vendor should be fine.

There is one more severe Ledger nano-s bug wrt to flashing custom firmware. It's possible to circumvent the blacklisting to write to certain memory areas by writing to another space that mirrors it. This should be fixable by implemeting whitelists as was stated in the talk. 

Nano Blue got a bit more than a blue eye. The change of colour when you press PIN keys on the display can be received and decoded using a software defined radio at a distance of several meters. I guess it could be fixed by not changing the colour of the buttons pressed.


Trezor got it pretty bad. They commended them for their open source work and good protection of the firmware verification code.  However the chip can be glitched so that it writes the seed and PIN code to RAM which can subsequently be dumped and seen in plain text. It's from a convenience function which allows you to retain seed and PIN when you upgrade the firmware. Apparently this feature is disabled when you use an additional passphrase when you set up your Trezor, so that seems to be the secure setup of choice.

1. Intro
2. Agree! I personally find Ethereum culture far saner, though I am a bit biased :)
3. Not an argument
4. I'm pretty sure Vlad would say the exact same thing about Bitcoin
5. The core [principles](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ) have been known for years, the core design for nearly a year, and details for months, with implementations on the way. So sharding is definitely not at the pipe dream stage at this point.
6. Sure, sharding is not yet finished. Though more incremental stuff has been going well, eg. uncle rates are at [near record lows despite very high chain usage](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1076802584688709632).
7. That review was off the mark in many ways, eg. see https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/1071111404340604929, and by the way CBC is not even a prerequisite for Serenity
8. Umm... you can definitely use Raiden with arbitrary ERC20s. That's why the interface currently uses WETH (the ERC20-fied version of ether) and not ETH
9. Ok
10. Sure, though as far as I understand there's still a low probability of finding routes for nontrivial amounts, and there's capital lockup griefing vectors, and privacy issues.... FWIW I personally never thought lightning is unworkable, it's just a design that inherently runs into ten thousand small issues that will likely take a very long time to get past.
11. Yay, Plasma!
12. Just because Peter Todd rejected something as ""insecure"" doesn't mean that it is. In general, the ethereum research community is quite convinced that the fundamental Plasma design is fine, and as far as I understand there are formal proofs on the way. The only insecurity that can't be avoided is mass exit vulns, and channel-based systems have those too.
13. Umm... we created a proof of work chain first because we did not have a satisfactory proof of stake algo initially?
14. And here's a set of long arguments from me on why proof of stake is just fine: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ. For a more philosophical piece, see https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51
15. Yes, we know about weak subjectivity, see https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/. It's really not that bad, especially given that users need to update their clients once in a while anyway, oh and by the way even if the weak subjectivity assumption is broken an attacker _still_ needs to gather up that pile of old keys making up 51% of the stake. And also to defend against _that_ there's [Universal Hash Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phXohYF0xGo).
16. Oh I definitely agree that proof of work was superior for bootstrap, and I liked it back then especially because it actually managed to be reasonably egalitarian around 2009-2012 before ASICs fully took over. But at the present time it doesn't really have that nice attribute.
17. I try to credit people whenever I can; half my blog and ethresear.ch posts have a ""special thanks"" section right at the top. Sometimes we end up re-inventing stuff, and sometimes we end up hearing about stuff, forgetting it, and later re-inventing it; that's life as an autodidact. And if you feel you've been unfairly not credited for something, always feel free to comment, people have done this and I've edited.
18. Ok, go on.
19. ...
20. ...
21. ...
22. See above for links as to why I think proof of stake is great.
23. See my rebuttal to Tuur's rebuttal :)
24. Yeah, I haven't really emphasized perpetual income to stakers as a selling point in years. I actually favor rewards being as low as possible while still being high enough for security.
25. Ok, let's hear about what the errors are...
26. Sure, but (i) the use of layer 1 for consumer payments is definitely, in bitcoin ideology, ""just a phase"", (ii) I don't think you can make analogies between consensus protocols and other kinds of protocols, and between soft forking consensus protocols and protocol changes in other protocols, that easily, (iii) plenty of people _do_ believe that hyperbitcoinization as a goal. Oh by the way: https://twitter.com/tuurdemeester/status/545993119599460353
27. Ok, go on.
28. ...
29. The intended goal of the difficulty bomb was to prevent the protocol from ossifying, by ensuring that it _has to_ hard fork eventually to reset the difficulty bomb, at which point the status quo bias in favor of not changing _other_ protocol rules at the same time would be weaker. Though forcing a switch to PoS was definitely a key goal.
30. How is that a broken promise? There was no social contract to only replace the difficulty-bombed protocol with a PoS chain.
31. Agree that was over-optimistic, though the part of the metaphor that's problematic is the ""be done with complex apps in a couple hours"" part, NOT the ""general-purpose languages are great"" part.
32. See above
33. To be fair, risk is reduced because Bitcoin _does less_.
34. We never advocated ""putting everything on the blockchain"". The phrase ""world computer"" was never meant to be interpreted as ""everyone's personal desktop"", but rather as a common platform specifically for the parts of applications that require consensus on shared state. As evidence of this, notice how Whisper and Swarm were part of the vision as complements to Ethereum right from the start.
35. Umm.... I just spun up a node from scratch last week. On a consumer laptop.
36. See above
37. Yes, the DAO fork did violate the notion of absolute immutability. However, the ""forking the DAO will lead to doom and gloom"" crowd was very wrong in one key way: it did NOT work as a precedent justifying all sorts of further state interventions. The community clearly drew a line in the sand by firmly rejecting [EIP 867](http://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/867), and [EIP 999](http://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/999) seems to now also be going nowhere. So it seems like there's some evidence that the social contract of ""moderately but not infinitely strong immutability"" actually _can_ be stable.
38. See above
39. Suppose I were to tomorrow sign up to work directly for Kim Jong Un. What concretely would happen to the Ethereum protocol? I suspect very little; I am mostly involved in the Serenity work, and the other researchers have proven very capable of both pushing the spec forward even without me and catching any mistakes with my work. So I don't think any argument involving me applies. And we ended up deciding _not_ to do more semi-closed meetings.
40. I personally am confident in the talents of our core researchers, and our community of academic partners. Most recently the latter group includes people from Starkware, Stanford CBR, IC3, and other groups.
41. I have no idea who described Lucius Meredith's work as being important for the Serenity roadmap.... oh and by the way, RChain is NOT an ""Ethereum scaling company""
42. Honestly, I don't see why Ethereum Gandalf needs to save the day, because I don't see what is in danger and needs to be saved...
43. Yay!
44. Agree there. And BTW I generally think financial conflicts of interest are somewhat overrated; social conflicts/tribal biases are the bigger problem much of the time. Though those two kinds of misalignments do frequently overlap and reinforce each other so they're difficult to fully disentangle.
45. Ethereum was never about ""smart BTC contracts""..... even ""Ethereum as a Mastercoin-style meta-protocol"" was intended to be built on top of Primecoin.
46. Ok, good.
47. What do you mean ""instead of""? We _did_ create an open source project and testnet! Whether or not ETH is a security is a legal question; seems like SEC people agree it's not: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-not-securities-but-some-cryptocurrencies-may-be-sec-official-says.html
48. Nothing in the ethereum roadmap requires time-travel-like technical advancements or anything remotely close to that. Proof: we basically have all the fundamental technical advancements we need at this point.
49. Got it.
50. See my rebuttal to Greg from 2 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4g1bh6/greg_maxwells_critique_of_ethereum_blockchains/

Zooming out a bit, I think the criticism from these angles really misses (i) just how valuable ""rich statefulness"" is in enabling more complex applications and protocols, (ii) just how much work is being done from different angles to implement protocols for various purposes, eg. https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up to give an example that Tuur did not mention at all, (iii) the progress that the Ethereum community has made in expanding and professionalizing even in the last year alone, (iv) just how far along PoS and sharding are, and (v) that many of the objections to PoS in principle [and probably sharding too] are cultural, not technical (""weak subjectivity is bad"") and it's possible to deal with that by.... having a culture that's fine with the tradeoffs.",2018-12-29 13:56:48

ecqv0t5,Sfdao91,161,"He's trying too hard. Tuur, just a many other 'influencers',  got lucky because they invested early in Bitcoin. Now they are self-proclaimed experts, but really most of the arguments are wrong or deliberately misleading. He calls himself an economist but hasn't any project, paper or degree to show for. He's all the time *concerned* or *worried* about Ethereum, but actually. If he really was, why not talk about the other obvious bad projects damaging the crypto space? Or why aren't you spending your time on Bitcoin? I have no doubt Ethereum will deliver and they will look even bigger fools in hindsight,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2/ First, ETH’s architecture &amp; culture is \_opposite\_ that of Bitcoin, and yet claims to offer same solutions: decentralization, immutability, SoV, asset issuance, smart contracts, …  Second, ETH is considered a crypto ‘blue chip’, thus colors perception of uninformed newcomers.

First of all, how does Ethereum claim to have all these things any less than Bitcoin? As far as I know, bitcoin mining is more centralized and since when does smart contracts is a solution that bitcoin offers? It has also been shown many times that Ethereum, in fact, has more SoV features than Bitcoin. Tuur claims to be following Ethereum since 2014, then he should know the reason Vitalik created Ethereum was exactly the lack of smart contract capabilities.

&gt;3/ I've followed Ethereum since 2014 &amp; feel a responsibility to share my concerns. IMO contrary to its marketing, ETH is at best a science experiment. It’s now valued at $13B, which I think is still too high.

Which marketing? Please don't get into semantics, you call it a science experiment on purpose to downplay that what Ethereum is trying to achieve is groundbreaking and has never been done before. What you think about the price is irrelevant, unless you can show some reason behind valuations.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4/ I agree with Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir that it’s not money, not safe, and not scalable.

In the same thread, Vlad says that Bitcoin isn't money either. Is it necessarily bad that Ethereum isn't money? It's much more. Referring to safe and scalable, Vlad didn't say that it's never going to be able to scale. Why would Vlad work on scaling solutions if he thinks it's never going to scale. Tuur, is Bitcoin scalable?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;7/ Recently, a team of reputable developers decided to peer review a widely anticipated Casper / sharding white paper, concluding that it does not live up to its own claims.

Very misleading Tuur, you refer to casper, but mislead the general public because this is casper CBC which is still in research, also the so-called article that critics that paper is deliberately criticizing an out of scope subject of the unfinalized paper (finality if I'm not mistaken).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 8/ On the 2nd layer front, devs are now trying to scale Ethereum via scale via state channels (ETH’s version of Lightning), but it is unclear whether main-chain issued ERC20 type tokens will be portable to this environment. 

Who better than the dev lead of Raiden, a 2nd layer development lead can respond to that?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The [~~@~~**raiden\_network**](https://twitter.com/raiden_network) allows any ERC20 compatible token to be transferred via payment channels on testnets. On mainnet only wrapped ether token is allowed at the moment. And that's only raiden. Other L2 projects also progress. You have not done your research on [~~#~~**ethereum**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ethereum?src=hash) L2 scaling 

 https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1078723832444276737 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;10/ Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is now live, and is growing at rapid clip.

So misleading, he's referring to another tweet with no link or source whatsoever. It has grown from 1 to 10, channels so 1000%? Congratulations! Show us metrics, how many channels are they, how many money has there been transferred using the lightning network and more importantly, is it really decentralized? I think we all know the answer to that...

Also, see the tweet below:

&gt;I took my hub down because:  - Funds have to be online/hot. Introduces counterparty compared to hardware/paper wallet - Funds are locked in channels. If the other side of the channel is unreachable, you need to wait up to weeks - Earns nothing. Much less than hosting cost

[https://twitter.com/abrkn/status/1078193601190989829](https://twitter.com/abrkn/status/1078193601190989829)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;18/ One of my big concerns is that sophistry and marketing hype is a serious part of Ethereum’s success so far, and that overly inflated expectations have lead to an inflated market cap.

Yes, developers really care about marketing, Ethereum is one of the fastest growing github projects, those projects don't contain any marketing at all. Those are actually people with knowledge working and building instead of pretending to be knowledgeable. Projects like EOS or TRON have a lot more hype and marketing, yet fail to grasp really developer traction. Because in the end, developers care about what they can do, the tools and if a project is really decentralized. Look at the weekly meetups all over the world.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;25/ In his response to my tweet, Vitalik adopted my format to “play the same game” in criticizing Bitcoin. My criticisms weren't addressed, and his response was riddled with errors. Yet his followers gave it +1,000 upvotes!

No, he used the same format to demonstrate how stupid your format was. Looks like you don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;27/ This kind of sophistry is exhausting and completely counter-productive, but it can be very convincing for an uninformed retail public.

Good job on projecting. The only person constantly posting misleading and half-truths is you. People are constantly building and trying to achieve something, the only thing you do is criticize. Being critical is not necessarily bad, however, yours lack any foundation, proof and doesn't offer suggestions at all. That's called unconstructive criticism, or counter-productive.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;29/ In order to “guarantee” the transition to PoS’ utopia of perpetual income (staking coins earns interest), a “difficulty bomb” was embedded in the protocol, which supposedly would force miners to accept the transition.

No, you're wrong, the difficulty bomb is not to force miners to accept the transition, the difficulty bomb is to force a hardfork.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;34/ Another huge issue that Ethereum has is with scaling. By putting “everything on the blockchain” (which stores everything forever) and dubbing it “the world computer”, you are going to end up with a very slow and clogged up system.

It's not intended to store everything on chain. Besides work is being done and proposals are made to handle that such as rent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;35/ By now the Ethereum bloat is so bad that cheaply running an individual node is practically impossible for a lay person. ETH developers are also imploring people  to not deploy more smart contract apps on its blockchain.

Great way to refer to the *Ethereum Developers* when only Afri posted a tweet of it. Somehow Tuur forgot to mention that Vitalik disagrees with the statement of Afri, half-truths and misleading again. Way to go Tuur.

&gt;Disagree. Most dapps have lots of room to gas-optimize, and even if \*you\* don't your dapp running raises gas fees and pressures \*others\* to gas-optimize. There's \*plenty\* of low-value spam on chain. And everyone should be looking into layer-2 solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;47/ Here’s why Ethereum is dubious to me: rather than creating an open source project &amp; testnet to work on these interesting computer science problems, its founders instead did a securities offering, involving many thousands of clueless retail investors.

No, they didn't, the SEC clearly stated Ethereum is not a security. Also what an insult to the people that participated in the ICO, who are you to decide if they were clueless? Looks like they didn't do too bad after all.

ecqmux3,aminok,123,"It's unbelievable what a farce Bitcoin SV is. Its creator and self-professed Satoshi calls on anyone integrating code for a decentralized marketplace into Bitcoin to be thrown in prison:

[https://medium.com/@craig\_10243/drugs-fraud-and-murder-ddf12208ae8b](https://medium.com/@craig_10243/drugs-fraud-and-murder-ddf12208ae8b)

&gt;A base contract with DSV would be instantly flagged by any miner not seeking to explain the facilitation of illegal activities. You see, a contract designed specifically for a purpose is not even remotely close to the exchange of cash or other transactions within Bitcoin today. There are only a few pools, and it is the pool job to verify the data as miners seek a hash. So, the individual miners are not liable, the pools are. Solo miners would also be in breach, if they accepted a DSV transaction.    
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;In China, fraudulent and deceptive business practices may constitute criminal offences under the Criminal Law (1997, last amended 2015), as well as administrative offences under the Anti-Unfair Competition Law (AUCL) (1993), the Advertisement Law (amended in 2015), the Tendering and Bidding Law (2000), the Securities Law (2006, amended in 2013), the Regulation on Futures Trading, (2007, last amended in 2016), and other measures. The Chinese Public Security Agency (PSA) (A.K.A. Public Security Bureau (PSB)) and by the public prosecutor agency, the procuratorate are of course the easiest to sell this to. The procuratorate makes charging decisions, and tries cases before the court, which issues verdicts and imposes sentences (including incarceration or criminal fines).

and

&gt;I am certain the **Chinese government** will have a good time with all this…

So, you can ignore me all you like when I say, I have already put the charge sheets together as a template for the US, UK, and Chinese authorities.

Infact individual BTC pools have more hash rate than the whole of the BAB network.  
  

As a transactional currency, BAB is entirely useless.  Most exchanges requires over 12 confirmations on BAB deposits. Bitfinex requires 20 confirmations (i.e. 2+ hours) . For use as transactional currency, you need faster confirmation. 

Knowing the toxic community that promotes BAB, its entirely possible that merchants get scammed with double spends if they use BAB. The payment processor (in this case opennode) will be the one holding their dicks in their hands in case BAB gets attacked and merchants lose money. There is significant downside in adding insecure shitcoins using BTC mining algo's but with a fraction of BTC's hashrate 

BAB really has one value. Zero. Its headed there, maybe not today but eventually. Every single fork of bitcoin is worth nothing at all. For one mining algorithm, only one coin can exist and the other coins using that algo are all insecue",2018-12-30 17:38:27

We all should be supporting each other, working on cross chain swaps, doing things that will help get archaic SEC laws changes, and adoption for crypto grow. Together... 

1) it’s clear that the maximalists only have 1 asset in their portfolio, which after investing rule number 1. Buy low, sell high, diversification is #2 and they are breaking it. But also

2) this is a projection of weakness, they don’t go after XRP, or EOS because they know the only other true decentralized project with high dev adoption is Ethereum.

3) they are using the same nonsense arguments that nocoiners and the banks have used against Bitcoin, it’s slow... there’s no real world use etc... like seriously they are acting like the centralized entities we are all trying to disrupt. Like look in the mirror, Ethereum isn’t scalable? Bitcoin is in the same boat. Price down over 80%? Bitcoin too.. everyone has scaling problems, and 99% of all crypto is slow.

Did good last time out! A lot of narrow odds on this card, hopefully we can get a nice profit!

Don't have any intention of ever charging for picks, but the research for these takes a while. If anyone finds enough value here to want to repay, any gifts would be cool beans.

Best of luck, everyone!

**/// GENERAL! ///**

- Confidence picks are all in bold. Sometimes I start feeling something during the card, but I generally only put significant bets on fights when they reach a percentage of 65&amp;#37; or above.

- The percentage indicates my confidence level on the outcome. For most picks, they are straight indicators of how confident I am, not considering odds. For heavy favorites creeping past \-350 or so, I might dial back the enthusiasm. Deciding where to slot everyone is a rough formula, but I've had a lot of success with it.

- The kiwi 🥝 (65&amp;#37;), grapes 🍇 (70&amp;#37; / 75&amp;#37;),🍍 pineapple (80&amp;#37; / 85&amp;#37;), and watermelon 🍉 (90&amp;#37; / 95&amp;#37;) are to denote each tier of confidence. When I consider where to place the picks, there's a bigger mental jump for me going from one fruit to another than, say, the difference between 70&amp;#37; and 75&amp;#37;, or 80&amp;#37; and 85&amp;#37;.

---
---
---
---
---

**/// HOW! ///**

- Obviously, I bet more as the confidence level goes up, but I don't bet in neat units. It sucks when the odds come out and two of the ones you felt good about are -245 and -360. But team those up, and it moves to -125. So I play a lot of short parlays of two or three picks.

- I do most of my betting as the card progresses, reassess when I need to. I try to be careful not to get too greedy, so I might hedge a little bit on a parlay here and there. Small investments can be worth the insurance you get back.

- These picks are intended more as a guide to what I like. I'd recommend considering them against what you like, not as something to blindly tail. But it's your money, do as you wish.
