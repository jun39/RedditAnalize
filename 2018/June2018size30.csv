In addition, this uses cherry picked dates.  Bitcoin has, on average, gone up almost an infinite percent since it was first invented by Satoshi.  No other investment has done that ever.

dzwbt1n,evilnight,115,"Tags can do a hell of a lot, too.

If 1/3 of the topics in a group all have the same tag, such as ~comp being overrun with [netsec] content, we know it's time to create a ~comp.netsec aka ~netsec so that place has a home of its own, and it'll *start* pre-seeded with all of the [netsec] tagged content, and all of the users who participate in those threads.

Content that is objectively valuable (such as /r/science AMAs) can receive an [ama] tag that applies a vote-multiplier effect, with careful gating of who can use this tag (mods, curators, editors) to prevent abuse.

Tags like [breaking.news] in news communities and [fresh] in music communities (used for new releases) can self-modify (into just [news]) or self-delete (like [fresh]) after a specified time period, so that they maintain their purpose of finding new content.

Spoiler tags and nsfw tags can have multiple classifications, so you could tell the site to filter out [nsfw.gore] but leave [nsfw.discussion] intact. Tags give the users a terrific amount of power to filter their own content.

Almost all data out there everywhere *is already tagged* so, when someone submits a link and clicks on the tildes equivalent of a (suggest title) button, it can not only do the title, but look up all relevant data about the link and auto-populate the tags as well, which the user then only needs to proofread. Editor/curator-level access can come with the ability to add or change tags or links (to combat freebooting and inaccurate tagging).

Tags on the comments like [joke] or [flame] or [offtopic] can be used to help sort out the comments into similar topic groups and assist with moderation duties. These tags can even outright *replace* simple, low-level comments.

Don't like reposts? That's no problem - when the site detects a repost, it can auto-tag it as [repost] and the people who don't want to see them can just filter out everything that's got those tags sitewide, putting that eternal battle to bed forever.

Moderators should also be able to define their own tags - something like /r/changemyview's delta system could be built right in as an addon to the tagging system. People will invent mechanics we can't even imagine using this.

Tags can make the search engine into a beast, providing views of content that are *separate* from the communities that created that content. This can be extended into header bars (like in /r/listentothis) that provide views of a group's content and even the ability to subscribe to only a subset of any group's content.

Every group has a tag signature, so if you have ~economics.cryptocurrency.bitcoin aka ~bitcoin as a group, all the content submitted there is automatically tagged with [economics] and [cryptocurrency] and [bitcoin]. The communities themselves therefore apply the most important and relevant tags as a function of their name and location in the hierarchy. That provides some real uniformity. 

This is just from our first two weeks of talking about what tagging can do for us. I'm sure there will be plenty of other ideas over time. The duality of the tag/hierarchy model overcomes the failings of both systems and provides the advantages of both systems.",2018-06-01 04:31:42

dzxqw9a,vegarde,89,"LND v0.4.2 was released this week. It is in active use, in production. It hasn't implemented watchtowers yet, but that's one of the first priorities from now. This will also pave the way for full function mobile wallets, with receive functionality.  


There's code being commited to the LND repositiory every day. I update my node about every time I see a significant improvement. It's quick and easy, though since there's no package repositiries etc, it needs a willingness to learn git etc. Not that hard.

Of major medium\-term improvements we'll see, is Atomic Multipath Payments. This will make the liquidity problem much smaller \(not finding a large enough path\), and makes it possible to use channels with much less liquidity.

Onion Routing is of course implemented, but that has nothing to do with the ""ultimate routing solution"" that we'll eventually need. There's going to have to be serious work there, but not that urgent. We have time. We can even do it in steps, improve on the current and find an intermediate solution. Modern software development suggests releasing early, no need to solve \*everything\* at once. LN in its current form is usable, more development will make it \*more\* usable.  


Conclusion: LN is launched. From here, it will only become better. Do you want to sit and wait for someone to declare it's \*finished\*? Won't happen. Bitcoin isn't finished, either. No product is finished before it's dead.  


Is it beginner\-friendly? Probably not. If you are moderately interested and know your way around a command line, now is definitely the time to get involved. And if you just want to test it, download Eclair and fund it with a few 100k satoshi and a couple of channels. You'll get to see it in action, but it's more educational to run a full node like LN or c\-lightning.

dzwllj8,DCinvestor,71,"I'm not generally a big fan of Crypt0, but [this video today really rubbed me the wrong way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os_OMoRNLbY)  He basically called out the Ethereum community for being critical of EOS.  He seems to think that we should be nicer to EOS, and just exist quietly in our own little corner of blockchain land.  He seems to think this concern is ""immature.""  Then, he creates a false equivalence with the Ethereum community's backlash against EOS with the Bitcoin community's initial backlash against Ethereum (which was driven more by maximalism than anything).

There are many things wrong with his logic, but I'd just ask Omar / Crypt0 this (someone feel free to page him if they know his username - *edit*, I've been told it's /u/darkestchaos ): *Which project called themselves the ""Ethereum Killer"" from Day One?  Which project ran an exceptionally greedy year long ICO on the platform it hoped to kill?  Which platform is coping with insane technical issues just days before launch?  And which project spends more on marketing and slick videos which appeal more to people's greed than on developing a meaningful community?*

These are only parts of the reason why you see some in this community lashing out against EOS.  I don't think many of us think of EOS as actual competition for Ethereum; rather, I think many of us find it offensive that a network controlled by 21 block producers (by proxy declaration) with an absurd token distribution process designed to maximize profit for the issuer can be considered a decentralized network on par with Ethereum or Bitcoin.  We are concerned that this model of centralized blockchain could taint meaningful discussion around the importance of decentralization in so many spaces where it could make a vital difference for many in this world.  And we are sad that some uninformed investors are going to get fleeced to the tune of $4 billion.  Block.one is selling you a *product* with EOS tokens, and they will pocket most of the money they raise.  They will spend a portion of it on trying to ""build an ecosystem,"" until such time it is obvious that such expenditures are not viable.

And I've got news for you EOS community: if a few posts from angry ETH ""fanboys"" (who are really only pointing out the inconvenient truth) upsets you, then you have a whole new kind of hurt coming for you with launching a live blockchain in an adversarial environment.  Angry Reddit posts may be the least of your problems.",2018-06-01 07:00:20

dzxeri2,MidAugust,64,"It isn’t P=NP, the question posed is whether P=NP is a true statement or not.

The proposition is as follows: are solutions that are easy to verify also easy to solve for?

There’s a lot of mathematical questions that are not algebraically solvable on a formulaic basis, believe it or not. This is the basis for cryptography: the key that unlocks a certain file, for example, is based on a mathematical problem that is unsolvable except for guessing every possible answer. However, once guessed correctly it’s easily verifiable.

One common example is that given 100 rocks of varying weights not known, how would one balance a scale by creating two different towers? Since we don’t know the weight of the individual rocks, we have to keep stacking until the scale balances. There’s no algebraic way to solve. However, once you guess the correct amount, you can see the scale is balanced. It’s easily veritable. You could do it with your own eyes. For mathematical equations, you could verify the answer is correct with a simple calculator.

This is also the technology behind bitcoin: bitcoin itself represents the solution to one of these mathematical problems. Bitcoin “mining” is simply computers everywhere guessing the correct answer until one of the computers guesses the correct answer. Again, it’s really easy to see the answer is correct once you get it, but there’s no way to systematically solve the equation except for guessing every possible answer.

So, back to P=NP. The idea here, is this: Are problems that are easy to verify also easy to solve? This is an ongoing problem in mathematics (and computer science). Some people think there is a way to easily solve problems that are easy to verify that hasn’t been discovered yet, others think there is no way and that it’s impossible. However, there has not yet been a proof to show either side correct.",2018-06-01 15:45:50

Also, if you close the accounts on some bitcoin exchanges, it may be impossible to reopen them later when he is more mature.  More consequences to think about.

I really hope said lawyer didn't say anything about needing you to pay probate or legal fees before you can inherit.  (Any such fees would be paid by the estate, not by you personally!  But ""person you know has died and left you money in his estate"" is a common variant of the 419 scam.)

&gt; I'm looking for any long term advice, to make this money last all my life

My first piece of advice would be to never touch the principal amount.  $5M is a life-changing amount of money, but it can also be a life-*destroying* amount -- it's enough that you never have to work again, but it's small enough that you could go on a spending spree (buying a couple houses and sports cars, flying around the world in first class) and find yourself bankrupt a few years from now.  So rather than thinking about this as ""I just got $5M"", I'd think of it as ""I just got a job paying $150k/year for the rest of my life"".

How do you turn $5M into $150k/year?  You invest the money, and draw out a small amount every year.  Investments to avoid: GICs (safe but absurdly low return), Mutual funds (they take huge fees for managing your money), Individual stocks (no, your friend who ""is good with money"" isn't able to pick stocks better than the thousands of PhDs working at investment funds), bitcoin/gold/tulip bulbs/etc (being non-productive assets, these basically only perform well during market bubbles).  You want to take that money and toss it into exchange traded funds which will have performance broadly matching the entire market.

I called this a job.  I'm serious, but it's a very different job from any other job you'll ever have.  Your job here is to **do nothing**.  And it's a really really hard job.  Investors screw this up all the time.  They see the stock market go down and they get scared and sell their investments.  They hear about a hot stock and they buy it.  Don't do this.  Just stick money into ETFs and leave it there.  Every few months, pull up a spreadsheet which tells you which ETFs you have too much of in your portfolio (e.g., if the Canadian stock market goes up, you could have more Canadian equities than your predetermined target) and rebalance -- and at the same time, pull out your annual spending money.  (You can hire someone to do this for you, but it's really not hard and most financial advisors will want to get themselves tens of thousands in fees for a few hours of work.)

&gt; and whether or not I should keep my job.

I would recommend against making any dramatic life changes.  Keep your job until you're used to being rich; you can always quit later.",2018-06-02 11:51:37

dzzra4g,Dawnguardian286,45,"Interestingly enough, when I came across a PC that my dad had built about 9 years prior, it had a Phenom II, a GT630, and 4GB of DDR3-1333. It got by on some games, like Overwatch, but I had to turn the settings to potato mode to get 45FPS average. GTA V ran, but stuttered in open areas and in high speed cars, but that was remedied with an upgrade of ram, from 4GB to 12GB. I know, also, from my experience, that your CPU will probably have enough bandwidth to support an RX 460 or 1050 without bottlenecking (90% CPU usage at most). This will definitely make games look better and run better, as now, I can play Overwatch at epic settings with no bottlenecking or frame dropping, and Fallout 4 at low/medium, with about 50FPS average. So, if you can find some DDR3 RAM and a 460/1050 for a reasonable price, go for it. Search locally, ask friends (especially ones who Bitcoin mine) if they have any extra cards, or look on eBay for a used model. You will not regret it. 

As for what you can do now, try going into task manager and eliminating all non essential programs, or plugging in a large USB drive to use for ReadyBoost (Though it's hit or miss for a lot of games.)

e0085n1,SteveWarlock,39,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

e019wwn,wsmithston,37,"A contract that relies on trust \(usually\) requires a central authority. What Satoshi Nakamoto realized was that in order to remove the need for trust in a third party, the trusted third party must have something at stake to keep its behaviour aligned with interests of the user trusting the third party. So in the case of Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash, the miners are the trusted third parties and their stake is the energy they spend on creating the next Proof\-of\-Work for a valid block of transactions. \(Therefore a Proof\-of\-Work is also a Proof\-of\-Stake, but the converse isn't true.\) If the block doesn't only consist of valid transactions, the Proof\-of\-Work is worthless and their stake \(the energy spent\) lost.

**So how is Dash different from Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash?**

For the most essential part, which is the production of valid blocks, it's basically the same except that the miners only receive 45&amp;#37; of the block reward. The rest of the reward goes to the masternodes \(45&amp;#37;\) and the treasury \(10&amp;#37;\). This of course begs the question: ""what is the purpose of the masternodes, and why are they being paid?""

Masternodes were introduced into the Dash network because the Dash network believes that in order for a cryptocurrency to be successful, there are more services apart from block production that need to part of the protocol. A lot of these services and operations are normally associated with a central authority or trusted third party, for example the mixing of coins, [the allocation of treasury funds](https://dashvotetracker.com/past.php), the storage of user data, and so forth... How could these services possibly ever be implemented in a decentralized manner?  And here comes the heart of the trick... You can create an open decentralized oracle which acts like a central authority and at the same time keep the system trustless by simply aligning the central authorities' behaviour with network's interests using the same recipe: the trusted party must have a stake to lose. This is why masternodes \(which you should really think of as service nodes\) must put up 1000 Dash collateral.",2018-06-03 19:10:51

e026zwm,sheldon_sa,51,"30 years ago, I was in your position. I wanted to learn how to program in an in-demand language but at school they only taught us Logo, BASIC and Turbo Pascal. Hardly exciting stuff. None of the technology you mentioned existed, the Web was just a dream and MS Windows was more like an app and less like an OS. The point is, what is hot today will be obsolete tomorrow, and that is a good thing, because this is how we make progress.

I know this is not what you asked, but t if present me could give high school me some advice (besides buying Apple shares and Bitcoin) it would be this:

- Think beyond just being a programmer for the rest of your life. You might want to start your own business, become a manager, move into sales, or whatever. Think about the skills you might need for that: accounting, economics, etc. and make sure that you develop those alongside your programming experience.

- Learn how to market and sell yourself and your programs. All programmers are in sales - even if it is just to convince a project manager of an idea.

- Learn how to write good proposals, requirement specs, use cases, test cases etc, all the steps and deliverables of software development. Add that to your portfolio.

- Many developers are in demand for their domain knowledge much more than their programming knowledge. Eg payroll developers, software used in certain types of devices etc. It helps if you have an interest in a certain area.

To answer your question more specifically, I would focus on machine learning, IOT, cloud application development, security and integration. Interesting applications are BluePrism and MuleSoft.

Hope this helps!

e01lu2o,acetmesis,45,"Hello, I'll try to address this point by point.

First off thanks for raising this criticism: it seems to be a recurring theme, so it would be good to clear the air a little and try to set this misconception straight.

**""Few times team changed their roadmap.""** 

The roadmap Stratis released around a year ago was very aggressive. Obviously, they needed to revise it when it wasn't achievable. Chief amongst the milestones for many people was the Breeze with TumbleBit (now called the Breeze Privacy Protocol). This is the first ever decentralised tumbling service. Being a first of a kind, there is no precedent or metre stick against which to judge the speed of development. Evidently, this was to Stratis's detriment the first time round. It seems that they have since had a much better idea of the time it takes to deliver this particular tech, as they have hit every Breeze milestone ahead of schedule according the more recent roadmaps, as well as even providing version releases which were beyond what was promised (as per this roadmap: https://stratisplatform.com/2017/09/29/stratis-roadmap-update/,
the **Breeze Wallet** *Bitcoin &amp; Stratis Beta TestNet*, **Breeze Wallet** *Bitcoin &amp; Stratis MainNet* and the **Stratis Masternode** *Alpha version* were all released on or ahead of time, HOWEVER we also received an unscheduled release of the Breeze Wallet with Masternodes beta on Mainnet! At this time, Stratis overdelivered with the Breeze Wallet and BPP)

**""Breeze wallet is should be relesed before 6 months.""** 

The Breeze wallet was released, some time ago. It is the first EVER C# Full Block SPV multi-chain wallet. Hopefully you can see this from my response to the previous point.

**""Smart contracts are good, but they are in alpha versoin. So I assume that we will have alpha 1.0, then alpha 1.2 and so on... It's not funcional yet.""**

You should join the Discord (link: https://discord.gg/9tDyfZs), if you haven't already! There's a #smart_contracts channel on there which should give you a good idea about the current state of Stratis's smart contracts. Suffice it to say, your fear that ""there will not be working product by the end of this year"" may well be laid to rest after having spent ten minutes going through that channel.

**""I also cant understand why they didnt updated website.""**

I agree with this point. The website definitely needs attention. Fortunately, they are in the process of doing a significant update/redesign of the website. However, we have no timeline about this. I think there are a few areas of the website which could do with some major updating. For example, the team section is wrong. There are currently more than twenty members of the team working for Stratis. I don't know the exact number, could be as high as thirty, which is why this section of the website could do with an update.

**""Correct me if I am wrong, but Stratis team raised 915 BTC during ICO. With that money (just BTC, without counting forks) they could hire a bunch of people (if they are not able to deliver project at the time) and finish most of the things by the end of last year.""**

They raised 915 BTC, yes. I don't want to assume what your familiarity with tech development is, so please excuse me if I sound like I'm being patronising, but you're wrong to suggest that ""more developers = faster development"". The speed of development with Stratis has been fast. Hopefully I'll be able to demonstrate this to you in one of the following points.

**""If we take a look at other project, they have huge comunity and that is what developers people are looking for.""**

Are you familiar with Stratis Development Foundation (http://stratisdevelopmentfoundation.com/)? It is an effective and valuable community run development incentive. It serves as a forum for collaboration and education, with payments made to SDF workers who make code contributions, write tutorials, create content valuable to the Stratis ecosystem and much more. Stratis has a wonderful community, and it is already starting to rival other major projects in terms of leveraging the community resource.

**""It was a long ago when CEO responded to some of the questions from the comunity.""**

I can't speak for Chris, but this is my take on this. Back when Stratis was still very much a start-up and had little by way of deliverables by which to measure the capability of the company, it was important that Chris, Krushang et. al. were active in the way they were. They were needed to reassure the investors that their investment was safe. That's not necessary anymore. The proof is right there in front of your face on the GitHub, in the releases and the products.

**""While he and other theme members should be very active answering the questions.""**

They are! On the official Stratis Discord, the team members are very active and always answering questions, providing support and guiding community developers. All day, all night, pretty much. The Stratis team are there, doing more than they need to. They're not going to waste time talking about the price of the Strat coin, but they do all that you would expect of them in terms of support and communication with the community, especially the community of developers currently coming to grips with the Stratis tech.

**""Do we know how much Stratis team have members? I dont think that there is a lot of people behind the project, because development is very very slow.""**

I don't know the exact number of team members (between 20 and 30 I think, with at least 10 to 20 of them being developers), however I do know it is *categorically* wrong to say ""development is very very slow."" To date, Stratis has released:

- An ICO Platform, in full production release, a fully customisable, FREE, crowdfunding platform built from the ground up in C#
 (https://stratisplatform.com/2018/05/09/stratis-ico-platform-release/). The first of its kind.

- Modular Full Nodes on MainNet built from the ground up in C#, which allow a developer to easily pick and choose from the suite of tools developed for the Stratis Platform (https://stratisplatform.com/2018/03/28/stratis-full-node-beta-release/). The first of its kind.

- A Full Node executable GUI on MainNet, Stratis's very own staking wallet serving the C# MainNet (https://stratisplatform.com/2018/04/11/stratis-full-node-gui-mainnet-beta-release/). The first of its kind.

- The Breeze Wallet on MainNet, a Full Block SPV (light) multi-chain wallet supporting Bitcoin and Stratis, built from the ground up in C# (https://stratisplatform.com/2017/11/21/breeze-wallet-mainnet-beta-release/). The first of its kind.

- The Breeze Privacy Protocol in beta on MainNet undergoing a private round of testing, the first EVER decentralised tumbling service including Masternodes of 250k Strat (https://stratisplatform.com/2017/12/12/breeze_protocol_beta_release/). The first of its kind.

- Smart Contracts alpha on testnet, the *first ever* C# smart contracts, allowing developers to leverage the .NET ecosystem while building and auditing contracts, with access to the full suite of tools available within that same ecosystem. A massive step forward for the smart contract space. (https://stratisplatform.com/2018/05/16/stratis-smart-contracts-in-csharp/). Again, the very first of its kind.

I haven't included some of the other things Stratis have released, like the Android Stratis Identity app, because this is already becoming a very long post. Nor have I included Stratis's C# NStratis rewrite of the Bitcoin protocol, even though that alone is a huge feat. It only takes one quick glance at Stratis's GitHub to get some idea of how impressive the pace of Stratis's development is. Moreover, we've got Sidechains in the pipeline, with an alpha release penned in for by the end of this month (June).

I'm not sure why I keep hearing that Stratis is slow when it comes to development, given that it is demonstrably untrue.

Perhaps it's because Stratis doesn't scream and shout about what they do and what they achieve. Instead, they commit that energy and those resources TO doing and TO achieving. ",2018-06-04 00:39:02

On PC you have to pay twice as much money as a console to have a decent chance at running the game. 4 times as much or more to run newer games. 

$300 for console. And who says I pay for my Xbox live? They have a points system that can easily earn you the amount of points necessary for a free year. Boom. Nearly Every AAA game for the next 5-7 years are tailored to be playable for Xbox. 

$800-$1500+ for a pc. And you better be relatively knowledgeable on pc to make sure you don’t infect it with malware making it run slower. Or just the slow drain over time that all PC’s experience. And hope that neither your CPU, GPU, RAM, etc end up bottlenecking you. Especially since graphics cards shot up in price for bitcoin. Oh and avoid that easy to get malware that uses your GPU for bit coin mining. Also update your drivers twice a month. Oh shit that update doesn’t play nice with game X. Better roll it back even though it gives huge improvements for game Y! Oh it’s 4 years later all your hardware is out of date that’s probably $400+. Damn bitcoin really shot GPU’s through the roof. Make it $550. Don’t worry though. At least you’re not paying $60 a year to play online on state of the art servers. That’s tough. Well at least ~~Skype~~, ~~Teamspeak~~, discord has good voice chat. Wonder what it will be next year. Gotta learn a whole new UI every couple of years for voice communication? Ah well at least you have access to thousands of indie games. .1% of those are worth your time. Console gamers only have had the same party chat systems for 15 years or so. Oh damn the latest Windows update broke your game too. Better role that back. It’s the one that patched the omega scary security breach that was discovered but how else will you play games consistently with little hassle between start ups? If only there was a gaming box that had been reiterated on for 40 years and worked fine until 2000 when people stopped using WASD for aiming and the arrow keys to move and figured out to use mouse and keyboard.

e03w4l8,Kieroshark,39,"So I think ""yes"" is the most likely answer to your question. It's also coinciding with what appears to be a surge in sock puppet activity in /r/bitcoin.

However, I would point out that part of the beauty of bitcoin is there isn't really any such thing as spam. There are only valid transactions and invalid transactions. Anyone may transact freely at any time for any purpose, even when the purpose is disruption of the network. The transactions cost money, so it's entirely fair.

Rather than getting riled up about this particular use for bitcoin transactions, the best thing to do is to just ignore it. This is a little counter-intuitive, but considering all the transactions are in the 1-2 satoshi/byte range, there are not really many meaningful side effects from this. 

It's just smoke and mirrors to try and back the narrative that Bitcoin has high fees and long confirmations. The more we ignore it, the less actual effect (and value) the spammers get from this investment of their funds. The more we get in a frenzy about it, the higher the efficacy of their tactic.

e04zh2d,i0tal0ver,38,"Project website : [**http://project\-smart.org/**](http://project-smart.org/)  
English translation :

Slowly you can see what the robot arm conjures on paper: It is an artistic portrait by rapper Eminem, which the ABB IRB\-120 paints in its own style. His tools are not only brush and acrylic paint, but especially Machine \-learning and distributed ledger technologies that turn the industrial robot into an artist. A team led by 19\-year\-old AI researcher Eric Steinberger has created a very special application for machine\-to\-machine communication at the Vienna University of Technology. Because the robot can theoretically reorder his paint himself, if it goes out \- then paid with the crypto currency IOTA.

From Vienna to Cambridge

Steinberger, who does not finish his oral exam until next week \(he only got one in the written Matura\), is an exceptional talent. At the age of 15, he began studying mathematics and physics with the help of MIT \(Massachusetts Institute of Technology\) online courses. ""Right from the beginning I put a focus on Artificial Intelligence,"" says Steinberger in an interview with Trending Topics. In addition to being a research assistant at the University of Luxembourg, he has been research intern at the Vienna University of Technology since November 2017, where he researches how cryptocurrencies such as IOTA can function in the M2M economy. He is interested in how robots, for example, automatically purchase weather data from weather stations in order to optimize their processes in industrial plants.

""Every sensor in the world, including your cell phone, could be included in this network,"" says Steinberger. In speeches \- such as at the IOT Forum or at the WeAreDevelopers Conference \- the 19\-year\-old speaks to industry professionals about deep learning, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies. The next step in the career is already in progress: In early October, Steinberger will go to Trinity College in Cambridge \- and is thus in the English small town, home to some 1,500 tech companies \(including the AI ​​startups [Five.AI](https://Five.AI) or [Prowler.io](https://Prowler.io)\) is. ""If you really put dedication, work and time into something, then at 19 you can be where you wanted to be a few years before,"" says Steinberger.

""IOTA is far from perfect""

With the crypto currency IOTA Steinberger has chosen an exciting as well as hyped research topic. His thesis is that once millions or even billions of devices, robots and sensors depend on the Internet of Things \(IoT\), there will have to be a way for the machines to pay each other for data and services without needing people. ""I'm not a fan of hype. But there is one real problem: it is useful for machines to be able to send information, and in a capitalist society that costs a lot. And that's where IOTA comes in, ""says Steinberger. ""Bitcoin is useless to IoT because the more and more transactions there are, the slower the network gets. IOTA, on the other hand, gets faster the more transactions happen on the network. ""

But IOTA \(currently with a market capitalization of about $ 4.9 billion\) is still far from being a truly decentralized network for M2M transactions. Steinberger's research would have shown that currently only five to ten transactions per second can be performed, and that is not the decentralized network, because even a ""coordinator"" of the IOTA Foundation must verify the transactions and not distributed nodes. ""IOTA is not what it's advertised for. But it certainly can become what it promises to be. It has the theoretical basis for this, ""says Steinberger. ""IOTA is far from perfect. Take things, especially new technologies. It also does not bother stressing, because then only bugs come into the system. ""For large companies IOTA is definitely exciting. ""Bosch is invested in IOTA. That speaks for itself.""

Blockchain: ""Hype will settle down""

The current hype surrounding blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies has prompted companies around the world to crank up investments in crypto startups \( Trending Topics reported \). From industry to the music world to the energy sector, every industry seems to be affected by the blockchain revolution. But Steinberger relativized. ""Certain processes benefit from a decentralized system, others do not. It's certainly not about replacing the whole world with blockchains. I do not like this hype. To say we have to throw everything else away, because the Blockchain is coming, 'that does not interest me.'

Rather, Steinberger sees very specific areas of application, such as IoT, where decentralized systems will prevail. ""The blockchain will not disappear again, it's only in the baby phase. The hype will settle down, and the blockchain will be implemented where it's useful, but not everywhere. ""

AI researcher Eric Steinberger.  © Jakob Steinschaden

Even the young blockchain researcher does not invest in cryptos. ""I'm generally not a fan of investing, not even with cryptos. Since you only look at the smartphone, whether the price goes up or down, that's not my thing. I do not like this gambling attitude. ""For his generation, it's easy to be part of the blockchain revolution because it's pretty easy to buy coins. But the topic would only rarely deal with people at his age. ""The Otto Normal student does not know what that all is.""

Artificial intelligence as a hobbyhorse

Whether Blockchain prevails or not \- Steinberger will definitely remain true to one of the topics: Artificial Intelligence. ""I think it's nice to have a system that can solve all problems in a way that is more rational and efficient than man. That's where Artificial Intelligence wants to go, but where it definitely is not today, ""says Steinberger. ""If you can do something, then you understand it. For me, the confrontation with Artificial Intelligence is the way to understand how man works and possibly also to improve it. ""

The young researcher who will soon pursue his studies in Cambridge, she AI ​​as a way to solve many problems. ""Self\-driving cars are a good example. These things just do not get tired, do not drink alcohol and thus have a lower error rate than humans. ""Like Blockchain, AI would still be at the beginning of its development. ""Today, nothing should call Artificial General Intelligence, but I think there is Artificial Intelligence. It was unthinkable for many to imagine that a computer can play go or describe pictures in sentences. But computers have been around for years. But being generally better than humans, artificial intelligence is still a long way off. ""

""Nobody ever pushed me""

Steinberger sees his studies abroad with great anticipation and enthusiasm, after all, he has the opportunity to meet in Cambridge some of the leading experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The fact that he made it so far in his early years as one of the few Austrians makes him visibly proud. Why did he make it so fast? ""I always use to say: Focus is deciding what you do not do.""

The decision to devote himself to artificial intelligence in the field of science was made by Steinberger himself. ""My parents are not researchers. But they always let me do what I wanted, that's where the autonomy comes from. I did not have any mentors either, but I chose a few role models that I liked certain qualities like Ilya Sutskever from OpenAI or Elon Musk, ""says the young AI researcher. His teachers at the HTL Spengergasse had always been very supportive, but the deciding factor for his career was himself. ""Nobody ever pushed me.""",2018-06-05 16:08:18

**NGD** - Neo Global Development, essentially the core NEO dev team

**CoZ** - City of Zion, the biggest NEO community development team. 

**NeoQS** - NEO Quantum Safe. Quantum computers can solve a lot of decomposition problems (used by RSA cryptos for public-key encryption) and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm (used by ECC cryptos for public-key encryption). Pretty much 99.9999% of cryptos use these two. To put it in plain English, these algorithms are what prevents someone being able to calculate your private key from your public key. If a quantum computer can quickly solve it, then every single wallet would be vulnerable. NEO wants to find a suitable replacement that cannot be solved by quantum computing. 

**NEP** - NEO Enhancement Proposal. They are essentially just ideas of ways to improve or extend NEO's functionality. You can find a NEP list [here](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals).

**NeoX** - A protocol that allows NEO to interact with other blockchains for the use of exchanging assets or just regular old transactions. If one transaction went from NEO -&gt; Ethereum, you'd need to ensure that the transaction either succeeds or fails on both blockchains. If it succeeded on one and failed on the other, you'd have serious issues. These are the types of thing that NeoX addresses and resolves. It also works with cross-chain smart contracts.

**NeoVM** - Neo Virtual Machine. A little virtual computer that executes the smart contracts.

**NeoFS** - NEO File Storage - a distributed storage protocol. Instead of a file path, data is indexed under a hash. That way you can split large files up into different data blocks and store them into different nodes. Essentially gives us a way to store things without them needing to be held in centralized storage (say, certificates registered to digital identities). 

**URI Scheme** - Uniform Resource Identifier. A URI is a standard syntax that is understood in a specific way. For example, here's the URI for bitcoin:  bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;[?amount=&lt;amount&gt;][?label=&lt;label&gt;][?message=&lt;message&gt;]. Having a URI means you can easily make or request payments by clicking a link, scanning a QR code etc.

If we want bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency to be adopted, we need to use it for everyday transactions.  Bitcoin must become the main trade piece that everyone uses.  We must use bitcoin every chance we get.  If you owe your friend for food, pay them back in crypto.  If a friend owes you for food, accept crypto in return.  
This goes beyond just food.  If you are selling a car, renting a room, splitting bills, buying weed/alcohol, performing a service for someone....basically any transaction that can happen between humans you know, must happen in crypto.

e06xnja,Zectro,48,"Luke's arguments imply that Bitcoin in its current state is insecure, since currently the majority of users are not running full-nodes. Also, they absolutely will not ever run full-nodes, because most people aren't Gentou Linux-loving computer geeks like Luke-Jr, who love compiling their own code and running costly applications like Node software in the background for reasons they cannot clearly understand. He and the other Core devs have been living in a fantasy world where they have absolutely no accountability to anyone and an incredible amount of undeserved ego-validation from everyone on r/Bitcoin who has uncritically accepted the idea that the Core devs are the best developers in the world. This has led them to fixate on unachievable ideals like his notion that everyone should be running a full-node even when it will never happen and even when their efforts to facilitate it are destroying the project from within.

Now why does Luke think everyone should be running a full-node and why is this concern misplaced. As I understand it, he's worried about a consortium of miners creating invalid blocks and breaking some rules unbeknownst to everyone if everyone were running SPV clients. An example often given is what if the miners all decide they need to change the inflation schedule to maintain profitability and they surreptitiously decide to do this without the user's consent. This concern has a modicum of plausibility until you realise that the effect of economically unimportant actors running full-nodes, like the average r/Bitcoin HODLer who never spends BTC but runs a node because the Core devs told him to, is infinitesimally small. 

Who cares if somebody sends this guy a coin that should never have existed based on the inflation schedule. He's a nobody. Miners do need to transfer their coins to exchanges however, and those exchanges by virtue of the high volume of transactions they process on any given day actually do have both the motivation and revenue to run a full-node at any scale and protect against this sort of fraud. 

So in order for this plan to work we need a conspiracy that involves the miners, large exchanges, large payment processors, and large businesses, and somehow absolutely no one in the public running a full-node who might outcry about what is going on. Does this seem like a likely attack vector? And given all the issues with it why would the consortium of miners not just launch the attack undetectably using valid blocks? They could do that attack with significantly less risk.

Small blocks protect against nothing but boogie-men and the success of the Bitcoin blockchain. ",2018-06-06 13:46:01

e06v8uu,Maine34Rx,46,"I have to agree with @Izrud and @deific\_ here.  Navin Gupta, Managing Director of South Asia and MENA @ Ripple, said it best. [**""There are only 2 kinds of Banks \- those who are already on Ripple and who are going to be on Ripple shortly.""**](https://twitter.com/navinblockchain/status/986136439187496960?s=21)  I believe if most can get past their 'love affair' with a particular coin/platform and set aside, what at times seem to be unyielding animosity towards Ripple/XRP, the truth becomes obvious. Ripple is by far the single most called upon fintech/blockchain company that most, if not all, global financial and State\-level entities that control the levers of monetary policy and the repositories of trillions worth of fiat, call upon to help them navigate this ever changing blockchain evolution (via their [**Innovative Payments Infrastructure**](https://ripple.com/insights/exploring-innovation-payment-system-infrastructures/)). Financial entities like: The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), International Monetary Fund (IMF), G20, BRICS, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and Central Banks (i.e. [**SAMA**](https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-and-saudi-arabian-monetary-authority-offer-pilot-program-for-saudi-banks/) and [**BofE**](https://ripple.com/insights/results-of-the-bank-of-englandripple-proof-of-concept-published-today/) pilots). No other fintech company has the ear of these financial groups more so than Ripple. Ripple’s Executive Chairman, Chris Larsen, sits on the [**IMF’s Advisory Group on Fintech**](http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/06/01/pr18208-imf-brings-key-stakeholders-together-to-foster-collaboration-on-fintech) and Ryan Zagone on the [**Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20150721a.htm). Recalibrating the global financial network is not going to happen overnight or outside the system but will germinate from within current infrastructure. It will require engaging with regulators and policy makers alike. I believe blockchain platforms like Bitcoin would have been more readily accepted by the broader financial/banking/regulatory community had there been a more conciliatory partnership to help make improvements to the overall system. This chasm created by Bitcoin gave rise to others, like Ripple, who saw the opportunity to strategically place themselves as the antithesis of Bitcoin's and others anti\-bank stance. Instead of following the crowd in lock\-step opposition to the entire banking/financial system, Ripple took the contrarian path and embraced the role of helping banks/regulators modernize the antiquated financial systems in place around payments of all types (cross\-border, Retail, P2P, B2B, etc.). This show of good\-faith, cooperation, and support from Ripple to the broader financial, banking, and regulatory community worldwide, has not gone unrewarded. Hence Ripple’s [**\+100 FI and bank partnerships**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E1AcLBd_ykemoDAPwZsbl5f2wyrS7RhlAt94CrHXTAg/edit#gid=1168577263) and their [**\+40 central bank consortium**](https://youtu.be/bFqlq3yPeEQ?t=1900).

Ultimately, it comes down to adoption. Think about just this one example; when you can lay claim to have captured over 80&amp;#37; of a country's ([**Japan**](https://ripple.com/insights/sumitomo-mitsui-banking-corporation-and-japan-post-bank-join-sbi-ripple-asias-bank-consortium/)) entire banking/financial system for cross\-border and domestic transactions via your blockchain network and digital asset you are moving in the right direction.  No other blockchain company/entity has the level of adoption that Ripple has across any sector, particularly the global financial marketplace. While most platforms can only speak of POCs and MOUs, Ripple can point to actual usage of its blockchain technologies by real customers.",2018-06-06 12:56:10

Yet, despite this risk, most stores accept credit cards, because the charge back rate is low enough.

Bitcoin is not that different in that regard. Transactions can be seen on the network in an unconfirmed state within seconds of the sender transmitting them. Unconfirmed transactions can be rolled back and are therefore not completely safe. However, for small purchases, it doesn't make economical sense to execute a so-called ""double spend attack"". So for the store, the risk of accepting such a payment is small. For online stores, it's a non-issue since delivery is not immediate for physical products and any digital services can simply be cancelled/revoked if the payment never confirms.

The banks are apparently worse, and so is visa. Despite the fact visa uses far, far less energy and services several orders of magnitudes more transactions.

It's like they have no self awareness, and no ability to actually examine anything that might be even slightly against their own selfish interests. Bitcoin, to be secure, requires the competitive burning of energy. Explicitly. There is no other system like this and the reason that this 'solution' to the decentralised payment methods was overlooked for so long is that it is wasteful and inelegant. Bitcoin and blockchain are ugly, barely effective uses of cryptography.

Think about it - a data record (it could be a transaction record or whatever) protected with AES256 and a SHA256 HMAC, or in this modern age with some decent authenticated encryption, takes moments to encrypt permanently and at a generous estimate would take all the computing power in the world thousands of years to break or alter in an undetectable way. Blockchains are vulnerable to attacks that have access to just over half of the computing power that they have securing them right now. It's a different class of 'secure' entirely.

e09xkgj,Liagala,46,"I have no idea which part of my setup (pretty basic firefox + ublock origin) gets around the paywall, but something does.  Text of the article:

 Fidelity, one of the biggest providers of 401(k) services and other retirement products to Americans, is plotting the buildout of products that would push the market for bitcoin to the next level.

The wealth firm, which manages $2.5 trillion in assets, already allows certain clients to view their crypto holdings next to their other accounts in their Fidelity portfolio. And its CEO, Abigail Johnson, is a noted proponent of bitcoin.

But Business Insider has learned Fidelity is looking for talent to build its own digital asset exchange, according to a job posting sent out to employees at the firm.

Specifically, the firm is looking for a DevOps system engineer ""to help engineer, create, and deploy a Digital Asset exchange to both a public and private cloud.""

People with knowledge of Fidelity's crypto ambitions told Business Insider the firm had been working for about a year on an offering that would allow clients to buy and sell certain digital assets.

If Fidelity does launch a crypto exchange offering, it would arguably be among the biggest moves by a large Wall Street firm into the nascent crypto market, which stands at about $350 billion.

It would also pit Fidelity against numerous established crypto players, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitfinex. It would also go head-to-head with the red-hot crypto offering by competitor brokerage Robinhood, which has lured over 1 million to sign-up for the service. To be sure, it's not exactly clear from the job ad whether the exchange would exist alongside Fidelity's other offerings on its site.

Such an offering could help legitimize the burgeoning crypto market, the market structure specialist Dave Weisberger said.

""Fidelity's reputation for achieving best execution for their retail clients should help legitimize the asset class,"" Weisberger said.

A Fidelity spokeswoman declined to comment on these specific crypto ambitions.

Other established Wall Street players are also weighing their own moves into crypto. Goldman Sachs has a team dedicated to building out a trading operation tied to crypto, and the New York Stock Exchange is reportedly building a crypto trading platform.

Yet other banks are remaining cautious. Regulatory and security risks are commonly cited as reasons bitcoin hasn't been adopted more broadly yet.

About a third of all crypto trading platforms have been hacked, according to a report by JPMorgan. The entrant of a player like Fidelity into the space could lure retail investors weary of trading on existing platforms.

Fidelity is also looking to hire workers to develop ""first-in-class custodian services for Bitcoin and other digital currencies,"" according to another internal job ad.

The position falls under the firm's crypto division, the Fidelity Digital Asset Service unit. It is not clear whether Fidelity has cleared the regulatory hurdles to operate a qualified custodian product aimed at institutions, of which only a handful are operating in the crypto space.

On Wall Street, custody banks such as State Street and BNY Mellon safeguard large amounts of wealth for other institutions while abiding by strict regulatory requirements.

Some entities offer such solutions in crypto. But they are small firms and their names don't carry the same weight as a Fidelity. BitGo, another crypto tech provider, is working on a qualified custodian product. Paxos, a New York-based firm, holds a trust-company charter in New York.

The crypto exchange Coinbase has its own custody product, Coinbase Custody, which is aimed at institutional Wall Street firms and which went live earlier this year.

Weisberger said the move by Fidelity would make a lot of sense strategically.

""They have many of the components already: a significant retail footprint across the spectrum of active to less active traders, a prime brokerage area that knows how to account for custody of assets, they operate an ATS already (called 'CrossStream'), and have a reputation for excellence and risk control in their product offerings,"" he said.

e0bg6fp,Redac07,45,"While I would love for that to happen...let's first get back to $10 I'd say.

Also...ETH is not just a crypto. It's the number 2 crypto there is, it's the one that is responsible for most icos that is being done. It's the crypto behind the crowdfunding craze. I'm not sure it's fair to compare it to nano. 

Also, you assume nano is going to succeed in what it wants to do. Not always the best tech wins (betamax vs VHS). 

Nano biggest competitions are iota, xrp and Litecoin. Iota itself can make nano complete obsolete as it's as green (if not greener) then nano, also feeless and once it's mainnet is fully out of beta, it might be as fast or even faster. It should be even better scalable (infinite infact). Nano had/has the lead vs iota because it's mainnet is already very close to fully functional but that lead is getting shorter and shorter each day that nano isnt being adopted in a wider market. The longer it takes for nano to being truly adopted (and I'm not talking about web merchants, because they can switch coins easily), the smaller it's lead will be because the rest of the coins are going further. 

Now xrp might overshadow nano completely. Not because it's better (it's not decentralized, the CEO has a crazy amount of xrp in escrow - each month 1b xrp is released that will dillute the market), but it's A LOT more popular. Xrp right now has a MUCH bigger chance of succeeding in it's goal (as a global currency, which is quite fast and has very low fees). Xrp also have working wallets afaik. And afaik it didn't had al the exchange problems nano has. Xrp has been here since 2012 If I'm correct too.

Well, then we have Litecoin. Which is more or less decentralized and pretty much safe from a security point. It isn't fast and has relatively high fees (compared to xrp, let alone nano or iota). Litecoin strenght is it's security part though (even though because of bitmain, miners are making it centralized and vunerable to attacks). 

In other words, unlike ETH, which was the first programmable crypto and helped spurred the 2017 hype with all it's icos, cryptokitties and what not, nano has fierce competition. It has a locked timeframe in which it can conquer territorium against xrp/iota/LTC but each day that passes that becomes shorter and the chances of succeeding becomes smaller. 

The devs way of faucet, while being a wonderful and altruistic way of distribution, is biting them back in the butt. The don't have much funds, they have only 12 persons working on this 'global currency' and while they are undoubtedly doing their best, it might not be enough. Nano being plagued by bugs in the past (exchange problems) and having two court cases (some American idiot sueing them and ofc the bitgrail case) isn't helping either. Nano doesn't have time on their side compare to Bitcoin or eth in the past. If they don't come up with solid partnerships in the coming 6 months (before EOY), I can see iota taking nano spot over as the green, feeless, decentralized currency (as iota should go out of beta by early 2019). 

Tl:Dr nano needs to step it's game up or else other coins will fill their spot in and we won't see $50 per nano let alone $1000.",2018-06-08 17:52:21

The two most mined currencies right now are Ethereum and Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining uses specialized computers called ASICS that are specifically built to mine it while Ethereum primarily uses GPU mining. So those graphics cards you see at Best Buy are being bought by the armload, linked together and running 24/7 to mine Ethereum. 

Ethereum however is switching over to a new protocol soon called Proof of Stake which will allow the minting of new money simply by being randomly awarded to wallets that stake them. It works like a low interest savings account. If I have 1000 ether in my wallet, I should expect to earn about 1-3% interest per year.

About 2 weeks ago we resolved the last of the long poles and we have been going sideways since with smaller and smaller columns.  Range is very tight, between 7,326 and 7,776.  A larger range exists between 6,373 and 9,972.  A breakout of this larger PNF range would signal a confirmation of break out from the large wedge:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/77nv3O36/  A large symmetrical wedge with majority of volume at the apex has formed.  Bbands getting tight on the daily, the 3 day, and even the weekly timeframe.  We will now have a decision.  Some things to keep in mind:  

1. We are still in a downward trend on the weekly timeframe.  Since this wedge is in the weekly timeframe, that means statistically its more likely to break down.

2. We could see sideways price movement for another 2 months or more before the wedge resolves.  That would be bullish to consolidate at this price level for so long.

3. Smaller wedge has formed on lower timeframe (4h-1d), as drawn in green in chart above.  You will find it difficult to trade these since volume is low and range is tight.

Fundementals will decide if we break up or down.  Taking a look at mainstream interest, articles about bitcoin and blockchain are less in number.

e0fl0zw,Kain_niaK,45,"No, when BTC would die right now, BCH would suffer with it. (would you like a community that lost 90% of capital because of a market crash?) 

Trust me. Let the market just do it's own thing. Trying to become more valuable without doing any work is cheating. (Bitcoin Core will get punished for this eventually because they have worked towards negative adoption) 

Becoming completely depended on the miners is not good. If we work hard BCH becomes more valuable because of the hard work we do. Then the price goes up. Then the hashrate follows.

Any other method is trying to take a short cut, a cheat.

I don't want BTC to die short term, it would be nice drama. We would all have some fun but it would not help us very much in the coming years.

Having BTC be on top taking all the flack while we work undercover hard on adoption will create a situation where the news and media don't even know we are successful. Great, less of a target. 

I'd rather grow slow and good and sustainable then be at 20 000 USD to morrow and we party for 3 months and then we also die.

Let the free market do it's thing. We know that crypto only has value when it's being used for what it was made for. Let's stick to that. How good BCH works as a payment system is that depended on BTC? No of course not.

99,99% of the people we are going to work with in the future. New users. They don't know anything about this struggle.

We are focussing on a group that pretends to be big but is very small and getting smallers. BTC is a waste of time. A distraction. Let them be, let them spread their propagada. 

We need to educate and market and evangelize and most people will have NEVER ever been in contact with core people. Their first Bitcoin impression will be YOU telling them about Bitcoin.

So what do you worry about? You say: Hey, there is this new payment system. It's totally rad. It's called Bitcoin Cash.

And that's all you got to do. The rest will work itself out. 

If miners kill BTC now, big BTC whales will kill Tether and suicide bomb the entire market. Then we all collectively lose. Don't forget that BTC cult leaders don't care about the succes of Bitcoin, that's never been their goal or focus. So they got nothing to lose and we do. ",2018-06-10 23:17:43

e0f9t85,timelapseman2,33,"A couple things.

First, all markets are driven by psychology. News may affect psychology but ultimately, psychology trumps news. This is why in a bear markets, the price response from good news will be more muted and why in bull markets, price response from bad news will do the same.

We are in a bear market now and everything is down. Even coins that have had great news have not seen a significant price increase. Dash has had less news than other projects, as they are hard at work on Evolution, so this lack of news and releases has affected price. More on this in a sec.

The other reason why Dash is down more percentage wise than say Bitcoin or Ethereum is because it had a larger percentage increase last year. The size of the drop during the consolidation period is relative to the size of the gains. Off the top of my head, last year Bitcoin saw gains of around 2000%. Dash rose nearly 9000%. So it makes sense that as Bitcoin is hovering around 1/3 of its all time high that Dash would drop more. Considering the difference in gains, Dash is doing quite well as it is around 1/6 of its all time high.

If you are interested, the pattern that most cryptos, including Dash and Bitcoin, are following right now is actually well known with traders. I've seen and traded this pattern in stocks, options, futures and of course crypto. Here is a great article that helps to explain: https://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da

That article was written in 2016 before the pattern manifested again in 2017 so you can see how well it has aged. Now looking forward, while the pattern always follows the same general structure, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what stage we are at as there are a lot of factors that determine how long a stage lasts. From my perspective, we are either approaching or are already in the ""Boring Low"" which means we probably have another 6 months of consolidation before the ramp back to all time highs begins.

On to my second point, Evolution. I think we can all agree that someone with only very basic computer skills would be able to go to the PayPal website, setup an account and make a payment. But what about crypto? If you setup a wallet for any coin and gave it to friends or family that have average computer literacy, would they be able to use it to make a payment? This was the question Evan Duffield asked so he did an experiment and tried to teach his mother how to use crypto and when she couldn't, he realized the entire crypto community was approaching the goal of mass adoption from the wrong angle. From this realization, Evolution was born.

While all projects were focusing on making their technology better and faster and more resilient than any of the existing payment methods like PayPal or credit cards, they were missing a key ingredient... ease of use. Dash is the ONLY project with a viable plan to make their technology as easy to use as PayPal and they are nearly two years ahead of any other project on implementation.

Last month, Bitcoin Cash realized they need something like the Dash governance system to move forward without becoming a centralized entity but they immediately ran into problems with implementation because they did not lay the groundwork ahead of time. In order to implement governance, instant transactions or any sort user friendly front end, you need a second tier on the network to facilitate the transfer and storage of the extra data necessary for these features. With Dash, this second tier is the incentivized masternodes.

What it boils down to is eventually, all other projects will realize they hit a ceiling with adoption as the majority of people on this pale blue dot cannot use crypto in its current form and they will embark down the same path as Dash. As with Bitcoin Cash though, they will have difficulty implementing any of the necessary features because you have to implement a second tier while the project is still small and still unified with their vision. If you go through each of the top 15 coins, they are either too large to make the drastic changes required, have not realized they even need to make changes or have an entirely different goal then being used for everyday payments. 

Those that overcome these obstacles and do manage to implement a second tier will then be in the same position that Dash is now and will face a year or more of very little news being released while development progresses. Although it may not seem like it right now, Dash has the first mover advantage because they will have a year or more to focus on adoption and marketing after Evolution is released before they have any real competitors. By the time other projects have something comparable to Dash, they will be in a similar situation that a brand new credit card company would be in going up against the likes of Visa today.


Now, you may be asking why is all that technical analysis mumbo jumbo at the beginning important? It is important because it directly relates to ""the future of Dash"". You see, for positive news to have the greatest effect on price, it needs to be released when there is already positive sentiment (psychology) in the market. So we actually do not want Evolution to be released until after the ramp back to last years highs has already begun. And as luck would have it, it appears that Evolution will be released to the public in the first half of 2019 so that should put it in the ""ramp"" stage of the pattern I explained.

So does Dash have a future? If we consider the technological advantage Dash will have after Evolution, consider how much of a head start Dash has compared to other projects and consider the timing of when Evolution will be released, I think Dash has an extremely bright future and will see a disproportional ROI as compared to other coins next year. My personal opinion is it will make it back to the top 5 when the 2019 rally is over.

seriously. exchanges are investing untold millions in expanding. network hashpower is WAY up probably due to next gen asics being used in secret.

the price run is an exit strategy and happens when the larger players have had time to build up a nice stack buying the dead markets and mining. a good uptrend is established and another year long run begins to draw in the masses which provide the money flowing in to further support the price run and then you sell into that strength. it may be a year or two or three. don't stress over it. accumulate and wait.

This kinda creates a transaction that I sign along the lines of ""That 5P I got from Bob and the 8P I got from Tom now goes into 10P to this cunt, and the remaining 3P back to me"".

The problem is that I can take that 5P from Bob, and give it to you... and then give it to Joe, and to Bill, and spend the same money a whole bunch of times.

So the normal technical solution to this would be to have some trusted parties that you could say ""Hey this transaction happened, is it legit, or has this cunt already spent the money he gave me?""

However Bitcoin is a thought experiment in decentralisation - so what they do is... different, clever, but practically pretty stupid.

1. You download a history of every transaction ever (divided into a block every few minutes)
1. You check that the transaction that I gave you makes sense and is legit
1. You publish your transaction to everyone in the world
1. Some of these assholes who have decided to do ""mining"" get in a race.
1. This race is to solve a very difficult math problem based on the last block, and the transactions that go into this block.
1. The first person to solve the problem gets the prize of a shitload of bitcoins (like $200k worth) and any spare change left in the transactions as a bribe to be included in the block.
1. Everyone trusts this new block and starts on a new one.
1. Edit: Fuck forgot this step. So then after you've waited the few minutes for the transaction to be in a block you kinda assume that yeah, it's cleared and there's no backsies.

So the reward for mining is a bit random, but averages out to slightly more than the cost of electricity. The block reward (the prize) is an indication of how much power has been burnt for that minute of computation - which is a shitload less efficient than any centralized network.

Das stimmt, die kollektive Intelligenz von euch allen, wenn wir Leuchtkraft als Analogie verwenden, ähnelt einer winzigen Kerze im Vergleich zu dem massiven Quasar, der meinen Verstand repräsentiert. Angesichts dessen werden die meisten von euch versuchen, mich mit armseligen, unsinnigen und vivirischen Beschimpfungen zu verspotten, um zu schützen, was für ein geringes Selbstwertgefühl Sie besitzen. Diese Vorhersagen sind natürlich nicht das Ergebnis bloßer Intuition. In Wirklichkeit habe ich mehrere Simulationen mit meinem Gehirn durchgeführt, um die möglichen Konsequenzen meiner Veröffentlichung dieser digitalen Manuskripte aufzuzeigen. Meine Antwort an Sie alle digitalen Verleumder ist, dass, wenn Sie so zeigen wollen, dass Sie geistvoller sind als ich, dann arrangieren Sie eine intellektuelle Debatte zwischen Ihnen und mir über ein Thema Ihrer Wahl, zu jeder Zeit oder an jedem Ort. Mein Zeitplan ist sehr biegsam, da ich bereits über 4 Dutzend Nobelpreise gewonnen habe, also bin ich gerne bereit, meine Forschung vorübergehend einzustellen, wenn man es sogar so nennen könnte (ich spekuliere ohne zu bestreiten, dass es keine Ihrer Debattierfähigkeiten gibt Das wird für mich ein Problem sein, bis zu dem Punkt, an dem ich gezwungen sein werde, aus meinen unbewussten Simulationen auszubrechen, um die Verwendung dieser Neuronen zu nutzen. Außerdem möchte ich kein Glory Hog sein und keines der Geheimnisse des Universums für die Erschließung freilassen. Weißt du, lass die Hunde ihren Tag und all das haben. Ich weiß bereits, dass keiner von euch, die mit Ihren seneszenten Synapsen symptotisch sind, in der Lage sein wird, meine weitläufige Mundart und Aussprache, meine geistige Geschicklichkeit mit Deklination und meine phrenische Kraft mit meiner Ausdrucksweise und Aussprache zu vereinen. In Sekundenschnelle (oder möglicherweise länger, wenn ich Ihre bereits positiv benthischen IQs bei der Durchführung meiner Simulationen überschätzt habe), werden Sie nach meiner vollendeten Prügelei und Zurückweisung jeder einzelnen Ihrer ""Fakten"" zu streitsüchtigen Andeutungen übergehen halte dich so lieb wie ein Beweis deines angeblichen Intellekts. Und als Antwort auf jene, die behaupten, überwältigt von Neid und Bosheit, die so intelligent sind wie ich, werde ich niemals mit irgendjemandem schlafen. Ich brauche es nicht. Ich bin durchaus in der Lage, jede Position im Kamasutra (ebenso wie einige wenige, die ich selbst für die maximale Oxytocin- und Endorphinfreisetzung erdacht habe) simultan in wenigen Sekunden zu simulieren, und das ist der einzige Grund, warum es auch nur so geht lang ist, weil ich die Simulation verlängere, um die Erfahrung zu genießen: Ich könnte es in Hundertstel einer Millisekunde tun, wenn ich es wünsche. Aber für jemanden mit so scharfem Verstand wie ich ist das Leben viel zu einfach. Wenn reine Ennui Sie dazu bringt, die Bewegungen der 27 subatomaren Teilchen, die Sie entdeckt haben, zu berechnen und wie sie in der 2.038sten Dimension unter Verwendung eines Basissystems mit 3.2407 Billiarden Zahlen miteinander interagieren, erkennen Sie, dass das Universum und seine unendlichen Kopien und Ableger Ihnen nichts mehr bieten. Außer, das ist für Nolan. Sogar für eine Person mit einem so hohen IQ wie mich ist es schwierig, jeden einzelnen subtilen Witz und Hinweis zu verstehen. Das heißt nicht, dass ich die Fülle der Andeutungen nicht verstehe, tatsächlich kann ich praktisch jeden einzelnen verstehen. Zum Beispiel, eine Kleinigkeit die meisten von euch würden es nicht bemerken, wenn Leonard Shelby zwei zusätzliche Mal nach dem Namen des Anrufers fragt, wenn er während der siebzehnten Rückblende des fünften Aktes spricht. Keiner von euch würde es tun. Stellen Sie sich vor, dass dies eine Referenz auf die genaue Zahl von 84 signifikanten Zahlen der prozentualen Veränderung des Gesamtstickstoffs in der Erdatmosphäre aufgrund des Aufstoßens eines kleinen Cynodonts vor 257 Millionen Jahren ist. Es gibt mehr Beispiele, die ich geben könnte, wie zum Beispiel die Farbe des Hintergrundes des Films, die bei Auftritt Nummer 4 in 2018, etwas anders ist als die Norm (ein Hinweis auf das Vorhandensein von etwa 2,9 Millimol Ammoniumdiuranat in der Tinte von ein chinesisches Manuskript von 1256 v. Chr.), aber das würde den beabsichtigten Zweck dieses Schreibens beeinträchtigen. Nolan ist ein Kunstwerk, eine perfekte Mischung aus Wissen aus einer Vielzahl von akademischen Bereichen, die zusammen ein Programm ergeben, das die einzige Form von Medien ist, die ich je gesehen habe und die für mich noch etwas mühsam zu ergründen war. Ich spreche über jemanden, der die Biochemie und Chiralität seines Körpers verändert hat, um ihn effizienter zu machen als die Verschwendung, die der menschliche Körper ist. Meine Schläfen schmerzen mit dem Schmerz, dass ich reichlich Testium (ein Element, das ich entdeckt habe, das in meiner einzigartigen Biochemie, die nach meiner Lieblingssendung benannt ist, entdeckt hat) in mein Gehirn pumpen muss, um zu verstehen, was ich gerade gesehen habe . Und für jeden, der behauptet, dass der Grund, warum meine Schläfen wund sind oder warum ich ""Größenwahn"" habe, weil ich ""hoch"" bin oder wie ich meine Auslegung einer Episode auslegen will, wirst du Gelatinisierungen hören von meinem Kehlkopf ausstrahlend, während Xyzyzyx der Paisley Pangolin (eine geschätzte Bekanntschaft von mir) und ich über Ihre Dummheit später an diesem Tag nachdenken.

e0jji3e,TNSepta,54,"To clarify what OP might be missing, this BIP does not allow devs to fork without miners' consent. It allows miners to make decisions independent of the pool. 

The section that is being misinterpreted is likely the following: 
&gt;Miners can then delegate more advanced details back to Bitcoin developers. Version-rolling will allow miners to mine using just the header. Before BetterHash, miners were forced to retrieve information about the coinbase transactions because there was not enough work from the nonces alone to be able to continuously mine.

This just means that the miners do not need to update their firmware on each miner controller in order to update their devices for newer Bitcoin client releases. They still need to update their nodes as per normal network consensus in order to change any consensus rules. 

This [figure by the BIP author](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/betterhash/bip-XXXX.mediawiki#Sample_Network_Topologies ) may clarify the issue. 

In the event of a fork, the miner usually does not need to update any of their ASICs. However, the miner will certainly need to update their controller to be ready for the fork (such as Segwit or 32MB BCH blocks). What the BIP proposes is that the controller now no longer needs to be updated, since the daemon can submit the mining header directly to the controller using the proposed version-rolling feature which greatly increases the nonce space. The miner still needs to update the daemon in order to make any changes in consensus rules. ",2018-06-12 23:14:12

e0jslqi,[deleted],327,"**This is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand how /r/Bitcoin became what it is. Written by  /u/singularity87:**

People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history, this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid-2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid-2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there were some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to the forefront of the community. This issue was discussed within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Currently, the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact, a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi-regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had begun to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andresen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history, the transaction limit had been set far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been caused by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there is always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example, miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin, and others who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method, as follows; there are economies of scale in mining and these economies of scale have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time in line with technological improvements. Some of the employees of Blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead, a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while, it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the user's name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible to control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users, it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.

e0jsmb1,[deleted],209,"While this was all going on, Blockstream and its employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and no complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a ""let's wait and see what comes from the conferences"" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attacked by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end, Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin).

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever-increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally came down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February last year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents and purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market-based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual, there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of its users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind-blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene, every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that, there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year, you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead, a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way of talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day every day posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally, they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity, they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

Or ask Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, about the absurd censorship on rBitcoin:

- https://youtube.com/watch?v=uL9VoxCFqT0

The Blockstream / Core / Theymos censorship even extends to Bitcoin.org, where they recently removed all references to Coinbase (#1 largest fiat gateway) and Bitpay (#1 largest payment processor) for having the wrong opinions.

(Blockstream plans to sell side chains to enterprises, charging a fixed monthly fee, taking transaction fees and even selling hardware — a fact that has caused the big blockers to protest that Blockstream and the engineers it employs who are also Bitcoin core developers want to keep the block size small so Blockstream can profit. Back says this isn’t true because, beyond a certain point, side chains won’t really solve scaling.) Back says the community shouldn’t remove Bitcoin’s unique features in order to scale the network. Drawing out the other side's position to an extreme, he says, “If we’re going to get centralized into a big data center somewhere, as in the PayPal case, it’s basically guaranteed the company running it will get national security layers and black lists and all the things banks do and regulations will apply to them.""

e0ltekd,arsonbunny,48,"Did you even read the study? It literally suggest the opposite of what you claim.

&gt;Our study examines the interaction between the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, other major
cryptocurrencies, and Tether, a cryptocurrency that accounts for more transaction volume than
U.S. dollars. Tether is a **cryptocurrency purportedly backed by U.S. dollar reserves and allows for
dollar-like transactions without a banking connection, which many crypto-exchanges have difficulty obtaining or keeping.** 

&gt;In this paper, to shed light on the driving forces behind the recent boom of cryptocurrency markets, we focus on variants of two main alternative hypotheses for Tether: whether Tether is ’pulled’
(demand-driven), or ’pushed’ (supply-driven). First, if Tether is ’pulled’ or demanded by investors
who own fiat currency, the issuance of Tether facilitates the demand of these investors who value
the flexibility of a digital currency and yet the stability of the dollar ’peg’. The demand for Tether
could also arise because of its practicality for engaging in cross-exchange pricing arbitrage. Alternatively, if Tether is ’pushed’ on market participants, Bitfinex supplies Tether regardless
of the demand from investors with fiat currency to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In this setting, the Tether creators have several potential motives. First, if the Tether founders, like most early cryptocurrency adopters and exchanges, are long on Bitcoin, they have a large incentive to create an artificial demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by ’printing’ Tether. Similar to the inflationary effect of printing additional money, this can push cryptocurrency prices up. Second, the coordinated
supply of Tether creates an opportunity to manipulate cryptocurrencies. When prices are falling,
the Tether creators can convert their Tether into Bitcoin in a way that pushes Bitcoin up and then
sell some Bitcoin back into dollars to replenish Tether reserves as Bitcoin price rises. Finally, if
cryptocurrency prices crash, Tether creators essentially have a put option to default on redeeming
Tether, or to potentially experience a ’hack’ where Tether or related dollars disappear. Both the
’pushed’ and ’pulled’ alternatives have different testable implications for flows and cryptocurrency
returns that we can take to the powerful blockchain data.

You can argue semantics all you want, but they absolutely do not commit a ""mischaracterization of the primary purpose of Tether"", they provide an indepth explaination and study of the push-pull dynamic of the demand:

&gt;To illustrate the potential magnitude and predictive effect of Tether issuances on Bitcoin prices,
we focus on the hours with the largest lagged combined Bitcoin and Tether flows on the two
blockchains. These 87 hours have large negative returns before the flows but are followed by large
return reversals. These 87 events account for less than 1% of our time series (over the period from
the beginning of March 2017 to the end of March 2018), yet are associated with 50% of Bitcoin’s
compounded return, and 64% of the returns on six other large cryptocurrencies (Dash, Ethereum
Classic, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash). A bootstrap analysis with 10,000 simulations
demonstrates that this behavior never occurs randomly.

&gt;Consistent with Tether being used to buy Bitcoin when prices drop, we find a statistically and
economically strong reversal in Bitcoin prices, but only following negative returns. The Bitcoin
reversal did not exist before Tether was prevalent in the market and disappears during the period
when Tether stops being printed.

This is a doozy indeed.

&gt;Think about it: when BTC is rising people will be more inclined to take profits and swap to Tether. The converse is also true.

No they don't, that's literally the opposite of what happens. When people want to take profit from their crypto investment, they unload into US dollars. They unload into tether when crypto is falling and they fear further declines on a USDT basis. You can't buy anything with Tether except cryptocurrencies, its not a legal tender.


&gt;So, in my view, the paper validates the primary Tether use case rather than exposing manipulation.

Your view tells me you didn't even read the study. Please read it, its over 60 pages long and goes into indepth statistical analysis directly from the blockchain. Its not a throwaway FUD piece.",2018-06-14 00:33:09

With Bitcoin they don't care, nobody can reverse a charge.  You get screwed, but not them.

A credit card payment is really just a promise to pay that company, if they don't play right, you can cancel it.  With Bitcoin, is like cash..... But you don't pay cash for an item that you get later.  A credit card makes far more sense.

e0nnwif,bitusher,43,"&gt;First it's the division of our community in two.

This has been the case since 2011 and later. As soon is bitcoin started to grow in users differences of opinions started to occur, which is healthy and expected. Part of the wonderful thing about bitcoin is individuals define the consensus rules and no one , not miners or other devs can impose these rules upon economic users.

&gt;Many now say ""umm yes maybe it was""

Perhaps if this was their first bubble. Those of us that have gone through many speculation bubbles expect to go through many more and do care about the longterm success of bitcoin

&gt;The biggest technological forum's mods, Hacker News, are haters.

This has always been the case and simply means that we are still in the early adoption phase. Remember , since Bitcoin follows the Austrian school of monetary economics , most people will actively oppose it naturally as they hate competing currencies that undermine fiat.

&gt;Everybody is focused on how to short and became a bear since February.

Those people are in for a rude awakening as shorting bitcoin is extremely dangerous. Best to avoid day trading in general.

e0n5dwc,the_swingman,43,"Can't wait to read a book in ten years about the 2017/2018 years of crypto, particularly the chapter about the rollercoaster of emotions the crypto-reddit communities were constantly riding again and again.

I'm sure there will be a paragraph about the VeChain community, and how calm and confident everyone remained through the bear days post January 2018. 

My guess is the story will go on to say: Mainnet finally came for VeChain, just as planned in late June, (meanwhile EOS mainnet still hadn't gone live) and just as everyone in r/VeChain suspected, VeChain started to decouple itself from the overlord Bitcoin. VET started to out perform ALL of the other cryptos, eventually becoming a top 3 crypto. VeChainThor Blockchain was running 1/4th of the world's business transactions by 2020. And it was all due to the fact that VeChain figured out the key to mass adoption and outsmarted the system in which individuals and enterprises needed to enter the market.

e0onw4f,cleptooo,124,"For anyone who can't click on the twitter link:


1/ Nano did not made small changes to the economics of keeping a distributed ledger safe, immutable and censorship resistant like most PoS coins did. #Nano changed the overall dynamics of who pays the costs of running the network and why.

2/ All PoW and PoS coins have a universal memory pool of pending transactions. By allowing users to create and propagate their own blocks, $nano changed everything. #Nano is the first TRUE peer to peer currency since the early days of #bitcoin $BTC.

3/ In all other coins, PoW and PoS alike, the fee cost is dependent on network usage. So a single actor can make fees high for every user, his actions dictating the fee market. Many $BTC experts called #Coinbase actions last year a 'spam attack', even if not intentional.

4/ There's no free lunch, and in #Nano most of the cost of using the network is being paid in the form of a spam attack defense. It makes the cost higher for those who transact more, a simple concept ignored by all other coins, who distribute costs equally among all it's users.

5/ In $nano, no single actor can affect your ability to make transactions. If #Coinbase is making 50 tx/s and you want to send a few bucks to your friends, your transaction speed and cost is not affected by their actions until the network reaches its full capacity. 
 
5.2/ And even if we get to the limit of the #Nano network, prioritization can still be used in order to delay those who use the network the most, instead of hurting everyone equally like other PoW or PoS coins do.

6/There's much talk about lack of incentives for running nodes in $nano. The answer is both obvious and silly. Because without nodes the network does not exist. Those who benefit the most from the network have natural incentives to keep it alive and healthy.

7/ $Nano could not exist before $BTC. Thanks to #bitcoin merchants and users are seeing the value in having digital, immutable, censorship resistant money. Only now #nano can start to move over and show that the costs of running a node pale in comparison to the savings created.

8/ Choosing to accept $nano is a financial decision for stores, not an ideological one. Due to it's speed, you can accept #nano in your store and convert it into U$ in a matter of seconds at a fraction of the cost of any other legacy method (once a FIAT pair becomes available).

8.2/ After a FIAT pair, payment processors can offer $Nano as a payment option without merchants even knowing what #crypto is. But they will save money by accepting #nano vs legacy systems. Once again, merchants will accept $nano because it saves them money, not because ideology.

9/ $Nano was deflationary from the start. 10 years after it's inception, $BTC still has ~ 4$% year inflation and it will only become inflationary ~ 100 years from now. Hard to call it deflationary when it has intrinsic inflation during most if not all your life. #cryptocurrency",2018-06-15 07:05:59

e0rmtfe,dmar198,75,"The video discusses methods and application possibilities for various types of swaps, especially submarine swaps and atomic swaps. Swaps are where you trustlessly trade various types of data, including crypto-to-crypto payments (e.g. bitcoins for litecoins -- swaps of this kind can be done either onchain or over lightning), onchain payments for lightning payments, lightning payments for onchain payments, and crypto payments (either kind, onchain or lightning) for torrent data.

The author also showed some demos on the testnet involving the code he has already written and is optimizing, and he shared which forms of swaps he is currently working on. The hope is that submarine swaps (both onchain-for-lightning and lightning-for-onchain) and atomic swaps (crypto-for-crypto) will both be included in LND before it gets out of beta. Based on the demos he showed, it looks very likely to me that he will finish his project in time.

The author also discussed potential applications for swap technology. Among other things, the trustless crypto-for-torrent swap (which he called an HTLCDASH swap, and which no one is currently working on, apparently) could enable trustlessly paying for downloads without ever having to worry that your counterparty might not send you the data you are paying for. The data would be divided up into chunks (like a torrent) and included in the smart contract preimage so that you pay could verify and pay for each torrent-like chunk with microtransactions, in a guaranteed and trustless way, so that it is impossible for you to pay for incorrect data.

Also, the submarine swap tech could allow exchanges to trustlessly outsource the job of onboarding people to the lightning network. So, for example, if someone wanted to withdraw bitcoins from an exchange via lightning, but the exchange doesn't have lightning integrated internally, they could trustlessly outsource the lightning withdrawal to a swap provider -- meaning they send him your payment onchain and he sends you an equivalent amount over lightning, without anyone being at risk and without the exchange having to integrate lightning. The same thing could work in reverse if you wanted to deposit over lightning -- the exchange could give you an invoice created by the swap provider, and you could pay that invoice, and -- trustlessly -- the exchange would receive an onchain payment from the swap provider.

Exchanges could also use swap technology to trade balances with merchants. I.e. if a merchant has a channel that is depleted in the incoming direction, so that he can no longer receive payments from customers, he can trustlessly trade his depleted channel for a full one with an exchange -- and thus start receiving payments again. (Exchanges hopefully won't mind getting channels that are depleted in the incoming direction, because they need to send bitcoins ""out"" to their customers very often, something that merchants rarely need to do -- and such channels still work for that purpose.)

He also discussed crypto-to-crypto swaps (e.g. litecoin to bitcoin and vice versa), showed some demos, and indicated that the code for paying someone over the lightning network in litecoin and having them receive bitcoin over the lightning network -- without you having to do anything special -- will be integrated into LND before it goes out of beta.

Lastly he shared some limitations of this technology and coding challenges that still need to be overcome. Among these, he indicated that swap providers will need to have a lot of liquidity, which is a startup challenge. Moreover, some of these swap tech applications involve onchain payments, which are slow and expensive, thus bringing some of the problems of onchain payments to lightning payments -- which no one wants. He is still working on overcoming or at least minimizing these limitations, and a lot of this is still theoretical, but he did show enough practical testnet demos that it looks like the code will be ready -- at least for submarine swaps and atomic swaps -- by the time LND is released.",2018-06-16 20:48:02

&gt; Some people seems to adulate Satoshi, think he can do nothing wrong and his word are to be interpreted as gospel. While I share Satoshi's plan to create peer to peer digital cash, I do think it is important that we think for ourselves. Here are some errors Satoshi made:

&gt; * Early version of bitcoind allows you to spend any coin by using ""op_true op_return"" as signature.

&gt; * It was initially possible to fork each version of the client on its own chain using ""op_version""

&gt; * Input value were not direcatly covered by signature, making it impossible for offline devices to check how much is spent and paid in fees.

&gt; * It is possible to put op_checksig in an input script. Coputing the signature hash fails and return 1 as an error code, but error code was checked so it is possible to produce a valid signature signing 1.

&gt; * Version fields are completely useless because they don't degrade gracefully. In case of hard fork, you can't |ake sense of the new data regardless of version, and in case of soft forks, they aren't useful.

&gt; * Places where addresses could be useful, for instance outputs, do not have one.

&gt; * Numerous opcodes were seriously flawed in early version, some of them exibiting buffer overflow.

&gt; * It was possible to create several coinbases with the same txid, and in fact, satoshi lost coins doing so. This breaks numerous assumption about the txns graph being a dag by design.

&gt; * Block size and/or tx count are not covered by pow. This creates DoS vector that lead to the introduction of the block size. Bitcoin Ulimited suffered from attacks after neglecting these DoS vectors.

&gt; * The script number format is little endian, one complement. No more comments on that one.

&gt; * The original code had numerous problems checking signature encoding, at least one could lead to a chain split between 32 and 64 bits archituctures.

&gt; * The merkle tree doesn't handle empty branches properly. This lead to a vulnerability where you could repeat transactions is a block and get a node to reject it.

&gt; * It is also possible to generate a valid 64 bytes transaction that looks like an intermediate node in the merkle tree, making it possible to lie to spv by brute forcing 70bits or so, which isn't considered secure.

&gt; * Verifying signatures was O(n*m) where n is the number of checksig ops and m the transaction size. This makes it possible to generate transaction that are absurdly expensive to validate.

e0rqthp,WRSaunders,46,"If you're talking about bitcoin, you've missed the mechanism.  Bitcoins can't be counterfeited because there is a log of who's owned every single one since it was mined.  The log can be checked by anyone, it's the opposite of ""hidden"".

What's not disclosed in the digital money solution is which ""human"" owns which ""wallet"".  Everyone agrees how many bitcoins are in each wallet, but nobody knows who owns which wallet.  When you read about digital money being stolen, it's when a different human manages to claim ownership of the money in a wallet by discovering the secret cryptographic key used to prove ""I own this wallet"".

This is different than offshore accounts, where the offshore bank knows you are the owner and won't tell your government.  (By the way, there isn't as much protection here as you'd think from watching TV and movies.)  With a digital wallet, nobody but you knows that you own the wallet.  If you don't tell, and don't leave the key around, there is nobody who is capable of disclosing your identity.  This is much better than having someone know and hoping they won't tell.",2018-06-16 22:32:55

Don't fucking Johnn***E***  Test me. 

All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery? It's not my fault if you can't handle my de trop of definitions or my lexical linguipotence! Get back up there and read it, even if you have to go through it with dictionary in hand.

e0w2fx2,TillBillyJoe,71,"&gt;What is the advantage or use-case of Stellar Lumens?

Actual low fee transactions (currently $0.0000023) with throughput around 1000 TPS with around 3 seconds confirmations. It's been like that since day one, ~3 years ago, so this isn't some pie in the sky or untested blockchain. It works and it's battle tested in the wild. And this isn't even accounting for it's upcoming [scalability solutions that could allow for ~10,000 tps.](https://www.lumenauts.com/blog/how-many-transactions-per-second-can-stellar-process)


Stellars killer app is scalability + tokens. If you're having an ICO for a project or token that doesn't require a turing complete smartcontract system, which is 80% of ICOs IMO, then Stellar is at a huge advantage over Ethereum. For any simple token like utility tokens, asset backed tokens, stocks, ect. stellar is a clear choice. Not to mention being in the top 10 cryptos gives it the first mover advantage and a market share greater than any smaller coins capable of doing similar things.


&gt;Is XLM overvalued with a 11,828.76 NVT ratio?

I'm not sure how accurate those numbers are nor how much it really effects the value of the project. [Doge for example has 1/4 the NVT ratio of bitcoin.](https://coinmetrics.io/nvt/#assets=doge,btc,eth,xlm_roll=200_zoom=1369872000000,1529193600000) But one thing I suspect is that those calculators online don't account for the value of tokens on the blockchain. Since fees are so low you need almost no XLM to use tokens.

But the big thing that people don't know yet is that [DEX trading on stellar is exploding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/8ruas2/dex_trading_is_exploding/). Stellar has one of the best DEXs I've ever seen. Orders fill instantly, almost no fees, ect. It's a trading experience lightyears ahead that of etherdelta or idex.

It's popular in some circles to accuse *closed source* software of including malware, bitcoin miners, copyrighted content, DRM, theft from existing GNU licensed emulators (open source licensed projects that can't be reused without opening the source) and in the case of emulation some try ""doesn't respect clean-room reverse engineering"". In CEMU's case:

* no antivirus positives
* encryption keys and copyrighted data isn't included with the emulator
* the drm is only in the early access patreon demo and not the delayed free version, and only triggers when the same copy is used 1000 times
* someone passionate about open source tried to analyse the executable for similar patterns with other emulators (doesn't help cemu was actually the *first* wii u emulator) using IDA Pro to incriminate it, but after a while gave up without finding much of anything. He instead started cracking the early drm version as a fuck you to the dev anyways.
* the developer says he used existing public information and documentation, and tests using programs he writes and tests on a real console. 
* That aside, ""not respecting clean room RE"" implies access to the Wii U's ""source code"" either leaked or disassembled (while emulation is simulating *hardware* workings, also a desperate Sony tried this attack vector against Bleem, but only managed it with the BIOS software not the hardware, and still got denied by the courts), and it's a US-specific corporate friendly clause that has been mainly used to undermine free software replacements for Microsoft Office so the irony is tangible. 
* More damningly, that an emulator is open source doesn't make it immune to breaching clean room. In fact there's a lot of those right now but the copyright holders (Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft indirectly) didn't care. OSS can and have put DRM and malware hooks in too that went unnoticed.

tl;dr: different ways to say ""closed source = crime, suspicious"" 

It's a very misguided way to support open source, in the hopes that the emulator will be abandoned by the users or the developer scared into it, and then it can be ""developed faster"" with ""more hands in the soup"". It's even counterproductive because these accusations managed to *discourage* the CEMU developer (and also various dreamcast emudevs) out of initially supporting open source.

It also tries to unearth a long settled debate about the legality of emulation as a whole just to spite one single closed source program. The Free Software Foundation did nothing to help emulator developers who asked for their help suing clone emulators on google's play store profiting off a copy of someone else's work and not respecting it license.

e10hhph,BlottoOtter,35,"Content reposted below, as it seems that my post has been deleted from /r/Tether !

On 6/20/2018, Tether posted ""[Transparency Update - FSS Report](https://tether.to/fss-report-transparency-update/)"", which claims that a [report](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf) from Freeh, Sporkin &amp; Sullivan LLP verifies that USDT is fully backed by USD reserves. (The report does not do that, [as I explain here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/8si7g0/tether_transparency_update_fss_report/e0zs4uj/)) The [report](https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf) does not disclose the banks Tether uses, but in the ""Introduction"" section it mentions that Eugene Sullivan, one of the partners at FSS, ""is a member of the advisory board of one of Tether’s banks. It was through this connection that Tether was introduced to FSS. As well, the firm's relationship with the bank allowed for the following review to commence in a timely and comprehensive manner, ensuring that no pertinent information was overlooked in the process.""

I don't know if that connection is an inherent conflict of interest, but it certainly seems like a *potential* conflict of interest, depending on the nature and extent of the relationships between these parties. So I tried googling about Eugene Sullivan to see if I could find any banks that publicly list him as an advisor or as sitting on their advisory board; I have not yet been able to find one. However, I did find an [obscure blog post](https://factfreeh.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/bloomberg-businessweekfebruary-15-2018a-chinese-casino-has-conquered-a-piece-of-america/) that summarized and elaborated on a [Bloomberg Businessweek article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-02-15/a-chinese-company-has-conquered-a-piece-of-america) about a Hong Kong-based conglomerate called Imperial Pacific International Holdings Ltd. The article and blog post point out that Eugene Sullivan was a board member of Imperial Pacific before stepping down to an advisory role. (That fact is corroborated by [Imperial Pacific's 2017 financial statements](http://www.imperialpacific.com/uploads/attachment/2018-04/303515ae35e87840b4.pdf), which list him as a board member resigned in 2017.) Louis Freeh, another partner at FSS, is also mentioned in that article as an adviser to Imperial Pacific.

It turns out that Imperial Pacific has been making headlines lately in the financial press. In addition to that Bloomberg Businessweek article, there are many others on [allegations of human trafficking and money laundering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/human-smuggling-money-laundering-probes-surround-saipan-casino) related to Imperial Pacific casino businesses. Bloomberg also reports that one of Imperial Pacific's offices [was raided by the FBI in March 2018.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/saipan-casino-operator-is-said-to-be-raided-by-u-s-agents)

None of this appears to constitute evidence of any linkage between Tether and Imperial Pacific. That said, I find it curious that, in another attempt to dodge an audit performed by an accounting firm, Tether (a [Hong Kong-based](https://tether.to/contact-us/) firm accused of [fraud](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/mystery-shrouds-tether-and-its-links-to-biggest-bitcoin-exchange) and [violation of anti-money laundering law](https://www.lawfareblog.com/another-cryptocurrency-target-us-regulators-tether), and under [scrutiny by the feds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc)) commissions a ""transparency"" report from a law firm with partners involved in the governance of a Hong Kong-based firm that is accused of [violation of anti-money laundering law](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/human-smuggling-money-laundering-probes-surround-saipan-casino) and is under the [scrutiny of the feds.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/saipan-casino-operator-is-said-to-be-raided-by-u-s-agents) Even if the hiring of FSS by Tether is a complete coincidence, I think the connections between FSS partners and Imperial Pacific make them the wrong people to provide input on the state of Tether's business. (That, and the fact that they're lawyers, not accountants.)

Right now, I interpret this new FSS report as nothing other than a disingenuous distraction from the fact that Tether refuses to undergo a financial statement audit that would validate their reserves. If that's not the case, and Tether is truly committed to transparency, then there are several questions they should be willing to answer:

1. What banks does Tether use? Specifically, which bank do they use that Eugene Sullivan serves as an advisor to? What is the nature and extent of his financial relationship with that bank? What is that bank's customer base like, and what percentage of the bank's business comes from Tether and its related parties (including but not limited to Bitfinex)? Does that bank provide other services or products to Tether, such as lending?

2. When will Tether undergo a financial statement audit and publish audited financial statements? Why has Tether to-date only commissioned extremely limited procedures that look at balances at points in time, as opposed to procedures that would cover a longer time period? Why has Tether (in the FSS and Friedman reports) opted to enter into consulting engagements (which provide no assurance), as opposed to attestation engagements?",2018-06-21 06:18:40

e1351hw,Drwillpowers,137,"2017 was a brutal year for my family. We had a house fire in November that literally destroyed our lives. I was injured, lost my job, everything I've ever owned, but worst of all my 3 cats. You probably saw the news story. Two of the cats had Guinness world records. Admittedly, I've spent the past 6 months trying to rebuild my life and start over again, and its been a real challenge. For some unknown reason I was compelled to put the majority of our bitcoin in a fire safe 3 weeks before the fire. As a result, it was (besides my partially burned shirt and a pair of shorts I wore while in the fire) my sole possession after the fire. As a result, the tradition of hidden bitcoin continues for its 3rd year. 
This year's capsules will be a bit different. Once again I'm hiding a little over 2 grand in the forest. However along with each capsule is this story, and the request that whoever finds them takes a little bit of the money and buys a $20 fire extinguisher from amazon or wal-mart. My family only had one, and it was in a place blocked by the blaze.  I searched in the blaze until I collapsed trying to find my cats. Had I woken up and had the extinguisher nearby, I could have saved them. I don't want anyone to ever suffer like we have, and so I ask that if you find one, you spend some of the money to make sure your family is prepared. 
In regards to the rest of the funds, they can be tracked on blockchain.info at the addresses at the bottom of this post to confirm they are real. If you have any doubts that I""ll really hide them, just ask prior forest attendees. Lots of people have found my hidden bitcoin. In any case, this is what the pots look like, so look for them!
Lastly, enjoy your lives. I completely ignored the advice of the 911 operator and went back into my house over and over. While searching for my cats, I found myself trapped in a room, and was 100% sure I was going to die. As I was going down, I thought about how dissapointed I was at having to die age 32 of something so random with so much left I wanted to do.  Due to sheer luck, the fact that I jumped in the shower for a few seconds during one of my runs to dampen my clothes, and modern medicine caring for my roasted lungs,  I managed to escape with my life if nothing else. I could have easily died that day, and it would have been the end of me. No more experiences, no more forests. Try to take it easy on your brain with substances this and next week and make good lasting memories. I hope the Bitcoin finds it way into the hands of people who really need it. Send me a PM if you need help cashing it out, but I suggest you hold onto it as long as you can if you don't really need the money. If you ever end up holding a lot of it, get a safety deposit box (I no longer keep any in my home), and store it there. Best of luck!

**Edit as everyone always asks, I hide them over the course of the weekend pretty much wherever I go. I just see a good spot and tuck one in. I always do this away from my big bitcoin totem so that people don't immediately go snatch them up. They are usually hidden in difficulty in regards to value. I keep all the private addresses for one month. There is a note in the containers about how to sweep the bitcoin off the paper.

Much of what I do in hostile territory involves a sales technique known as pacing &amp; leading.  In sales, this means that you initially make it seem like you agree &amp; understand what they're saying, so it feels like you're walking alongside them, walking in the same direction as they are, and then you gently turn them to your product or service.

So if you immediately blurt out ""Bitcoin Cash"", you'll get a kneejerk reaction of a million downvotes.  But if you start with useful information that they can relate to, and then gently lead them to BCH, then you can win them over.

I don't care if it's hostile territory. I play offense, and I play to win. ABC. Always Be Closing.

This USD -&gt; BTC ramp will allow people around the world to EARN Bitcoin for small jobs rather than ""buy"" Bitcoin.

This will be great for people in countries like India who could use a deflationary currency, rather than a currency that loses 10&amp;#37; of its value or more every year.

Kasego will greatly contribute to Bitcoin's global adoption as more people begin to get rid of (spend) their USD ($) and store their value (hold) in BTC (฿).

Imagine a world where everyone uses Bitcoin. Your employer pays you in Bitcoin. You shop and pay with Bitcoin.

Maybe you broke up with your abusive ex 2 months ago and moved cities to get away from her. Maybe an insurance company is trying to determine if you are an ""unsafe"" person. Maybe an oppressive government is trying to stop you from buying books online.

Every public blockchain allows these people to find you. Every public blockchain allows these people to know you.

And even if you bought something 20 years ago, it's recorded. Permanently. Regardless of who you are now, regardless of the circumstances, if you run for office one day you can rest assured your opponent will bring it up.

Like, with Bitcoin, you only have to trust your own hardware, and math, and 51% of the hashing power in the network.

And Bitcoin is one of the better-thought-out ones. I once saw one that claimed to avoid Bitcoin's 51% problem, so after much effort, I tracked down their actual whitepaper (and not the ""marketing whitepaper""), and confirmed that they are technically correct: That one didn't have a 51% problem.

e18z2za,qwsazxcde1,119,"2014 man. I got into Bitcoin. I loved it. I told everyone about it. First coins were purchased for ~350$ and then later 600. Then 200... I learned that Bitcoin liked going down. I tried margin trading but I was bad. I told myself it was learning fees and I should get better. I studied more and read more but found out I pretty much just liked gambling.


By 2015 I'd lost like 400$ for like the 6th time on okcoin and their 20x futures I stopped going to the whaleclub teamspeak and talking to traders and I stopped thinking about Bitcoin pretty much. I stopped coming to this Reddit. All the money I made working at McDonald's and saving up was pretty much gone but I wasn't broke or anything. I lived with my parents and shit was cheap and I found a new hobby in poker. 


I went deap down that rabbit hole. And I got really really fucking good. In fact I played something like 400,000 hands studying in 2016 and then 1.3million hands in 2017 netting me something in the mid 5 figure range of profit. Which is hard to do man. Especially online. I took the knowledge, the risk management, And the money I learned from poker  and got back into Bitcoin when a lot of the people here did. The rally up to 20k. Luckily for me though I only ever knew bear markets. I was born a bear in this world. 


I put in some money. Watched it go up as we went from 4k to 5k to like 10 then to fucking 20. And I held. Then we dropped hard and I'm like oh... Oh I'm ready. We hit 17k and I booted up the old margin trading account and have pretty much been opening shorts whenever I can. Trading primarily on 1D charts. I've knocked out about 10-15 pretty rediculous trades on anywhere from 2.5x to 10x leverage. 



Anyways... The real reason I'm typing this up in my bed at 2 am on a Sunday night is because when monday comes around and I've got to go into work. I'm gonna be putting in my two week notice. I'm gonna be done putting up with my shitty coworkers and I'm gonna be done driving an hour to work both ways every day. Somehow... I got lucky man. I know the variance aspect from poker. I ran good... Really. Really good. I've never had so much btc and it's crazy to me that I do now. All from what I learned these passed few years. I sold. I'm set. For a good, Longgg while. And my life's gonna be changed forever. All thanks to you guys. I'm 95% out and I'll be continuing the trading grind with that 5% and see what I can do with it as a hobby. Cheers guys, the learner's fees paid off for me. This is still gentlemen 🤙 ",2018-06-25 15:01:54

https://twitter.com/bytemaster7/status/1010927437432213505


""From the Ethereum ""Constitution"" (https://www.ethereum.org/agreement ) calls for arbitration. Ethereum also supports freezing and reversing of transactions and has done so.  Ethereum is governed by use of centralized Trademark held by a single entity.""


It really pisses me off when someone as smart as Dan spreads misinformation in such an obvious way. He knows exactly what he is doing, and this is him intentionally trying to damage ETH reputation ( this is not an innocent mistake or misunderstanding because he knows more than most how difficult blockchain governance is, having been in the space since early bitcoin, to the Ethereum ICO till now).


Make no mistake, there is no freezing and reversing of transactions done arbitrarily on Ethereum. Ethereum is governed by the holders, the devs, the miners and the nodes all together as a community. If Ethereum had arbitration and the power to freeze and reverse transactions, the DAO would not have been a big ordeal causing a significant risk to Ether and the birthing of Ethereum Classic. Even with the hard fork and birth of ETC, no account was frozen or transaction reversed. The hackers account and transaction exists in the original ETC chain till this day. 


Worse yet. We just had MULTIPLE parity failures from the malicious hack of various ICOs and the multi sig contract kill. This happened towards the end of last year, and caused huge problems in the community for AGES with calls for a contentious hard fork and lots of divisive sentiment and things said within the community. This went on for months, and the lost funds were never unfrozen, and no transaction reversed or hacker account was frozen. Now if the EF had any power to freeze or reverse transaction, or if anyone on the Ethereum network had arbitration powers, do you think we would have gone through all these problems that almost threatened the whole communities very continued existence? Dans claims are disrespectful and really mean, and honestly, after the help Vitalik provided in checking his code and exposing critical errors days before launch, the least Dan could do is atleast be fair and not spread misinformation against Ethereum.",2018-06-25 16:45:26

e187ndp,SanityInAnarchy,48,"Honestly, it kinda does, but more importantly, neither of those pages explains it very well. The first is straight-up marketing bullshit, with no technical details at all. The second is... well, naive:

&gt; &gt; How does Waltonchain plan to prevent the RFID chips from genuine products being removed and placed into counterfeit good? Whilst I understand this will stop the production of counterfeit good from counterfeit factories, I do not understand how this will prevent chips from genuine products being placed onto the exact same counterfeit item.

&gt; Currently, to prevent RFID IC removal, Waltonchain has a corresponding solution for different industry applications. In the clothing industry, we encapsulate RFID tags into care labels of brand clothes items, and the tagsallow to track the transfer of a single product along the production, logistics, sales and other areas of circulation. The forger cannot get care labels removed and apply the RFID tag to fake and shoddy goods.

...erm... why the hell not? This sounds like someone is suggesting that removing and re-sewing a tag on a piece of clothing is impossible. Am I reading that right? Because if that's what they're saying, that's *hilariously* naive. Seriously:

&gt; &gt; If the RFID is on the packaging of a box, how will Walton plan to prevent the contents of the boxed being replaced?...

&gt; The fragile anti-transfer tag developed by the Waltonchain team can prevent replacement from the genuine box. We will locate the fragile anti-transfer tag where the package may be opened to ensure that the RFID tag is fully bound to the physical asset when applied.

...gee, no one will ever be able to open the package from... somewhere *else,* could they? 

Neither page even attempts to explain WTF the advantage of *blockchain* is, though, over literally anything else. The point is for each factory to be able to generate an RFID chip that is unique, and identifies the factory of origin, right? So... why not ordinary cryptographic signatures issued by a trusted authority? Because, from the FAQ:

&gt; &gt; With the RFID chips being issues from a Waltonchain database, what would happen if the issuing database was compromised?...

&gt; Waltonchain is a decentralized distributed ledger based on the blockchain technology. All the data loaded to the chain is confirmed by more than a half of the nodes. The data on the chain cannot be tampered.

...unless you control more than half the nodes, right? And since I see a ""mining"" page that mentions GPU mining, I have to assume there's some sort of PoW here, even though the FAQ mentions stake. So this is *exactly* Bitcoin's 51% problem. The bigger a network is, the more resilient it is to such attacks, but Bitcoin is the biggest one and it *still* saw a mining pool accidentally gain 51% of the compute.

So I honestly don't see this being an advantage over a simple cryptographic signature applied at the factory, other than being buzzword-compliant. But it does have one gigantic red flag:

&gt; &gt; Will you have your code base public?

&gt; We have plans to open the Waltonchain code. We will reveal the relevant code at the right time after we have completed full reliability and security tests.

Until then, we have no reason to trust you or your code.

'How can so many be so naive', he rubbed his temples.  'This DAMN CURSE!' He screamed out, to his audience of empty energy drink cans and his e-cig.  Ever since he was younger, he was told he was smart.  His selfish and worthless parents drilled into his head how smart he was.  Clearly he was raised by narcissists, because this praise of his intelligence made him lazy and despondent.  'That was their plan, they didn't want to see me succeed.  Those baby boomers would rather talk about how I'm not doing well but dad owned a house, 3 cars, and a woman by the time he was 19 with his factory job!!!!!!!  It's not fair!  They told me I was smart to manipulate me!'

Exasperated at this despair, he laid down, head hanging over to see his copy of 1984 that he never read but enjoyed talking about incessantly.

e1bbcuu,barbierir,33,"They achieve it by creating an arbitrary number of completed independent 2mb blockchains (called ""parallel"" chains) that can do cross-chain swaps with each other.

I really mean ""independent"" blockchains because they can have their own PoW miners and if any of them (or KMD itself) were nuked, the others could still function.

KMD and all its parallel chains share the same fixed supply of coins among them. The coins can be used normally between users on the same chain but they can also be sent from one chain to another. When moved from a chain to another they're completely burned on the former and created from zero on the latter.

I'm sure most of you have already spotted a problem: such chains must have a very weak security. In fact KMD uses a set of 64 elected ""Notary Nodes"" for a special security job. They're called ""notaries"" or you could call them ""oracles"" if you wish. 

Please note that such NN are a very different thing from Masternodes/dPoS/BP or similar systems, because NN don't have any monopoly on mining, even with large scale collusion they can't censor tx or do any shenanigans to the independent blockchains. The worst thing a compromised NN can do is refraining from doing his notarization job (and so losing all the revenue in the process). Fortunately the min requirement is that 13 out of 64 NN do their job for the system to work.

So, what NNs do?

1) First, they add a layer of protection from consensus attacks, called delayed-PoW, by notarizing the parallel chains on KMD and then KMD itself on the BTC blockchain (but they can switch to any other future blockchain with more hashrate). After waiting for a notarization turn, even the small blockchains are as secure as BTC. 

2) Second, they check the proofs of the cross-chain swaps ensuring that they are completed (it takes ~15 minutes for moving coins to a chain to another)

The vision is that for massive scaling the load can be spread among many roads instead of a single large road. For example there could a chain for Asia, one for north America or for Europe... or even a lot more up to every city/county level or for specific use cases. There is no practical limit, except what the internet itself can sustain. The effect is similar to sharding but without all the complications of implementing it.

Users will run/mine the blockchain they use most frequently or more than one as they wish. Eventually all of them get notarized on BTC inheriting the same hashrate protection.

Beside this scalability, KMD allows to create other customizable PoS/PoW blockchains (assetchains) with their own token supply and smart contract capability. They enjoy the same dPoW protection.

KMD and the assetchains can be traded on the native p2p ""atomic swap"" BarterDEX that also supports most Bitcoin-based coins, Ethereum and Erc20. 

As for privacy, KMD itself is a Zcash fork and so are all assetchains. A feature called JUMBLR will add automatic mixing using zksnarks tech, that will become more effective as the ecosystem grows.",2018-06-26 20:49:30

e1cgyhp,MaxCharacterLimit-20,45,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

e1cduis,Drwillpowers,38,"2017 was a brutal year for my family. We had a house fire in November that literally destroyed our lives. I was injured, lost my job, everything I've ever owned, but worst of all my 3 cats. You probably saw the news story. Two of the cats had Guinness world records. Admittedly, I've spent the past 6 months trying to rebuild my life and start over again, and its been a real challenge. For some unknown reason I was compelled to put the majority of our bitcoin in a fire safe 3 weeks before the fire. As a result, it was (besides my partially burned shirt and a pair of shorts I wore while in the fire) my sole possession after the fire. As a result, the tradition of hidden bitcoin continues for its 3rd year. This year's capsules will be a bit different. Once again I'm hiding a little over 2 grand in the forest. However along with each capsule is this story, and the request that whoever finds them takes a little bit of the money and buys a $20 fire extinguisher from amazon or wal-mart. My family only had one, and it was in a place blocked by the blaze. I searched in the blaze until I collapsed trying to find my cats. Had I woken up and had the extinguisher nearby, I could have saved them. I don't want anyone to ever suffer like we have, and so I ask that if you find one, you spend some of the money to make sure your family is prepared. In regards to the rest of the funds, they can be tracked on blockchain.info at the addresses at the bottom of this post to confirm they are real. If you have any doubts that I""ll really hide them, just ask prior forest attendees. Lots of people have found my hidden bitcoin. In any case, this is what the pots look like, so look for them! Lastly, enjoy your lives. I completely ignored the advice of the 911 operator and went back into my house over and over. While searching for my cats, I found myself trapped in a room, and was 100% sure I was going to die. As I was going down, I thought about how dissapointed I was at having to die age 32 of something so random with so much left I wanted to do. Due to sheer luck, the fact that I jumped in the shower for a few seconds during one of my runs to dampen my clothes, and modern medicine caring for my roasted lungs, I managed to escape with my life if nothing else. I could have easily died that day, and it would have been the end of me. No more experiences, no more forests. Try to take it easy on your brain with substances this and next week and make good lasting memories. I hope the Bitcoin finds it way into the hands of people who really need it. Send me a PM if you need help cashing it out, but I suggest you hold onto it as long as you can if you don't really need the money. If you ever end up holding a lot of it, get a safety deposit box (I no longer keep any in my home), and store it there. Best of luck!",2018-06-27 06:31:28

e1fp0j1,DCinvestor,51,"[We *may* be entering a deep crypto bear which takes a year or more to resolve.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wJT_6DtrFY)  The linked video is from my favorite chart drawer, and he is one of the few out there who doesn't pander to fanboys with his analysis.  He is sober, and he is often right from the time I've been watching him.  According to him, we are watching the end of an epic hype cycle play out.

Let me preface this by saying I take a *very long* view to my crypto investments.

But it's important to entertain the possibility that fundamental news *may* not matter to ETH price in a meaningful way in the near future.  If the SEC announcement did nothing durable for the price, then I'm not sure EOS's ETH selling ending, futures, or anything else is likely to make a durable difference in the near term.  The prevailing bear market could ""win,"" even in the face of news like that.  And with the restructuring of the roadmap, we are not likely to see a Casper / PoS bump any time soon.  Also, I imagine that institutions will be sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a better entry point which they now expect at this point (they are *pros* at playing hype cycles)- and of course, custody solutions.

The *entire market* could move downward sharply if BTC breaks $5800 down to $5K.  It would probably go lower after that (who knows how far, but some are calling for $2.5K to $3K BTC), and then stabilize out.  If that happens, that will likely be an excellent accumulation period for the next big run.

This overall market is not driven by fundamentals in a meaningful way right now.  *It is driven by hype, that feeds off of itself and news.*  You could argue that crypto really has no fundamentals (at least at present).  Fundamentals from equity analysis typically involve valuation of real assets, income / cash flow, profit, business models, etc.  Most of crypto has none of these.  [And right now, interest in crypto is at a recent low.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin)  It will surely increase again, especially as platforms like Ethereum deliver real, tangible value, but I write this post to remind you to **manage your expectations** on when that might be.  If you're the type that would freak out about buying ETH, and watching it decline by even up to 30% to 50% from here, then understand that about yourself and make decisions accordingly.  Wait for a clearer trend, or buy and hold for a period of years (that's what I do for the most part).

I'm definitely not selling (I don't trade, and generally only make sells for tax loss harvesting), but I am layering in some buys at lower levels and reserving some cash on the side in the event of a bigger drop.  Within a month or two, I expect to be back to good old, boring dollar cost averaging, whether we're in a deep bear or not.  And no, I'm not shorting.

I'm no pro, and I could be wrong, but that's what I'm doing.  I plan to do some more reading on hype cycles before we enter the next one.

What I mean by this is that what's keeping people from putting whatever false transactions they want into the blockchain is that most of the hash power on the network is ""honest"". An attacker would need to get 51% or more of the hash power to start confirming fraudulent blocks, and the only reason this is not trivially possible is exactly because so much electricity and computing power is being wasted in searching for blocks. It's economically difficult to get up to that 51% mark because of the sheer cost of the hardware and electricity.

If the mining algorithm were to somehow become more efficient such that the current hash power of the network only consumed 1% of the current electricity, or something like that, this would only make it far easier to attack the network if it were to stay that way. But of course, it wouldn't, because people would just use the electricity they were paying for previously to increase their own hash power, until we got back up to the same usage as before (i.e. the maximum amount that miners can purchase before it becomes unprofitable or they run into delivery limitations).

The limitation was due to other parts of the networking stack, and not an arbitrary choice. When BTC was started it was assumed 32mb would be enough for quite some time, performing a hard fork later to go beyond this upper limit.

Core developers completely diverged from this path and the design laid out by the whitepaper by keeping the temporary 1mb limitation that Satoshi placed as a quick plug for an issue called *poison blocks*\*,\* as well as soft forked SegWit which drastically alters how BTC operates. Now they are pushing transactions off-chain with Lightning Network as the big solution to their made up problems.

e1g31b0,dragontamer5788,76,"&gt; Sure you have to mine a bitcoin at first, but you don't have to mine 1,000 bitcoins to make 1,000 bitcoin transactions.

No. But each transaction takes up a minimum of ~200 bytes (roughly) and there are only 1mb of data per block. In short: a BTC Block can at BEST handle 5000 transactions every 10 minutes, or roughly 8.3 transactions per second.

So you need, under current settings, to mine 12.5 bitcoins to have 5000 transactions (of any size) take place. Or less, because complicated transactions (such as multi-sig or other multi-party transactions) use much more than 200 bytes.

Efforts to increase the size of the BTC Block (its just a compile flag... super easy to change) have been met with flamewars and have all failed. As such, the BTC network can at best handle 8.3 transactions per second.

------------

The mining mechanism of BTC is how transactions work. If miners didn't exist, then BTC couldn't be transacted. That's the entire point of the BTC network: miners allow transactions to happen and therefore they are awarded with BTC.",2018-06-29 01:25:10
e1g6kg7,dragontamer5788,76,"You need to mine a block to get roughly 5000 transactions verified. Mining a block also creates 12.5 Bitcoins. This limit is due to the 1MB limit of the BTC Block-size. Anything that doesn't fit in the block needs to go onto the next block.

As such, there's **roughly** 400-transactions per mined Bitcoin.

Actually, that's assuming the best case scenario. In reality, not every block is ""full"", and some transactions use up far more space than usual. As such, you may only get 300-transactions in a block, or 200 sometimes.

--------------

So there's where the energy calculation comes from. Every 12.5 BTCs that are mined allows for 5000-transactions to take place (best case scenario. Will likely be way fewer transactions in practice). Calculate the energy costs of 12.5 BTC, divide by 5000 and bam. You got the energy cost per transaction.",2018-06-29 02:13:21

e1hrizi,rzwitserloot,48,"I wouldn't say 'largely'. Nevertheless, knowledge of how threads work comes up from time to time.

#The problem

The problem with threads is this: You introduce an explosion of execution paths. Instead of a simple 'first java executes the first line of this method, then, it executes the second line of this method, all the way to the end', it becomes: ""An arbitrarily chosen thread chooses an arbitrary number of instructions to execute, then, the VM will make an arbitrary choice as to whether or not to make any changes to fields this thread performed visible to other threads unless you've done a good job on reading the java memory model to ensure propagation of these changes"".

The former is easily understood. The latter is (largely) untestable and unfollowable, and therefore, fine strategy to write code that looks good, passes all tests, runs great on your machine... and bombs in production 5 days later, in a way that is utterly mystifying; no exception pointing at the problem. The problem won't be reproducible (do the same thing, click the same buttons, feed in the same data... and now it works fine. And then tomorrow when that important customer logs in, it'll fail again on you). Finding a bug like this is _literally_ on the order of 100 to 1000 times harder to find, so avoiding even one such bug is 'worth' having 100 others.


Nevertheless, using all the cores in your CPU is [A] practical, in that just running it all on one can be unacceptably wasteful for performance, but more importantly [B] inevitable, because you don't write every line of code in your app yourself (you use libraries; the core java.* libraries at the very least), and THOSE will sometimes use threads.

So, what is a programmer to do?

My advice: Anytime you get to threading, try to push towards going big or going small; in both cases, you NEVER call ANY method on Thread (possibly you do some Thread.sleep in the 'going big' style), you have no need whatsoever of 'synchronized', no state is shared between threads, and you don't create new threads (some framework / library  does this for you).

# Going big

Write or use a framework which is the execution framework for your own actual business code. For example, a web framework is such a thing: You start it, it does things, and then it runs your code. Generally in these cases you do not write public static void main, or you do, but all that your main does is fire up the framework whilst you configure it or pass to it a bunch of 'handlers', and then the voodoo black box does its work.

Such frameworks are really good at setting up threading. This way each handler can be in its own little world; if a thread shares no data with any other, reasoning about threads is much, much simpler. Take webservers: Any given web handler simply does not get to interact with other handlers. It's not like you can ask the web framework for a list of WebHandler objects that you can then call methods on.

There will still be a need to interact, of course. However, in such environments the interaction is very tightly controlled via specialized calls. For web frameworks, the interaction is usually 'I use an appropriate transaction level and interact (with transactions) with a database; my communications with other handlers works via this database, as they will end up reading what I write, and this database intermediate makes reasoning about the flow of data much simpler'. Other options are things like rabbitMQ.

# Going small

Reduce the code that needs to run multithreaded to the smallest possible thing it can be, and then write a single stream/collection based operation that uses threading to apply this operation to a great many inputs concurrently. The fork/join framework is the usual go-to here. Imagine you are writing a bitcoin miner. This operation can be described as follows:

GIVEN: A list of a few million randomly generated codes to try, and exactly 1 input block.

TASK: Write the hash into that 1 input block, hash it, and see if the hash ends up having the appropriate amount of 0s at the very end.

You can do this by going small: Write a trivial method (it won't be larger than half a screen's worth, that's common in this 'go small' model) which injects the code into the block, hashes it, and returns an empty string if the hash is not suitable, and if you hit the jackpot, returns the block. Add to this a 'reducer' which takes in all results and returns only those that aren't empty.

# Libraries

In practice, especially for the 'going big' route, you may need to have a cache or some such that should be shared between whatever threads your webframework is making for you, but try to find libraries for this too. There are some tricks to interacting with such libraries. Generally, you have to go 'atomic'. For example, you can use the various collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package, but, the only guarantees it can make is that a single method call does the right thing. It cannot guarantee that a series of calls does the right thing. So, don't do this:

	if (concurrentMap.containsKey(myKey)) {
		String v = concurrentMap.get(myKey);
		operateOn(v);
	}

because you have no guarantee that `containsKey` will be consistent with your later `get` call. Instead, find a way to do it in one call. Here, it's simple. Do this:

	String v = concurrentMap.get(myKey);
	if (v != null) {
		operateOn(v);
	}

another example: Don't do:

	String v = myCache.get(myKey);
	if (v == null) {
		v = doExpensiveCalculationOfValue(myKey);
		myCache.put(myKey, v);
	}

instead, do:

	String v = myCache.computeIfAbsent(myKey, k -&gt; doExpensiveCalculationOfValue(k));

it's even shorter to boot ;)

# Lessons

* Use frameworks, either large: Web frameworks, or small: fork/join, hadoop, or other map-reduce-style stuff.
* thread-to-thread communication uses abstractions like message busses (rabbitMQ and such) or databases.
* if you MUST have direct thread-to-thread interop, use libraries with collections types that are designed for this, such as `java.util.concurrent` and guava's `CacheBuilder` stuff. When interacting with these collections, know that consecutive method calls to them have no guarantees of internal consistency, so reduce it to 1 call. Be aware of methods like map's `computeIfAbsent` to enable this.

e1hbmyx,autemox,48,"Point and Figure https://i.imgur.com/khnkTKi.png  We have confirmed a new column of 7 O's.  We have been moving sideways for the last 12 columns with only 1 long columns.  That is fairly unusual, usually bitcoin doesn't have so many short columns in sequence.  Often we will get a very large move after such short columns.

A pullback to $4,499 would complete unresolved long pole dating back about 9 months ago and is our next likely long-term target.  

Short term, we have a recent unresolved long pole of 16 O's from 6/10, a move above 7,040 would resolve 50&amp;#37; of the pole.  I was thinking our bull div on the daily from several days ago would bring us to this short term target, but it hasn't happened yet.  Fun fact, we have had 168 long poles in the last 9 months and every single one of the 168 long poles have had 50% resolution except this one from 6/10. 1.5 year of PnF here: https://i.imgur.com/AuSFbNz.png

Daily close at lower low has invalidated our bull div on RSI daily chart.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/kllGtGIl/ 
 So if you bought on the bull div, where to close the long?  I have a strong sense that many traders are waiting for some sort of decent movement up that they can potentially short (that's me at least).  Downside potential is still large and there is no guarantee we'll get that short entry we want.  That doesn't mean we should open new shorts here, but closing a long here to prevent further loss is reasonable.  And there are a LOT more longs than shorts showing on finex right now.

A 2-part bull div could form if we get a green candle today*.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/kllGtGIl/  Yes I realize I just said that our bull div was invalidated at today's daily close.  But tomorrow's another day, and like most bull div invalidation there is a chance for a 2-part bull div to occur if the downward momentum does not continue.  There is 20 hours for this to confirm, so take it with a grain of salt, but keep it in mind when you look at today's close.

Lets do something (just for) fun we do sometimes (tldr; it likely doesn't work) and look at google trends: [https://i.imgur.com/Tkd2p1y.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tkd2p1y.png) If we apply trend analysis to our google trend, we see that we are in a clear downward trend on the daily chart (scrolling back to Q1 2018 reveals the downward trend since 2/6).  Lower lows and lower highs are being made.  However, around June 11 we made a higher high and June 17 possibly a higher low.  If we break the higher high from June 11, this would put our google searches in an upward trend and would be bullish.  Until then, we are maintaining a downward trend that has lasted since 2/6 (on 2/6 we had a single day where it looked like trend was changing to upward and then failed 4 days later).  Does this sort of trend analysis on google trends work? Probably not! 😂

If you only have 1 bitcoin then the most you can do is sell it, wait for the price to go down, then buy it back lower. But if the exchange will let you do 5x leverage then you can borrow 5 bitcoins from the exchange, sell all 5, buy 5 back lower, and repay them with the new 5 at the lower price, pocketing the difference.

The problem is, what happens if the price goes up. You still need to repay the exchange their bitcoin but the money they're holding for you from the first sale isn't enough to cover it. They don't trust you not to default on repaying the bitcoins you borrowed if the price goes up so they normally require a deposit (hence needing 1 bitcoin of your own to sell 5 of theirs at 5x leverage). When the price goes up your deposit is no longer covering the difference, and so they ask you to start adding additional cash to make sure that they can rebuy the borrowed bitcoins with the cash they're holding for you.

If the price keeps going up you need to keep topping up the money they're holding for you to keep it at a certain ratio. If it goes up above that ratio then they'll liquidate the short, rebuy the coins they sold on your behalf with the money they have, and pocket anything left over.

In relatively stable markets with small swings leverage can be used with a degree of safety. You can give them some buffer and have time to top it up as needed. But in markets with 20% swings that's not going to work as well. You'll need large amounts of additional cash on hand to make sure you don't have the position closed on you (with a total loss), at which point the whole leverage idea is pretty pointless.

I read that Bitfinex was deliberately manipulating prices to close out big shorts. It doesn't matter if the price subsequently drops if the short has already been closed due to not making a margin call (topping it up). If Bitfinex spike the price of their exchange out of the acceptable margin for the short then they can legitimately end the short contract, seize whatever was deposited, and refuse to honour any proceeds that the contract would have made once the market spike stops. Similarly if the server goes down and they can't make the payments Bitfinex still closed out their shorts. Super shady stuff.

e1j3fu1,PedanticPendant,46,I think the adopters that BTC lost are greater than those that BCH has gained so far. Those are big names and they could have stayed if only BTC had scaled on chain and stayed usable. Overall the decay of Bitcoin Core's functionality has really hurt the entire crypto ecosystem and put all the adoption back 1-2 years.,2018-06-30 09:55:17

Personally I'm of the opinion the primary reason it's popular is because the snake oil salesmen are out there looking for marks and there a whole bunch of rubes who want to buy in because bitcoin made their buddy enough money for a down payment on a Tesla. ",2018-06-30 03:31:29

We have that fantastic new 90-second video [What Is Bitcoin Cash?](https://youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLqssva4liHRxWSTu67H0qw21v-To0A2oY&amp;v=OE3QTbgh-p8) that just came out, but that video is positioned for people who already know what Bitcoin is, so it’s a little bit light on the technical details for newbies (which is what makes that original WeUseCoins video so great).",2018-06-30 23:43:39
