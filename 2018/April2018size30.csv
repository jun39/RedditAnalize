dwmbc4g,DamnBigAss62,541,"Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

dwm6q3w,xanhugh,229,"Anyone who is a serious investor (ie the people who become millionaires) will have their own exit strategy. A lot of people will possibly sell half of their XRP and keep the rest of it as a constant flow of value to be tapped in future. 

What might be your point of becoming a millionair might be someone else's point of making $10,000, so the curve of people hitting that point is different for everyone. If you have 10,000xrp then your millionaire point is $100. 5000xrp and it's $200, etc.

Additionally, this isn't like bitcoin in that people accidentally became millionaires, much of the cryptospace's attitude toward XRP actively stopping people from investing is what keeps in the serious investors who believe in it's use case, understand the figures involved, and see that there is a lot of room for xrp to increase, and most of us believe XRP is seriously undervalued right now. 

If the FUD surrounding XRP wasn't in operation it's highly likely we wouldn't be enjoying this long period of suppressed price which is allowing us to speculatively stock up on as much as possible, but at some point when utility begins to push the price up as xrapid transactions begin to build it will probably reach a critical mass where BTC, altcoin and external investors realise that they can make some serious money by transferring their portfolio to xrp and we'll see price movement like never before. This is precisely what happened to BTC in December driving a FOMO frenzy. 

As for intentional price suppression, the FUD is precisely that. The thing with xrp is that we want to be rich, but we don't rubbish other coins in the process. For BTC holders alot are already rich, or getting there, so it is within their interests to spread the FUD so money flows in to their investments. 
If it's in relation to institutional price suppression there would have to be a clear benefit of doing so. We don't know the price xrp is given to institutions who buy in bulk, if they get any discount from Ripple etc, but when they do buy in bulk they are going to want to have that price be as low as possible. Even a one cent drop could mean them saving thousands of dollars. 
But as more and more XRP are added in to circulation, the ability to mess with the price requires even more meddling, and volatility due to that factor goes down as it's impact ability diminishes. 

Ultimately the whales are going to have a diminished ability to mess with price when there is a volume of trillions going through xrp every day. If they try to manipulate prices by placing large fake sell walls it's not going to make any difference with thousands of transactions buying and selling from gateways every second. Whales would need to have holdings worth significant fractions of a trillion dollars to make any impact, and if you're already a trillionaire you probably won't care about it anyway. Yes they may try to prevent the price going down, but obviously that is to the benefit of every xrp holder. 


So basically in a nutshell, yes they can right now, and yes they can in the future, but the impact of that is going to become less and less as time goes on. The only exception to that is Ripple founders with billions of XRP, but again it is within their own interest to ensure a high price, rather than to try and suppress it. They already are billionaires right now, but that's not stopping them from going to work every day and realise the full potential of Ripple. They want to be in the rich list, but it's more important to them for power reasons, ie being ceo of the world's wealthiest company the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. That's what drives them to do what they do, not just the money but the status.

Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

dwmw283,AbrasiveLore,210,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another sub-par piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show.

I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic.

At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscript. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen Nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you.

Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

dwmvyt7,UpDown,131,"The crash back then was waaaay longer, but it was also off the heels of a 100x year for bitcoin, not the 16x or whatever we had this year. And the bubble popped after a 1-month 10x, not the 3 months 6x we experienced. This boom was much slower, but crashed much faster. 2014 crash took 16 months so or to reach the trough of -85% returns. We're at -75% for alt coins already, which is probably the best thing to compare to 2014. Keep in mind, the difference between -85% and -75% is another -40%. 

The lesson i learned was disappearing was a huge mistake. I lost a lot of experience, and I missed opportunities like Etheruem, which I ended up getting at $4 instead of the $0.18 I could have done. The same is true for other great projects that showed up at what was pretty much the absolutely trough of the market. So the morale is, stop being scared, just accept it, and keep paying attention, learning, investing, and building (Yes, contribute more than money). 

My theory is that Alt coins will experience essentially the same thing that occurred in 2014. -75% to -85% peak to trough. I don't believe bitcoin will experience much more than -70% as its much more mature, more liquid, etc. Bitcoin is at -65%. Another 5% loss from peak to trough is another 15% loss from here ($5800 bitcoin). It's a good time to buy regardless.  Altcoins could be at the bottom, or could dip another 40% and not surprise me (40% being the difference between a 75% peak to trough and 85% peak to trough. Not that big of a difference in absolute terms but still plenty room to fall from here). Personally, I think even altcoins won't fall as much because they got to benefit a lot from Bitcoins maturity, so -75% seems like a fair peak to trough. Any further and it's clearly value town.

In conclusion, buy quality altcoins (top 20 altcoins) and some bitcoin. ",2018-04-02 02:34:29

- When Bitcoin increases in price compared to USD and, as a result, other cryptocurrencies increase in price as well, no one complains. These posts somehow only appear when the market goes down and people look for a scapegoat.
- Maybe the prices are less coupled to Bitcoin than you think but the market sentiment for cryptocurrencies as a whole is simply negative right now. This is a young and relatively small market. Many coins are trying to achieve exactly the same thing. I'm not surprised when things mostly go up and down as a whole. 
- Even if prices are strongly coupled to Bitcoin, is it really that strange? Half of the cryptocurrencies out there are simply clones of Bitcoin backed by a not-so-impressive development team. There's Ethereum and other ""smart contract"" platforms but I've yet to see one convincing example of a smart contract that indeed requires ""Turing completeness"". Not to mention the fact that like every other smart contract out there seems to contain vulnerabilities. Proof of Work burns a lot of energy, maybe too much, I don't know. But we've yet to see if a version of Proof of Stake can be offer the same kind of security. A system backing a global decentralised currency cannot afford to be 99.99% secure: it needs 100%.

Vertcoin started a #FairMining movement to bring awareness and get other crypto projects onboard with forking away from ASICs. I thought this was a really good concept that addresses some of the core problems being faced in crypto right now. 

The Bitcoin ecosystem is toxic, unsustainable, and not actually very decentralized. It was a good concept at first, but now it's monopolized by big players like Bitmain. The absurd amount of resources going into mining for the sake of ""securing the network"" is ridiculous. All that just to accomplish 7 tps. Like any ecosystem, Bitcoin only grows if the money funneling in is greater than the money coming out. But the fact of the matter is that almost NO-ONE is actually using it in the way it was intended. Even businesses that accept it are only using it as a medium to sell back into fiat. Ignore the Mt. Gox trustee cashing out $400MM, that was nothing because remember that these miners and Bitmain are cashing out BILLIONS on a yearly basis to pay for their operations. Even the miners are NOT holding all their mined BTCs. This is a constant monetary drain on the ecosystem that is not adding value to the system.

If blockchain technology and the rest of the cryptospace is to succeed, it NEEDS to get away from Bitcoin. Let the devs and miners fight amongst themselves with their politics, but we cannot be letting Bitcoin destroy the progress that has been made elsewhere because this is screwing over not only the average investor, but other promising projects in blockchain that have so much more potential beyond just as a decentralized currency.",2018-04-02 01:06:56

JP are the folks who charge all the other banks fees to route through them.

Ripple are providing a solution to all of those smaller providers to completely bypass JP. 

There isn't really much they can do about it either. If they were to develop their own system they would have to get all of their smaller partners on board to do exactly the same thing as Ripple offering, but convince them that JP pulling the strings is somehow better for the banks. Their only hope would be to undercut Ripple, but then again there's nothing to stop Rippple undercutting JP. 

What the FUDsters will ultimately realise is that XRP is disrupting and decentralising the banks from within, doing what Bitcoin has failed to do. 

When you follow the endgame to it's logical conclusion in 10 years there will be no need for Western Union, moneygram, Santander apps etc. Everyone will just download a Ripplenet app for their phone and send their money directly to the recipient. But don't tell Ripple's partners that...
Banks will still be around, but as vehicles for mortgages, investments, business finance etc. But personal banking? No chance. It will be gone within 20 years for sure. For most of us in here we are already doing it in our wallets and crypto, we're managing our own accounts without a 3rd party. 
We don't need bank statements, we don't need overdraft charges, we don't pay monthly fees. We are at the very beginning of what will ultimately be the end of personal banking via institutions as we do today.

dworniq,kwanijml,45,"The ups, the downs, the swings, the bubbles, the busts, the speculation. . . is all necessary for price discovery and slow, eventual, decline of the volatility.  There is no other way. There is no shortcut.  Every single decentralized cryptocurrency, is and will be going through this process.  

You're late to the party; we've all done the ""community push to spend instead of just hold"" thing, several times.  It tends to just create a somewhat artificial (if small) uptick in the number of vendors accepting bitcoin (and by ""accepting"" we of course mean, using a payment processor and converting immediately to fiat, rather than paying employees and suppliers and holding any themselves).  This is fine.  There's nothing wrong with it; but it is simply just not a sustainable mechanism for creating the transaction loops which we all wish for in order to make crypto more usable as a currency and help stabilize the price.  Granted, Bitcoin Cash is not going to be as prone to the high transaction fees and slow confirmation times which also caused a lot of merchants to stop accepting the token. . . but again, we've been through phases of adoption which resulted in a lot of attrition, well before scaling became an issue with BTC.

I don't know why so many of you still don't understand what is going on economically, with crypto.  It requires thinking a little beyond first-order causes and effects. . . but it's not that complex:

You cannot program stability into a money protocol, and you cannot simply wish or will adoption and transaction loops into existence.  Public calls for solidarity on ""good discussion"" and avoiding ""speculation"" are next-to-useless.  Why?  Because of the very reason why all cryptos remain volatile (and even bitcoin is only very slowly stabilizing): because there is a giant coordination problem inherent in the creation of money, and it goes something like this:  Why would I adopt a token to use as money, when few others accept it yet as money?  But why would others accept it as money, if few others are buying/holding/spending it as money?  How do you get a worldwide economy of crypto-enthusiasts or holders, to agree upon, not just one price, but in fact a price for *everything* which can bought or sold with the crypto-token? (that is the nature of money; everything else has one price...money has millions of prices; e.g.  One dollar costs a post-card, and it also costs 3 eggs, and it also costs 1/20 of a shirt, etc.)

This is a massive coordination problem or market failure, and it is one reason why, historically, the state has tended to get involved in the creation and production of money, because that overwhelming force they possess and force of law and force of habits (or path dependencies), makes it much easier (less costly up-front), for them to simply declare a certain commodity ""the money"" and even set a value or exchange rate, which everyone immediately follows.

If you are interested in buying and selling things with cryptocurrency; you are necessarily in this for the prospect of the formation of a new money or monetary unit; whether you realize it or not.  This has so little to do with payment networks alone, or sticking it to banks.  Bitcoin's very makeup and protocol, make it very suited for very few things other than money (i.e. it has excellent monetary properties, or latent network externalities as a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and unit of account; such as fungibility, divisibility, transportability, scarcity, etc.).  The token (being digital or virtual) had to have it's own, built-in, rudimentary payment network (we meatbags can't physically grab a bitcoin and give it to someone else).  But this payment network aspect (as important as it is in order to help overcome the coordination problems), is auxiliary to bitcoin's nature as future money or proto-money.  It would be nearly pointless to try to simply create another payment network to compete with the centralized services. . . and use PoW blockchains to do it.  That would be madness.  That's not what Satoshi and Hal Finney and the other cypherpunks were trying to do. . .that's not what any sane person is trying to do.  We are trying to create stateless money.

So, this coordination problem acts a little bit like a classic public goods problem; in that, it is group rational to have a common money/monetary system with the latent properties which bitcoin possesses; but yet it is individually rational to reject the token as worthless, or doomed to fail. . . or to simply free-ride off of the others who do spend money to acquire and adopt and mine and spend the token; both in terms of speculating on the price, and in terms of letting others build the transaction loops and the infrastructure and services necessary to make it a universal, worldwide currency or money.

So, unless you want a government or government(s) to take over this project and declare an exchange price for bitcoin, and create an immediate demand sink for it, such as requiring that taxes be paid in this token. . . then you need to understand what mechanisms markets posses for coordinating against these types of market failures and producing public goods.  You need to understand that (to quote economist Markus Brunnermeier) ""Money is by definition a bubble since it derives its value from resale option.""  In other words, money is a speculative asset, by it's very nature.  It is a permanent bubble.  It is a mass delusion of recursive value, born of the fact that having a common medium for indirect exchange (avoid the transactions costs of barter), is highly valuable and beneficial to the group or economy as a whole.  

So, there is no stopping the speculation, without stopping it from being or becoming money.  But more importantly, the speculation is an important part of overcoming the coordination problems of market production of money, and eventually stabilizing the exchange value (which stabilization can only be a direct product of higher market cap/liquidity, and positive expectational feedback loops from use as a unit of account).  See, lottery and games of chance have been used for centuries by charities and communities and even governments, in order to produce public goods.  The lottery of the speculative game which is investing in cryptos, is what drives people to build up the ecosystem and buy and hold and accept and try to pay suppliers and employees and create transaction loops. . .despite the free-riding which is occurring and will always occur.  

I don't know why the speculative aspect it is so distasteful to so many, especially the new people in our community; but it does serve an irreplaceable purpose.  And while I'm all for warning and cautioning people (don't invest more than you can afford to lose, in fact don't day trade, dollar-cost-average, don't just hold, but spend also, etc.), we also need to celebrate the bubbles and busts as much as we fear them; they are what has historically (despite the attrition during the busts) created the most adoption, and coordinated the most transaction loops, historically.  

Let whales and institutional investors and a few crazy people day trade and kill themselves or make killings.  I am absolutely **not** talking about going all ""Biiitconeeeeeect!!!"" on people.  But stop misunderstanding the repeated patterns of bubble and bust as a necessarily unhealthy thing, but rather, let people know that, in responsible amounts and ways, they are not necessarily making a bad decision by investing (if they are willing to hold for the long-term) even when the price is clearly running up in to bubble territory.  And don't dissuade people from being excited about the process of making some amazing returns either.

Edit- also crypto as *currency* is all but dead-in-the-water in places like the U.S., thanks to their governments' classifying their tokens as a capital asset and requiring the tracking and reporting of basis and profit on every single transaction.  This makes bitcoin de facto illegal to use as a currency in these jurisdictions, since (in addition to the coordination challenges explained above), you are never going to get average, everyday people to adopt a currency in which they now have to change their whole tax preparation for, and in which they have to figure out basis and profit for every single, day-to-day, spend.  And no, software can't and won't solve this problem.  You would have to have a coordinated system across all wallets and services and paper wallets and other cold storage, which allows a user to mark whether each transaction is intra-personal, or whether it is a value-realization event; and then automate the calculations from there and interface with H&amp;R block or turbotax or whatnot, so that it is seamless and doesn't add much inconvenience for people.  This is not happening.  It is not going to happen.  Crypto is already relegated now to other countries where it is needed more, and the black/gray markets.  Day-trading-type speculation is the only reasonable use of the token in the U.S. now (traders obviously already accept and take on and have tools for the responsibility of tracking their capital gains and losses), thanks to tax law and the government persecuting OTC sellers and other services under the auspices of KYC/AML laws.  So, stop blaming your fellow bitcoiners for the state of things and start understanding the causes of the incentives which shape the ecosystem.",2018-04-03 03:41:09

dws99mr,Fishermang,362,"Here is why I personally believe Cryptocurrency is gonna fucking fail:

* Loads of exchanges getting Fiat pairings will eventually lead to shit ton of regulations to deal with.
* Adoption is seemingly going up, but when you look into the majority of announcements, everything revolves around partnerships, alpha versions of untested apps and systems, and so on
* Everyone knows that Bitcoin is a cash grab for greedy people, supported by unstable and manipulated marked and it is a hassle to use compared to simple good old fiat
* Cryptocurrency is going to be centralized, projects bought out and decentralized useful stuff will remain underground
* Everyone who is rushing to get merchant adoption is trying to get ahead in the game of a highly unpredictable and volatile speculative business
*  Majority of stores use bitcoin to draw attention, especially online, to get more business. Most stores don't want it because they don't even understand it
* I am repeating all my points because I care, but realize that no one else does as everyone here is just greedy and want to get rich. When everyone cashes out - and cause another huge drop in the prices, who is going to want to adopt the crypto?
* An absolute insane number of projects is going up, and as history shows, a huge majority of these projects will go bankrupt
* Students and scientists putting in work is related to development, and has no relation to money - as it in fact is developement of technology - which once again will be bought out by rich companies.

My point is: don't fall for the one side of the coin.

dwsb5dt,slavox,282,"Hi Mark,

First off I'm glad you survived all the personal attacks and managed to stay sane and relatively active on reddit and IRC despite all the memes and hatred.

I have had a few questions on my mind for years some of which you may be able to answer here.

1. Who wrote/managed the ""Willy bot"" &amp; what was it's intended purpose? 
2. Pior to the closing of withdraws at Mt Gox at what point were you aware that the BTC had gone missing? 
3. Chain analysis seems to show that the hacker/hackers were stealing coins for years prior to the final bankruptcy. 
Are you aware of any reason why they simply didn't empty the wallets completely? 
4. Are there other company shareholders who also have claim to this extra BTC? Do they share your opinon that it is the creditors who deserve it?

Despite what people may think Mt Gox helped build and shape this community. It showed people bitcoin had real value when it was just some cool tech. We learnt from Gox and the community is stronger because of it.

Thank you

In OP's defense, it is much less obvious to uninformed investors when they trigger the need to pay taxes, when it comes to crypto. The IRS ruled that you realize gains *every* time you convert crypto - so if you invest $100 in bitcoin, it jumps to $1000, and then you convert that $1000 into a scamcoin, you now are on the hook for $900 worth of short term capital gains.

dwuq5rq,mike_hearn,221,"To whatever authority presented itself. In Bitcoin there is no state. So instead, the core developers became the authority.

I don't know if you were around back then, but there were a few moments that crystallised this for me.

The first was when we (myself and Gavin) launched Bitcoin XT. This made the news and there was a TV segment on Bloomberg. I was speaking at a conference in Sweden at the time so I couldn't take part and wasn't sure I wanted to anyway. Instead they ended up with a Core supporter on their talking heads panel. The main reason cited by the Core supporter for why he was opposed to Bitcoin XT was that ""the Core developers have PhDs and neither Mike nor Gavin do"". In fact the people they were referring to had PhDs in irrelevant subjects like computer graphics, and none had any experience of scaling consumer online services - whereas via Google I had plenty. But Google doesn't award PhDs so the value of that experience was zeroed out.

This exchange sums up the mentality many had at the time: Bitcoin is *complex*, therefore it can only be understood by *experts*, therefore I should obey the instructions of experts even if they may superficially appear to be nonsense. But I am *not* an expert so how can I decide who is or is not an expert? I must rely on *proxies*, proxies like academic credentials, or whether their ideas sound clever when they speak, or whether other people who seem to be experts are agreeing with them.

These signals are all heuristics and are all trivially gamed by people who understand psychology. Some people may remember the moment when suddenly lots of small blockers started calling themselves Dr This and Dr That. They had always had PhDs but never felt the need to use their titles before, but suddenly they all started doing so. You will also remember the loud insistence that ""consensus"" mattered and that bypassing the ""consensus of experts"" was a nasty trick that Gavin and I were trying to do, because we were in the minority (no citation offered). 

W.R.T. the miners specifically I called some of them via Skype before I decided to leave. One or two refused point blank to talk to me. One miner said he supported me, but couldn't be seen to do so in case it hurt the price. Another conversation went like this:

&gt; Miner: ""We agree the block size should be raised and we agree Core is not going to do so.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""Great! So when will you start running XT?""
&gt;
&gt; Miner: ""We aren't going to run XT.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""Er, but you just said you agree with our policies and don't think Core will come around.""
&gt;
&gt; Miner: ""Yes, we agree that you are right, but we will never run anything except Core. To do that would be to leave the consensus.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""So - if everyone thinks like you do, and refuses to run anything except Core, then the maintainer of Core is effectively the CEO of Bitcoin. So what makes Bitcoin different to PayPal? How is that decentralised""

There was a long silence at this point as if the miner had never considered this before. And eventually he just said, ""We can't run XT, that'd be crazy. We will wait for Core to change their minds.""

That was the point where I decided it had all become a waste of my time. The vast majority of mining hash power was controlled by people who were psychologically incapable of disobedience to perceived authority.",2018-04-05 23:14:21

Have you ever heard the story of why Armistice Day / Veteran's Day is November 11th?  The ceasefire that ended WWI went into effect at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the year, which is why that day is celebrated.

The sad fact is that the ceasefire could've gone into effect earlier, but the signers chose that moment because the numbers were neat.

I don't remember the specific numbers, but some time back I saw figures for the number of people who died in WWI between the time the ceasefire was signed and the time it went into effect.  All those deaths could've been avoided, but the people orchestrating this event wanted to play cute tricks with numbers, so people died.

dwulrd3,mike_hearn,129,"This is a tough one.

My view is that Bitcoin Cash strongly resembles the Bitcoin community of 2014. This is not good. That experiment was tried and it didn't work. It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was. I think it was inevitable given the structure and psychological profile of the community at the time. So just trying to ""get back on track"" as I see it, is nowhere near radical enough.

If I could get one message across to you in this session it's this: **be bold**. Be willing to accept that what happened was not just bad luck. Liberate yourselves from just proceeding along the path Satoshi imagined and be willing to think radical, even heretical thoughts.

Here are some questions to reflect on as a community together:

* Does Bitcoin need to use Script? If it swapped out the VM and scripting system for something better, would it still be Bitcoin?
* Does Bitcoin need to use proof-of-work? If it stopped using proof-of-work one day, would it still be Bitcoin? The Ethereum guys already answered this question and are making plans to abandon it.
* Does Bitcoin need to use its current protocol at all? If *all* the technical aspects of Bitcoin changed, leaving *only* the monetary policy and existing coin balances, would it still be Bitcoin?

and

* Does Bitcoin need a Foundation or some other form of formalised governance? We tried to make one years ago and it failed due to a mix of rum characters and opposition from people who felt it was ""centralisation"", who maybe didn't realise that the alternative was not structurelessness but rather a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

dwuntr8,mike_hearn,121,"No. The causes were complex and essentially psychological. Let's say that the miners didn't behave in the way they should, and nor did most of the community, and that left an opening that a small minority of developers were able to exploit to take it over.

In such a situation, who is at fault? Was the problem the weakness of the community? Or those who exploited it? Or both?

The most critical problem for cryptocurrency in general is that Bitcoin's design rests on three assumptions that have been invalidated:

1. The price of the currency will be proportional to utility.
2. Miners are economically rational actors who will maximise utility because they want to maximise the price.
3. The other participants in the system are also economically rational and will evaluate decisions based on what's best for the long term.

In fact the price went up even as the utility of the system collapsed, due to any utility signal being swamped by speculative capital, and miners turned out to be economically irrational - their primary desire was to follow orders, not maximise their long term returns. I spent *significant* amounts of time trying to persuade miners to raise the block size limit towards the end of 2015 and they refused to do so because they were terrified of anything that might be perceived as disobedience to authority. We can debate what the cause of that is - at the time I wondered if it was related to China being a communist dictatorship - but ultimately western miners were not much better.

To understand the root causes of all this you must read Sowell. It isn't optional. ""A Conflict Of Visions"" explains why societies split into two camps that fight each other, again and again. We normally recognise this in the context of national politics as left wing vs right wing, but in the Bitcoin community this same conflict arose as Big vs Small Blockers, in Ethereum as Classic vs Original, in Russia as Red vs White, and in the UK in recent years it has been Leave vs Remain. All these conflicts are typified by the same characteristics:

* Bitter, enduring conflicts between two opposing camps of roughly equal size who can never make up.
* Very different attitudes towards perceived experts, intellectuals, towards academic qualifications etc.
* A win-at-any-cost mentality by one of the camps.
* Different views on the validity of the preferences of the majority / ""will of the people"" etc.

The reason they are so similar is because they share the same root cause, a root cause that traces to a disagreement about the span of human nature. Societies split into two camps because ultimately the underlying disagreement is over a unidimensional variable, so disagreement runs along a 1-dimension spectrum.

These conflicts cannot be avoided but they can be contained and channelled. If the Bitcoin community doesn't establish systems for containing this conflict it will arise again over some issue that appears superficially different to the block size debate, but underneath looks much the same.",2018-04-05 22:36:00

&gt;  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

So Satoshi understood that his invention could be generalised, but didn't do so.

Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. It doesn't have to be fully peer to peer or decentralised, but a forum which had a different approach to community moderation might be a help. For example, no downvoting allowed, and some limits on the power of moderators and admins.

In hindsight I wonder if it was so hard to predict. Nobody *did* predict it so in some trivial sense it was hard. But if you look at the history of anarchic communities - which Bitcoin certainly was and to some extent still is - they don't stay anarchic for long. Someone always seizes power. Nature abhors a power vacuum. By refusing to fill that vacuum with systems, it was perhaps inevitable that it would be filled by individuals instead.

&gt;I visited some hours ago the official Verge Twitter profil to read the news about the hash hack. While reading the tweed i noticed several messages offering a compensation for the attack by Verge. Send x Eth and you get some bonus back. Sounded legit to me as it was affilated to the hash attack and i suffered from it as well having had some hours only orphaned blocks on all my baikals, hence i fall victim to this damn scam on the official twitter page.

&gt;Now, while i have myself for sure some vault for this i'am seriously angry about how on the official verge twitter page 100s of scams and fake messages that say they got the ETH back are tolerated and nobody cares about it?!?! How is this possible. After i realized i got scammed i even made a post in this tweet that its a scam and to remove it asap, nothing happened and people still fall after that scam.

This was before even the eth/etc split. But you didn't really explain *why* this approach wouldn't succeed in your exit piece, it was just baked in as an assumption because your position was ""all or nothing hard fork upgrade"" and you never seriously considered a minority chain split.

How did you ""know"" that a minority chain split couldn't flip the majority chain? What assumptions, if any, have you revised since the Ethereum and Bitcoin chain splits?

dwul86v,mike_hearn,57,"Yes, I'm afraid I think there's a lot to do and that's one reason I agreed to do this. Some things are being overlooked. If history repeated itself that would be a crying shame.

Hard forking is an implementation mechanism, not a governance mechanism. Governance is a process, and often an institution, for arriving at a decision. A hard fork is just the software event that makes it real.

I note with some alarm that Bitcoin Cash is planning a timed hard fork in just one month, with no attempt to measure support or whether people are ready or even agree. The content is not going to controversial in this community now, but a lot of organisations would find it hard to schedule and test a software upgrade on one month's notice. There's a risk that miners who do upgrade will be split onto a minority chain by accident even if everyone intends to upgrade, and have to roll back, making them even more conservative than they already are.

Governance was one of the causes of the split and so needs the most analysis and change. But I'm afraid I'm not seeing that at the moment. Multiple competing implementations is what we tried with Bitcoin XT and it didn't work. Ultimately the internet is a lawless place, and a sufficiently committed group will always be able to wipe out any nodes they disagree with to prevent people from expressing their opinions. Formalised governance mechanisms can help avoid this by coordinating a group decision in ways that can't be so trivially attacked, and if you look at Ethereum, they have the Ethereum Foundation and other ways to do it. I think that would help a lot. 

Right now I don't see anything that would prevent a repeat of what happened before, especially given the underlying psychological causes of the Core/Cash divide.",2018-04-05 21:47:20

I first discovered Bitcoin and after some research, realized that it had huge potential to change the word.

Not everybody buying EOS is clueless, new or chasing a pump. Your posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project. Rather, it's a personal attack on somebody who is not even involved with the project anymore, so your entire post is irreverent. Nearly everything you wrote is incorrect. This shows that you know very little about the project, yet you still have formed an opinion based on your emotions. Rather than boycott a potential competitor to your investment, learn about it. Research it. If you still think that your investments are better choices than the competitor, great. If not, reconsider your current investments. No reason to boycott anything, just ignore it if you don't like it.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;  But even if EOS was legit, who in their right mind wants to support a person like Brock Pierce?

Nobody is supporting this guy. He's hasn't been involved with the project for a while now. He was gone even before the hit piece on Last Week Tonight. 


&amp;nbsp;


&gt; an exit scam seems so much like the logical next step.

The EOS 1.0 code was finished today, its open source on Github. There is no way for them to exit scam, because they don't have anybody's money. The EOS code is there. The dev team is not launching the chain, an independent community member is. EOS would still get launched and the tokens would be swapped to the chain automatically. There is no way for them to exit scam. They can walk away right now and nothing would change. It's a decentralized project. The dev team wrote the code and published it. That's it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the last week show bit of James Oliver.

It's Last Week Tonight by John Oliver, not James. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If a coin, that was created by a KNOWN scammer AND child molester 

The project was not created by Brock Pierce, not even close. It was create by Dan Larimer, the creator of Bitshares and Steemit. Also, the guy is not a ""known child molester"". He was never found guilty. Hell, he was never even charged. He was only accused. And even if you choose to stay away from EOS because some *accused* of this crime is involved, you should be aware that he was also the chairman of the Bitcoin foundation. 


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; It's time to dump that shit, let it burn away so we don't ever have to speak about it again

* It still uses reddit to coordinate the community.
* There is no formalised governance mechanism. Old Bitcoin used ""rule by obscure IRC chats between Core devs"" and the different Cash devs coordinate .... how?
* It still uses proof of work and miners still don't care about the health of the network.
* The community still appears somewhat opposed the idea of voting in any kind of formalised governance procedure (e.g. ABC fork is not waiting to see if miners agree, or if users agree, they just picked a time and went for it).

I don't really hang out here anymore so I don't know if other problematic aspects remain ... from a quick search over the forums it seems people don't use terms like ""rule by math"" anymore, which is good. I'm not saying there's been no improvement.

&gt; It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, ""ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing."" 

What we wanted was a fork of the chain that would so clearly dominate that the small blockers would give up. The alternative Cash adopted of simply forking the entire ledger permanently, abandoning the brand name, the currency symbol,  the forums, the wallets, the exchanges, *all* the infrastructure was  - at the time - considered inconceivable. It wasn't even suggested.

The community lost a lot in the Cash split. I realise it may seem like a victory of sorts but in effect the big blockers abandoned everything except the code. It is astonishing that this event didn't negatively affect the price, but as noted below this is a double edged sword.

&gt; We do calculations on 8192 bit numbers - in common RSA keys Always a question of q=what operations. It is nice to have people who are experts such as Vitalik say what is impossible... The Patent and IP lawyers love these comments :) PLEASE keep them coming! Pretty Please!

Notice how he clearly conflates ""2^256 bits"" (so much info that the entire universe isn't big enough to hold it) with ""256 bits"" (probably roughly the entropy of this sentence). This is literally the crypto equivalent of [Verizon math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShv_74FNWU).

Here's his argument in the tweet thread about how Bitcoin is Turing-complete:

&gt; This is something that this allows: http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2003/HPL-2003-21.pdf … Still think Bitcoin is not extensible or Turing complete... Boneh-Franklin allows for the creation of cryptographically secure Random Oracles. This is Just the start down the rabbit hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle

&gt; And... Oracle Machines are Turing complete... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine …  E:y^2 = x^3 +b This is the Boneh-Franklin system - it is also Bitcoin for b = 7

I call this the ""A implies B and bee implies honey therefore A implies honey"" fallacy; just because two things have similar names doesn't mean they are remotely the same thing. An oracle machine ""is an entity capable of solving some problem, which for example may be a decision problem or a function problem""; a random oracle is simply a random number generator that stores its own past outputs so it remains consistent. The two concepts are entirely different. And this seems to be the _cornerstone_ of his argument for why bitcoin is already Turing-complete.

And oh by the way, the guy seems gleeful about patenting everything. I'm pretty sure the bitcoin cash community is in favor of economic freedom, and patent trolling is the exact opposite of that.....

I don't give a damn if the guy is (part of) Satoshi; for all we know, it could even be the case that he actually was part of the Satoshi group, he was just the bizdev guy. But he's _definitely_ not technically competent, shows a level of arrogance far above his actual level of understanding, and makes pie-in-the-sky promises about BTC/BCH's capabilities that are clearly untrue, and only serve to detract from genuine efforts to implement those capabilities if people really want them.",2018-04-07 09:43:24

And of course the more you belief he is Satoshi or was involved with the creation of Bitcoin the more you will think in this way. On the other side of the spectrum, why would I do an effort in to reading this con man's papers ... I have better things to do with my time!  And so it's kind of an amplified DDOS attack on somebody's time. 

CSW makes other people do all his thinking and debating for him, so he can keep on conning. He is a master at the craft. All so the investors in nChain keep on investing. nChain then invests all over the BCH spectrum and then of course they have to invite CSW to all these conferences. 

That's why you will not hear Roger Ver say: ""He is Satoshi"" or ""He is not Satoshi"" but ""Person A still believes he is Satoshi"".  It's always money. Always. I can ask Roger a thousand times to explain why he is doing business with CSW and nChain but he will never answer. The stakes are to high. Apparently in the BCH community there is use for a con man that has indeed fooled some people in to believe he is Satoshi.

Then there are the Bitcoin Core hijackers who have proven to be quite effective at manipulation themselves.  They love the fact that CSW is active in the BCH community and is such a controversial figure and probably do whatever they can to make CSW look as legitimate as possible on the sub here just so they can ridicule BCH later. 

The big problem for 99% of the user space is that we don't have all this knowledge so we are stuck with proxies. People that we trust that we have to believe.  That's how so many of us got bamboozled by people like Greg Maxwell and others. We just could not understand all of it, and then it's easy to fool us.

dwyd026,vbuterin,61,"&gt; The paper you are referring to has deeper fallacies, for example it considers honest miners stupid and incapable of reacting.

How would honest miners react? Are you actually suggesting that miners should engage in active strategizing among each other to reject blocks from specific miners that they deem to be unkosher? If so, that seems like a very easy political gateway toward censorship. The default strategy (mining and insta-publishing on the head) should be a Nash equilibrium, full stop, so consensus can proceed forward in an automated way, so that the desired form of coordination (the consensus itself) can happen without opening up avenues for undesired coordination (51% censorship cartels).

&gt; Yet, of the 2 people in that conference hall that day you did not dare to call a fraud the only fraud in that room that has defrauded millions of bitcoin users.

Samson Mow is not a fraud. Roger Ver is also not a fraud. There's a difference between someone having political views you disagree with, and someone frequently emitting statements that can be proven to be objectively false within a paragraph.",2018-04-07 13:57:45

dwyf0v5,vbuterin,56,"&gt; 33%+ of hashpower cannot be small, if any node is hacked to propagate the hidden blocks then the damage is done

You do realize that mining pooling allows miners to mine a block without having most of the contents themselves, right?

&gt; There is a thing in business known as risk management. SMing is full of uncertainties, therefore by definition uncertainty = risk. That also makes it extremely unlikely from a business point of view. Mining is already too risky on its own due to price fluctuations etc for the mining pool to agree to add to that uncertainty by engaging in SM.

All of this applies even more so to 51% attacks. And yet we still believe that 51% attacks are a risk. So this argument doesn't actually reduce the extent to which the possibility of selfish mining (as opposed to the impossibility thereof) reduces security.

&gt; Then how about the army of trolls and shills they hire on Reddit and Twitter? How about the r/bitcoin censorship they all sponsor? How about all the ad hominems they push?

I strongly disapprove of all that stuff. Theymos should be ashamed to call himself a cypherpunk, and I fault the bitcoin core community for not doing more to ostracize him.

&gt; is educating people on a lot of things pertaining bitcoin

To be clear, he is _mis-educating_. That's a _negative-value_ contribution.

&gt; Moreover, you were flat wrong about negative gamma.

You and he are both misusing terms. Gamma is an input to the model, not an output. Craig himself then [tried to clarify](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/981378961677701120) that by negative gamma he meant negative probability. Well, let's look at what [negative probability is](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_probability). If you read one of the [linked papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1287.pdf), it becomes very clear that negative probability is a mathematical abstraction that can be used in cases where there is the possibility of anti-events:

&gt; Taking an event { ui } with ui ∈ Ω, we denote by N+ the number times that events with the same sign as the event ui occur during a sequence of N trials, by N- the number times that events with the opposite to the event ui sign occur during a sequence of N trials, by ni the number of times that the event ui occurs during a sequence of N trials, and by mi the number of times that the event -ui occurs during the same sequence of trials. Let vN(ui) = (ni
 )/ N+ - (mi )/ N. Then we define the extended frequency probability of the
event ui as p(ui) = lim N→∞ vN(ui)

In our case, gamma was the probability that the attacker's block comes in first, as opposed to the honest miner's block coming in first. What does an anti-event in this context even mean? An attacker's block not getting in, and also somehow magically transmuting itself into a second honest block, so as to make the honest chain instantly grow by 2?

The article seeks to rescue Craig's claim by turning it into an argument that introducing zero-power nodes has a _negative effect on gamma_, but that's not even aligned with Craig's own effort to rescue his own claim.",2018-04-07 14:54:59
dwya4iy,plaenar,53,"Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency firm, has approached U.S. regulators about registering as a licensed brokerage firm and electronic-trading venue, a move that comes as regulators have waged an aggressive campaign to supervise the fledgling industry.  

The San Francisco-based startup, one of the world’s largest platforms for trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has met with Securities and Exchange Commission officials in recent weeks about registering its business with the agency, according to people familiar with the matter. The step would allow Coinbase to expand the group of assets it offers to include digital tokens that the SEC has argued are securities and could put pressure on other cryptocurrency trading venues to submit to U.S. oversight, the people said.  

“It’s an early phase where the industry leaders understand they have to live within a highly regulated environment,” said Richard Levin, a partner at law firm Polsinelli PC who advises companies involved with digital currencies. “They have to deal with the SEC.”  

A Coinbase spokesman declined to comment.  

“The assets that we do list have all had some amount of regulatory certainty,” Coinbase President Asiff Hirji said on CNBC on Thursday. “As soon as there is more regulatory clarity than there currently is you would expect us to start listing more assets.”  

Companies that operate online trading platforms for cryptocurrencies have positioned themselves as disrupters of traditional channels for raising capital and exchange trading. Trading in bitcoin and other virtual currencies that Coinbase offers, including Ethereum and Litecoin, is virtually untouched by U.S. market regulators.  

But the growth of initial coin offerings—in which startups offer investors a token in exchange for an investment—has added a new opportunity that makes it harder for platforms to continue shunning regulation. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said that most tokens issued through ICOs are securities, meaning they can only be traded legally on a licensed exchange or electronic trading venue.  

Businesses raised $4 billion during the first quarter through ICOs, more than half of the $6.5 billion raised in ICOs for all of 2017, according to Token Report.  

The SEC has issued subpoenas or requests for information to dozens of companies that conducted ICOs, according to people familiar with the matter, as the regulator tries to sort out which deals evaded securities laws and which tokens may have a valid excuse from regulation.  

The threat of a regulatory enforcement action has scared Coinbase and some other bitcoin-related firms from listing new tokens. But Coinbase announced in March that it planned to support tokens in the future, although it declined to disclose which assets it might add. The company has already launched a service for storing customer assets, a function that licensed brokerages often perform for clients.  

Coinbase, whose backers include venture-capital firms Greylock Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, could seek a license from the SEC as an exchange, but registering as a broker-dealer is viewed as a less cumbersome step that would allow the company to move into markets the SEC regulates. Many broker-dealers operate licensed electronic trading systems, which are alternatives to exchanges that face less extensive regulation.  

Still, the step would expose Coinbase to a new type of regulatory risk. The SEC can examine broker-dealers for compliance with the extensive array of rules that brokers face. SEC examiners could comb through the company’s trading records, the systems its uses to protect customers from cybersecurity threats, as well as its policies for defending against insider trading and market manipulation.  

Coinbase faced manipulation-related allegations last year after the price of a bitcoin offshoot called Bitcoin Cash climbed in value before the platform began facilitating trades in the alternative currency. The company said it would investigate the matter.  

As a broker, Coinbase’s platform would only be allowed to offer tokens that comply with securities laws. That would mean token issuers would have to register their sale with the SEC, providing investors with an extensive set of financial disclosures. Token issuers can avoid those disclosures if they limit the sale to institutions and millionaires, but investors in such private sales aren’t immediately allowed to sell the investments.  

At least one other firm involved with virtual currency trading has registered with the SEC as a brokerage firm. Templum LLC operates a licensed brokerage firm and alternative trading system and plans to offer startups a platform for selling regulated tokens as well as a market for trading them. Templum has asked the SEC to allow tokens that were issued and traded illegally to “remediate” their status by making the required filings with the SEC.",2018-04-07 12:51:04

I remember when a friend of mine was charged $200 to his checking account and they told him they would credit him in MONTHS instead of refunding him.  

I remember getting banned for website abuse or malicious activity when some opposing team was doing some shady shit during match scheduling, and then finding out, oh, one of the players on the roster is either an admin or friends with an admin.  Welp, guess we have to play our playoff match on a west server when we are all east.

The admins are notorious for deleting threads and pretty much destroying evidence of anything shady they do.

I’ll have you know that I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such intellectual grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

**CSGO Dreamhack Open Qualifier 06:00 AM EST**

Imperial has been on a tear recently against all types of competition. Winning against Heroic, Sprout and North at CPG. Here is another chance for them to make progress as a team by qualifying for Dreamhack and getting more lan experience.  MINLATE on the other hand is a mix between Envyus Academy and two players from ex misfits. I don't think Imperial goes in taking this match lightly. Nukkye and Espiranto are two insane up and coming players who I feel will get it done tomorrow quickly. Let's take the good odds on the up and coming Mix team. Sorry for the short write up UFC is on. 😂

**2u to win 2.1u**

**WINNER WINNER**

*Didnt even set an alarm to watch the match was really confident on this one. Imperial is making waves. That being said I can totally see Espiranto going to a legit tier 1 team in the future.*

dwzx7yo,MinerDon,58,"&gt; It's just like ATMs that charge 3 bucks to take out 20 bucks.

Let's have an honest discussion shall we?  

Point A) that's $3/transaction.  Sure if you take out $20 and pay $3 you are paying 15%.  That $3 is fixed though.  If you take out $100 the fee is 3%.  If you take out $300 the fee is now 1%.

Point B) there are lots of fee free ATMs out there.  My ATM cards work at thousands of ATMs and I pay zero fees.   You can avoid fees if you want to.  Where are the 0% bitcoin ATMs at?  That's right they don't exist.

Point C) He stated 6.5% **and** ""shadowy market value"" which means they are giving you a shit exchange rate to further pad their fees.

Point D) The one point of bitcoins is to get away from a faceless corporation separating you from your hard earned cash and now you are bending over backwards to defend a faceless corporation separating you from your hard earned cash.

I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines).

Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no?

dx2g5xj,NEETPolice,114,"PoS it not ""nearby"" as some of you say. The cryptocurrency scene never saw a project that successfully implemented a PoS algorithm that was mass adopted -- really, literally NO ONE can say PoS algorithms work flawlessly. PoW is the only path that we know for sure it works and we're currently risking the decentralization aspect of Ethereum's blockchain.

Blockchains only exist because they're decentralized and have consensus. **if this is not the case then it doesn't make any sense. Go use a RMDBS instead**.

I urge the community and developers to defend a hardfork changing the PoW algorithm.

*""But I don't want to see a new Ethereum Classic!""*

Who cares, really? Monero is the prime example. Monero forks every 6 months and they're on the version 12 now. There are 4 different initiatives that appropriated the version 11 network. FOUR! Everyone knows these are just money-grab opportunities, including Bitmain itself! Yep, Bitmain is supporting one of these initiatives (their Bitcoin pool, AntPool, started a XMO pool, lol).

Boris Epstein is doing must-run segments for Sinclair Media.

Paul Manafort is spending his ukranian blood money as quickly as he can before the government convicts him and seizes it.

Michael Flynn is selling his townhouse and also having 'go fund me' sessions to pay his legal fees.

The Mooch is losing everything in a divorce.

Spicer appeared on the Emmys, which was a fucking travesty.  He's also been on talk shows complaining that no one will hire him.  I imagine it's because no one believes anything he put on his resume.

Omarosa became [a meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E3Ibvpqotw) and is trying to make money by selling a book.

Hope Hicks is trying to sell her diary to the highest bidder while simultaneously avoiding jail time and dating as many abusive white house staffers as possible.

Speaking of abusive white house staffers dating Hope Hicks, Rob Porter now works for Trump's 2020 election campaign.  Go figure.

James Comey has a book out, and is probably relaxing in a spa somewhere, laughing quietly to himself about ""Emergency Case File A00193,"" which is in an undisclosed location.

Preet Baraha is tweeting some great shit about how dumb Trump's legal team is, but I suppose that doesn't pay the bills so he's likely working for a major US law firm on account of how fucking awesome he is.

Steve Bannon has been fired from Breitbart and vilified by the very same neckbeards he first cultivated into the political arena.  I assume he's living off of his own vast bitcoin hodl while awaiting ~~execution~~ ~~a presidential pardon~~ trial.

Some british asshole is in Jail for the next 30 days for lying to the FBI.  I'm sure it's a Club Fed but I hope it's Rikers.

George Papadopoulos is hiding in a fucking hole somewhere, hoping Putin can't find him while simultaneously live-tweeting pictures of his location and sharing them on facebook.  So, you know, I wish him luck with that.

Cory Lewandowski is trying to figure out how to win Hope Hicks back while they're both in jail.  Actually, I really have no idea what he's up to.

Sebastian Gorka, when not parking on the sidewalk like a giant asshole, is appearing from time to time on Sinclair Media, just in case you didn't yet think they were part of an American fascist/racist/homophobic/misogynist conspiracy yet.

Kellyanne Conway is still employed, but no one knows what her official job is (seriously), and she's cursing out her husband every fucking night for being the lawyer responsible for case law which established that you can sue the president.

HR McMaster and ""Mad Dog"" James Mattis are both dusting off their Fox News political pundit suits, and probably both are also writing books.  McMaster may also be wondering why the fuck no one ever honors his suicide pacts.

&gt; It makes no economic sense to lock up your own money with a poorly connected node, just in case you need to receive money from them. 

In LN, you don't lock up any money with someone who opens a channel with you.  They provide 100% of the funds and it will remain this way until a payment routes through you to them (or through them to elsewhere).

As a new lightning node, they can't be paid without resorting to an onchain transaction(new channel opening), period.

&gt; Alice sends money to Bob, it goes through Amazon and Amazon is privvy to the entire transaction and you are doxxed to them.

This is not correct.  The payments through Amazon (in your example) are onion-wrapped.  Amazon can see where it goes next, but they cannot know whether Alice is the source or whether Bob is the destination.  They could make an educated guess about it, but cannot know for sure.

&gt; Alice wants to send money to Bob. Bob doesn't have any channel open. Alice can't send funds to Bob.

This is also true if Bob just opened new channels on the network.  He can't be paid period until someone opens a channel with him, as channels are (typically) 100% funded by the open-er.

The open-er also pays 100% of the fees, no matter when the channel is closed.

&gt; Alice wants to send $100 worth of Bitcoin to Bob. They are both connected to Amazon with a channel. Bob opened a channel with $100 but Bob just bought a new toothbrush. Alice cannot send $100 to Bob.

In this case, Alice could send Bob back the price of a toothbrush, otherwise the situation is the same as above.

&gt; or there is some other thing called a watchtower that she has to trust with her money.

Watchtowers don't have access to your money.  You have to trust them to broadcast for you if you get attacked, but they don't get trusted with your money directly.

&gt; Bob makes $2000 a month. Bob is lucky. He's richer than 90% of other people on the planet. His employer pays his salary in Bitcoin using LN. 

LN is likely not going to be able to route payments of this size, especially not reliably.

&gt; Bob has $500 left in his channel with his employer and wants to save it. He must now close the channel so he can move his BTC to a wallet he has the keys for. Next salary is coming. 

Bob already has the keys for his LN channel.  Regardless, that detail isn't important - Bob can't both save money and be paid the next month's salary through the same channel.  A new channel would have to be opened.",2018-04-10 01:49:03

So if BTC price is $5000 and it doubles to $10000, you won’t double your $100.  You will double your $900 loan + $100 , so you just won $1,000 ( 10x more). If it goes to 15,000, you wont win 3x but 30x! and so on...

BUT... if BTC price goes down, and you have 10x margin, you will lose your money if it drops a 10th part of the 100%. That means if it drops only 100%/10x = 10% , you lose everything. Why? Because you only had $100 , but you had a loan that made you have the power of $1,000 . How much does it take to lose your original money? 10% of that 1,000. Otherwise you would be negative in debt.



Many people also get destroyed by “Shorting”. 

You can also win money if market goes down.

For example. You take a loan of 1 btc that costs $100. You sell that btc for $100 but you still owe the bitcoin. You wait for the market to drop. Lets say it drops to $90, you buy it for this amount and give back the btc you owed. You just made $10 dollar profit.

**ESL Pro League 01:00 PM EST**

Today we're in for the battle of last place in pro league. Everything has gone to shit for EnvyUS this season but they do have their pro league spot to fight for. This match will likely decide which team gets relegated. That being said EnvyUS are obviously giving it their best shot to not be a complete joke this season. They took NIP down 2-0 yesterday. 

That being said AGO looked completely lost on cbble yesterday against North. Yes both teams aren't the greatest but on an aim based map where aggression matters. I'd take scream and RPK over Gruby/furlan all day. Let's take the French squad to win cbble at some pretty good odds.

**WINNER WINNER**

You are hoping the price of bitcoin will go up.   Say it goes up to $8000, you can sell your 6 bitcoin for $48k, pay back the $30k, and are left with $10k + $8000 in profit.  (Compared to not using margin, you buy 1.5 BTC @ $6666 with your $10k and sell for $12,000 (@$8k) and only made $2k.)

However, if bitcoin goes down you could be ""liquidated.""  You still owe $30,000 to your broker and have 6 BTC, so if the price drops to $5,000 your 6 BTC will be sold off (liquidated) automatically in order to pay back the $30,000 loan, and you would be left with nothing.

The amount you borrow compared to your start collateral is your Leverage.   10x leverage would be borrowing $100,000 with your $10,000.  This is more risky because you get liquidated sooner.  Same price examples, you buy 16.5 BTC with your $110k @$6666. 
You owe $100k, so your liquidation price is $100k / 16.5 BTC = $6060.   If the price drops by just 10% your position will be liquidated and you get nothing.  Before with the 3x leverage, the price needed to drop $1666 (25%) before you got rekt.

(In this post we are talking about shorts, which is the same thing but backwards.  You are borrowing bitcoin at $6666, selling it, and promising to give back bitcoin in the future.  You are hoping the price will drop so you can buy back the bitcoin at a lower price, give the BTC back, and pocket the difference.   But if the price goes up too much you'll be forced to buy the BTC at the higher price and pay it back immediately.  That's what happened this morning.)",2018-04-12 22:25:59

dx6vws6,WatchMeCuckCeleste1,168,"Some context: 

1. Ice was friends with a guy called ""DJ"" who was one of many stream-snipers that showed up at his apartment.
2. Ice is dumb as fuck and can't spot a liar. DJ has free reign to lie about how cool he is.
3. DJ was mentally unstable and lied a lot, he could get ""any celebrity on a phone with Ice""
4. basically he wanted to make himself useful for the stream so he could remain on it.
5. Although he consistently lied, and everyone saw through this, Ice wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt.
6. DJ phones up Ice when Ice got kicked out of his apartment. DJ says Ice can live at his place rent free in LA.
7. Rent in that area of LA, in a house, would be like $5000+. obviously sounds way too good to ever be true. 
8. Ice thinks the entire thing is shady but shows up anyway.  
9. The house is DJ's parents house and his mom is an invalid, DJ is there against his mothers wishes.  
10. the house doesn't belong to DJ, despite this he has roommates, who live there rent free.
11. DJ keeps lying and showing off his parents house to Ice and Sam, and they begin to feel sorry for DJ.
12. DJ is trying to lure ice to pay 5000 in cash. 
13. The ""Plan"" is DJ and Cam would live with ice rent free and Ice ""can afford it"" so it's ""fine""
14. Ice rejects this, doesn't want to pay DJ's rent or live with DJ. fortunately Ice isn't fullblown retarded. 
15. So, Cam is basically living rent free and using DJ. Sam Pepper doesn't like the fact Cam is using DJ.
16. DJ is clearly mentally ill. for all DJ's faults, he had attracted people that are using him for the ""free rent""
17. DJ pretends to be a drug dealer and have hundreds of bitcoin but refuses to go to the atm or show drugs. 
18. DJ wants ice to buy four ps4's via postmates so they can play it on stream at DJ's house (he'd keep the ps4's)
19. Cam wants Ice to pay for him to be on stream, Cam attempts to get the other larger roomate to beat up Sam.
20. Cam has established himself as a user, a pussy and a hypebeast. he acts like a celebrity/better than sam/ice.
21. Cam is using DJ for the house, he's just a dumb stoner,he has the mannerisms of a squatter.  
22. After he realizes Ice is someone he can manipulate. Cam wants to use Ice for fame/get a following of his own.
23. Sam/Ice see right through this and he's already shown himself to be a liar/manipulator/scumbag. 
24. Cam shows up consistently seeking to be on stream and grow his channel, but acts like he isn't.
25. Cam does this quite often, Ice/Sam are just berating him at this point for being a shitty person. 
26. Ice says to cam if he wants to redeem himself to either get fucked by him on chaturbate OR pay the bill.
27. he decides to ditch, but before he does, he tries and fails to get the waiters number, dude is a fucking loser.

They relied (and still relies) heavily on net neutrality: that other companies will treat their IP packets exactly the same as all other IP packets. The same goes for the domain name: ICANN [does not interfere](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/copyright-2013-05-03-en) in copyright disputes. They did lose the .se domain name because the national registry have to comply with Swedish law.

The first major takedown was when the servers got seized. The police took all machines in the entire datacenter, no matter the customer. You solve this problem by installing new servers an re-route your IP addresses with BGP (or point your domain name to new IPs).

It turns out that the dataset behind The Pirate Bay is [not very large](https://torrentfreak.com/download-a-copy-of-the-pirate-bay-its-only-90-mb-120209/). Pretty easy to just sync it up to new machines as long as you have backups hidden somewhere.

Between 2010 and 2017 they broke out the tracker to its own service, [OpenBitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBitTorrent). The tracker is what keeps track of who has what chunks of a torrent. That meant The Pirate Bay itself only hosted the metadata about the chunks that makes up a torrent, not where those chunks can be found. I am not sure how they solve this legal problem nowadays, but one guess is that they rely on [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) so that all you need is the addresses of a few other machines.

There is not much more to it, really. The hard part is to stay within the bounds of the law when so many of your users are doing something illegal, and possibly to keep your own identity hidden if you don't want to get in trouble (this was not a concern for the original team).

This is how The Pirate Bay have done it. It is important to note that The Pirate Bay is a political lobbying project (or was...). That is why they have been open with their identities, being transparent with how they host stuff and how they believe they are acting within the law. Note that they do not try to be an illegal website!

If *I* had an illegal web site I would do it completely differently. I would use Tor to hide my servers and my identity, which seems very effective. Remember Silk Road? It took a very long time for authorities to track it down, and they only succeeded because the admin was a dumbass posting on a web forum about similar activities. I would pay my hosting bills with Bitcoin from wallets that are only used for this purpose. Like The Pirate Bay I would keep backups of the dataset, possibly even physical copies hidden in the forest or something. My computers would be encrypted with very long passwords and I would use trusted VPN services (possibly also routed over Tor) for all Internet access regarding the project. I would also lead a separate normal life like a web developer who earns his money fair and square, complete with social media profiles and a Reddit account to show how normal I am.",2018-04-13 19:53:20

dx9f0wp,siddhartha-komodo,59,"I'll give you my unofficial opinion. I'm no longer an official team member, though I'm still an active community member and Komodo believer. (I left the team to resume my MBA program, which I was in before I discovered blockchain, and had always planned on finishing my degree.)


Komodo is built to be used. As such, it requires people use it for its value to go up.


On the BarterDEX side of our progress, we're lacking in Bob-users providing liquidity to the network. There are things being done in the background to resolve this, largely surrounding UX/UI.


BarterDEX is arguably the most advanced DEX on the tech side, but without liquidity, the tech doesn't matter. So, if you want to get directly involved, learn how to set up a Bob provider node, and add liquidity to as many pairs as you can.


On the asset-chain creation side, there appear to be two things that people are waiting for before diving in.


The first is for the smart-contract tech to get out of alpha. The merkle root of merkle root (MoM) idea is fantastic, imho. It allows multiple blockchains to conduct smart contracts together, including non-KMD blockchains. The details are still fuzzy to me, so ask jl777 if you're really curious.


Until the smart-contract tech is done, it's really hard for people to code smart-contracts on KMD. You have to use the native Bitcoin protocol smart contracts (the original smart-contracts that Satoshi Nakamoto designed, and which serve as the basis for BarterDEX's atomic swaps). Very few developers can program on this level. 


MoM and Crypto Conditions are the first primarily solutions for this, but it may be a while yet before the KMD team starts giving people the go-ahead. 


Secondly, people are waiting and watching as the next few dICOs come out, just looking to see what happens. Hopefully everything will go well.


It's frustrating not to see the price rise quickly, certainly. But know that the amount of funds the notary nodes have


The other thing I would encourage you to do is to start holding the notary nodes to account for their campaign promises, and putting pressure on those who are holdovers from the first election to contribute more.


Notary nodes are largely misunderstood by the majority of the Komodo community.


I rewrote the white paper before leaving largely to explain them more thoroughly. I haven't seen it appear yet on the website, but hopefully it be posted soon. There are several extra pages explaining what notary nodes are and what they do.


One thing that, in my personal opinion, is largely misunderstood by the Komodo community is that the notary nodes are, effectively, the most important Komodo-team members.


Each node receives 50 KMD per day, no matter what. (Assuming they're taking advantage of the mining opportunity.)


That means each node should be an evangelist, developer, businessman, etc., on top of their foundational responsibility to endow the Komodo community with the Bitcoin hash rate.


They have a financial incentive to make that 50 KMD worth as much as anyone can imagine. 


Imagine if KMD reached the same value as Ethereum at its peak of $1K (I believe, our MoM and CC smart-contract tech now make us arguably superior to Ethereum, on several levels). 


That would make each node worth $50K per day. You can run an entire small town off of that. There are third-world countries that exist on less.

Ideally, each node should be a treasured position, held by an extremely engaged individual, who leads a team of other individuals in growing the Komodo ecosystem. Their foundational requirement is IT network experience (if the Komodo ecosystem is successful, there will be plenty of work for each node to do to maintain notarization).


But their job, in my opinion, really shouldn't stop there. They should be making podcasts, looking for new projects to notarize to the KMD main chain, setting up LP nodes, etc.
They should be marketing, selling, building, and developing Komodo.


The more valuable KMD, the more valuable their guaranteed 50 KMD/day.


There are a few of the newcomer notary nodes that do this, and few of the ones from last year who held over also are active contributors.


However, many of the notary nodes seem completely complacent with just $125/day, instead! It's enough to live off of, and put their mental energy and resources (even their KMD earnings) into setting up mining farms and trading in other projects.



In my personal opinion, if Komodo is to succeed, the notary nodes will each have to take responsibility as an MVP team member of the Komodo community.


Currently, the KMD notarization funds are enough for KMD to continue notarizing (assuming currently fee levels, which are sometimes extremely high) for at least 12 years.


That is a LOT of runway, so the Komodo project won't be disappearing anytime soon. Plenty of time to keep pushing forward.


Whether or not it will rapidly grow is up to user adoption. The smart-contract tech, UX/UI work that is happening in the background, and the upcoming preliminary dICOs are the next steps. Once we make it past them, we'll reassess and see what comes next.


It will take people using it on the same level that people are using Ethereum (the ERC20 token short cut that Vitalik took is really the reason why Ethereum pumped so much. Besides being first to market in ERC20s, Ethereum really doesn't have any other competitive advantages).


Even if you compare us to Lisk, which does Javascript-only smart-contract (far, far easier to build the backend tech for this), we're still just not yet getting user adoption on their level. The team is aware of the issue. The smart-contract tech has to be finished before we can start building out documentation, tutorials, etc.


Keep in mind, once all this stuff actually gets up and going, Komodo is built to scale in a manner that is a large competitive advantage. I've loosely calculated the numbers on my own.


An individual blockchain (any blockchain, not just KMD-related blockchains) is limited by size and speed.


Each individual blockchain in the Komodo community can support as much as one other main chain (Ethereum etc.).


Since Komodo is capable of connecting 10's of thousands of individual chains, both through MoM/CC and atomic swaps, Komodo is capable of scaling into the levels that would let us start competing with networks like Visa and MasterCard (millions of transactions per hour). Many other blockchain projects are not built to compete on that level.


It will take a long, long time to get to where we are actually doing that, but the 12 year runway gives us time to get there. 


Hopefully this helps give you some insight into what we're actually up against, and what kind of help we need from our community.",2018-04-13 05:04:10

Today we have a lower bracket match for the ESL One Belo Qualifier. Attax goes into this match off the back of some big upset wins online but I'm not convinced it was due to them playing great. The team overall is really skimp on firepower. They lost their best player recently to BIG and you still have the Hunden factor to make up for. Not to mention the map pool for Attax really plays into North. Their main three vetoes are overpass, Nuke, Cache. North has no issue playing Nuke and overpass. One of Norths perm bans is cache so it's likely they can float the ban and force Attax to ban it later. That being said we are going to see North get either Nuke or overpass. That alone strongly favors North to win in straight games. 

Despite north looking awful on lan they have been much more consistent in online play. I'll take the Danes to sweep Attax and move on to likely face EnvyUS.

Now, he was having a sort of conundrum: he didn't really have room in his garage to just leave the kayak on the ground, and his backyard had just recently been sprayed. So he had been considering a somewhat genius idea: use zip-ties to fasten it to the roof of the garage.

And so, there he was, one end of the kayak balanced on his shoulder, the other suspended by a loop of zip-ties. Another loop hung from the ceiling above his head, and he stared at it for a few moments.

Up the kayak did go, straight into the loop, right as planned.

In the engine of a jet plane travelling over southern Ontario, a tie snaps, and a fuel connector pops off. 

Within moments, the engine is engulfed in flames.

There are only twelve people on the plane. This is not, as one might assume, due to the obscenely high prices of domestic flights in Canada. No, this is a private jet, flying an underpaid flight crew of six, along with their passengers: three CEOs, two up-and-coming geniuses, and their host, whose name cannot be mentioned for risk of violating several trademarks.

The crash of the plane heralds, only hours later, the crash of the stock market.

dxccnzo,ScreaminJay,49,"Well, private tracker is a small world. I'm one of the ""big guy"" in there and I can tell you, it's always the same people everywhere. We collect and reshare and rip and encode everything. All you see getting down to your public sites, we're making this stuff exist... all of it, except scene stuff.

I'm one of the founders of PTP. That came as an extension of what we were already trying to achieve on KG, branching into the mainstream... and restricting it to movies alone. It works well, we are all collecting movies and creating the largest archive ever put together.

Understand this, 80% of movies on PTP are not on public trackers, they are only on a very few sites. They are all private: KG, CG, PTP, Cinematik, ADC, HDBits, it's a very small circle. It's a hobby that is very different from those that are satisfied by public trackers. I'd say streaming sites are just fine if you are after this stuff. I mean, just get netflix, it have it all, it's all good. A lot of people stopped downloading due to streaming services.

But PTP and other huge archive websites serve a different purposes. KG and ADC create hundreds of subtitles for non-subtitled movies. Rare movies, things you cannot buy anyway unless you speak Cantonese or Swedish or whatever have been translated to English.

Again, it's a different hobby and interest. I often tell people it is not worth joining PTP if all you want is the latest popular movies. Those are easy to find on any other trackers. It is fine to use PTP to download them, but if you have zero interest for everything else, then it is not worth your trouble.

There are more than one site with rare interesting content you cannot find on public and generalist sites. If you claim generalist trackers are not a whole lot better than public trackers, that is not entirely true, but it is not completely false.

That is to say, if you are on a generalist tracker and you are looking for this old kung fu movies you remember seeing as a kid that you never could find... well, it's not going to be on a generalist trackers. There are the specialized Asian trackers for those (avistaz and ADC)... and you can find them on KG/PTP/CG too. They will very rarely be on public trackers or generalist private trackers. 

Also, very important notion, private trackers are trading hubs for collectors. Some of us have been doing this 20-30 years. I recruited people to Karagarga a dozen years ago... from a forum where people were still trading bootleg rare movies on VHS tapes. Bootleg movies are those that were not released on any medium except film and that film was transferred to VHS. 

This hobby was never intended as a way to save money exclusively. A lot of us purchased a lot of movies and supplemented it with downloads, recording off tv, things like that. People still spend a ton of money bringing this content out. For example, all of those web-dl you see, tons of people are spending money to get them to you.

Finally, your mentality doesn't work, it never worked. Public trackers have never preserved anything. I've released movies on KG in 2005 that are still seeded in 2018. This is very different what we are doing in our small ""clubs"". 

You should try to join the key trackers and they will change your mind. To get in is complex, but you just need to get acquainted with people who are within them. The reason why getting in is complex is... because people are assholes and they are selling invites. Thus, when the top sites are being sold for 100-300$ per invite in bitcoin forums, then we need to restrict how those invites can be offered.

If people offer invites publicly, here is what happen.

""I have invite for X, give me YOUR email"".

Joblo goes to his trading site and say: ""I have invite for X, selling for 200$"".

Joblo sell that invite, goes to the guy who is publicly offering invites and send him the email of the person he sold the invite to. See, very simple, you are giving invite to someone, that person you are giving it to have sold it to a third-party.

That is why those sites need to protect themselves against this scam that have happened very often where you give an invite to someone who is actually just using this offer to make money. 

On the very difficult to join sites like HDBits, people have likely made tens of thousands of dollars selling invites over the years. Now, if you run a tracker that is actually costing you money since donations don't match expenses, do you think it is appreciated to learn some people are making thousands of dollars selling invites? Or for anyone else who donate to this site... we are contributing in building something that is ""free"", but it cost something to run, so donations are needed to share this expense. Then someone just come in and try to make thousands of dollars off of you. 

Understand the economics too. Private trackers have no ad and run by donations. It cost money, a lot of money, to run all of this. Public trackers have ads and spam to help with the cost. 

As said, completely different hobby. If you want free stuff, it's not hard to find. These are everywhere. If you want to help a community grow and build its archive... then private trackers are the way to go.

dxdlhas,The_OPs_Mommy,93,"Ok I’ve got some intel on this.  

Both addresses in question belong to the same person.

It’s an Australian lad who (while I won’t dox his IRL identity) online uses the nym “pondsea”.

He is very involved with [KOMODO](https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform) (a fork of Zcash) as well as the intimately related, soon-to-launch, “decentralized atomic swaps exchange” (smh) called [barterDEX](https://komodoplatform.com/decentralized-exchange/) (formerly known as [“Bitcoin Dark”] (https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoindark/). He **currently operates several KOMODO notary nodes** from servers in St. Petersburg, Russia, Montreal Canada, and Sydney Australia. 



(Remember the highlighted part for what follows)  


Last year and prior this same issue came up. 


The way their Komodo “blockchain solutions provider” system thingy works is by encoding tx details of their originating chain in the OP_RETURN output on the BTC blockchain. 

These “notary nodes” are performing something that they call “Delayed Proof of Work”. These “notaries” are compensated for performing these tasks.  


Their official response (by way of [a thread on bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1808078.0)) attempted an explanation of their MO:  
 
&gt; *”Everyone has heard of the block size debate and its proposed solutions. Whether you are a proponent of SegWit + LN or BigBlocks or some other method in-between, most all can agree something needs done. Komodo aims at tackling current and future need for storing data on a secure distributed ledger  through its scalability mechanism known as Delayed Proof-of-Work”*


continuing with:  

&gt; *”Delayed Proof-of-Work  works by receiving submissions from third-party blockchains and recording their hashes into a Komodo Block. The blockhash of that block  is then submitted in a group-signed transaction to Bitcoin's Network through a group of elected node operators.   This signed transaction forms a ""checkpoint""  where if at a future time either a third-party blockchain or Komodo itself  becomes threatened by a malicious actor or a fork divides the community, this checkpoint system gives the operators of the respective networks a "" last known good"" block hash  from which they can start efforts of fixing their network.”*  



About the spam:  


&gt;”There are several in here that accuse the Komodo notary nodes in their group-signed transaction of contributing to the delays on the Bitcoin Network.  This is not the case.  First, our transactions count for well less than 1% of the current backlog. In addition they are a part of a necessary function in the SuperNET ecosystem aimed at enhancing the bitcoin networks scalability.”*  


So there you go. It doesn’t seem to be malicious per se. 

I’d classify it more as garden-variety parasitism by some weird cartel comprised of one [ridiculously prolific procrasterbating programmer](https://forum.supernet.org/t/has-james-jl777-abandoned-his-projects-in-the-past-how-many-icos-has-he-done/155/3) and his entourage of computer nerds.

I was asked for a personal prediction and that’s what I made.  I always advise that if you are going to buy XRP, do it by dollar cost averaging.  Don't mortgage the house, sell the family car, or cash in the kid's tuitions to buy XRP.  If my prediction is right then I'm right and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but it is ultimately up to you to buy or sell XRP.  Do you understand that?


If you don't like my prediction and you think it's nuts, crazy, weird, unbelievable, unsubstantiated, then go back to the other subs or the other forums and talk amongst them and their TA charts.  You sound like a grown man/woman and as an adult you can make your own decisions.  You can't just rely on some person on the internet whose ""face"" is a bear wearing a funny hat.


I like to think that most people in this subreddit seem to be of the same mind that this subreddit is a fun diversion of the usual FUD infested pits of the other forums and subreddits.  I am not a psychic like Theresa Caputo, John Edward, or Edgar Cayce.


[Heres some GoogleFu..](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ripple+%241000+prediction)


**Please consult with a registered investment advisor before making any investment decision.**

Look at the post from Christmas day and look at what has happened with Ripple since then. This Ripple locomotive is not stopping.  Brad ""Brass Balls"" Garlinghouse, David Schwartz and the rest of the team are on a non-stop central bank conquest that is shaking the cryptofinancialsphere.  The new and old money are starting to come around.  The ancient money, for example Sharia etc., is still hesitant but they too are starting to give an inch here and there.

The other coins are in an awful panic.  Bitcoin and the alts thought that they could “burn down the empire” and then rebuild it with their coins.  Ripple saw the writing on the wall and decided to work with the empire and then when they got comfortable, supply them with new coins.  Everyone sees it.  
Again, the prediction may be right or it may be wrong.  It could be right if some big things in the background come to pass and the plans that were planned a while back pan out.  But if a wrench is thrown in, it could all unravel and get delayed.  These are things I don’t have control over.   I am not here to yank people’s chains.  I am here to bring hope to the masses that there is a good possible investment sitting out in the open that 99% of the world has not even looked at.  I post what I can and leave breadcrumbs for people to help them do their own research and make a decision whether to buy XRP or not.

Sometimes I get a big idea/info that something is in the works and may happen but the PTB or the King and his soldiers shut it down.  “CoughBuyOutCough.” 

Make a decision on your own.

I truly wish the best for you and everyone else.  I want us all to come out winners with Ripple and XRP.  If this subreddit and its jester moderator is too much for you to swallow then go ahead and unsubscribe and if I feel that you need help and are just miserable hanging around this good-natured sub, then I’ll help you out like I’ve done with a few already.

Banks are legally responsible for taking care of your money, so even if you don't ""own"" your own money when you save it to bank, that doesn't really matter, because banks have obligation to pay back to you. Compare that to Facebook situation where you have nothing to win against Facebook if you sue them because it's all in their TOS that they will use your data for their profit.

It's a completely different issue and I think it's important not to conflate the two if we want Bitcoin to really win.

Even if I know I don't own my money when I save it to my bank, I still use them because they're guarding my money, and it works well enough mostly.

Too many self-proclaimed libertarians don't truly understand why we have banks and governments and just mindlessly blame them, and I think that's very counter-productive thing to do.

dxd33vn,Cryptolution,57,"&gt; You think it's a bitcoin hater spamming the network?

No, we know exactly who it is, and probably why they are doing it, which is to game the network to maximize fee revenue. This is a exploit not envisioned by satoshi, because it creates a perverse incentive where those who are supposed to be working for the *good* of the network with greed are instead working against it.

From the [LaruentMT article posted by OP, see part 2](https://medium.com/@laurentmt/good-whale-hunting-d3cc3861bd6b) -

&gt;These charts confirm that only 7 mining pools have played an active role during the 8th wave: 1Hash, Antpool, BitClub Network, BTC.com, HaoBTC, Kano CKPool and ViaBTC.

These are those who are complicit in this behavior. We all know who is involved with these pools. Clearly there is collusion going on behind the scenes, with company coordination, to collect as much of the spent fee's as possible, to minimize the cost of this behavior and maximize the potential revenue generated by increased fee's.

Watch the documentary on MIT card counting. Pretty much the same plan. If you coordinate with a large enough group, and you spend enough money, with the data known (how many cards/how many blocks/hashpower) there can be a mathematical solution to predicting chance and therefore revenue.

Some of these pools might loose, but overall if they collude they are all going to win big.

And they have, and continue to, **at the expense of bitcoin users, creating ideological rifts, leading literally to the splitting of bitcoin**.

Let that soak in for a minute. Miners, who are supposed to be securing the network, who are paid fucking handsomely for it, such as the [3-4 billion bitmain made](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/84czhp/bitcoin_mining_firm_bitmain_made_3_to_4_billion/), are instead milking every single penny from the system to the point of not caring how much damage it is doing to the ecosystem that has made them filthy rich, are ultimately the root cause behind the factions in bitcoin. You know the saying...follow the money....

This is the largest failure of bitcoin, and one that im still not sure is going to be fully rectified with LN. It will reduce costs for sure, but I don't think it will solve it. They will just game the system the same way regardless of circumstances.

This is also one of the largest arguments *against* a blocksize increase. If you give miners an economic incentive to maximize revenue, they will persue it *at all costs* as can be demonstrated by these multi-year spam waves. So if you raise the blocksize, miners will simply stuff the blocks full of padded transactions so that they are at the edge again, increasing fee revenue.

With a blocksize increase, the ecosystem is punished twice. Not only will end users pay more in fee's regardless of how large the blocksize is, but node operators will be forced to upgrade hardware to accommodate the increased resource usage. This will undoubtably reduce node counts in a linear fashion, leading to (eventually) strong centralized effects.

I just don't understand all the mining cartel apologists. The whole ""its the free market bro"" shit. Yea, it is, but its also vulture capitalism. Its squeezing every ounce from your end users (to massive detriment to the network), when instead you could let them thrive, propagate the network and maximize your revenue from increased population/usage.

Those mining groups are not the friend of bitcoin. They will watch it burn because they have already been made filthy fucking rich from their behavior.

2) broader economic fundamentals, anything from interest rate trends to exogenous shocks like the onset of a global financial crisis... which, worth noting, would be the first such event for bitcoin, which hasn't gone through a full business cycle yet (having appeared in 2009, after the GFC)

A 50% retrace of this column would put under 7399 and now that our O column has confirmed this is more likely to happen before we can continue upward.

Let's look back at our chart drawings from 4 days ago https://www.tradingview.com/x/vDDIAO6U/  Both the smaller kumo break out and the larger higher high break out played out very nicely.  A strong move up without very little retracement or throwbacks to previous highs.  Reaching 8100 without much retracement is fairly impressive, but we are now at a minor 62% fib level, a weekly level, and we have had recent 2-4 hour bear divs.  A retrace to at least 7000-7400 (25%-38% fib, 4 hour cloud, wyckoff throwback, volume node) is highly likely here.

The higher timeframe bull break out is at 9.9k-10k (confirmation of long term downward trend break, higher high, break of 62% fib from local high to local low).  As we approach 8.8k-9.9k (volume node, long term downward trend, major weekly level), we will see more and more shorts open as the risk reward increases on short position.

I started this process last October, but chickened out halfway through and just got into crypto instead.

Edit: 

If anyone *is* interested in getting into crypto, [Binance](https://www.binance.com) is the most popular exchange for buying most popular crypto currencies other than Bitcoin. Unfortunately, they don't accept 'normal' money yet (Though they will soonish). You have to buy Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin/whatever on one of the exchanges that do accept normal money, and then send your crypto to Binance. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is probably the most used exchange to buy crypto in the first place, but there are alternatives. I used [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/) here in Europe, and it was fast and painless. Took a few hours from when I registered to when I could buy with my credit card. This was in October, however, not sure if they have longer wait times now. You do have to do a video call with them and show them your ID and pinky promise you are not buying crypto for someone else or because you are being robbed. Once you have an account on both Binance and an exchange that accepts fiat (normal money) and you have sent your crypto to Binance, please do at least a little research to determine *which* crypto currency you want to buy. Many of them will do very well, and have already, but it is also inevitable that some of the projects will fail. Don't put your entire investment in any one coin, and don't risk more money than you can afford to lose. We had a very painful crash from January to March, and while the general trend has been up, nobody knows which way the roller coaster is going to go next.

dxf4kll,Mr0ldy,57,"I wrote down some Verge history in an earlier thread about Verge the other day. I'll just repost it here since you seem curious. Here is a copy of my post:

To understand how Verge works, just look at ""Wraith protocol"" that does not exist, it was just a hypeword for optional stealth adresses from 2014. Something that any coin can use. It's a wallet level feature, not protocol level. They are also worthless for privacy, especially if they are optional.

""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/20701/what-is-a-stealth-address

""I was in Verge team when Wraith protocol was ""invented"" by M.Stolaire at those times. The name was intentionally picked to be catchy and proclaimed to be some sort of new tech. Then it was hyped properly. Noobs don't bother what tech it does, McAfee tweets, noobs see price under $, see price of Bitcoin over 15k$ and buy and fomo others. Same now. Xvg net attacked, main dev writes in telegram and other channels its normal and that's it. Fanatic comunity just say nothing happened. Now the hype with partnership is steaming and nobody cares about attack. “ Speculation :that partnership gonna be very probably with German Bank and they will release xvg debit cards. Imagine Verge chain being attacked in future, how you will pay with such card. Useless. And I'm not even talking about that when I was in team dev said xvg will NEVER partnership with bank, ever. Because it is anonymous, decentralized currency.“ W/e. he lies so often, that it does not matter what he says. One of the reason I left team after June, July, August roadmap kept postponing and stayed undelivered without explanation to us as a team or to comunity. ""

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.840

Who is the dev you might wonder?

A guy convicted for numerous crimes and he also does not know how to code. Some examples of what he did include drug charges, multiple traffic violations, trespassing, giving wrong name to an officer, contempt of court, failure to appear in court, violating probation, damaging property.

Just to give a few examples, I could give you about ten more.

That is without going in to several payed pumps and extreme censorship and dishonesty by the Verge team/Sunerok, such as denying the severity of the hack and just a whole battery of dishonest actions such as changing icons and colors of the wallet and claiming it to be ""privacy updates"", I have the links to the discussion and links to github but I'm too lazy to dig them up.

Verge is a hype-coin, a shitcoin and since recently, most likely an all out scam. It feeds on naive investors who have no clue about fundamentals. And is used by whales to scalp the noobs for profit.

Now we are waiting to see ""the biggest partnership ever in crypto"" and because of the above history, I expect it to be quite underwhelming.

dxglkmk,IkmoIkmo,2380,"This shows only one perspective as IPO investments are priced very differently from pre-IPO investments.

i.e., one investor bought 10% of Facebook for 0.5m pre-IPO. That share of the company later grew to 50.000 million (50b). In other words, the investment appreciated by 100 thousand fold. A $10k investment would be worth $1 billion, which is similar to bitcoin.

Secondly, not including dividends is a really bad idea. Reinvested dividends with compound interest make a huge difference. For example, $1 on the S&amp;P500 since the start of the graph became $34 or $168, depending on whether you reinvested dividends. If you did that for some of the other company's, you'd see quite a different story.

Lastly, bitcoin hasn't made as many people rich as you'd think. The problem with bitcoin is a problem you see in many valuations. For example, I can start a company and create 1 billion shares. I can now sell you 1 share for $1. Not a big deal, if it's a bad investment, you just lose $1. But, I have now valued my company effectively at $1 billion, after all my most recent transaction price puts my fungible shares at $1 and I have a billion of them. 

Bitcoin does this as well. It remains to be seen however if the current owners can cash out the hundreds of billions of market capitalization of Bitcoin. I'd bet the answer is no, the price plummets as soon as substantial portions are tried to be sold, suppose all owners tried to sell all coins to new owners, the price would probably drop to virtually nothing, which we see in price drops everytime there is any substantial selling pressure. This is different from actual money making businesses like say Apple, which, suppose the current owners tried to sell all shares to another party, would be able to do so at a price close to the current market cap. It wouldn't be worthless overnight. 

Conversely, it's quite easy for startups to also claim ridiculously low valuations and boost them later. i.e. Google could have started with 1 billion shares, sold 1 of its billion shares for a billionth of a dollar, valuing the entire company at just $1. The transaction is insignificant, they only gave up a billionth of their company, a tiny, insignificant fraction. But two decades later in 2018, when the company is worth $800 billion, you could have said 'my investment / market cap / stock went up by 800 billion times', which is orders of magnitude more than bitcoin. Obviously this is silly, just like starting bitcoin's valuation at a penny when it was meaningless.

In short, yeah bitcoin was a unique, ridiculously good investment, but these comparisons can be also misleading sometimes, can be silly sometimes, and only show one perspective. ",2018-04-17 01:49:38

So they forked the bitcoin and went their way.

But obviously it didn't end there. Since the Bcash community thinks they are the ones who are sticking to the original idea (Satoshi's white paper and such), they should be the ones to be called the original Bitcoin (therefore they should be the ones to get the mainstream adoption and recognition). Bitcoin community on the other hand disagrees. To be honest they have their own reasons too but since they don't bother to be as vocal as the Bcash community I'm not that up to date with their goals. Nevertheless they don't like each other since the fork and don't keep themselves from slinging shit to each other.

I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops).

Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below.

Been waiting for this event for two months now. Let's fucking go boys. The first event since the huge influx of roster changes throughout the scene. Team Liquid coming up huge recently with the additional of Naf and now finally filling the entry role with Taco. I can't help but take the spread against Gambit who have been absolutely awful I'm 2018. Seized has recently taken over the IGL role and they have been getting smacked around pro league by double digit losses left and right. Out of their last 6 matches they only managed to win against Godsent in a close match on Cbble. This is the match where TL cements their up and coming top NA status. They have to come out firing this group because it's the most dangerous out of the whole tournament. I don't see them coming out slow. Fire power is heavily on TL and gambit has literally no map pool.

dxizebw,turtleflax,62,"Claims and advertising differ frequently, but here's some from the past year.  They will use vague or subjective terms like ""privacy coin"", ""private"", or ""anonymous"" which can be hard to argue.  When they make claims like that it can imply sender privacy or transaction unlinking, but they do not have any of that.

&gt; Tor integration/private networking

This has been claimed for around a year, but was not accurate until about late January 2018.  What they based this on was running some of their electrum servers on Tor.  [The user would connect to this server securely, and the server would relay your transaction to the network](https://archive.fo/10byr).  In effect, this actually reduced privacy because you were going through a middleman who then knew your address, tx history, tx ID, and real IP address.  The verge dev even lied about the fact that he could see this data in an interview.  If someone had used a normal wallet client instead like on bitcoin, the network and their ISP would not easily be able to connect them to an address or transaction.  [Around late January, Tor integration was added to the wallets](https://archive.is/D9r57), but last I checked they had not been built for all major OS platforms.

While integrated Tor may sound good and help in certain scenarios, it does serve to isolate many of your nodes from potential users on the clearnet.  It also means that verge devs are responsible for updating the Tor software in their client when security or privacy issues arise, and wallet updates don't tend to be released that frequently.

&gt; Ledger privacy

About 1 year ago they actually both claimed to be the best privacy coin and that ledger privacy was bad because merchants wouldn't adopt them because support couldn't verify transactions on the blockchain (not true of any current or prior blockchain privacy technology).  In October they decided to integrate stealth addresses, which is technology Vert and other coins had in 2014.  They called it Wraith protocol even though ""protocol"" is a misnomer in this sense and it's very misleading to rebrand existing tech as if you created it.

Stealth addresses are something a recipient can use to protect their privacy from the sender.  [It is weak privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/cryptocurrency#wiki_verge) unless coupled with actual transaction privacy.  Since merchants and exchanges tend to use automated systems that are not designed for this, there has been no adoption of the little privacy tech they actually have.  So effectively, there will be no way to privately send funds to pornhub or an exchange because their automatic system isn't generating you a stealth address.  And again, the recipient privacy was not meant for you so even if they did generate one, it wouldn't help you at all.  



&gt; Dual blockchains, public and private

This was claimed in their whitepaper and marketing, but has no basis in reality.

So at the end of the day, Verge has integrated network privacy and weak recipient privacy.  Privacy-wise they are somewhere between Groestlecoin and Dash.  If integrated Tor is important to you, ZCoin just integrated it and has far better ledger privacy",2018-04-18 04:35:13

dxkghw5,lannibal_hecter,54,"lmao his website looks really promising. Seems to be a bad attempt at finitism, following his own intuition without being aware of finitism.

[This](http://steve-patterson.com/cantor-wrong-no-infinite-sets/) is a good introduction to the article linked by OP.

&gt; I am a philosopher and author working outside of academia 

&gt; In my own research, I have discovered a remarkably consistent truth: orthodox opinions are almost always wrong. The “mainstream consensus” on any given topic – whether about political theory or quantum physics – frequently makes foundational errors. Thus, my worldview looks radical when compared to the mainstream.

right... 

&gt; The foundations of modern mathematics are flawed. A logical contradiction is nestled at the very core [...] they’ve made an elementary error that most children would discover.

ok, let's see

&gt; Mathematicians are an interesting bunch. They are very, very rigorous when it comes to analyzing implications – what follows from what. They do not seem nearly as rigorous when it comes to analyzing presuppositions – what precedes from what. In fact, they do not even seem to be aware of their own presuppositions. I’ve been told countless times, “It’s absolutely certain that Cantor proved the existence of different sizes of infinite sets! Mathematicians have double-checked his work for a century!”

&gt; But they don’t seem to be aware of one problem: what if the presuppositions of Cantor’s proof are wrong? 

Absolutely doodley. Cantor's contributions to mathematics were entirely uncontroversial! Why has nobody questioned it?!?


&gt; What mathematicians try to avoid – and seemingly every other area of thought, too – is philosophy

.... what?

Later he mentions Russell, Wittgenstein, Kronecker, ....


&gt; In order to understand the refutation of Cantor’s Diagonal Argument, we have to understand the metaphysics of mathematics – what numbers are, and their relationship to our minds. In a nutshell: numbers are concepts. They do not exist separate from our minds, nor do they exist separate of our conception of them.

Specifically about Iota having zero fees (which would be a big deal to Amazon's low prices). and it's unique ability to scale up in speed as the network traffic increases, which again would be a big deal for Amazon's enormous traffic.  We should be excited for such an enormous company to be pressing forward into the IoT world, it only means more people are preparing to benefit for the foundation Iota has already established as a world leader in it's purpose.  While also keeping in mind, to get a network like Iota off the ground is not something that can easily be copied, it takes a certain amount of baseline traffic to get its wings off the ground with no coordinator and no one is closer to this than Iota itself, it's not like bitcoin which can literally be carbon copied with a new name in a weekend of effort.  Once Iota gets up to running speed it may never have a parallel because everyone wanting to use the technology will go to the fully-functional leader, not wait for a competitor to spend 4 years catching up it's network traffic to a certain threshhold to be an alternative functional decentralized solution.  Iota is the real deal, and it's the first of its kind.

dxjt7wg,zoink,47,"&gt;Does anyone know if this is common practice at Starbucks? 

The one time I was in a Starbucks in San Francisco there was a minor kerfuffle between a barista and a black guy about the bathroom. 

Guy asks if he can get the code for the bathroom. Barista said it was only for paying customers.  He said he'd buy something after he got out. Barista still refused, said he could buy it now. He got indignant, raising his voice, ""how dare you question my honor"" type of thing. Barista relented. He used the bathroom and left without buying anything. 

I used to do bitcoin trades at Strarbucks. I always made sure I bought something. If I am at a coffee shop for hours I make sure I buy at least two things. I wouldn't call the cops over it but I think it's a dick move to sit around for hours and not buy something. 

I never worked food/coffee but I worked retail and when you see customers pull the same shit over and over again, even though it's minor, it starts to add up. Certain personalities can get really wound tight about it. In a company as big as Starbucks I've got no trouble believing that a manager had had enough of people ""taking advantage of the company"" and called the cops. No set up just a numbers game.

The big win here, it we can get mass adoption, is a monetary system that no government can abuse or interfere with. If Bitcoin, or Ether, or any other coin, becomes massive, at the very least it will force some big governments to be much more disciplined in their monetary and fiscal policy.

Hell, **he even has his own currency now.** So why can't he just go do his own thing?

Roger knows that /r/Bitcoin is never going to be his property and he will never have any untoward influence here, and it has driven him insane.

Think about the precedent this sets.  Here's why this paid partnership is bad for crypto:

1. Alt already know the bullshit that is exchange listing fees.  These can range from $1,000 to several million.  Every merchant adoption is going to want their own payday now too.  This will be terrible for crypto adoption

2. If anyone does try to pay with the shitcoin that is verge, they have to deal with the exchanges to get bitcoin first, then they have to experience the shitty verge wallet.  This is a terrible first impression for crypto

3. Pornhub themselves will have a bad crypto experience when the verge dev accidentally forks his coin again or his shitty code gets attacked

2. It says shady-ass fundraising and announcement announcements are ok

3. It says you don't need good tech, competent development, actual privacy, or ethical marketing to succeed in crypto

Probably the best match all day imo going between arguable the best player in the world and a Fnatic squad who finally is finding their groove. Despite recent online results I do edge Fnatic here in a bo3 especially due to how shallow Navis map pool has been. Fnatic is great at inferno, we will see that map played likely picked by Navi. Both teams play overpass and Mirage. Even though Navi dumpstered Renegades it's not much to say when you see how it was played. You can't expect S1mple and Electronic to run into sites blindly entrying. Krimz is one of the best anchor players in CSGO and I can see Navi struggling on their T side.

Building on that, I have now come up with four short-term scenarios.     
Here’s the [zoomed out, macro view](https://www.tradingview.com/x/m9SY9iz2/).     
Here’s the [channel changeover](https://www.tradingview.com/x/qoUlK0uz/).     
Here’s the [four scenarios](https://www.tradingview.com/x/a1xyX9oj/).     

**Bull Case:** We continue within the immediate channel (the support line is bright green) with a price target of $8,800-$9,000 for April 23. This would be very bullish as it means we have forcefully broken through the downward channel from ATH.

**Sideways Case:** We leave the immediate channel but stay within the broader channel (the black lines). We likely see a moderate retracement to 7,800-$8000, but consolidate at this level with a price target of $8,200 for April 27. This would indicate the log resistance from ATH is going to be a major source of downward pressure on the market.

**Bear Case:** We drop out of the broader channel for the next three weeks, but stay above the brief support created in early April (the light blue line). This comes with a price target of $7,500 for April 8.

**Uber Bear Case:** We drop out of the immediate channel, the broader channel and fall below the brief support created in early April. This would indicate a significant reversal of the progress from the past month and that the market is still in the original downward channel from ATH. This action yields a price target of $6,900 with resolution shortly after May 22.

These charts might be a little messy, but I’m still getting the hang of this. Just to give you a bit of background on myself, I was an associate at a macro hedge fund and an analyst with the alternative asset management group at a top three U.S. investment bank. I have experience with fixed income, forex, commodities, derivatives and interest rates. I hope to do a larger macro analysis of bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market in the near future.

Would they be supporters of the decentralized vision? Or would they quickly succumb to the type of control typical of most centralized entities either by forced compliance or by greed?

It didn't take long to know the answer to that.

First, was their inclusion of a phishing scheme called BCash as if it was legitimate. They either didn't do their homework and were ignorant, or had business ties to it. Either way, it was a clear sign they were failing.

Second, was their lackluster attempt at protecting the privacy of their users. They are now happy to report users to the IRS, both via the summons and via proactive actions of reporting trades as if they were a typical brokerage. Rather than side with customers, and prefer to shut down and burn their data, they preferred to sell out their customers in order to survive. It may have been the correct business move, but the incorrect moral move.

And Bitcoin, without the principles, is worthless. Coinbase has proven to only be about making a buck, and has no respect or loyalty to it's customers or to the purpose of Bitcoin's entire point of existing.

Coinbase was initially a good on-ramp for dollar to bitcoin conversion, but now, it is probably doing more harm than good. Even if Coinbase has accelerated the price of Bitcoin by making it easier for people to ""invest"", at what cost?

dxpv4q6,pwuille,61,"Bulletproofs is a general technology to implement zero-knowledge proofs.

Bitcoin does not use zero-knowledge proofs. There is no way you can just ""plug in"" Bulletproofs anywhere in Bitcoin.

Perhaps you are talking about confidential transactions (CT). This is a technique to permit a public ledger that makes the amounts hidden while still permitting everyone to verify the balances adds up. If that sounds like magic, that's because it is.

CT rely on zero-knowledge proofs. They could use Bulletproofs. They could also use other types of zero-knowledge proofs (there are several, zk-SNARKS is the well known, each with their own trade-offs). Certainly the invention of Bulletproofs made CT more accessible.

However... CT is still very different from how Bitcoin works right now. There is no obvious way to integrate them. My best hope would be using something like an extension block, where you can have coins on the ""legacy"" side or coins on the confidential side - with explicit operations to move them between the two.

However, that is far from simple, and AFAIK nobody is really working on it. Much as I love this technique and would be very excited to see it in Bitcoin, it's unrealistic to think that it will be usable anytime soon there.

Hvis de mot all formodning skulle klare å få gjennom en reguleringsplan vil de fortsatt måtte forholde seg til kommunale og statlige regler. Kommunen kan stenge hele anlegget hvis to campingvogner står for nær hverandre, de kan stenge serveringssteder dersom det er for møkkete, de kan ilegge eiendomsskatt, de kan nekte seksjonering av eiendom osv. Hvis prosjektet velger å ignorere myndighetene blir de kastet ut, følger de kommunen blir det ikke libertariansk. 

Det er ingen mulighet for at kommunen vil tillate 2000 nye boliger i et LNF-område innen kommunevalget, så noe håp om å overta flertallet i kommunen er bare å glemme. Den blir slått sammen med Mandal og Lindesnes snart, så det blir ikke enklere i framtiden.

De får ikke seksjonert ut eiendommene, så «investorene» vil ikke ha noen reel eiendomsrett til parsellene. Nå hele prosjektet er basert på privat eiendomsrett og det ikke finnes muligheter for å beskytte seg mot svindel kan dette bli et problem. Mange av tomtene ble tilsynelatende solgt for Bitcoin i vinter, så det spørs vel om det er så mye å svindle.

Imagine the dominant bitcoin had 32mb blocks with a fleshed out scaling plan including successful testing of GB+ blocks , support by every major crypto business, project, and service, guaranteed sub-cent fees and a more the merrier growth strategy for true global adoption.

Now imagine some upstart devs forked off and reduced block size to 1mb, heavily restricting transactional capacity to create a fluctuating fee market intended to produce long term fees in excess of $100+ driving users to a second layer system of fee taking government regulated financial intermediaries they call “hubs”.

Would this new high fee coin see any traction whatsoever?

It needs to be understood that the current BTC price is the result of incumbency, not merit. Any suggestion that the market could never come to the realisation that the Blockstream/Core redesign of bitcoin was a mistake is pure cult ideology.

BCH is gaining against BTC for very sound fundamental reasons, rational traders need to position themselves to ideally profit or at minimum protect their holdings in the event of a switch.

Remember that they share miners and unlike BCH, BTC lacks any facility to survive a significant loss of hashrate. If BCH continues its strong push toward price parity then the miners will jump ship and the BTC chain will genuinely cease to function, dropping its worth to $0.

Definitely not scam coin BCH. Fucking marketing coin. Essentially it's the same thing as Bitconnect in a better costume. So sad to see people fall for his bullshit. 


I mean honestly, if you're looking at the top20, which coin do you objectively look at last, for good reason? BCH. They have nothing remotely to offer. 


They're no decentralized, and essentially Bitmain cash. Probably the only reason other BTC pools didn't 51% attack Bcash yet, because Bitmain protection. 


So they're not decentralized, but have cheaper transactions than Bitcoin! That's a plus! Except, it isn't. Many coins in the sphere have much cheaper and faster transactions than BCH offers. 



So they're not decentralized, they're not the cheapest nor the fastest, and the personalities that market the coin are absolute scumbags and sometimes even straight con-artists, when you see people like fake Satoshi. 



____ 



It's also just super funny how the coin just cannot stand on its own merit. If some good news comes out for LTC, IOTA, whatever, they cherish it. They like the positive news and appreciate growth. If BCH is in the news, the topic of discussion immediately reverts back to how shit real Bitcoin is. They just cannot stand on their own merit. That's also a reason they hijjack all the infrastructure of Bitcoin. 



When you want to discuss BCH, the discussion *always* end vile. People are so super angry when it comes to their beloved Bcash. 



Fucking worse than Tether. 9.5 billion invested into a straight up scam. Congratulations Crypto. Hope to see the Litecoin/BCH flippening soon, so this pathetic coin finally comes crashing down. 



Finally: http://flappening.watch/ , taken from Charlie's Tweet. 


Clearly you can see stuff. For some reason Litecoin seems way more liquid than Bcash, despite Bcash almost having double the marketcap. I wonder whether that's got something to do with the fact that nobody uses Bcash whatsoever, because it's a pump and dump held by a few, waiting for an opportunity to sell off their bags? ( Yes, that's how it works )



Sell that shit. Buy *anything* else with your Crypto, but sell the Bcash scam. Get Nano, IOTA, ADA if you're into innovation. If you want cheap transactions/fast get Litecoin, Ripple, many options.

We know of additional selling from certain ICOs, and while some of this will continue, a large amount was completed.  There was also additional selling as Gox coins were converted to fiat as required by the court.  Shouldn't see more of that until September.

The price climb makes perfect sense in the context of seller exhaustion.  The idea that there isn't buying interest in Bitcoin is hilarious.  There is more interest in building a position in Bitcoin than ever before.  There has and will continue to be steady buying, enough to support prices well above the previous all time high.  Acute selling can push the price lower, but in the abscence of acute selling the price naturally drifts higher.

However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

dxs4xs7,DynamicMiffo,56,"It's undervalued. That simple. 

The coin offers many technical improvements compared to the original Bitcoin. It has assimilated the best features from both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and it offers real zkSNARKs shielded transactions for privacy. 

This is completely unique for a bitcoin branded product. Not even the big ""privacy"" coins that are actively in use on the net (Monero, Verge, etc) offers true privacy like this, and proof exist that their privacy is compromised. 

There are other zkSNARKs currencies, but they are small. Bitcoin Private has 20 403 830 coins in circulation. Multiply this with the current BTCP price, and you see *why* it has a higher value than the other zkSNARKs currencies. 

And then compare it with Bitcoin Cash, which by all means is an *inferior* coin from a technical point of view (and also *dysfunctional*, with its infrequent and irregular block generation). Bitcoin Cash has gone from a 15 billion to 21 billion market cap in just a few days. If you apply BTCP's coin base to BCH's market cap ($21 050 075 851 / 20 403 830), and you will see that it would mean a BTCP price of $1032. And BTCP is technically superior, which should really warrant an even higher price.

There is no such thing as real bitcoin. The people decide individually. In case of bcash it has less value than bitcoin (core) but it is much more than zero so some people are fine with that vision which means to them bitcoin cash isn't a worthless knockoff but simply another version (in their eyes, more close to the idea of white paper and therefore more valid).

Don't get me wrong, Roger Ver is batshit crazy but if he believes bitcoin cash is real bitcoin and it is worth more than 0 and some people agree then they are technically not wrong. People who say btc is real bitcoin are also not wrong. This is what permissionlessness is.

Back from my temp ban. Note to anyone don't get baited into insulting anyone. Not really worth the ban especially if you enjoy the subreddit. 

That being said I do see major value in Heroic map 1 Train. It is NV map choice but overall I think heroic is the stronger team on it. They played a few months ago when NV was in way worse form so I don't think they will stomp them by any means but I can see them winning. Heroic have been doing everything to prove they are good without Jugi and I can see them wanting to end the season with a couple clean wins over another bottom of EPL team. NV still hasn't figured out their CT side and Heroic has quick explosive offense with 5 rifles. I see that being a big issue if Happy is struggling with the awp as usual. Scream has been basically useless. The days of running out mid train and one tapping everyone is over. The Meta has changed and I don't see him being that much of an impact. Heroic has a much safer CT side on train and overall I think they are a much better team than they performed this season. It's hard to rebound when you are swapping the awp around but snappi seems decent with it. Let's go with the Danes.

dy1iu73,gabrielcro23699,706,"A lot of people are mentioning businesses, but that's usually for low-level, small time crime. Let's say someone makes $100k, but also makes $50k illegally somehow on top of that (maybe selling something illegal on the side), this is common with EU truckers for example, who often smuggle cigarettes on top of their normal stuff across borders. Now this $50k is 100% illegal income, they can't really pay taxes on it otherwise the government might ask questions (how did you make $150k when every other trucker made $100k?). You can't really spend the $50k, because again, the government can be like (you made $100k, how did you spend $150k last year?). So some of them open up mostly sham businesses that they don't care about, like a small coffeeshop, and then claim it makes $50k when in reality it makes way less. A single coffee shop making $50k is completely reasonable and nobody will ask questions. Boom, now this truck driver can use his illegal money.

However, for wealthy, more impactful people, it's different. Somebody worth millions of dollars, suddenly opening up chains of businesses and ensuring each one of them lie about their income is a nearly impossible thing to pull off, especially in the EU. So, one way wealthy people money laundering is through 'fake' purchases that don't raise suspicion. Let's say I'm selling you $5m worth of illegal goods. You can't give me that money in cash as a gift, otherwise I'd have the same problem as the trucker earlier. So I sell you something else. Like a stupid fucking painting that's worth nearly nothing. And you buy it. Boom, you get your goods, I get my money, and the stupid fucking painting was the middleman to make it a legal transfer of money. You can replace the painting with anything, even businesses or houses or whatever. (I'll sell you the title of this shitty, crumbling business for $5m).

&gt;That said, there are limits to this kind of heuristic. If there's any point in the blockchain's history where less than &gt;some portion p of validators are online, and you can get your hands on old private keys for q &gt; p of coins active &gt;then, then you can create a new history that appears to outperform the original.

Notice the assumption since Praos is forward security, old private keys do not exist. As for the threshold p, this is a reasonable tradeoff as we are assuming convergence to a network structure like bitcoin with a collection of reliable stake pools. Falling below this threshold would be an unlikely and detectable event that could resolved out of band. 

In practice for the forward security part, there are numerous methods to enforce this, but the best is likely using trusted hardware to generate and destroy the signing keys. You could sign twice (once with the slot leader key and once with the TPM key) and gain external assurance that the keys no longer exist.

There are other methods, but this seems to be the most pragmatic, accessible and direct way of resolving key destruction. It's important to point out- as your community with likely misinterpret my above statement- that Ouroboros does not require trusted hardware to be secure. It's an optimizing example for a practical implementation of the protocol.

We're not in a commercial real estate bubble. **Fucking tag me.** The commercial real estate market has been running hot in '17, was weak in '16, and took a while to recover from '08.

Request is a network, so it's not really what the dev team does but moreso what the community does. As of now there's also only Eth allowed for the network. I do believe there's been coding for both bitcoin oracle and ERC-20 tokens both being worked on. That is the true main door opener for REQ to be live and working. Then once that's working it's entirely up to the community and devs to make the project explode. 

Similarly there's been A LOT of news regarding the programs being ran on it. Chango, Donaid and quite a few others. 

REQ is a network, networks take time. Their partnership with DAO and kyber will be massive as well if everything goes according to my speculation.  

Just makes me sad to see someone make a post without even doing a minute worth of research about what's being developed on REQ. Price doesn't matter at all for REQ at the current moment. If you want to make money short term invest into TRON, EOS, or any random moonshot shill coin. If you're fine holding for any time longer then a month that's where network coins come into play. REQ, NEO, ICON, AION etc are all the future if they continue to adopt useable usecases. 

But to tl;dr this, REQ still doesn't have much to show for the development. But, the groundwork is there.

dy3xtu5,JuanaLaLoca,145,"The FUD does make a lot of sense at first glance but the more you look into it, the more you go further into the rabbit hole, the design decisions start to make a lot of sense. Specifically:    
&gt;EOS will be extremely centralised. 21 nodes is a paltry sum. Non-full-nodes will not have any way to do lightweight verification, thus multiplying its degree of centralisation.    

It is actually 121 full nodes, 21 of which mine blocks. Non full nodes can verify unless public key cryptography is broken(still going strong as of now(the nodes don't get your private keys, so it is still auditable and merkle tree is easily verifiable). There is still a risk of 2/3 bps colluding to either censor or do something else untoward. If they do, token holders get to kick them out via elections that occur every couple of seconds or so.
&gt;On top of all of this, the 21 full nodes will be delegates, which are voted in. By necessity, this turns consensus into a political process instead of an automated one. One of the practical effects of this is that the delegate nodes will be known/trusted third parties.    

I think you are right about this but keep in mind the system still works if 1/3 bps are trustable. So yes we do have trusted 3rd party BUT the trusted 3rd party does have a huge financial disincentive to screw you over. Contrast this to ethereum or bitcoin where if the 5 or so biggest mining pools get together, they control the network outright, the person with the most hashrate then is a trusted 3rd party? Eos has had to modify satoshi's vision in order to achieve scalability, and eos is not perfect, the richest people in the world could buy all the tokens and control the network. The holy grail I think would be dpos + identity to enable a crypto democracy as opposed to a crypto oligarchy.

dy5lb2w,edoera,97,"Hi /u/MemoryDealers - As a developer, I want to point out that you missed one extremely important aspect of Bitcoin whose weight will be 5 (or even more) according to your measure.

And that is ""developer friendliness"" (or ""programmable money""). I've been watching what memo.cash has been doing and how supportive the community was towards the developers. And when I say ""community"", it's not just Reddit, but basically the core philosophy of the BCH chain itself in every way is very developer friendly. As a developer I think this is one huge difference that will trump everything else.

Today when you think about building something on top of BTC, you can just forget about doing anything on-chain, but the only way you will get attention is by working on virtue-signaling ""LApps"", and as a developer that's not something I want to build on top of. When you build apps on the lightning network, it feels like you're building on top of Twitter API (except that it's Lightning labs and Blockstream instead of Twitter, inc.) because no matter how they sell it, the future of lightning network is dependent on those two companies (or some centralized companies like coinbase or square taking over as a ""hub"")

But BCH, with its low transaction fee and upcoming OP code expansion, everything changes, not just technically but also because we know exactly where the blockchain is headed. And that determinism is very important to developers because we look at what has happened to all the projects that tried to innovate on top of BTC, worked on the projects for couple of years to several years, and then became obsolete just because they couldn't get a permission from the ""core developers"".",2018-04-29 18:00:50

While we often here things like, ""It's easy to get listed, just contact them, ABC coin got listed on XYZ and they are half the volume of ARK"". Let me explain why this is misleading. 

Cryptocurrency exchanges have become vastly successful extortionists in the past two years. When I first started in this industry, exchanges were clamoring to add any new token that had even a mildly successful funding round because they wanted volume and they wanted to bring in those communities of followers to their platform. 

That is not the case anymore. 

The industry has become a system where exchanges hold all of the power and can essentially make whatever demands they want in order to list your token. The reason for this is simple. **People keep giving too much money to shit ICO's** with no idea, no intention of building real projects, who can afford to throw whatever they want at an exchange to get listed and call that progress. Unfortunately, users are willing to accept that as progress as long as their coin pumps and they can sell, at which point they move on and don't care what happens next. 

So what does this do for the rest of us? It drastically inflates the expectation of the exchange on what they can ask in return for a new listing and creates unrealistic price tags for companies like ARK who actually want to continue development for the next 20 years and build something that changes the world. 

""But the exchange did a public poll and ARK won so they have to add us now"". Also misleading. What happens after the public poll is that the exchange reaches out and makes their demands on the team. The team can either meet those demands and get listed in a few weeks to a month, or the team can refuse those demands for the extortion they are, and get put on the back burner to paying customers (other tokens) and get the ""we are working on it and will add it soon"" response. 

Now you are probably thinking, just pay the $30k and get listed. Well, guess what? It's WAY more expensive than that. What most of you don't realize is that the business model for most exchanges revolves around making money off of ICO's by charging to have their coin added, not off of fees charged to users. **Some major exchanges charge $1+ million to get listed. Per token.** You read that right, OVER A MILLION dollars for a listing. 

We recently reached out to an exchange somewhere in the mid 20s in total volume. On average, the top altcoins on that exchange get anywhere from $10,000 to $750,000 USD daily volume. $750k being a major top 5 token like Litecoin, $10k being your average run of the mill altcoin no one has heard of. Average tokens around ARK's level of market cap and volume on the major exchanges saw around $200k USD per day on good days. The exchange wanted around $150,000 USD in Bitcoin and an equally large amount of ARK/ETH for promotion after being added. 

This requires Travis and our team to then negotiate like crazy and try to form some kind of deal that makes sense for us. That typically requires our demonstrating volume, growth, potential future growth, etc, until we get on the same page which something that we think is reasonable for the additional options and liquidity that it might bring (which in the case of most exchanges is rather small). Sometimes this works out and we reach a consensus and get listed, other times they won't budge or just simply want too much and we can't close the deal. 

----------------------------------------

All of the above is to say, getting listed on exchanges isn't as easy, or as cheap as you might think. We are constantly in contact with at least 2-3 exchanges and trying to work out terms that make sense and bring added value to the ARK community while being responsible with our development funds. I hope everyone can understand that there are a lot of factors that go into all of these business decisions and we are always doing our best to weigh the pros &amp; cons and do the right thing by you guys. Hopefully all of that gives you a little more incite from our end and helps you understand some of the daily issues we face that don't always get publicized. ",2018-04-29 05:59:41

dy4infn,Espret,62,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

Other possible reasons may have been the largely unexpected survival of Bitcoin Cash, the loss of many key SW2X backers (perhaps because of the intense pressure from the Core crowd), and the realization that the SW2X fork made no technical or political sense.  Namely, it was unacceptable to both the small-blockian camp (because it increased the block size) and to the big-blockian camp (because it included the SegWit crock and would not remove the congestion of the network).",2018-04-29 05:14:06

dy6y74z,Kay_McE,1195,"**PART III**


Why? Why did they go through all this effort? Why did they pick me? Out of all the people in this world, why did they pick *me*?


Then, as my brain ran through its mantra again, it hit me. 


I didn't know anyone. 


I lived alone. I worked at a gas station. I had no family, no friends. I was gone for two years, and I already knew. *No one had missed me.*


**You have seen a lot of things happen today, Alex. This leaves you with two choices.**


My heart sank even further, because I already had a feeling that one of my two choices was death. Death as an innocent bystander, all because I was a witness to something despicable, too valuable and dangerous to let live. 


With this kind of situation, though, would death be the better choice of the two options? Would I want to entangle myself in this sick game any further?


**Your first option is to walk out of this room and never speak of this again. You do not know where you are, you do not know who we are, and any confession to knowing of the people who have died here today would make you a primary suspect in their disappearances.**


**We believe you are intelligent enough to remain silent if given freedom. You will walk out, unharmed, and have a chance to rebuild your life as an invisible, exceptionally average person. You will resume your life as a nobody.**


I didn't think I could feel any more confused at this point. I thought for sure they'd want to kill me to keep me quiet, but it seemed like they knew me well. Damn right, I wouldn't say a word if they let me live and leave. 


**Your second option is to work for our show. We will pay you 50 Bitcoin annually, which is the equivalent of roughly $470,000 per year.**


What.


The.


Fuck.



No. 


No way. 


No.


**Your instinct may be to decline. Allow us to change your mind.**


**Had we not played the game today, all of those sick criminals would still walk the earth today. You would buy coffee from them, or ride next to them on the bus, or make friends with them online.**


**The world would have never known. Justice would have never been served. Vengeance would have never been dealt. The families watching would never have had closure.**


**You can be a force for good. You can be someone. You don't have to work for scraps and be treated like you don't exist.**


**You can help change the world.**


I... I didn't know how to feel. I didn't know what to do. This was all so, so fucked up, and I didn't know what to do. 


**We will open the door. If you want to leave, take the hallway to the right. If you want to stay, take the hallway to the left. Your call.**


There was a sharp burst of feedback from the speakers, and the distorted voice was gone. I now noticed that the webcams had all stopped blinking.


The door opened, but no one was there. Just me.


I thought about it for a moment. The idea of walking out of the right hallway, finding the exit, feeling the breeze on my face, walking to a store, and drinking a soda sounded lovely. So mundane. So normal. So...exceptionally average.


Stepping out of that dingy, now bloody, white room with those goddamn buzzing fluorescent lights and its hundreds of webcams, I turned left.",2018-04-30 11:12:07
dy71w64,Kay_McE,1014,"**PART IV (FINAL)**

Over the next few years, I saw and did a lot of things I now regret. 


I tried to justify it. I convinced myself that I was making the world a better place. That I was helping people make peace with their trauma, and helping criminals make peace, even if forcibly so, with their actions. 


The dark web is a vast alternate reality. A reality where unspeakable acts are the universal language, and bitcoin is the universal currency. 


The world governments know it's there. They all know. They just choose not to do anything about it. They can't help you.


If a government does manage to shut a website like ours down, another one just like it pops back up within a few days. People are always willing to pay good money for a good show. It's all about supply and demand.


The Retribution was definitely one of the top-grossing livestreams on the dark web for the larger part of a decade. Finally, the CIA took it down, but the show resurfaced under a different name. 


But that's why I'm here, writing this about all of this to you. People don't know what's out there, and the media outlets on the surface web don't talk about it. You have to dig for it, and download special browsers for it, and set up VPNs for it, and be prepared to completely flood your computer with viruses for it. You have to want to find it.


These people, the ones who run the show, convinced me through years of isolation and trauma that *they were the good guys.* That I could be a good guy, too.


In reality, they are the worst kind of monsters. The kind that believe they're doing the right thing. The kind you can't reason with. 



I am not one of those monsters. I know I have done things that deserve a life of punishment, but I'm not one of them. At least I know I'm wrong.


So the best I can do is warn you.


I know you're probably never going to get this letter. I'm sure your P.O. Box has changed by now. But I had to try to warn you. 


If, by some chance, you *do* get this letter, run. Run as far away as you can, away from the city. Run away from Wi-Fi, cell service, everything. Lay low. Please, get away from everything and hide. 


You have been selected for an upcoming episode of The Confession Booth. 



What you did... It was bad. And, if I'm being honest with myself, it was pretty hard to send you this warning, this heads-up, because I'm actually disgusted with you. I'm horrified that I'm related to you, but at the same time, it makes sense. It makes sense that a sickness of the mind would run in our family. 



In the end, I had to warn you, because you are my father. I know we never got along. I know we haven't talked in years. I know you've always hated me. You're still my father.



I'll never forgive you, not after what you've done, but if they select me for the job, if I have to be the one to bring you on the show... I'll never forgive myself. And I can't live with that. 



I know what you did. They will give you no mercy. And I won't be able to help you. 


I will probably be the one to kill you.


Please run. 


Love, 






Your Son, Alex

I will try and help you as a fellow investor as to why it is one of the most solid long term investment choices in entire crypto space right now.

There are a lot of interesting facts you may not even know, e.g. the chain being as old almost as BTCs? some argue even older. Who is David and the role Jed played later formed Stellar. 

Start with: https://ripple.com/insights/ (A lot of great useful information and short videos)

Recent TD;LR articles for investors: https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/7-facts-you-didnt-know-about-ripple.aspx

Now I will summarise a few things for you as an investor.

Ripple basically works in payment settlements, the coin or Token XRP, 60% of it is held by Ripple, a centralised company. Only 40% is in circulation, rest locked up in escrow where 1 billion is released to ripple every month for private sales and some portions to sell public for funding the company and XRP further. 

Ripple has a few products, but XVia and XRapid use XRP, the fastest token on their ledger, whether crypto to crypto or fiat to fiat, or crypto, fiat. XRP on ILP will settle them the fastest. ILP so highly regarded in the industry right now that there are currently leaks of very big players also implementing it, although the settlement can use anything, even if XRP is the fastest. 

Products like XRapid source the XRP required via Market makers and then also on public exchanges(compatible ones, a lot being added). They always will settle on ASK meaning constant volume will keep the price steady if not in most cases driving it up. 

XRP basically is the liquidity solution, and we as investors hold it to sell on exchanges not just to others, but eventually to institutions that Xrapid and other products to come will be sourcing from. 

XRP is open source, and a proper crypto contrary to what anyone else says. It is getting COBALT update to do all transactions in 1 sec, has the highest TPS that matches VISA and will go beyond soon after COBALT. 

XRP needs just 17 more nodes to be more decentralised over BTC and ETH both. 

XRP will survive even if Ripple the company dissolves. 

All holders like founders are in contract and cant dump more than a certain amount a week, making sure value stays healthy. After all Payment solutions like Mercury FX just posted successful Pilot, Western Union, Money gram and others are still piloting. This is real adoption, not hype, not pump and dump. real companies doing real testing for something real to eventually happen, like production use. 

Ripple is currently targeting different usecases for XRP with payment providers and Banks are still the ultimate game, but since they don't just hype or do anything to pump xrp, they literally have 100s of bank partners that eventually might/might/might ask to trial XRP once the payment providers rake in the savings and show them it is legit. 

Ripple also wants regulations as their token is fully regulations compliant. They have an actual team of board members, directors, CEO, devs, architects, network engineers - you name it. Big big names they have poached.

Above makes it a very serious and legit project backed by a proper silicon valley firm with very experienced people from various industries that were poached. They don't even announce much, and silently just keep working and are partnered with some very big names, speculation of-course but eventually may be disclosed. Here is a list of current central banks, payment providers and other LIVE XRP using partners: http://rppl.info/ 

XRP will and can not be created on the go by Ripple, all FUD. 100 billion is all that will exist, and every transaction also burns it. There is no inflation. There are no dumps, Ripple execs are the biggest bag hodlers if anything and so they also want it to work, while banks and other make money on savings, yes they will get rich too but can only sell so much every now and then. And us investors will get some little profits too. Thats better to me and more legit than anything out there, although I still hold Eth for its own usecase and to use it for payments once in a while.

dy6iqlq,Abell68,42,Pay with bitcoin? Isnt it bitcoin cash? Seems like u try to piggy back on btc name. Pretty misleading because people think you mean bitcoin but get forwarded to a different coin bitcoin cash. This only pisses people off and drives them away. ,2018-04-30 06:11:13

dy7oe0s,LouisOfTokyo,36,"I'm not sure exactly how it works with these bitFlyer terminals, but the actual bitcoin transaction is wrapped up behind the scenes, so I don't think it would be possible to double spend. With these terminals the merchant accepts 0-conf because I imagine that bitFlyer is taking that risk on itself.",2018-04-30 23:22:48
dy7mqcl,heffer2k,35,"Hi Ryan. I’m a software engineer of over 25 years (most of those in C++). I can write beautiful code, although plenty of time I write garbage. I can smell my own shit though and this does thus qualify me to pass judgement. Regardless, it is not the code itself that is garbage (I have not even looked at the code), but rather the *design* of segwit given the goals to be achieved. We could talk for a long time about contentious soft forks, the community split, 4mb weighted blocks, tx malleability, scaling etc etc etc. But there is no doubt in my mind that the design taken by core, was disastrous on so many fronts, and for all the wrong reasons. Please don’t think this is just about some lines of code. At very least, consider the man hours still being expended on this whole “war”, consider the wider effect of the split and the censorship etc, consider who the stewards of Bitcoin were, and imagine it all could have been avoided with an extremely simple 4mb hard fork about 2 years ago. That can at least be held in mind before one starts debating the merits of segwit.",2018-04-30 22:53:02

dy7kxlw,LouisOfTokyo,33,"I tried for a while to find the transaction ID so I could look up everything but I couldn't. But because I was annoyed that I couldn't pay using bitcoin myself due to mine being in cold storage, that night I transferred some to a hot wallet for future use, and the default fee of 3.4 sat/byte (~7 cents) got it in the next block 2 minutes later. So assuming bitFlyer's fee estimation is up to scratch, probably around that.",2018-04-30 22:18:51
