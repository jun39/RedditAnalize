e566wok,life_is_cheap,98,"Sound like OP left out some crucial details in his story. When he initially gets questioned by the bank about where his money is coming from why does he feel the need to lie instead of just tell them he was bitcoin trading? He said he told the teller it's for renovations or something. He must have known he'd done something illegal, which according to the comments below was possibly not paying tax on the capital gains. But OP didn't mention that in his post. 

Looking at this point A to point B; The bank question OP about where his money is coming from. Instead of telling the truth he tells them lies. They decide to start investigating him and thus confiscate (freeze?) the funds in his account. OP potentially was not paying tax on his bitcoin profits and knew that not only would he not get his 13k in savings back but he'd probably owe up to 50k in back taxes to the ATO after being investigated. Conclusion: OP wants to suicide because he'll be charged with tax evasion and end up owing possibly over 50k to the ATO. I believe this is a common scenario in the US involving the IRS and business men caught evading taxes. ",2018-09-01 03:50:10

&gt; I do not know why there were two conferences.

&gt;  perhaps there is some other explanation

Disinformation. Lies and propaganda.

&gt; Dr. Wright suddenly decided to leave the conference, exclaiming ""Lies and Bullshit!""

&gt; although other nChain representatives denied that the ABC answer was ""bullshit""

Apparently nobody can back up Craig's bullshit claims.

&gt; When pushed, nChain was unable to give objections to OP_CHECKDATASIG, stating that they had not investigated it enough or that the people who could explain were not present.  

Because Craig is the only one with objections and they cannot be logically explained.

&gt; Canonical transaction ordering (CTOR) was treated in a similar manner, with only the briefest explanation of objections given (that it involves Merkel insertion rather than appends) and no further discussion took place.

Kind of worrying as there are actual arguments against it.

Looking forward to a split then. Is Bitcoin Unlimited the only ones who actually work towards a compromise, which everyone seems to want?

e57o2z7,mummouth,28,"&gt; Surely whatever the future brings, it will bring UNTOLD supercomputing power. Computers are already that much better at cryptographic problem-solving, thanks to Bitcoin itself.

Future quantum computers will be able to derive private keys from public keys using [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm). Classical computers will never be able to do so, because, no matter how sophisticated they get, they run on atoms, and there are not enough atoms in the world (or even the solar system) to build a classical computer large enough.

&gt; SHA256 hash may be high-grade for its time

It's more than that. The standards that are set by NIST take your considerations into account. They are designed to be future-proof. It would be bad practice to use a cryptographic primitive 10 times too hard for the best supercomputer to break; that would simply be broken by the best supercomputer 4 years down the line, or a laptop after 15 years. So they make them many, many orders of magnitude too hard to solve.

&gt; but am I correct in saying that all you need to beat it is more raw computing power? A large amount, but... no higher degree of complexity. Just power and time.

Hashing is a different cryptographic primitive from dual-key cryptography. You can't unhash hashes, even with a quantum computer. You are correct in saying it is just a matter of enough time and power, but remember that there is only so much time and power in the observable universe. There are about 10^80 [atoms in the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Matter_content). Between spin of quarks, momentum of electrons, etc., each atom has around 10^2 bits of information, so there are around 10^82 bits of information in the universe. From the Big Bang to the heat death of the universe is only about 10^18 seconds, so you're on about 10^100 operations over the lifetime of the universe. There is simply not enough time and information around to compute [certain mathematical problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number), like [cryptographic standards](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1x50xl/time_and_energy_required_to_bruteforce_a_aes256/).

&gt; It does seem implausible, but presumably anybody who accomplished this task would end bitcoin and destroy a 100 billion dollar market. 

Yes, but first they'd have to destroy the observable universe to turn it into a computer, which is a bigger problem.

&gt; Presumably Satoshi knows precisely how the hashing function works. 

It's open knowledge. Everyone knows how SHA-256 works.

&gt; Wouldn't that help him to reverse engineer keys? If not, why not?

No, because https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle

e591tna,TrueButNotProvable,84,"Let's see. The show ended in 2006, so 12 years would have passed since then.

(I didn't think it was going to become this long, but I was having so much fun I almost kind of want to develop this into a script or fanfic. Would anyone be interested in that?)

**Malcolm**: By now, he *probably* would have gone through university -- it's possible he's still working on his PhD, but my guess is he wouldn't take very long with that. I'd like to think that he somehow tried to work his way to being president like Lois says, although that's a bit odd, since his interest is more in science than in politics. However, as a compromise, perhaps he's working his way up the ladder to be a science advisor for some government agency.

**Reese**: Here's an idea. It's a little silly, but hear me out. 

Reese works as a janitor for a while, but works on his cooking skills in his spare time. One day, he decides to apply to compete in Hell's Kitchen with Gordon Ramsay. The producers see his tape and let him on, because they're sure his aggressive nature will cause lots of drama which will make for an entertaining show. Gordon notices Reese's rebellious nature, and tries to break his spirit. But Reese is so used to having criticism yelled at him -- from years of living with Lois, to working in the meat plant, not to mention being in the military -- that he just shrugs it off. Eventually, Reese wins the competition and becomes a famous chef, winning Gordon's begrudging respect along the way.

**Francis**: Francis is still working for the same business he was working for when he graduated, and has worked his way up through middle management. He and Piama have two kids and they live in a nice house in the suburbs. However, whenever Lois calls or visits, he still pretends he's a free-spirited burnout and tries to hide his success.

**Dewey**: He's worked his way through Juilliard studying piano performance, and works as an accompanying pianist on Broadway. However, I think he'll get disillusioned by the glitz and glamour, and he'll eventually take his fortune and use it to fund music education programs for underprivileged children as well as special needs children.

**Jamie**: We don't know much about Jamie or the new baby. I suspect Jamie will look up to Dewey in the way that Malcolm and Reese look up to Francis, but in a more positive way (i.e. he'll see Dewey as a role model).

**Lois**: Lois begins to go through menopause. Hal is about to console her about the inevitability of aging, only to find out that she's ecstatic about it -- it means they can have all the sex they want, and not have to worry about having any more kids. (Sure, menopause comes with its own inconveniences. But compared to giving birth to, and raising, all of her kids, it'll be a walk in the park for her.)

The only kids left in the house are Jamie and the new kid from the last episode. But they're old enough to take care of themselves most of the time, and they're not nearly as much of a handful as (say) Reese or Francis. So, Lois finally has the time to be a manager at Lucky Aide.

**Hal**: This is another silly one, but hear me out.

Sometime in 2012, one of Hal's poker buddies mentions some new thing called ""Bitcoin"". Everyone at the poker table agrees that you'd have to be a complete idiot to invest in something so risky. Hal agrees with them at the poker table, but being the impulsive risk-taker he is, he secretly goes to the internet later that night and finds out how to invest in Bitcoin. He presses the wrong button and accidentally invests his and Lois's entire life savings (only a few hundred dollars).

Hal has trouble figuring out how to get his money back, but his employers see him stressing out at the computer constantly checking the price of Bitcoin. They assume he must be working hard, and start giving him raises and promotions. Hal notices this, pretends to work even harder, and eventually refills their savings account so Lois never notices anything was wrong.

When Bitcoin eventually skyrockets in price, Hal finally enlists Malcolm's help in figuring out how to get the money -- which Malcolm does, for a percentage of the cut. Now Lois and Hal suddenly have hundreds of thousands of dollars on their hands, which they use to fix up the house. The neighbours become suspicious and tell the police that they suspect Hal of being the meth kingpin ""Heisenberg"", who Hal has an unfortunate and coincidental resemblance to.

**Craig**: Now I'm having too much fun putting a story together. Let's see if I can merge this with Lois's and Reese's stories.

Craig continues to work at Lucky Aide even after Lois becomes manager -- in fact, he gets a secret perverse thrill out of her being dominant and ordering him around.

When Reese competes in Hell's Kitchen, Craig cheers him on, being the supportive roommate that he is. When Reese decides to start a restaurant, he asks Craig to be his business partner -- after all, Craig supported him the whole time, and Craig does have management experience from Lucky Aide.

Craig gives a tearful goodbye to Lois (Lois tells Craig that she's busy right now, and if he wants to quit to start a restaurant with Reese, he should do it. Plus, if he's going to be working with Reese, obviously she'll still see him around.)

Craig is a bit dejected to know that he won't be able to spend as much time with Lois. Soon enough, Reese introduces him to the accountant they've hired as a contractor for the restaurant. She has a commanding presence, tells Craig exactly what he needs to do, and looks and acts a lot like Lois. Craig immediately falls in love, and he works up the nerve to ask her out. She says, sure, what the heck.

**Stevie**: Stevie gets wealthy working in quantitative finance, and uses his wealthy to start a venture capital firm investing in technology. He's achieved a reputation as ""Elon Musk on wheels"". He and Malcolm still call each other regularly. Malcolm is secretly envious of Stevie's financial success, but he also knows it's good to have powerful friends in industry.

e57xrql,MobTwo,84,"For any Bitcoin Cash supporters reading this, take a moment and think critically.

Even if you're a blind Craig supporter, I hope there is some sense left in you to think for a moment. Is it more likely that the problem lies on a single person or the entire BCH community?

If Craig wants to make BCH the global p2p money, I am all up for it. But if he wants to split/destroy the community and start smearing anyone who disagrees with him, then I simply cannot see myself aligned with such behaviors.

Even if Craig is part of Satoshi, such behaviors cannot and should not be tolerated. The value and strength of a cryptocurrency is dependent on the community behind it. You destroy the community and there is no value left. And more than anyone, Satoshi should know this.",2018-09-02 01:58:03

e58buqm,C00mbsie,75,"OK OP I think you misunderstand what market cap really tells you.  Saying this stuff makes crypto look bad, and is why people think that crypto  creates money out of ""thin air."" I can go find some no volume shit-coin which last traded at .01c and is sitting at 1m MC, and then put a buy order in for a couple coins at $100. If someone (probably out of a group of 2 people who actually own the coin) fills that buy order(why would they not), then the coin is all of the sudden 10000% up, and now the market cap is also x100 up. So now the market cap is 100m. Does that mean I created $100m worth of money? No. There is a couple 100 dollars in the coin, and that's all there is. Not a single damn person would be willing to buy at $100. Market cap is an extremely poor indication of how much money has been put in or can be taken out of a crypto asset that has low volume/liquidity. Even for Bitcoin it is estimated that each dollar put into BTC raises the MC by $25-$50. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think about some top 10 like Cardano. It's market cap is $2.8 billion. If everyone wanted to cash in their Cardano for USD, would all that Cardano become 2.8 billion? No because the volume of Cardano is only 68M. Not near enough volume to buy up 2.8B worth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whoever did this probably filled his own buy and sell orders just to mess around. If he did not, then the ""scammer"" probably lost a bunch of money. He bought the coin for 1600, and then sold it for 850 (You can tell because it is vertical lines, which means it was a single buy/sell order).  This is a non-issue.",2018-09-02 05:40:56
e59koxm,Der_Bergmann,69,"Bitcoin Unlimited performed excellently during the StressTest. 

With xthin, graphene and parval it employs the most advanced scaling technologies. Even old 32bit old laptop nodes have been able to keep up with blocks up to 12mb, while middle class systems did not even really notice the biggest blocks during the test.

The system performance is glorious. I don't know if BitcoinABC performed worse. A lot of them broke during the test, but it might be because they run on low-grade systems or VPS credits run out (1st of September!). 

It seems BitPrim was taken out nearly entirely. Only 2 of 32 nodes kept running.

The decrease of ABC nodes and the growth of BU nodes might be caused by political reasons. BU appears to be the only client which is focused on keeping the chain together and enabling the ecosystem to find a consens over hardfork changes, while other imps rather try to impose their consens on the ecosystem.

Running a BU client will be the only safe solution when the hardfork gets ugly, while ABC's course seems to be ""Hope that we will or go down with us."" With BU it is ""Try to push your will, but if you fail, follow the hashrate.""

e599a56,joecoin,42,"&gt; Bitcoin's main advantage is that it is relatively simple and robust with a 9 year track record, but lightning is not.

But that's the beauty of this. We are getting A scaling solution that does NOT change the base layer and thus does in no way threaten to break Bitcoin's nine year track record of stability but it does still work perfectly fine, evidently even in a real world scenario.

And it is only at its beginning and it is nothing that we cannot easily change and develop or replace if neccessary without messing with the Bitcoin protocol.

&gt;    **I'm not wrong that you cannot receive back more BTC than you put into the LN.**

&gt;Correct, you're not wrong. At the present time that is one of its many limitations.

&gt;    **Lightning Conductor doesn't seem like a working fix. If I open a store on the LN, do I have to continue to use some liquidity provider to continue accepting payments?**

&gt;Right now you have to manually rebalance your channels through some method, one of which is to use a swap provider (of which there are very few). When swap tech is finished, there will be ways to do it trustlessly, and someone will create a wallet that does it on the backend automatically. At that point, you'll no longer have to worry about rebalancing your channels. But right now we're in early days and a lot of stuff that ought to be automated (and can be) has to be done manually. There are lots of opportunities in this space where the user experience is poor to create a solution, get users, and help the community.

e5afenr,jtoomim,53,"While I agree that /u/deadalnix and co should have been providing benchmarks in support of their proposals, I've been working on doing that in their stead.

Yesterday we observed that on average, [37 of the 43 kB](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9c3wts/graphene_holds_up_better_than_xthin_during/e58k9wu/) per block in Graphene messages is order informataion that would be eliminated by CTOR. Now, 37 kB is not a lot at all, but it's still 86%, and as we scale it  eventually might grow to the point where it matters. I think this is the strongest reason for CTOR. Whether that CTOR is lexical or topological is a separate question.

Concerns have been raised that lexical orders would make block validation more difficult, most notably by Tom Zander and Awemany. I implemented a version of the outputs-then-inputs algorithm for topological block orders, and so far have found the [serial version is only 0.5% slower](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/244#issuecomment-417841637) than the standard topoological algorithm. My code has a much greater chance for parallelization, and I'm working on getting that done soon. Once parallelized, it's plausible that the parallel version may be 350% faster on a quad core machine than the standard algorithm, but this depends on what [Amdahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law) has to say on the matter. I think this shows the fear-mongering about the lexical ordering to be unjustified, and suggests that there will be some tangible benefits soon.",2018-09-03 07:29:00

I'll give him the best possible scenario which is that he bought $500 worth every week that it was above the current price, and $1000 for every week that it was under. Unrealistic and not the case but hey, makebelieve is the name of the game with him anyway.  
I'm using the historical snapshots from CMC.  
[This is months january-march](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(500%2F17131\)%2B\(500%2F14086\)%2B\(500%2F12326\)%2B\(500%2F11746\)%2B\(500%2F9087\)%2B\(500%2F8165\)%2B\(500%2F10854\)%2B\(500%2F9790\)%2B\(500%2F11280\)%2B\(500%2F8776\)%2B\(500%2F7720\)%2B\(500%2F8567\)). He spent $6k to get 0.5856 BTC.  
[Here's april-june](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(1000%2F6895\)%2B\(1000%2F6972\)%2B\(500%2F8096\)%2B\(500%2F8876\)%2B\(500%2F9404\)%2B\(500%2F9751\)%2B\(500%2F8495\)%2B\(500%2F8282\)%2B\(500%2F7328\)%2B\(500%2F7682\)%2B\(500%2F7312\)%2B\(1000%2F6565\)%2B\(1000%2F5982\)) where he spent 8.5k to get 1.1415 BTC.  
[Finally we got july &amp; august](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(1000%2F6377\)%2B\(1000%2F6831\)%2B\(1000%2F6296\)%2B\(500%2F7426\)%2B\(500%2F8206\)%2B\(1000%2F7012\)%2B\(1000%2F6330\)%2B\(1000%2F6400\)%2B\(1000%2F6681\)) where he spent 8k for 1.1968 BTC.  
So all in all we're looking at 2.9239 BTC for $22.5k which is an average of [$7695 per BTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(6000%2B8500%2B8000\)%2F\(0.5856%2B1.1415%2B1.1968\)). Sell that today and you're down $1257, not up $7000.

e5af1r0,cryptos4pz,30,"&gt;Was there any explanation of why we need 128 MB blocks right now?

I can't answer for Bangkok, but I can answer for myself as I support large blocks. A key thing big blockers tried to point out to small blockers when they asked why the rush to raise size before demand is that the protocol ossifies or becomes harder to change. This is a simple fact. Think of all the strong opinions on what block size should be for Bitcoin BTC. If there was no 1MB limit do you think Core would be able to gain 95% plus support for a fork to add it today? Not a chance! Whatever it was - 2, 8, none - they wouldn't be able to change it because the community is too large now. A huge multi-billion dollar ecosystem expects BTC to work a certain way. There were also prominent voices that want *smaller* than 1MB. So such a huge percentage of agreement is simply not possible. 

How did the 1MB cap get added then? Simple, the smaller the community the easier it is to do/change things. The limit was simply added. Any key players who might object hadn't shown up yet or formulated opinions on why resistance might be good.

The point is if you believe protocol ossification is a real thing, and I think I've clearly shown it is, then if you also believe Bitcoin ultimately needs a gigantic size limit or no limit to do anything significant in the world, then the smartest thing to do is **lock the guarantee into the protocol** as soon/early as possible, because otherwise you risk not being able to make the change later.

Personally I'm not convinced we haven't already reached a point of no further changes. Nobody has any solution to resolving the various different changes now on the table and nobody seems willing to back down or comprise. So does that make sense? It's not that we intend to fill up 128MB blocks today, its that we want to guarantee they at least are available later. Miners won't mine something the network isn't ready for as that makes no economic sense. Hope that helps. (Note: I'm not for contentious changes, though)",2018-09-03 07:22:37
e5bi3i4,tweq,30,"The ""Lightning Network"" is supposed to solve bitcoin's scaling problems by reducing the number of bitcoin transactions. Two parties commit a certain number of bitcoins to a ""channel"", and can freely move the those bitcoins back and forth within the channel without needing real bitcoin transactions for each move. Only the final balance between the two sides is settled on the blockchain, so you can theoretically reduce the stress on the bitcoin network if you reuse a channel for many transactions.

An obvious issue here (among many others) is that you cannot move funds that haven't already been committed to the channel. Once all funds are on your side of the channel, the other party can send no more through this channel until you send them back some first, and you can never receive more than the total amount committed by both sides. 

So if you open a channel with the gambling site, you commit the amount of bitcoin that you want to bet. But the gambling site probably doesn't commit any funds, because it doesn't know how much you'll win and cash out (if anything) and it couldn't possibly pre-commit the maximum amount of winnings to every single potential winner. So the most you can get out is the amount you put in (minus fees).

*In theory* LN is supposed to be a vast interconnected network of channels that can swap funds through multiple steps and balance each other out overall, but as with everything cryptocurrency-related this doesn't actually work and never will.",2018-09-03 22:56:52

Their shorts are liquidated, meaning that they are forced to buy bitcoins back ==&gt; buy bitcoin ==&gt; price increase ==&gt; more shorts are liquidated ==&gt; more bitcoins bought ==&gt; price increase ==&gt; etc.

A spectacular example is in April when a all time high in short positions on BTC occured at the same as a year low for the BTC price (around 6450-6500$) ==&gt; year low after a 66% decrease, a normal person would think ""maybe it's time to buy"", a greedy trader thinks ""let's push it down even further"". Because the market had already been pressured a lot and people started to buy at the lowest price of the year (at that moment), the price slightly increased up to 7000$ and then positions started being liquidated. Price boommed up to 8500$ and ended the day at 8000$. A memorable day for the hodlers.

e5detrd,SoyDaniel,68,"Bitcoin has had its first healthy move up in a very long time. As you can see in our other previous rallies of 2018, each rally has had several $1000 daily candles. Now we see a slow and steady climb up which more sustainable, continuously making higher lows and with each dip getting bought up quickly. The bulls are now approaching massive resistance, which I will go through below. 

1. 0.618 fib level. 
On our last two rallies, this is the Fibonacci retracement has been rejected from. We are now approaching this level again, a key resistance to key an eye on. 

2. Horizontal resistance. 
The region of $7500 on our last 2 rallies has had a lot of consolidation on both the move up and down, so we will see a horizontal resistance here. 

3. 200 EMA
The 200EMA is sitting on $7550 at the moment on the daily, which is going to add to the resistance. 

4. Triangle downwards resistance line 
This is a valid resistance that has been playing out for 9 months now. 

5. Rising wedge
On the 4h you can clearly see BTC in a rising wedge , which is a bearish pattern

6. 5th Elliott Wave
I have done an Elliott Wave count, and using the Fibonacci extension, the end of wave 5 has a valid target of $7500, before we get our correction. 

7. Volume is not great. 
For a real reversal I would have liked to see more volume, but I believe this low volume is because of indecision. Are we in disbelief? 

If we break though this trend line, we will ideally see a massive spike in volume.

If the bulls come together and break through the resistances, I believe we will have entered into a real reversal attempt here, if we cannot this was just another dead cat bounce. From a TA perspective I believe it will break down, but my heart is saying we are going to break through resistance, and at least short term we are going to see a nice move upwards. If we break down and hold $6,000 support again, from the triangle we should see a decision mid-September to start of November time. 

So to conclude, Bitcoin from a technical analysis perspective is looking very bearish and this is a great opportunity to go short. I will be laddering shorts from $7500 as from my trading plan I cannot yet this go, but I do have a strong feeling we will be breaking through this level.

There are two types of USD prices in Iran
1. official price = 4200 Toman
2. black market price = ~14000 Toman
 It was the last price when I write this post.
also 1 Toman equals 10 Rials

We (normal people in Iran) cannot buy USD with official price. We can only buy USD in the black market.

Also that chart is for ~2 days ago . (USD price was 12800 Toman on that day i think)

if i buy 1 BTC in Iran NOW,
i should pay upto 100,000,000 Toman !
for example if Bitcoin price is 7300 USD,
7300 √ó 14000 = 102,200,000 Toman !!!
That's very high !

We have big inflation in our economy (about 250% inflation!!!) That's why everything in my country is very expensive. USD price in Iran is going up everyday, and all iranian people are losing their purchasing power everyday...

Mining is now an officially recognized industry, as ""local production"" of bitcoin is considered a profitable business (no shit, IRR depreciated against USD about 30% within 3 days).

Central bank is moving into legalizing crypto trading and establishing guidelines until end of September, as local fiat is failing rapidly. People already are buying bitcoin and other cryptos in droves, this could prove to be a very lucrative business for the government, also will help with the coming sanctions. Iranians already bought billions USD worth of crypto (maybe with the government), but moving to legalize it will officially make it available to a country of 80 million and the Iranian diaspora (about 5 million) who are always looking for a way to send money back home and banking sanctions prevented them.

One original promise was freedom from government manipulation.  While maybe that's true, it's just been subject to different sorts of manipulation, and those manipulations have been more volatile and destructive.  Especially considering that some person or group can decide on technical changes to the platform that could have large effects on price.

The second selling point was the supposed instant transfer of funds for no cost anywhere in the world eliminating the need for all predatory banking transfer fees.  This turned out to just not be true.  Takes forever and it costs more than multiple apps you can use to transfer actual USD.

A third promise was a native online transaction platform that could be integrated into the retail and service economy.  While this kind of happened, due to the above problems it was never very practical.

The ledger function just isn't that valuable to the average person.  It might be valuable in the infrastructure of large organizations or governments, but almost nobody lists the need for a ""better ledger"" as a problem in their lives.

Satoshi put Bitcoin under the MIT license because that one was the most free.

Then Professor Technobabble starts rambling about how patents are good for Bitcoin?  How can his followers believe this bullshit? Do they know anything about the spirit behind the Free Open Source Software movement? 

CSW followers should watch [Revolution OS](https://youtu.be/jw8K460vx1c), and ask themselves if CSW his vision and vision of Satoshi are compatible. Because Bitcoin has primarily been build by people that understand the need for Free Open Source Software. 

The benefits Bitcoin can bring are those of more economic freedom. It's a tool for trade! One that is more suited for e-commerce then anything before. 

We build those tools free, so we can use them ourselves. And we allow other people to also use these tools  for free. Because if everybody starts using them, everybody benefits. 

Of course there is room for services build around Bitcoin, where you need to pay people for their work. But patents are simply incompatible with the new system we are trying to build.

&amp;#x200B;

So when I posted this some days ago I was laughed about it but the story goes, that we have reached over 200k BTC in their cold storage only two times. Those two times we crashed big. This was 3rd time we reached over 200k you see what has happened and still happening.  All would be good but Bitfinex cold storage is still increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple thoughts on that. Lets see why I think it is so significant. On a single day Bitcoin network handles bitcoin volume from 500k to 2M bitcoins. Usually on work days it stays about 1M. On weekends 500k or even lower. You make two transactions with Bitfinex cold storage you have all BTC network volume on one weekend. And remember bitfinex is not the biggest exchange there it is number 4. But I think it represents current mentality of crypto ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now Bitfinex cold storage balance is at 228k and rising every hour. People are getting ready for huge sell off. Maybe this information is not relevant for today or this week or week after but I think it is relevant for year 2018. There will be huge sell off no doubt in my mind and it is yet to come.",2018-09-06 15:00:48

Also, with the amount of 'diversity' of assets in the crypto space, I never really understood why all ETF proposals till now were exclusive for Bitcoin. It could make sense in 2013, it doesn't at all now. 

Especially with the narrative being pushed around that Bitcoin is an SoV. I would not invest in an ETF with an SoV, I'd rather buy gold for that.

e5iuzym,Logpile98,36,"Ok here's something I don't understand: why is the cost of mining considered the price floor for bitcoin? 


Let's say it costs $6000 to mine 1 BTC. If the price is 10k the miners are happy because they're able to make a profit (until they start buying more and more mining equipment, pushing up the electricity usage and thus the cost). But if people really leave BTC in droves and the selling pushes the price down to 5k, why would the price be expected to recover to 6k? 


I could see the argument that miners would withhold selling at a loss which would create artificial scarcity and pump the price up, but they can't operate at a loss forever. If the price is determined to stay at 5k for a long long time, miners would begin shutting down until the difficulty drops and now the remaining ones are able to mine for less than 4k.


But let's say the sentiment is REALLY bad, to the point where even diehard hodlers and early adopters are jumping ship, causing bitcoin to go absurdly crazy low, like 50 cents (I don't believe this would happen due to other reasons, we're talking just hypotheticals here). Why would mining cost prevent the price from going that low? It seems to me that if the market absolutely TANKS and is determined to stay down, there's nothing to stop miners from going bankrupt until the point where the only people mining are nerds using home PCs just for the fun of it.

Traders don't buy spot, and if they do it's gonna be at 5.9k in the near future not 7+. The retail investors that got into this to make money are all gone now. The HODLers are HODLing. The institutional investors aren't coming any time soon. There's no demand for Bitcoin. When there's no demand the price goes down!

Want the price to go up? There's really only a few things you can do (other than just directly dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the spot market). One, you can help make Bitcoin better. Help develop wallets that dumb people can use and not lose all their money. Y'all realize that this stuff is unusable for stupid people right? Stupid people have money too. The other way is to just encourage adoption in general. When you sell something only accept Bitcoin. Support businesses that support Bitcoin (not the ones that instasell once you buy their stuff with BTC). Accept BTC as a payment at your business and offer a discount.

The last thing you can do is wait. Wait for people to give up and sell and the price to *really* hit rock bottom (we aren't close BTW), wait until all your nocoiner friends are laughing in your face, wait until the guy whose never used a financial instrument in his life is asking you how to short BTC. That's when the traders and institutional investors are gonna start turning into buyers. That's when there will be tons and tons of new demand. And as the price starts going up and up the retail investors all pile back in and create even more demand and we blast off.

The thing about futures is there was no way for institutions to short BTC before it, so they pump BTC up before futures, short, then dump the market to cash in on their shorts.

What if people have just lied to you about this shaddy stuffy and you have heard these lies so much from so many loud voices that you started to believe them? 

Do you realize that one of our so called ""leaders"", Roger Ver, who in reality just primarily represents the businesses. (he is not a dev, so how can he lead the devs?) Do you realize this was the first person in the world to start investing in to Bitcoin and bitcoin related start ups? He was so passionate about the ideology behind Bitcoin that people started calling him Bitcoin Jesus. 

You know what his crime was, the reason they nailed Roger Ver to his cross?

He decided that he did not recognise the original Bitcoin he got passionate about in the current Bitcoin but that he did see it in Bitcoin Cash.  And so he simply said to himself. Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin use to be, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

And then he acted accordingly with his entire business, bitcoin.com. Which he build himself.  While the people that accuse him, what have they build? How have they contributed to the success of Bitcoin? 

That's his crime. That's his shady stuff.  And if you would take all the shady things people have done in crypto, like /u/theymos collecting 6000 BTC to upgrade bitcointalk forum and then stealing the coins.

If you would make a list of people in crypto that broke their promises or stole from people or where dishonest or where manipulating.

Well Roger Ver would not be at the top, or the middle, but somewhere at the bottom. 

So it's totally unfair that they assassinate his character and that so many people now believe he is a bad person.

You know what people's main evidence is that Roger is a bad person? He looks like one. Let that sink in. He looks like one. That's their argument. 

You should ask yourself the question: Why did so many people lie to me about Roger Ver.

And you will find that the answer is that cult was created and that only a few cult leaders have lied, the rest has simply not thought for themselves enough.

Like you. You got bamboozled and now your are realizing it.  Well, you won't find many people here  that not been bamboozled in one way or another.

We trusted some of the original Bitcoin devs that later turned out to be bad actors. And the guys  that ran the fora. We thought: ah they mean well. 

But many of us know better. They bamboozled us on purpose, and they are still doing it.  

And lots of us are working hard towards undoing the damage they have done to Bitcoin. And one day we will leave them far behind and the world will never even know of their existence.

e5kuvz4,laboratorypicked,32,"Sounds similar to this one:

[https://blog.bitmex.com/unboxing-bitmain/](https://blog.bitmex.com/unboxing-bitmain/)

Buttmain spent $887m buying Buttcoin Cash.  67.5% of their operating cash flow from their entire history of operations.

They're down $380m since they bought it, and they can't liquidate it without crashing the price.  


&gt;One of the key assets of the company is  its portfolio of cryptocurrencies, valued (on a cost basis) at almost  $1.2bn as at March 2018. As at March 2018 this consisted of over 1  million Bitcoin Cash. The market value of the altcoin portfolio has  fallen in value since Bitmain invested, with almost all the losses  attributable to Bitcoin Cash, as the chart below shows.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As the following chart below illustrates,  the Bitcoin Cash investment itself is very significant, to the extent  that the company spent around 69% of its 2017 operating cash flow on  purchasing Bitcoin Cash. Although this could be an exaggeration, some of  the Bitcoin Cash would have been inherited from pre-fork Bitcoin. The  figures imply that around 71,560 of the 1,021,316 Bitcoin Cash coins  could have been inherited in this way.¬†  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The situation is even worse than the  above indicates. Not only did Bitmain spend a majority of the 2017 cash  flow into Bitcoin Cash, they also spent a majority of cash flow from  their entire history of operations, into Bitcoin Cash. The documents  show that Bitmain generated no cash flow in in 2016 and then only $25m  in Q1 2018 (perhaps due to large TSMC prepayments).

He is right for sure but that is not the whole story. It‚Äôs very difficult to get in and get out at the right time for most people (except in hindsight) and the average investor is probably better off HODLing. As someone was posting yesterday, if you‚Äôd taken this guy‚Äôs advice you would have got into ETH at $7 and got out at $50 or $70 after a crazy 10x gain, Vlad Zamfir style.

That is why there aren‚Äôt more billionaires from the early Bitcoin days. They sold when they hit their moon at $200 or $400 or whatever.

Also it depends on what your investment horizons and goals are. I am personally in this to make life changing amounts of money at a minimum and ideally to retire off it.

It sounds crazy but a 5-10x gain isn‚Äôt enough to do that (well, 10x might be, but you get the point) and I am willing to take the risk of everything going to zero to get the big returns. I don‚Äôt want a 5x return.

If you can convince me that BTC will fill all the Social goals Bitcoin was created to fill, I will convert back today.   (Although I will still have been banned from your community for expressing concerns about blockstream)

* Disrupt Banking.  Not facilitate it on the 2nd Layer. 

* Bank the unbanked.  And I don‚Äôt mean running their transactions through a lightning hub that‚Äôs owned by Wells Fargo. Which, by the way, is exactly what‚Äôs going to happen in the next 5-10 years.

*  Able to conduct Peer to Peer Cash for any amount.  Any.  Amount.  On chain without permission or the need for routing or 3rd parties.  This is literally the reason bitcoin was created, and your version doesn‚Äôt do this anymore, if there‚Äôs any activity on the block chain above normal.  

Notice I said **able to**. Not have to. But **able to**. I have no problem with Layer 2 solutions for mass micro-transactions. That‚Äôs always been the plan. But not in the context of the block chain being effectively shut down.

As long as bitcoin is **able** to do what it was made to do, then I‚Äôm completely fine. You‚Äôve got a convert.  Because that means the 6 billion unbanked in the world will be able to onboard directly. **Like was supposed to happen**.

This one might be covered by BTC when Blockstream is finished making money off of the second layer and decides to expand the first layer.

In fact, all of these things may be covered by BTC when Blockstream gets around to raising the block size limit like they said they will. 

After they‚Äôve made all their money. 

After bitcoin has suffered market dominance loss, and everyone that wants peer to peer Cash has moved on to other coins.

Love it.

Bitcoin Cash should not get any hard forks for the time being, its more important to have a stable platform for companies to build on.

What I'm doing there (with https://flowee.org) is working hard to make a platform for people to build on top of. I want to make a stable and fast node which I renamed to be a 'Hub' because it will immediately be the cental component in the Flowee ecosystem.

Many open source components can be added but they are all separate projects, written and maintained by people that like doing that stuff (or companies that use them). Examples are a professional point-of-sale solution that connects to a Flowee the Hub (over the network) for companies that are too big to use SPV wallets. But there are hundreds of other ideas already waiting to be exploited.

The aim is that we create a platform, like wordpress is a platform, like Windows is a platform. Make sure its all open source and create value by making it easier to create actually useful things for actually paying customers.",2018-09-08 00:23:34

One would naturally ask, ""How does a group of people get so pumped up on hate..?""

[God's Own Party](https://youtu.be/TFSA0IPMqew) is a book about how the Christian Right became.

It started in the 1930s when big business tried and failed to push their anti taxation *(only rich paid taxes back then)* small government message... aginst Trustbusting Roosevelt.

They failed because people saw through their BS... so they did a study finding **preachers to be ""the most trusted men in 1930s America""**

Acting on this, their efforts then focused on disseminating their message through donations to ""friendly"" churches. 

Before this, religious people didnt have any particular political affiliation. It's in the book. That's how it started... 

...then in the 1970s after Nixon felt the media was mean to him over Watergate... Fox, Rush L, and the conservative media movement begun, intended as a right wing propaganda machine. That is detailed in [Brainwashing of my Dad](https://youtu.be/Qh3TeTxgNVo)

Certainly sir, just initiate your bitcoin transaction now and by the time you arrive it should almost have completed. 

Sounds convenient! What do I need to do to pay?

Why it's easy! Just create a wallet with some software you found on best-bitcoin-software.xnation.feralhosting.com/totallyfree.php, find a market named something like CoinBitJarFlex100, pay real currency for pretend currency at the market rates for that hour less a random percentage fee based on the lunar cycle of the moon, wait 48 hours for half a dozen Chinese server farms to approve a transfer to your wallet, then open up a website in France, enter our 87 digit secure code, initiate a transfer from your wallet to our wallet and voila! Assuming some Russian kid didn't steal it from you in the mean time, in just one week you can pay for a car wash.

Thanks mate, the future sure is amazing. 

By the way don't delete your wallet file or all your money is gone forever.

Also if it's any consolation, bitcoin has crashed many times throughout its history. A lot of you may be new to crypto but if you remember the previous years during the $1000 ATH and the 2013-2014 market, it's eerily similar to what's happening in this market. Bitcoin will go on another bullrun in the future and historically, it always happens 5-6 months before the next halving. Not only that but bitcoin is still up in price a considerable amount compared to last year as well as the fact that the volume is more than 300% higher compared to previous years. With adoption growing as well and much more structure in-place, it's quite possible for bitcoin to hit new ATHs in the near future.

When I search 'Ethereum' on Twitter, the top tweets are usually from some Bitcoin Core personality or another bashing Ethereum with ridiculous FUD (though not today; today Ethicionados are coming out swinging). Cryptocurrency has become an echo chamber where sentiment is based on substance-free narratives rather than informed opinions on the fundamentals.

A significant portion of posts in /r/CryptoCurrency are about projects based on Ethereum, but they rarely contain 'Ethereum' in the title. The cryptocurrency media is inadvertedly or deliberately under-reporting Ethereum's role at the centre of the majority of blockchain developments.

The titles of a large share of cryptocurrency news should have 'Ethereum' in it, but for some inexplicable reason, if it's about Ethereum, it almost always refers only to the generic 'blockchain', whereas when it's about BTC, or some irrelevant competitor to Ethereum, the name of the network will be specifically mentioned in the title.

So I agree with your call to market Ethereum's primacy better. It is totally dominant in all facets of the emerging decentralized finance economy, from tokens, where 93 of the top 100 tokens by market capitalization are on Ethereum, and where new standards like ERC721 are the emerging industry standard for representing particular classes of assets, to decentralized exchanges, where over a dozen ERC20 DEXes are now operational, to transactions per day, where Ethereum does more than triple what BTC does per day (600,000 to less than 200,000), to development tools (Truffle, Embark, remix).

First off Mario does not *metabolize* coins. Notice that when Mario comes in contact with a coin, it completely disappears often only leaving a sparkle behind. In fact, Mario does not have to physically touch the coins (see coin blocks) to, in your words, ""metabolize"" coins. Does he consume the coins? Don't be ridiculous. Rather I believe that the true Mario exists in some kind of different plain. 

**Mario is obviously the astral projection of a druid**

You might wonder: ""But, Mario is obviously an Italian name, you sad fucking red lion. He can't be a druid."" Of course *you* of all people would think that. First off, if Mario was Italian he would obviously consume pasta instead of mushrooms. During one of the invasions of Gaul by the Roman empire, Mario's great-great-grandmother, a Gaelic druid, fell in love with one of the raiding Roman legionaries. This soldier left the poor druid with only two gifts: a child that was growing in her womb and a single name: Mario before perishing of disease. It became a family tradition to name every first born male ""Mario"" after that. The phrase, ""It's a me, Mario,"" is a poor translation of the Gallic phrase, ""Ishta mea, Mario."" This loosely translates to, ""I am the druid Mario, the last of my kind."" The entire series of Mario is a metaphor of the conversion of the pagans to Christianity. Mario is the last Pegan of his kind. Peach represents the conversion of his state by the Catholic Church, with Bowser being the Pope. Peach is always being captured. There is nothing Mario can do to stop the conversion of his people. He can only delay it. Mario uses various druidic items to help him on his quest. His powers grow when he consumes psilocybin and he can transform into various animals. Yoshi is his familiar. It all adds up.

Right after the BCH guys started doing their own meetup weekly, we had times where as Roger said, basically nobody came. Since then it's picked up a bit - we're typically doing about 15 to 25. I would say about half-a-dozen of these people are specifically BTC enthusiasts, and tend to be hostile to BCH. Some of these people used to come to the meetups, but stopped because we had a lot of big-blockers in Tokyo (including myself) and they were sick of getting into the same argument all the time. This is basically the same reason /u/discoltk split off and set up the BCH meetups, IIUC. 

Most of the other people who show up probably don't have strong opinions about BTC vs BCH or whatever. I think people who found out about crypto after the block size wars and the alt-coin cambrian explosion are much less likely to think about there being One True Chain or care which one it is.

Honestly a big shout out to members of this room who are also regulars on /r/ethtrader  for setting the record straight on that room and how the sentiment actually is.  Tough going for sure.

Someone called me out by name over here today and many of the folks in /r/BitcoinMarkets are defending what they see as a net positive for /r/Ethtrader mods stepping to clean up bots/trolls lately. It's nice to hear that honestly. Many of the bears on Ethtrader, according to members of this room, are getting upvoted for actually producing bearish sentiment rather than ""retarded lol one liners haha he got liquidated"" type shit we've been dealing with. Many of you that share in EthTrader are happy for us that the actual trolls are finally getting a lot of pushback lately so Ethtrader can get a somewhat clearer view of sentiment both bear and bull.

I hope it's working. It's a real job as mods to clean up the really bad actors.  I remember being here in 2014 when the price finally capitulated and reading all the nastiness. Many people that frequent both subs have been calling for tougher moderation in Ethtrader because they generally feel like Bitcoinmarkets was doing a better job taking out bots/trolls.  

We've been trying our best and it seems to be helping.  But a shitpile of market activity still doesn't make it fun. 

/r/BitcoinMarkets thank you to those of you who come to share on /r/ethtrader and don't wreck the party continuously with name calling and pure blatant fud like some of our other friends from /r/buttcoin and God knows where else.  It's a dicey market to say the least and we've had our fair share of people threatening suicide and/or posting suicide hotline numbers just like the old days of Bitcoinmarkets.

Don‚Äôt know if I want cemo, maybe just something to take the edge off the pain while the family comes by. 

I‚Äôve lived a hard and wild life: 60‚Äôs acid freak living nearly 10 years in the streets to having four children and a wife while building a multimillion dollar business and then saying FUCK U ALL and stole millions and gave it to my new love, Stephaine. We were driving down a street in Seattle in my sports car and I asked her: ‚Äòclose your eyes and tell me your most deep and private wish.‚Äô  She said ‚ÄòI want my own church.  Do you have enough magic to make that happen?‚Äô  A block latter I pull in front of this big fucking WHITE CHURCH with a for sale sign in front. Who in Seattle sells a church?  I bought it for her, my love, with money I was stealing from a very rich widow, who I was sleeping with. What a piece of shit this woman is, Margaret. I became her worst nightmare, though totally non-violent.  Don‚Äôt fucking judge me people, if you do you just don‚Äôt know what is. The extremes were intense. 

I finally got really tried of this shit, hired my son‚Äôs attorney, and went off to prison.   Very nice 30 months of playing chess with Rex among other things. Everyone left me alone as they thought I was crazy. One time prison chess champion but as ‚Äòcrazy as snot‚Äô to quote my court appointed shrink. My ex-wife got a huge lump sum insurance settlement because I‚Äôm totally bat-shit crazy. 

Poor Margaret, she has spent nearly a million dollars in legal fees on me.   The last time we were in federal court her attorney said it wasn‚Äôt fair, he is too smart for us.  She even accused me of moving bank assets around and then going into those banks and deleting all evidence. They found the accounts she told the federal judge, account numbers and balances, and then when they moved in to grab the amounts they were gone, no trace.  Fucking unreal, I have no clue what is going on here. I finally disclosed to her one of my bitcoin accounts and she gave up, settling for $150,000.   Her nearly 30 year fight ending. 

My ex-wife said as I was going off to prison: cheer up dear, children and animals still love you. Funny girl, still love her.  Drop dead gorgeous. She found me living in a cave when I was tripping on lsd. She told my children I just used her for her genes, like duh I thought when I heard it.

My current wife is unbelievable. She is the highest paid professional in her industry in the world. We have been married for 20 years and my ex-wife told me last Christmas she is madly in love with me and thinks of me daily. Her husband won‚Äôt let us even talk without him being right there. I own my own business and in a bad year make over $100,000.  I also grow all of my food on my little farm on an Island nw of Seattle.   Four children and seven grandchildren. 

All of this is for fucking real.  No, I‚Äôm not making it up.

My step son‚Äôs ex girlfriend (who I love dearly) is a writer. My wife wants her to write a book about me: a 60‚Äôs acid freak in the 21st Century will be the title if I choose to live that long.

I‚Äôve been tripping again and only my oldest son knows. He was conceived with both of us on lsd. He is a brilliant computer game designer. 

So what I wrote, one of these times I‚Äôll go into the brilliant white light and those that loved me will find this body.  They‚Äôll move on as we all do.  Those that hate me will believe I‚Äôll take that hate with me for eternity. Jokes are on them, there is only love.

If BTC is good because it guarantees that you'll always be able to run a full node on minimum hardware, and if an onchain transaction is required to open a Lightning channel, doesn't that mean that chains like BCH will dominate Lightning Network since the order-of-magnitude greater onchain capacity means that it can onboard new users at over 10x the rate (currently, more in future) than BTC (BTC can only onboard ~7 people per sec, max, whereas 32MB BCH can currently on onboard 100 new users per sec)

&gt; # Russell says the paper losses on his initial investment have reached 96%.

Emphasis, mine.

Folks, this is ***truly fucking impressive***. Was just cruising around town with fuckharvey &amp; I joked about how I wanted to reach out to this guy personally and give him some kind of consolidatory prize in exchange for an honest interview to figure out *""dude, just what the hell were you thinking exactly????!""*

&gt; Russell attempted to mitigate his losses by **shifting money from bitcoin** (XBT) **to an offshoot called Bitcoin Cash** and other cryptocurrencies including **Ethereum** and **Ripple**.

Why is this so noteworthy? Consider the following (asset / ATH / current / % discount off ATH):

* BTC | $20,089.00 | $6,270.01 | **-68.79%**
* BCH | $4,355.62 | $437.14 | **-89.96%**
* ETH | $1,432.88 | $182.83 | **-87.24%**
* XRP | $3.84 | $0.25858 | **-93.27%**

Source (as of writing): https://athcoinindex.com/

With his **96% drawdown**, this guy managed to rebalance his portfolio allocations in such a way that he racked up paper losses *exceeding* those if he just simply went 100% on *ANY* of the individual assets--his Sharpe ratio is [very] negative.

In other words, this guy ""beat the bear market"" *at losing money*. If you did the exact opposite of this guy, you'd surely find yourself near the very top of the BitMEX leaderboard.

Not for nothing, OP...in addition to owing it to your fianc√© to let her know what happened and giving her the opportunity to decide whether to stay with you, that‚Äôs also the far, farrrr more responsible financial decision. If you‚Äôve turned over the new leaf that you claim to have, I hope she doesn‚Äôt leave you, but you understand that there‚Äôs a chance she will. Well, if you ride it out, get married, and then she finds out...she still has a decision to make at that point. And, if she decides to leave then, you‚Äôre not looking at a breakup; you‚Äôre looking at a divorce. Part of getting more solvent financially is to make more sound financial decisions...telling your fianc√© before you get married is the more sound financial decision.

I had some dividends sitting in my account from a pretty stable stock that I own...it wasn‚Äôt much, maybe a grand. Like you, I‚Äôd read stories of people getting rich off bitcoin. I played the ‚Äúoh, if I‚Äôd only put in seven bucks 18 months ago, I‚Äôd be driving a Bugatti right now‚Äù game. So, I threw the $1,000 at Bitcoin. Almost immediately, the $1k became $2k. The $2k became $4k. I was elated. Then the $4k went to $3k. Then I started checking the price 10, 15, 20 times day. My mood would follow the ebbs and flows of the bitcoin price. All this, over a thousand bucks. The point of the story is that while you‚Äôre not faultless in this; you‚Äôre not alone or really unique. It‚Äôs easy to get drunk off the rollercoaster that is gambling. You have a problem. A sickness. Your parents...your fianc√©...they‚Äôre going to be angry.

e5vwd71,MyStolenCow,45,"Basically explains the crypto run last year and the subsequent crash.

Crypto was 650 in Jan 2017, gambling with crypto became a thing with Korean rich kids and it became somewhat of a trend there. Korea, and East Asia in general tends to be a very trend driven region.

Tether started running the printing machine.

Price of bitcoin crossed $2000 in May 2017, and then suddenly all these dumbasses on 4chan made a lot of money from what most regular people would consider to be monopoly money. Greed/jealousy happen, it went crazy in Korea/Asia and China to an extent (though exchanges are banned there), people didn't understand it but the speculative demand for them, as well as ETH, was insane; they even had live bitcoin exchanges running for grandma's who didn't know how to use a computer. 

Bitcoin crossed $5000, they made an episode on Big Bang Theory, then it just went insane in the west as well, everyone and their shoe shine boy were buying bitcoin, crossed $9000 by Thanksgiving, people were bragging about their gainz over holiday dinner, so next week everyone who wasn't in crypto FOMO in and downloaded coinbase, which was gaining 100k new users a day in Dec/Jan. Bitcoin went to 20k, people sigh that they missed out on bitcoin, but maybe that 25c ripple will be like bitcoin someday, so they drove up shitcoin alts to a new record high (shitcoin ripple went to $4 LOL). 

Eventually the people who were susceptible to bitcoin FOMO was exhausted, the supply of greater fools ran out, people cashed out, and that whole shit fell, the only reason why there is still air in the bubble right now is tether manipulation, and the few people who still haven't accepted the fact that crypto is monopoly money so they are ""buying the dip(s).""",2018-09-13 12:30:05
e5whm10,h_lance,44,"However, there are  three disturbing differences.

One, in retrospect, dotcom companies were mainly fairly honest members of that common category in business, ""too early pioneers"".  The model was correct - twenty years later online sales and delivery is a major and growing component of retail.   Amazon was founded around 2002 (\*correction\* - it was 1994 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon\_(company)#Online\_bookstore\_and\_IPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)#Online_bookstore_and_IPO), which doesn't change my point at all but which I correct now for accuracy), using pretty much the dotcom model, but with more attention to competing on price.  Lots of weird early car companies when bankrupt before 1920, etc.

Two, because they were businesses, there was something that could bring an end to the bubble.  It couldn't become a never ending Ponzi scheme, because the businesses themselves eventually had to run out of cash and go bankrupt.  They were businesses, they rented spaces, they hired staff, they had assets, and they had bills to pay.  The crytpo bubble is pure psychology.

Three, because they were based on a legitimate idea, elements of their model could eventually be adopted.  Bitcoin itself is based on a self-contradictory idea - it's going to be adopted as a medium of exchange yet simultaneously constantly increase in value relative to the price of other goods like a San Diego condominium in 2006.  It can't be both.  But even if the deflation weren't there, it's not intended for anything good, libertarian shill slogans notwithstanding.  It's basic function is to facilitate crime (including plenty of crimes with victims) on the internet.  It's supposed to be the online equivalent of a suitcase of unmarked cash for criminal dealings.  As such, it abandons all the \*beneficial\* aspects of competent regulation of financial markets, like reasonably stable prices, insurance of deposits, legal limitations on shilling of fraud investments, and so on (the fact that some of the world's weakest currencies and financial systems are ""almost as bad as crypto"" doesn't change this).  And it even abandons the advantages of suitcases of cash, too - with cash you know who you're dealing with to some degree and can potentially threaten retaliation if you're cheated.  There's no obvious reason why any elements will ever make their way to legitimate systems - who wants to be completely unable to identify who you're buying something from, completely unable to reverse transactions in cases of fraud, forced to wait hours for digital completion of an online transaction, etc?",2018-09-13 22:06:51

e5wa3jq,Asus_Acer,39,"by u/Banelingz from another thread:

&gt;I think I can provide a bit of insight, since I've worked with high net worth clients in China for quite a bit of time.  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, Fan BingBing absolutely evaded tax. However, everyone from politicians to taobao store owners does it. The problem is very rampant in China, and is one of the reasons why bitcoin and high end art markets exploded in the past decade or so, as they are vehicles for people to launder money. That being said, the only circumstance where people are investigated for it are 1. when they piss someone off, or 2. the person they're bribing has gone out of favor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, this part is speculation based on tabloid and online chatter. Basically, rumor has it that the wealthy backer that Fan has had, who helped her with her agency and fashion brand, has become disgruntled in recent years. As such, he is trying to promote another young actress he is currently sleeping with to become the premier actress in China. Thus, all the shady financial dealings Fan has had over the years have leaked out.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no way of knowing if that's true. However, one thing for sure, Fan's pretty fucked. The reason is usually, when you realize you're investigated, you contact your connection in the government, and these investigations either go away, or you agree to pay back the tax owed. No big deal. However, the fact that she's still gone means that she's fallen out of favor with whoever she knows in the government. Which is pretty amazing considering her clout.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway, only time will tell as to what happened.

e5xcole,Namrok,56,"I think most people are not at all even remotely reasonable when it comes to money.  The amount of disordered thinking I see around me makes me wonder how these people aren't on the street already.

Most of it stems from having next to no intuitive sense of how numbers work.  The worst is not understanding how interest rates are bleeding them dry, or how credit cards work.  They have a weak understanding at best about how important it is to pay down your principle.  To say nothing of how poorly invested what savings they have might be.  I'm talking savings accounts with something like a 0.1% rate of return!  And they're afraid to move it, even to another savings account at a better bank with a better rate of return.  Much less other extremely conservative vehicles like a CD ladder.  We're not getting crazy with bitcoin here.

So the overall picture is of people just reflexively using credit cards, paying the minimum or an arbitrary amount above it which may or may not be chipping away at principle, and letting their meager savings languish, getting demolished by inflation, and often cleaned out at the first life hiccup.

I can't count the number of times I've seen people let their 20% APR credit cards get out of control, and then pay it off after a year or two of struggling with the entire contents of the 0.1% savings account.  When if they'd just taken that decisive action early on, they could have easily saved thousands of dollars!  But they were ignorant of how lopsided the math was, and too emotionally attached to their shitty savings account.

To say nothing of other just straight up weird cognitive gaps in money.  Like mentally zeroing out purchases below a certain amount, only to realize they spent $300 more than they thought they did once the credit card statement shows up at the end of the month.  I saying to themselves ""I have $100"" and spending it several times over because each time they spent it, they never adjusted their mental model of how much money they had.  Because they don't check their balances that often, because it causes them anxiety.  

Or having little actual sense of how much money they even spend on things period.  Money comes in, money goes out.  What gets spent on what is almost impossible to parse back out, and totally untracked.  To say nothing of how there is no budget for the totally predictable annual bills that roll around.  No sense of looking at last years books to get an idea of what seasonal hits you have coming this month.  So totally predictable expenses if they'd been paying attention ""come out of nowhere"", and they'd already spent the money on those cognitively invisible purchases.

e5zs0s0,Capolan,80,"Ok, get some popcorn and sit down, this is quite the story.

The guy that created bitcoin, ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" had certain perspectives about bitcoin.   Several of these perspectives written about in the original white paper about bitcoin - mainly that bitcoin could be used as currency and replace or at least accompany fiat, were a cornerstone to the growth of ideas around cryptocurrency.

Satoshi (whom no one knows who they are) at one point bowed out of the entire scene (no one knows why) and handed off governance to several people.   These people then enlisted the help of a few more.   1 of the persons that they allowed in as a sort of ""admin"" was a young developer named Greg Maxwell.   Internal politics became a very real thing, and most say that Greg began to sow discontent as well as assist controlling information on sites like reddit.   This was the birth of the now ledgendary censorship of reddit's r/bitcoin sub-reddit, and the general controlling of information.     Greg slowly over time got the group to distrust each other and essentially kick each other out of the group.   Most of the people that he was able to get removed were people that wanted the best for bitcoin and it's future, specifically that it was a decentralized system for the people.    This in and of itself is quite the epic story, and it's a story of betrayal and intrigue and it rivals any of the psychopathic power struggles that go on in wall street or big corporations. (it would make an excellent movie).

With the people that were essentially in it ""for the people"" removed, bitcoin began to be co-opted with the help of someone from WAAAY back in the day (one of the first 6 persons involved in the mailing list that started the ideas that drove bitcoin) - this person's name is Adam Back.    In this processing of politics, a company called ""blockstream"" was formed.   Blockstream's actions indicated that they saw the financial potential of big business and high finance transactions using bitcoin.   

Many fights ensued between those that wanted bitcoin to stay as a ""for the people"" currency, and those that wanted to tap into the larger financial markets.    One of the big things that were fought about is something called ""block size"".   in a nutshell block size is the limit of transactions that can be had for every block, a block being essentially a container of transactions that are validated approximately every 8-10 minutes.   Limiting the block size creates a situation where paying more for a transaction to be processed can get you into that small queue of transactions.  pay less?  then you might get in...in the next one...or the one after that...or maybe the one after that...  

This created a fee system that made mining incredibly profitable, and though moving massive amounts of money was still cheaper than any other service on the planet, it absolutely removed the ability for bitcoin to be fiat money.   People were paying more in fees than the cost of the item they purchased.

Blockstream meanwhile was doing all sorts of machavelian things, including slowly patenting pieces of code that they were inserting into the main branch of ""bitcoin"" and it's network.    r/bitcoin was under complete control of all information and narratives regarding bitcoin, all directed toward blockstream's goals.  this was done by someone known as u/theymos.    Blockstream also was brigading any sites they could with paid representatives pushing their narratives and releasing disinformation.  

The block size debate raged on, with factions being formed between ""small blockers"" and ""big blockers"".    Small blockers argued that amout of transactions could be increased by using code/technology, while big blockers argued that the original vision of Satoshi covered that block sizes should grow to scale to the network.   There are MANY fights about this, as well as tons of wrong and misguided information out there, on both sides.

What was then being pushed, and pushed hard by blockstream, was the idea of having transactions ""off chain"".   essentially bitcoin but without the blockchain which is really a 3rd party payment system where the payment is ""bitcoin"" but in name only.    The big blockers and original theorists all said that this is completely against the vision of bitcoin, that this isn't decentralized as a 3rd party now was involved, and they said that whomever owns that off chain solution gets the fees of transactions.    In short, some corporations were about to make a LOT of money, and bitcoin would be one step further away from the original idea (regardless of what side of this you side with - this really isn't debateable - this isn't what the intent was, and some don't like this, some don't care, etc.)

The mining community among others all decided that they would comprimise.  they would both increase the size of the blocks AND implement this off chain payment system.     Everyone agreed to this.   The idea would be that first the off chain system would be put in place and then several months later once everything was stable, the block sizes would be increased.    this agreement was called ""segwit"" (segregated witness - I'm not going to go into that here, but you can look it up).  

One group however really hated this comprimise.   They wanted to stay true to the original idea, and saw that this would take bitcoin away from people to use as cash-money, as well as give the ability to control the decentralized network and it's transactions.    They didn't want this new ""Segwit"" code in bitcoin.   

In order to not have Segwit code, this group needed to fork the bitcoin code so that they could branch off from the code that now contained segwit.   This means basically they were going to form a whole new cryptocurrency from the fork.    This whole new cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin Cash.

Everyone laughed at bitcoin cash, calling it bcash or btrash or whatever as very divicive lines were drawn in this strange financial battle for crypto dominance.  

As soon as Segwit code was introduced Blockstream and those that agreed with blockstream began a massive campaign to not increase the blocksizes at all regardless of what was agreed to, and all sorts of lies, hacking, distrust, scamming, etc was born and the community became further divided.    Bitcoin was re-positioned to never have been intended as cash, but instead a store of value, while bitcoin cash wanted to only be cash, to be daily use ""money"".  

This battle rages on and on.   Bitcoin Cash's main supporter and someone who has gotten very wealthy betting on bitcoin cash being a superior system is Roger Ver - one of the speakers on this cruise.  the other Speaker is Jimmy Song, a bitcoin evangelist who was hired by Blockchain Capital as a partner in January.  

So, what you have is the anarchist and ""for the people down with corporations"" guy Roger Ver,  and a representative from an organization and well known evangelist of Bitcoin, Jimmy Song. 

This debate is INCREDIBLY heated and hostile, and the disinformation and distrust only grows by each passing day.   One side is ""money for the people with no government or 3rd party intervention"" and the other side wants to push bitcoin into the big spaces within the financial world markets, and in many ways do not care about micro transactions with bitcoin.  

So the question comes down to this - which do YOU believe in.   do you want crypto to be a high level high dollar transactional system or do you want crypto to be a daily use micro transactional system?

That is the debate that has reached near religious level convictions with the people in this space.

Watch now as the rebuttals come in about what I've just said here - it will probably be comical.     My bias, and I admit this is that I feel bitcoin cash is closer to the original concept of bitcoin and I like that it's for the people and useable.   HOWEVER i also recongnize - if you want to make money in crypto, you need the large financial houses out there and you need liquidity and stability - and bitcoin has this right now.     

I have simplified some of the goings on as well as the information and history of Roger Ver as well as Jimmy Song.   With that said, people will now discredit what I've said by talking about Roger Ver going to prison for selling explosives (fireworks for farmers designed to scare birds on ebay - the case wasn't about fireworks being sold, as they were sold by Cabelas and LL bean and such  - it was about doing it online for the first time) and other such things.

Very few will give you the full story about this, and the misinformation out there is massive.   I've read about and been involved in both sides long enough that I picked a well-researched perspective and I maintain it.    

The people that are pushing disinformation will do so and be effective at doing so because of the complexity of what is being discussed.   Just know, in many ways it comes down to  ""people vs. corporations"".    

let the hate rain down on me now by the various evangelists out there.   PS:  here's a link where the guy that Satoshi Nakamoto handed everything off to, Gavin A.  talks about Greg Maxwell.   (Gavin was pushed out at one point)

Jimmy accuses Roger of having too many Bitcoin Cash supporters in the crowd (which is silly because Bitcoin BTC supporters were just as welcome to the conference. Where were they?). **But besides all that: Jimmy targeting the audience is a non-technical argument *because he can't debate technicals without reading from a script*. So he targets the audience.**

To further put it in perspective: **There *was* a large fat man loudly shouting and attacking Roger during the debate (multiple times), and Roger smoothly handled the (intense) heckling**. I *think* that man was just a mindless r/bitcoin drone (or was it a paid attacker?). I will be generous and assume ignorance first instead of malice. But it makes you wonder why that man was so vicious. It was pretty horrible yelling if you haven't seen it.

Firstly, every new user is bound to be utterly confused by there being two bitcoins, and thus to mention BCH to a new user is a deliberate scam. They are so easily confused, after all (and apparently unable to read).

Yet, when it comes to getting involved with LN, all of a sudden these same users will become veritable systems engineers who are able to purchase and commission computer systems hardware, install operating systems (especially Linux), configure networking, configure operating systems and software (often through obscure command line commands) and understand all the intricate theory about LN connectivity, channel creation, maintenance, direction and so forth. (Just look for some recent threads from LN advocates who have tackled this stuff head on!)

So I ask which is it BTC dudes? You can't have both narratives. Choose one.

(And before someone cries ""false dichotomy"" I actually agree that it is false. The average user WILL be smart enough to differentiate between the two versions of bitcoin, but they WONT be smart enough to use/configure LN). :D",2018-09-15 12:45:16
e5zqw7p,shadders333,50,"The block size does impact propagation times but the fixes for this and other issues aren't consensus changes. The stress test proved that the network won't collapse under extreme load. Due to the backlog caused by inefficient software it also showed that a miner that had invested in better software would have had the opportunity to mine all the transactions and claim the revenue that others missed as a reward. And the ancillary services that had the capacity to deal with it would have gained a branding advantage over those that didn't. 

This is the point of raising the limit even before the software gains the capacity to handle it. It creates an incentive and an economic pressure for miners and other that rely on full nides to improve this capacity. Until Bitcoin SV, miners have not directly paid for their own node development and developer groups have had different priorities. That has now changed. Our focus is 100% on performance and 0-conf improvements and we have the funding and team to build world best practice (modelled on aerospace) development capacity and do so.

We have kept the November changes set minimal for safety's sake. But in the background we are working on all the identified bottlenecks in parallel as well as building profiling infrastructure to identify more and model the next generation bitcoin node design. The performance changes I refer to are targeted for release before the May 2019 hard fork.

Bitcoin cash needs to scale fast and the paternal approach of saving people from their own mistakes removes the urgency of this development imperative. One important thing to remember is that no one can mine a block that they can't mine. And if they do mine it it means everyone else could have mined it and should be able to validate it.

But if you had a way of personalizing it to them to the extent they actually feel threatened... They still couldn't do anything unless they validated themselves to the FBI as a scam call organization.

I think a better idea would be to incentivize people to give up their organization. Tell the scammer, I will send you xx amount of Bitcoin if you tell [whatever authority] everything there is to know about where you work and who you work for. Especially for the Indian scammers (who are calling from ""Microsoft,"" for example). Get them to anonymously rat out their entire organization for six months worth of their pay.

e5z6ojy,deadalnix,37,"&gt; Do you agree with /r/btc's moderation policies? Do you believe that harsher anti-trolling policies would be beneficial for the community, or do you think that would harm more than help?

I think /r/btc policies are a bit lax, but on the other hand, the community was abused by outrageaous moderation policies from /r/bitcoin, so it's understandable. Finding proper policies is difficult.

&gt; What do you see as the biggest hurdle(s) to mainstream adoption?

I think there are two main axes:

1/ Most of the ecosystem is highly unprofessional and constantly playing petty games. It is important to come up with a roadmap well in advance, a schedule that goes with it and stick to it. Not doing so will cause a lot of incertitude in the market and why would you build your product on top of a plateform that will evolve in unspecified ways in the future ?

2/ UX. Let's be honest, UX is not great right now. Many basic tasks are stupidly complex to execute. For instance, transferring money from a wallet on a computer such as electron cash to a mobile wallet require you to type the address manually reading it on your phone's screen, or finding a way to send that address to yourself, for instance by mail. This is bad.

&gt; Following up on the above, Monero is a very well respected and well liked crypto in this community. Do you interact at all with their development team. Do you believe there are lessons we can learn from their development practices, especially surrounding hard forks? What, if any, features of Monero do you believe Bitcoin Cash should adopt?

I do not interact with their team much. They are overall very professional, and I wish the BCH ecosystem would learn from it. In term of feature however, not that much. The UX with monero is atrocious - connecting your wallet in command line to your node is not something most people I know are going to be willing to do - and on a technical perspective they made tradeoff that increase privacy but also make it significantly harder to scale, which is not a tradeoff that make sense for Bitcoin Cash.

&gt; And lastly, we've seen already that the best way to attack crypto is through social engineering, not technical flaws in the protocol or network. Do you think there are some superior governance techniques Bitcoin Cash can use to protect itself from such attacks, both ongoing and future?

The Bitcoin Cash immune system is very weak on that front. I'm not worried about government that much because there are more immediate threats from within already. If that doesn't improve, good people are going to be weeded out. It already happened for some.",2018-09-15 02:35:11

e612bhq,TheCryptosAndBloods,56,"Exactly one year ago today, I signed up to Coinbase because I'd heard of this ""bitcoin"" thing and thought I'd chuck some money at it although I saw it had tripled from the start of the year already to $3000 and thought I was probably too late. 

Then I logged in and found I could buy Bitcoin as well as something called ""Ethereum"" and ""Litecoin"" on Coinbase. And I used my credit card to buy a hundred bucks - 45% BTC, 45% ETH and 10% LTC. 

I spent some more a week later, and then I thought that's it. I'm just going to sit on this and get on with my life (also I heard about McAfee's Bitcoin $1 million by 2020 tweet and actually thought he was credible lol). 

Then because I had some skin in the game, I started reading a bit about ""blockchain"" and then some more, and then I signed up to Binance and before I knew it I was down the rabbit hole buying shitcoins. 

Still, I was 7x up my investment in early Jan and utterly incredulous - knowing it couldn't last, but hoping for a few more months of it - I wanted to cash out my initial investment at 10x (lol). 

Then the crash hit (sorry the ""January dip"") and still by then I was fascinated by the sector, and I stayed and I stayed reading and getting deeper, and invested in a couple of ICOs, wrote some Medium articles, got to posting on this sub...started trading a bit (hello Bitmex liquidations) and here I still am a year later. 

Down a lot, but certainly not out, and not going out anytime soon..

You've put 100% of your assets into one asset class, a class with a guaranteed negative return. You're undiversified and extremely vulnerable. What if inflation jumps? How long does your money last when you're losing 10% per year? Stocks and bonds are how to protect yourself from inflation and stop going backwards and avoid catastrophe in the long term. 

Thankfully, you've already been investing for a long time through your super. Go look at his Super's past performance. See the amount you earned in interest vs the amount you contributed. I bet the world didn't fall in.

Why not start with a small amount to see how it feels. Buy 5k of a Vanguard diversified fund (low fees, includes bonds to protect against market downturns, global diversified holdings, simple) via Selfwealth and watch it for a while. Or buy bonds or term deposits - investments with guaranteed returns.

Wherever you are, you can make a difference too:

1. When purchasing, always ask if they accept Bitcoin Cash even if you know they don't.
2. They typically have heard of Bitcoin and respond positively or more likely negatively. Be sure to take that moment to explain that Bitcoin BTC is different from Bitcoin Cash BCH and that Bitcoin BTC is no longer suitable for electronic commerce while Bitcoin Cash BCH is what Bitcoin used to be, you know, when Bitcoin was a growing, disruptive, dominant p2p electronic cash system.
3. Ensure your friends have Bitcoin Cash wallets on their phones. Always remember to gift some Bitcoin Cash to a new wallet as it is bad luck to give someone an empty wallet.
4. Use Marco Coino App by u/curyous to show other merchants are using Bitcoin Cash BCH. No one likes to be the first with something they don't understand.
5. Even if the merchant will not accept Bitcoin Cash BCH, try to get them to install a personal wallet and gift them some BCH. If they become familiar with Bitcoin Cash they will come around when they better understand it.
6. Start with the owner-operator/independent stores first. They can make a decision to adopt while a franchise will hide behind management and must be converted at a corporate level, a much harder prospect in the early stages of adoption.
7. Consider buying and installing a Bitcoin Cash ATM.
8. Report your successes on r/btc so everyone can enjoy.
9. Be sure to have fun. Bitcoin Cash is exciting and infectious and very very cool. BCH sells itself, you just have to let it.

e66mvzh,dalebewan,180,"Related -&gt; True story from yesterday:

I park my car about 10 minutes away from my office, since the company I work for doesn't have enough parking spaces.  When I left work yesterday and was walking to my car, I passed one of those charity fundraising pop-up stands on the street.  A girl intercepted me and started on her story about why their charity is the best way to help starving people in war-torn east African countries.

To be honest, I'd be happy to give a little donation.  The charity sounded alright.  However I am the blue shirted guy in this comic... I only use bitcoin.

While it would be funny to tell you that she gave me money, that didn't happen.  What did happen though is that she'd never heard of it, and called over one of her colleagues.  He confirmed that they don't in fact accept bitcoin donations (he was aware of bitcoin, but only superficially).  The three of us then spent about 10 to 15 minutes talking about what bitcoin is and how - with proper planning on the charity's side - it would be something they really could get behind given how control over money is one of the ways that these countries are being oppressed by those in power.

So, no donation from me yesterday, but they said they'll talk to their supervisor/organiser and see if they can at least start accepting bitcoin donations in the future, even if it's just to convert to fiat at first.  I also somewhat got the impression that both of them were likely to go out and investigate it further themselves.  They both seemed really quite excited about the idea of it as I explained it to them.",2018-09-18 18:06:13

In response to my dissent, I was informally dubbed CryptoMom.¬† I always have wanted to be a mother, so acquiring this new title was quite an honor. Admittedly, this is not the form of motherhood I envisioned, but one of the wonderful aspects of motherhood is that children are quite different than their mothers anticipated they would be.

If I were a mother, I suspect that I would be a free-range mother rather than a helicopter mom.¬† A helicopter mother hovers over her child in order to ensure the child‚Äôs success, although this strategy often backfires. A free-range mother, by contrast, encourages her child to explore with limited supervision, which requires the acceptance of a certain level of risk.""

Realize that their team and their technology are different than all other cryptos. 5) Become convinced over time that basically anything any crypto can do, Iota can do better. Realize that I like IOTA better than ANY other cryptocurrency and the more I learn the more excited I become. 6) Sell all other cryptocurrencies to buy more IOTA. 7) Look at the value of all cryptocurrencies and realize it is all hype and speculation. 8) HODL IOTA in the belief that it will survive all the drama and come out as a true leader.

The cryptocurrency market has gone from $750 Billion in total market cap to $200 Billion this year. Can any sort of analysis make sense of that?? (or how it went from $17 B to $600B in 2017??). The price of IOTA gets whipped around (with all the others) based on overall sentiment and Bitcoin price. The Iota Foundation basically does not care--instead of focusing on price or market cap they are focusing on building their team, their partnerships, and their technology, I think it was Dom who said this will either be a trillion dollar project or a failure. A $1T market cap would put 1 Mi at $360. I think eventually it will get there, but I don't know if that is 5 years or 50 years. The current IOTA market cap is less than 2% that of BTC and less than 10% that of ETH. I see nothing fundamental that would justify that disparity--in my mind IOTA is the most valuable of all three of them. The price disparity is simply about the small demand for IOTA, which is largely a product of a) difficulty trading IOTA (on far fewer exchanges), b) active FUD campaign that has scared a lot of people away, and c) no marketing campaign by the Iota Foundation. Iota is actually building something before trying to sell it to the world, whereas most everyone else is first selling their idea, pumping their price as much as possible, and then seeing if they can build something.

__UPDATE: [ABC has published a binary release v0.18.2 which contains the fix. Please upgrade.](https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.18.2/)__ If you're using an older version which you want to patch, see my source instructions below.

I'm not convinced off-hand that this is true for ABC, where there is a specific comment that the duplicate input check is skipped in CheckBlock due to slowness, and in fact CheckRegularTransaction is called with fCheckDuplicateInputs=false just as it appears the analogous Core code did prior to their critical patch.

EDIT: _I was looking at an older source tree (0.18.1 source package downloaded from the current release). The current master branch on github contains a fix within a refactoring of the duplicates check. However, you will need to run from source or wait for release of v0.18.2 if you run from binaries._

It looks to me like BU and XT code predates the optimization attempt by TheBlueMatt which introduced this bug, and that they do check for duplicate inputs in CheckBlock via code in CheckTransaction which always gets executed.

If you're running ABC from a source package prior to 0.18.2, I recommend you adopt sdaftuar's fix immediately by changing

to

&gt; if (!CheckRegularTransaction(*tx, state, true)) {

This enables the duplicate inputs check.

The year is 2015.

Price dumps hard to yearly bottom ($200) at the beginning of the year, briefly going below it. 

Over the rest of the year, we bounce near the $200 bottom and establish support at least 5-6 times. 

We touch the $200 support for one last time in September, establishing it as the yearly low, the bear market bottom, and the rest is history (we never see $200 again).

Sound familiar? Replace $200 with $6000. 


The difference is, during 2015:


+Bitcoin was still a niche concept with no guarantee of global adoption. 


+No institutional acceptance. 


+People, including myself, were scared shitless.  


+People truly believed Willy bot was the only reason BTC ever went to $1000. 


+Public perception of Bitcoin was ‚Äúdrug money‚Äù &amp; ‚Äútulips‚Äù


+Higher barriers of entry compared to today. 


+LN, second layer, sidechains were a pipe dream, Bitcoin scaling was questionable. 


+Concerns regarding internal community dispute, and a hostile miner w/ 51% hash 




‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Do you think we live in the same world today? Bitcoin has overcome all of the concerns above and achieved more than I imagined in 2015. Bitcoin established a global reputation that would‚Äôve been a dream come true back then. It is legitimized as a net asset class, and this recent bear market has shown the newbies why Bitcoin is the reserve asset and unit of account for all crypto. Liquidity, volume, adoption, development, reputation, public opinion, public interest, institutional interest have all skyrocketed. We have mainstream media, VCs, hedgefunds and institutional investors shilling Bitcoin 24/7. Bitcoin is no longer the fragile little experiment that we must protect.... Bitcoin is at a point of no return and completely unstoppable whether you like it or not. You cannot say the same for ANY other altcoin, period.  Today, most people don‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúWILL Bitcoin recover‚Äù, they ask ‚ÄúWHEN will Bitcoin recover‚Äù



We can easily continue this bear market through 2019 and even establish a new low below $6000. That‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess at this point. But ask yourself if we *should*.... does it fundamentally make sense for this bear market to be just as long as the previous bear market? I would say no. Price does not strictly follow fundamentals but the probabilities increase in your favor if the fundamentals make sense.  Fundamentally Bitcoin is more bullish than it has ever been, and I think the length of this bear market should be somewhere in between the mid-2013 bear market &amp; the brutal 2014-2015 bear market. Either way, I lose no sleep at night buying Bitcoin at $6000 and I‚Äôll be completely fine buying Bitcoin at $3000 too.

e68w6vr,kirkisartist,43,"It's a lot to unpack, but here we go.

Fractional reserve banking was always a shell game. Plebs would lend their gold to a bank for a return on interest. You could technically withdraw all of your gold. But not practically.

If enough plebs tried to withdraw in the full amount at once, you'd get a bank note for your gold that you could retrieve on the other side of the continent. You could get on your horse, travel through bandit country and maybe a warzone, maybe lose a horse or family member along the way, just to get where the reserves were held. Or you can play along and spend the IOU, like every thing's fine.

After the industrial revolution, travel became easier, but feeding the ponzi became a bit more difficult. Every nation that had a gold backed currency failed in less than a century. America even started [banning the possession of gold ingots and confiscating it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) to keep the scam going. 

Thank god the sham finally came to an end. Sure, 1 GBP is worth chicken tenders on the kids menu, not a pound of sterling silver. But now that we can admit we have a problem, we can at least hedge with precious metals. Unfortunately precious metals can't be transmitted digitally. That's the one thing banks really moved the world forward on.

Bitcoin was invented to be a p2p digital currency. Great idea. 1 BTC=1 BTC, no ifs ands or buts. But if we go on a reserve standard 1 BTC=1 empty promise. 

I'm here and believe in this project because frankly, I see custodial exchanges as the biggest weakness of crypto currency. I find the possibility of them running a reserve is far too great. I believe that too many traders leave their savings sitting on an exchange waiting for a buy/sell order to go through. Meanwhile the exchange could get hacked or funds could be plain old embezzled.

Now, if we're dealing with fiat tokens, we're dealing with banks and the fractional reserves that come with them. That's fine. If users are going to let banks hold their bitcoin in reserve, I can only hope they're at least collecting interest on them. But that's not our business.

Our business is to make sure money gets from A to B with no room for tom fuckery in the middle. We're not responsible for point A or point B. Your shitcoin got 51ed? Not our problem. You gave your life's possessions to a ponzi scheme? Not our problem. Your stupid country is having a bail in? Not our problem. A staking pool is running a fractional reserve? We got a big goddamn problem.",2018-09-19 19:06:09

e69o8aj,endmysufferingxX,158,"I want to piggy back on top of this comment for visibility.

I just called NewEgg support and they told me this: ~160,000 customer's had their information stolen and they are working right now to verify who actually had their information stolen.
  
  
So they will email, by the end of the week to let everyone know who was affected. So if I were you I may still go ahead and cancel and re-order their cards but if you want to wait you can put a freeze on the card and if you don't receive an email by this weekend you can unfreeze, although I'd add notifications and two factor authentication etc or any security measures on your card.
  
  
Be careful everyone and stay safe!
      
EDIT:    
  
To anyone just reading this if you made a purchase in the affected periods (Aug 13th - Sept 18th), even if you didn't receive the initial notification email, does not mean you are automatically safe.   
  
They will be sending out a separate email out on Friday with FAQ and another email to those that have been affected.  
  
Please do not make any assumptions, and if you want to be extra safe please call your bank.  

I would advise to not make any purchases from newegg even though they have removed the malware, until they release their official statement.   
  
EDIT2:  
  
Everything that has been asked and confirmed so far:  
  
**1. What was the affected period and if I made a purchase before/after am I safe?**  The affected period is August 13th 2018 - September 18th 2018. The malware has since been removed so if you made a purchase before or after the date(s) you should be safe.  
  
**2. If I used PayPal, Amex Checkout, MasterPass, BitCoin, ApplePay or third party checkout am I safe?**  In general yes if you used any of these mentioned methods you are safe.  
  
**3. I did not use those methods, instead I typed out my CC/Debit information or used a saved CC/Debit card to checkout is my information stolen?**  In general yes, you should assume your card may be compromised, if you ended up clicking checkout during the affected period. 
   
**4. Does this affect newegg on just desktop or other marketplaces?**  In general the known affected sites are newegg.com for both USA and Canada at this moment as well as their mobile app. This does not include newegg on eBay, so users who made purchases there during the affected period are safe.  

**5. I filled out my information but did not end up checking out during the affected time period, am I safe?**  In general, yes if you did not physically click checkout the script would not have activated and your information is safe.   
 
**6. If I had my CC/Debit card saved on newegg but didn't buy anything am I safe?**  In general, yes the script would not have stolen anything if no purchase was made during the affected period. It was only activated during the checkout stage via ""click"" action.  
     
**7. What should I do if I am potentially affected?**  You should immediately check your transactions and see if any fraudulent charges have been made recently and should either place a freeze until otherwise noted or contact your bank to replace your card.  
  
**8. I know CC/Debit cards are affected but what about Gift Cards?**  Yes gift cards are included in the affected list as well, so if you used a gift card during the affected time period, it will have been compromised. Best way is to contact NewEgg.

e6bejbq,Supernova752,158,"Honestly, looking at the comments in this thread - **is no one paying attention?**

ICE, who owns The New York Stock Exchange(Largest Exchange in the world) and 22 other exchanges around the world, is launching their crypto platform, **Bakkt, in November(less than 2 months)**.  They've been working on it for a year and a half and have literally stated that they aim to **mainstream cryptocurrency adoption** through creating an entire, regulated eco-system with custodial solutions - making it easier for merchants, institutional investors, and everyday investors to buy, invest, hold, and spend crypto.  **Bakkt aims to get pensions, 401ks, IRAs, etc. involved.**  They are not supporting margin trading either - the platform is made for investors.  And right off the bat they're partnered with Starbucks - **the leader of mobile payments in the U.S.** \- [bigger than Apple Pay, and twice the size of Google and Samsung Pay](https://www.cnet.com/news/starbucks-beats-apple-pay-google-pay-samsung-proximity/).  **Their goal is replace swiping credit cards with scanning bitcoin apps.**

ICE was built from basically nothing, it's CEO Jeffery Sprecher - bought a small exchange in 1996 for $1, assuming millions of their debt, and built it into the largest stock exchange operator in the world and the powerhouse it is today.  ICE didn't assign a random CEO to run Bakkt - **Bakkt's CEO is Kelly Loeffler, Jeffery Sprecher's wife** and a veteran executive of ICE since the early days(2002) who helped build it into what it is today(they married in 2009).

That's not to mention Fidelity, CBOE, Citigroup, NASDAQ, Coinbase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, etc. all making their own plays.  The SEC has accepted 2 new chairmen/women, both of which have a positive view on Crypto, and Bakkt's launch could set the stage for the BTC ETF approval.

Look, I'm not saying Wall Street is the savior of crypto, but you are absolutely disillusioned/misinformed if you think that they want to introduce these platforms they've spent considerable time/effort/money on only to pound the price/volume to zero.  It's honestly painful seeing all of these poorly researched, negative, ""yea right"" comments when this could be an opportunity to make a significant ROI if you're doing serious research and paying attention.",2018-09-20 22:47:46

e69q6fa,Peter__R,113,"This was a strange moment for me when it happened.  Prior to this, Andreas had been an inspiration to me. I loved his talks and his vision for bitcoin. He would often say how bitcoin was permissionless and that if you wanted to start making a difference, that you should just start building stuff and putting it into action.

I thought he would appreciate what we were doing with BU.  We weren't just arguing for bigger blocks on Reddit, we created an implementation to make it a reality.  This implementation included Xtreme Thin Blocks -- tech that reduced block propagation times by a factor of 5x and block propagation BW by a factor of 25x.  

Indeed, Xthin had a vulnerability that was exploited.  

Andreas could have applauded BU for doing this work and taking these risks, and just politely pointed out that it would take time for BU's QA process to mature.  He could have _encouraged_ the permissionless innovation and scaling work we were doing.  That would have been consistent with the message I remembered from his talks.  But instead, I felt like he wanted us to just stop working on bitcoin and go away.  I remember him even making a comment about us being ""little yapping dogs that needed to be kicked.""  This all seemed very strange to me coming from Andreas.  In my mind, we were working to allow bitcoin to continue to grow, yet it felt like he was against us.",2018-09-20 03:24:25

e6aqj0l,Mister_Diesel,64,"I dunno, after seeing what happened in January, my thesis has always been that reality isn‚Äôt going to matter when the US money pours in. Almost everyone in this space was immersed in the news of Canadian Legalization, because most of y‚Äôall are Canadian. I live in Pennsylvania, a six hours drive from 75% of this country‚Äôs entire population. In January when we were blowing our wads, all anyone down here was going on about was Bitcoin and Cryptos. CNBC was going nuts nonstop about it, with almost no mention of Canada and Cannabis. The media hype only started in July. Do you see the volume on CRON? Now check the dollar volume on GTBIF and ITHUF, LHSIF. There‚Äôs still no action. If you follow Todd Harrison and his thesis of a share shortage, we‚Äôre destined to Bubble. Sadly, fundamentals don‚Äôt matter much in a mania environment. I mean, I sleep just fine at night having an 1/8th of my worth in CNTTF and APHQF, but I refuse to sit here and pretend to be surprised when ANYTHING bubbles. It‚Äôs simply a matter of everyone wanting to get in, before anyone is ready to leave. Of course we see what happens at 3pm in TLRY when many decide they‚Äôre ready to leave.

Investing into a bubble is different than investing in mostly bull markets. I went to bubble school in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. Sports Cards and Becket price guides. Beanie Babies lol. Dot.com. Real Estate 04-08 with blow off top and deflation of the Mortgage Paper Bubble. 2017/18 Bitcoin crypto currency bubble. In my opinion, it would be wreckless to ignore the potential of a parabola followed by a crash in Weed Stocks. One cannot effectively hedge risk without at least considering all potential outcomes. Canadian Retail got us to 2017 Thanksgiving, and California Legalization was the wake up call in the States. End of Summer media primed the pump and now with Tilray exposure, the pump is on. August 14th was only FIVE WEEKS AGO. Nobody down here knew what was going on with Constellation and CGC. Fast Forward to the Tilray Free Marketing for the sector, one friend texted me earlier saying he bought Tilray at 98$. Another friend opened an Etrade account on Tuesday. My Uncle told me after closing Bell today that he had finally bought some STZ and is set up ready to buy some of these Cannabis companies. My dad is enthralled with a silly YOLO CBD play i nailed on CANB so he is for some reason still trading that POS ticker.

I‚Äôm a stubborn swim up stream type of moron. Too smart for my own good, and numbers always matter! I‚Äôve logged 1500 hours learning the sector as best i can. Don‚Äôt confuse SIGNAL for NOISE. The market is telling you something. Now is not the time to trade on financials. We‚Äôre still a month away from the inevitable mess of a roll out where we can start seeing some sales. Now is the time to trade human emotion. At least be aware of it. Shitty penny stocks with any loose associations to Hemp or CBD or Cannabis are doubling and tripling.

- Half of the unusual effects displayed in the backgrounds of the item icons still don't load because they decided it is apparently too much effort to upload the PNG images that backpack.tf had been using for years.
- For two years after Two Cities you couldn't search for Australium weapons and they didn't appear differently in any way except for name on the site so it was [really fun](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/450662799438949279/2353D0C241F8CE95B0081686A4DB9DCAC61C92CF/) trying to sell those back then. Eventually they updated it so you can search for it, and the only change visually was a little yellow circle which relayed that it was an Australium, and then they eventually got around to updating the code to display the proper backpack icons!
- You still can't search for Killstreak kits of a specific sheen, killstreaker, or weapon it is applied to. The same goes for Strangifiers. Good luck trying to complete your Team Shine + Fire Horns collection with TF2Outpost.
- You still can't search for specific war paints or weapon skins. A lot of times [they also don't even display right and have never listed their skin's title](https://i.imgur.com/sbPKXrL.png).
- The limit for items in each side of the trade box is capped at 8. This originally led to them being displayed as 4 on top row, 4 on bottom row, but since they updated their site scheme you get [a listing method that does not look good](https://i.imgur.com/SZoj4Yb.png)
- The staff is notoriously unprofessional and has oftentimes straight up banned people for ludicrously stupid reasons. One being a fairly common issue of an IP address shared with anybody that happens to have a private backpack with the ban reason of it [being a ""functional alt""](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7hih1p/tf2_outpost_mods_are_really_unprofessional/). It's a fair argument and all but they don't even bother with evidence on a case-by-case basis; it's a case of just blanket banning all accounts under an IP address if one has ever logged in and now has a private backpack which brings to mind why they never wrote a small bit of code to automate the process already since they're adamant about it.

TF2Outpost as a whole has left a bad taste in my mouth since they decided to change the ""donate to get these perks [forever]!"" to ""oh yeah the features you donated for are now a monthly payment."" It's fair that they need a steady stream of money to keep working, but with the incompetence of the staff and apparent lack of care into basic web design, why should I or anybody donate? *Auto-bumping trades?*

&gt;1/ Recently, there has been a concerted effort to suppress Litecoin price by people/funds that are shorting LTC and by groups that see Litecoin as a threat. I will clear up this FUD and show why Litecoin has tremendous value.


https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648816095121409

&gt;2/ FUD: Litecoin has lost its edge and can't differentiate itself from hundreds of other altcoins.
 
&gt;TRUTH: Litecoin has one of the most secure networks of all altcoins. Litecoin has over $150MM of ASIC hardware protecting it. Litecoin dominates Scrypt mining by far.

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648816908791808

&gt;3/ Miners have no incentives to attack the network because it will destroy the value of their ASIC hardware.

&gt;Litecoin has a ton of liquidity, which is important for people to get in/out of LTC. It is on practically every fiat and crypto exchange (Gemini soon), even more than ETH

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648818179690496

&gt;4/ Litecoin is supported by 9+ payment processors: Aliant Payment, BTCPay, Coinbase, CoinGate, CoinPayments, Globee, GoCoin LTCPay, and TravelbyBit. This makes it extremely easy for merchants to accept LTC. There are too many LTC merchants to count! #PayWithLitecoin

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648819056312323

&gt;5/ Litecoin processes $200MM worth of transactions each day. And the network has worked flawlessly for 7 years! 

&gt;Litecoin works today as a global decentralized sound money, that can't be censored, can't be reversed or taken away, can't be counterfeited, and can't be devalued. üöÄ

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648820092301312

&gt;6/ FUD: Litecoin is no longer needed now that Bitcoin can scale with LN. 

&gt;TRUTH: Many of the LN clients and apps also support LTC because they see the value of Litecoin. With atomic swaps, LTC interoperates with BTC on the Lightning Network.

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648820973166592

&gt;7/ Litecoin will always be the cheapest and fastest on ramp to Lightning Network. And with solutions like submarine swaps, you can use on chain LTC to pay for a BTC lightning invoice! 

&gt;We will also have decentralized exchanges using atomic swaps. The possibilities are endless. ‚ö°

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648822067781632

&gt;8/ FUD: Litecoin as Bitcoin's testnet is not worth $3B. 

&gt;TRUTH: Even if Litecoin's only use case is a testnet, you can't put an absolute value on it. Need to look at it relative to Bitcoin. Litecoin's marketcap is only 3% of Bitcoin's marketcap. That is not very large at all!

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648823426768897

&gt;9/ Litecoin helped Bitcoin activate SegWit last year by proving the game theory of SegWit in practice. Bitcoin's own testnet3 can't do it because testnet3 coins have no value, so no incentives for malicious actors to hack it. Litecoin helps Bitcoin. That is extremely valuable.

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648824424980480

&gt;10/ FUD: Litecoin has no development in the past 6 months. 

&gt;TRUTH: We don't work on the master branch, where people are looking. This is generally good Git practice! Proof: we released 0.16.2 last week and just released 0.16.3 today, which fixed the recent critical DoS bug.

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1042648826027241472

&gt;11/ FUD: Charlie has quit Litecoin and doesn't care anymore. 

&gt;TRUTH: I'm working on Litecoin full-time and focused on Litecoin adoption. Proof: the fact that I spent time writing these 11 tweets! üòÄ

&gt;Litecoin also has the strongest crypto community. LitecoinFam üöÄ

&gt;Money Button is a digital cryptocurrency payments button for websites and apps. Using Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payments are nearly instant, nearly free, work everywhere in the world, and cannot be reversed or blocked. This is how money should be. We take no commission if your transaction volume is lower than X per day, you'll receive 100% of the BCH sent.

Where X is replaced with whatever volume they would like to offer for free. Not bragging about this on the front page is insane to me; if you get even just 1 more site to adopt Money Button because of it then it's worth mentioning.

*Notice how I also mentioned that the Money Button is using Bitcoin Cash. This key piece of information is also something I think is really strange that it isn't right there on the front page.*

*I mean the way it looks right now when someone surfs in on moneybutton.com is that it's just a ""payment provider"". No mention of crypto anywhere so why wouldn't new people just assume you are trying to be like PayPal with traditional fiat money? Then they close down the site because why not just use PayPal. At least mention Bitcoin Cash somewhere so people immediately understand that Money Button is something different.*

Rating Bitcoin/Monero as A for store of value is a bit optimistic to me. There's still a decent probability that cryptocurrencies as a whole could fail. They are also both pretty volatile. Fiat isn't great considering inflation, but USD and EUR are not quite that volatile.

Difficulty of gold production should probably downgraded to B and Bitcoin to A+, due to the strictly limited supply.

Established history should probably have a D for both Bitcoin and Monero.

Still after this, he really didn‚Äôt understand anything other than patience. I hammered that into his head. It was something simple he could grasp and still feel like we‚Äôre bonding. 

Well, unbeknownst to me he put $20,000.00 dollars of his inheritance into Bitcoin in early January 2015 @ $178 and the finally sold @ $19,750 in December 2017 making a total of $2.2 Million Dollars. And do you know what this motherfucker did after that? He bought 8,883 ETH with his proceeds earlier this morning. I‚Äôm thinking he was the reason for this run-up, and not XRP.

e6hdkgt,Prince-of-Denmark,43,"Unlike a bitcoin receiving address, a funded Ripple wallet is a real thing on the ledger that has properties. This has advantages and disadvantages, but one of the disadvantages is that there's a cost associated with having one. To cover the costs imposed on the network, the XRP Ledger has a ""base reserve"" that is XRP that is not spendable or transferrable. You can use the reserve to pay transaction fees and, if the reserve drops, you can transfer out XRP to the new reserve level.

Some of the advantages of this scheme include:

The ability to change the key protecting an account without changing the receiving address.

The ability to configure an account for multisign and change the keys, signers, or quorum, again all without changing the receiving address.

Addresses can configure what assets they're willing to accept as payment and payments to them can automatically route through intermediary assets to find the cheapest path.

Accounts can place offers to trade one asset for another on a distributed exchange that follows deterministic rules.

The reserve goes up (currently by 5 XRP) for every additional object an account owns in the ledger (such as a trust line, offer, or escrow). You can reduce your reserve by eliminating these objects, but current rules do not allow the base reserve to ever be transferred or spent -- it covers the cost associated with recording the fact that the account has already performed certain transactions and without this recording, those transactions could potentially be replayed.",2018-09-23 19:01:07

e6gf6ot,shadders333,31,"Whilst I congratulate Awemany for his discovery of the bug and disclosure of the bug to some parties I cannot reasonably say the same for his disclosure to the Bitcoin SV project.
 
Awemany did not responsibly disclose this bug to SV despite security contact details being available on the front page of our github and several other communication channels to us being known to him.  This is in stark contrast to the disclosure of Corey Fields.  At the time SV did not exist and there was no one for Corey to disclose to.  At the time of this latest disclosure it was well known to Awemany that the SV existed.  Corey went to great lengths to find a suitable communications channel with ABC as there were no publicly available email addresses and no obvious PGP keys (see: https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/http-coryfields-com-cash-48a99b85aad4 ).  It would have been relatively trivial to find these for SV in recent days.

The first email address on the SV github under the heading ""Security"" has an associated PGP key on public keyservers and could have been easily found.  If Awemany had trouble finding it, an anonymous message asking for one through any of those communication channels or through other direct channels he has with us would have resulted in us pointing him to the key immediately.  Our team found out about this bug from Reddit and had to create a patch in the middle of the night under serious time pressure given that it was already publicly disclosed.  The point of a bug bounty program is to reduce risk not increase it.  Considering a bounty for this lack of disclosure would be completely contrary to the goals of the program and send the wrong message about the standard of disclosure we expect for bug reports eligible for a bounty.  This is regrettable as I would have been happy to advocate for a full reward if the disclosure had been made properly.

If in spite of all of the above if there is some reason unknown to us that prevented Awemany from making contact and he is able to make a convincing case to that effect we will reconsider the position.  However he would have to clearly demonstrate that he attempted to contact us and was unable to due to some failing on our part.
 
With respect to the bounty offered to Corey Fields, I can confirm that the offer has been made and that Corey has requested it be donated to a 3rd party.  Details of the transfer are currently being worked out and further details will be made available once it is finalized.

Finally I would point out that our full Responsible Disclosure Policy with full details of our bug bounty program (several times better funded than our nearest competitor in the cryptocurrency space) will be available in the next two weeks.  Until such time we will honour the bounty on a discretionary basis in a way that I'm sure will be publicly perceieved as reasonable, with the caveat that the disclosures must be made according to commonly accepted standards.

e6hgreg,LumenStandard,29,"Guys, I get the logic on supporting XRP to allow the bot trading to bring XLM up with it, then as the superior tech comes to light of XLM all XRP will be dumped for XLM, as the protype it is. BUT, please do not dissuade my dear lumenauts from missing out on this ride. We‚Äôre a community here. XRP is not natively built into their blockchain. It doesn‚Äôt stand a chance long term to XLM. If they pull anything off this year it is because they are good at marketing and most of the crypto community doesn‚Äôt understand what makes a winner a winner. 

XRP does not launch ICO‚Äôs (this is huge)
We will be getting volume and adoption from every area of crypto all combined into one highly scalable and efficient blockchain (the stellar network; native asset, the Lumen)


Concrete reasons why XLM will vastly outperform XRP:

Stellar (XLM) pays partners to join the network, Ripple (XRP) is trying to sell XRP to banks and institutions. Why would any bank pay to use XRP when they could use XLM for free and be paid to do so? They wouldn‚Äôt that‚Äôs why Ripples partnerships are mainly in the PoC phase (western union partnership announcement).

Stellar‚Äôs native currency, XLM is built into the ecosystem and must be used as the bridge currency in all transfers (ensuring XLM continues to have volume while the network is used, new SWIFT banking system) XRP was not designed this way and is a critical flaw. At any time, Ripple can chose to create additional bank specific coins to be used on the network for transfer. Banks could pay to use this new coin ( real bad news for XRP investors) or pay to use XRP, but they will choose XLM for free.

XLM was given the green light by New York‚Äôs Department of Financial Services. This is a huge advantage because it will allow USA compliant exchanges to list Stellar Lumens, and this is already in the works (Coinbase, Gemini soon to follow) XRP was not given this clearance even though they have been asking for this distinction for a long time.

Biggest reason: Jed McCaleb, co founder and main technological resource left XRP to design XLM. He‚Äôs the Steve Jobs of cryptocurrency, but is actually a really nice guy. He also is the main innovator in this space. Regarded imho as the best cryptographer in the world with an ultra elite background in DLT technology. He set aside the lions share of lumens to be given away for charity and adoption. Ripple XRP is keeping their currency for themselves. That‚Äôs normal, but not as affective. XLM will soon lead the cryptocurrency market.

If you think there is going to be deflation, you want as much cash as possible. If you think there is going to be inflation, you want as much assets as possible. Both are good, so you always want a combo of the two.

Inflation happens when a ton of people want something (such as GPUs at the peak of bitcoin mining) and deflation happens when no one wants something

In order to predict this, the best you can do is read the news and think out logically ‚Äúif this happens, what would happen next?‚Äù The more you observe this the better you get.

First thing you should do is get out of any debt you might have as quickly as possible, then build up a reserve and build up reputation in your field. Just like how money is valuable, reputation is just as valuable

Use credit cards often, and immediately pay it off, this will build up your credit score and you shouldn‚Äôt have issues getting loans when you need them.

ASIC Boost is something that was derided as very bad and evil by BCore (the creators of BCore BTC... well to be more correct the hijackers of the original Nakamoto/Andresson client) until they said it was good, and thus censored and memory-holed all history of it being bad which is par for the course from the ""anti-censorship"" coin who's existence to this day is probably only due to heavy rampant uncontrolled censorship and control of narrative.

It's basically nothing to worry about, I would be more worried about why I had client software that's probably unsafe installed on my system - lots of bugs in BCore's BTC software and one found just this week almost took the entire system down and inflated the currency if it weren't for the heroic actions of a Bitcoin (Cash) developer.

In addition to the future contracts, Bakkt is **creating a form of the Lightning network** for retailers that they're partnered with - and right out the gate, they partnered with [**the leader in mobile payments - Starbucks(they're bigger than Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay)**](https://www.cnet.com/news/starbucks-beats-apple-pay-google-pay-samsung-proximity/).  Not to mention the track record of the CEO(Jeffery Sprecher), who bought a struggling exchange for $1 in 1996 that was millions in debt and losing $1 million per month and turned that into the powerhouse that ICE is today - they now own 23 exchanges around the world, including the largest exchange in the world, The New York Stock Exchange.  They have a a strong track record buying failing, archaic exchanges and turning them into modern, ultra-efficient businesses.  His wife, Kelly Loeffler joined ICE early on(2002) and was crucial in turning ICE into the powerhouse it is today(they married in 2009) - she's also Bakkt's CEO.

They already have extensive experience/trust from the largest institutional investors in the world, and phase 1 is specifically targeted at onboarding as many as possible and bringing Bitcoin to Pensions, 401ks, Hedge funds, etc.  Not to mention FDIC insured custody solutions, regulatory compliance, essentially a lightning network for merchants, easy investing for your average Joe, all backed by ""physical"" Bitcoin... I think this is bigger than most realize.  This is far from just another futures platform, and it launches in less than 2 months.  A successful launch will also pave the way for CBOE's Bitcoin ETF approval. **Their goal is literally to replace swiping credit cards with scanning bitcoin apps.**  This is huge.

Also, important to note, this isn't their first foray into crypto - ICE bought a minority stake in Coinbase in January 2015, when Bitcoin was only $200.",2018-09-25 23:39:37

Pee on him. It's affectionate because it tells him he's yours.

&gt;Respect your husband (From the video: ‚ÄúWives, respect your husbands. It‚Äôs biblical - it‚Äôs in the bible.‚Äù)

Do *not* go to Olive Garden and throw your Tour of Italy at him because he ate the last breadstick. Do *not*.

&gt;Be his confidante

Constantly remind him that you know all his most damaging secrets. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

&gt;Fuel his love language

If he feels most loved when you make him a cup of tea, constantly give him tea. Even if he complains. That just means he wants it more. Tie him to the bed and pour piping hot tea over his open screaming mouth.

&gt;Give him space

Disappear for days at a time.

&gt;Don‚Äôt stop giving

If he complains that you're buying too many big screen TVs - keep buying more big screen TVs. He loves them. Don't stop giving, even if the bank takes your house and you end up living in a fort made out of big screen TVs.

&gt;Never stop learning

Men love it when you know off-the-wall things like how to build a pipe bomb, or how to use bitcoin to buy cocaine on the dark web.

&gt;Be interesting

Keep a room in your house just for you. Lock the door to the room and wear the key around your neck. Place a machine in the room that makes random noises like dogs barking or children screaming. Whenever you and your husband hear the noises, drop whatever you're doing and say ""I must tend to my flock"" and go inside the room for 1 hour. Never let him come with you.

&gt;Accept his help

Pretend you've forgotten how to wipe your ass. Men like to feel needed.

&gt;Do not compare him

Act like no other men even exist. Accidentally bump into random men in public and look confused. If you ever need to interact with a man in public, loudly question where the disembodied voice is coming from. Make sure your husband is in earshot so he knows how much you love him.

It‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs on the horizon but I can understand why some people are antsy about price. This will all change. The next bull run is going to be insane, one of he few times the ‚Äòlittle guys‚Äô are in before proper institutional players. Banks and stock markets are recommending diversification in to crypto assets of around 5% - that‚Äôs a huge chunk of money sat waiting on the side lines right now. One of the reasons I‚Äôm excited to see how BAKKT plays out.

Gott keep a firm eye on those fundamentals. We‚Äôve endured the year thus far in bear conditions. I‚Äôm numb to it now, I dont know about you guys. No point worrying about price, or even checking, frankly! It‚Äôs just demoralising and we all know not representative of the future. 
It could still be another 6 months before the markets turn, I think the catalyst now will be regulatory clarity and institutional access. Once that comes and the space is legitimised in the eyes of legality, there an influx of money waiting to diversify into this emerging asset class.

VeChain still needs time to really get on its feet, too, so I think at first we‚Äôll ride a wave of bitcoin bulls, then, as VeChain becomes more established and we see a proper flow of business through the Blockchain that blasts away the talk of ‚Äòscam‚Äô ‚ÄòChina hustle‚Äô and the doubts many for some reason place on this world class project, we‚Äôll see highly bullish movements in to VeChain.

e6l1nu8,CryptoRedemption,29,"There are a few different reasons.

For one, there are costs to process transactions and to secure the chain. How would those costs be recuperated without a coin?  It could take place through the legacy banking/financial system, but then it would either need to be pre-paid at a certain rate, or charged afterward and the tx's basically being extended on credit (in what will ideally be a incredibly dynamic system).  Having the ability to transfer value directly on the chain automatically based on actual usage greatly reduces friction/overhead, and eliminates risks of non-payment or under-payment.

Alternatively, an existing cryptocurrency could be used to transfer value (bitcoin? nano? stellar?) but then you're introducing reliance upon another cryptocurrency that can vary wildly in costs, new and unknown security risks, potential bottlenecks in speed, etc.  One of the core value propositions of VeChain's platform is that they intend to keep the cost of using the chain (cost per/tx via VTHO) relatively static.  This way, enterprises can anticipate and budget their costs like any other business expense.

On top of all of paying for the costs of writing/processing tx to the blockchain, a major goal of the VeChain platform is to facilitate trustless exchange between enterprises; That is not limited to data access, but also extends to value (money). This can be payment for data, payment for services, and payment any number of other costs that can come up via smart contracts and certain metrics/thresholds. Many of these things will be paid  for a la carte, or on an ongoing basis. Having a cryptocurrency that interacts with smart contracts allows for a whole new speed of business than what is possible otherwise, and reduces their dependence on trust!",2018-09-25 10:11:18

Edit: Sorry guys I didn't mean to say Siberian just got distracted (midnight here). I meant to say Eastern European and a Nordic Country or two. Many across the Western EU (Ireland, Spain, Netherlands, Luxemboug) are going to miss targets but Eastern Europe is looking pretty bad as well due to the increase use of Coal and the lack of diversification of their Energy Portfolio. This mainly comes down to lack of Public and also Private investment in those industries (Solar, Wind, Biomass, Hydro) as they look to continue using Coal and Natural Gas as it is cheap to generate power. On top of generation not being from renewables it also means emissions haven't been great due to dirty fuels. 

This isn't the case for the entire EU. Denmark has done very well, Iceland has pretty much unlimited clean energy (prime country for bitcoin mining and aluminium manufacturing) and the UK have been investing heavily in solar and offshore wind. Estonia has also done very well and has exceeded their 2020 target which resulted in them selling their excess energy credits/points to Luxembourg, an EU first. It is anticipated other countries that fail their targets will look for similar agreements across the EU, but really it is quite poor as it is a statistical method of getting around their obligations.

e6mkxqg,BlottoOtter,32,"I haven't followed the Tether scandal that closely the last few months, but I'll try and give some highlights as I understand it.

Tether LTD, based in Hong Kong, has a token (USDT) that it claims is fully backed by US dollar reserves, at $1 for every 1 USDT token. [Many have accused them of fraud](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-tether-truth-machine-the-wheels-of-justice-turn-slowly-but-grind-exceedingly-finely-8e3bd72ad011), and Tether has never provided proof of its reserves; is forbidden from doing business with American customers; bears similarities to other digital token/currency schemes that have run afoul of US authorities; and has had frequent, well-reported problems finding a bank that will take its business. Despite this, USDT somehow still trades at about $1 and a staggering amount of cryptocurrency is bought and sold using USDT instead of actual US dollars.

Bitfinex, one of the largest crypto exchanges, has some sort of ownership relationship with Tether; this fact was hidden for a long time, and was only exposed [in a document leak known as the Paradise Papers.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-05/mystery-shrouds-tether-and-its-links-to-biggest-bitcoin-exchange) Bitfinex has also had significant problems finding a bank to take its business, is heavily reliant on USDT to facilitate crypto trading on its platform in lieu of actual US dollars, and has been accused by some of either tacitly permitting or being complicit in a wide variety of malicious and manipulative trading practices on its platform.

Regarding both organizations' banking problems: if memory serves, they were kicked out by Wells Fargo in early 2017, after which their banking situation was never clear, but seems to have included stints working with banks first in Hong Kong and then in Europe before forging a relationship with [Noble Bank in Puerto Rico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitfinex-said-to-find-bank-in-puerto-rico-after-wells-fargo-exit) earlier this year.

This is where it gets really murky, and I haven't kept up lately. Noble Bank seems to be shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, much like Bitfinex and Tether. Bitfinexed [has looked into some of the links between these parties](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/the-tether-truth-machine-the-wheels-of-justice-turn-slowly-but-grind-exceedingly-finely-8e3bd72ad011), which include connections with a law firm that performed a bizarre [fake audit of Tether](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cryptocurrencies-tether/cryptocurrency-firm-tether-releases-law-firm-report-attesting-to-u-s-dollar-reserves-idUSKBN1JG1SB) and also has ties to [a Pacific casino accused of money laundering](https://factfreeh.wordpress.com/tag/imperial-pacific/). And now, it seems a number of executives at Noble are leaving the company, raising suspicions that they're leaving because a looming problem, and in the process reigniting concerns about Tether being a scam that threatens the whole cryptocurrency market because of the pervasiveness of USDT.

e6my0pf,nullc,29,"meh.

I think ""bitcoin"" companies being tech laggards and spending their time adopting yet another altcoin rather than keeping current is a real concern. ... one that even draws question on the competence of regulators (not that we really needed more examples...), since regulated exchanges keep getting approved to add more altcoins when their Bitcoin support isn't even current to Bitcoin circa 2013 (e.g. uncompressed pubkeys, no batching, no segwit, no sending to bc1 addresses).

But breaking backwards compatibility isn't a good way to do it.  I think the message you're sending is ""you should oppose improvements to Bitcoin, because eventually you're going to be _forced_ into using them."".

As an author of [BIP 173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) I think BC1 addresses are a good improvement, but not remotely important enough to give people a justifiable basis to oppose future changes.

When we designed segwit we explicitly left out a new address format in part to avoid tying segwit to the ability to send to new addresses, since we knew that it was going to take a long time before wallets and services could uniformly send to them. IIRC, it took something like two years for bc.i to be able to send to p2sh addresses.

Right now it seems many businesses prefer to add altcoins instead of keeping their bitcoin support state of the art because thats what makes them money.  This equation changes if people choose to do business elsewhere, and people can make that choice without breaking compatibility.  Organic customer demand at least lets them stick with a cost/benefit trade-off and make their own decision. And besides, I think the failure to stay current sends a valuable signal about a business' operations that we'd lose by forcing it.

Yes, you are correct, the way the Stellar network works is that the only trustless asset is xlm.


#2
Since anyone can issue an asset/stock/token whatever on the network you have to be careful on who you trust. You have to pick your 'anchors' carefully.


#3
And you should NEVER trust an unknown custodian. So it's not trustless, its you choose who you trust. The SDEX has worked like this for a long time, before StellarX existed.


#4
I can understand that you do not see the value in it, because you still have to trust someone to redeem your bitcoin/litecoin/xrp/usd/euro/whatever token.


#5
And I think the warning of choosing which asset you trust should be even more clear (although it is quite clearly written on the StellarX website)
Since it's decentralized, there is no option of locking anyone out (not even scam anchors) from the SDEX.


#6
There seems to already be serious anchors in the space. And many traders are likely to find the free trading useful. And are likely to redeem their btc/ltc/xrp/usd tokens to the real assets with varying frequency.


#7
I think the volume will come both because Interstellar is a serious actor in the space, and because there are no trading fees.


#8
And because Interstellar are incentivizing trading quite heavily:

&gt;StellarX‚Äôs marketplace is greenfield for experienced traders. We pay out 100k XLM (roughly $20,000) each week to top market makers. 


#9
If you find that this is not of interest to you, then you should definitely use something more appropriate for your specific needs.


#### a
I don't think StellarX will suit for every trader, but rather it's one more choice for consumers. 

#### b
And personally I think that is both a good thing, and that the StellarX will be awesome!

Also feel free to correct me if anything here was factually incorrect.

e6pzxkq,grmpfpff,211,"You can make up reasons like ""he owns btc so he had to"" to distract from the fact that this one developer found not only a bug, but the holy grail of all bugs. 

He is a bch developer and could have chosen to sit there with his laptop on the beach and not only generate Bitcoins out of thin air, no. He could have done the same for Litecoins, and every over coin that is based on Bitcoin Cores code.

He could have waited until the bug was fixed on his coin of choice and then wipe the entire competition of it out with a few transactions, they all contained the bug that Bitcoin developers added to save a few milliseconds of validation time. I'm not sure how many people understand this. Imagine you wake up and there suddenly is 42 million Bitcoins instead of 21 million. Or 840 million Litecoins. And the networks heavily disrupted because the bug crashes Bitcoin's nodes. 

He chose not to. He used the right channels to inform the necessary developers of his findings. And Bitcoin Core developers tried to discredit him, twittered that he is full of shit etc.

You still think that the community of the Bitcoin fork from last summer are all lunatics and scammers?


Edit: 

since this is blowing up, here is a little idea what one could have done with that knowledge:

Create a little script (like the ones used during the stress tests) that creates transactions 24/7. Send those transactions to all major coins that are vulnerable to the bug, and those free coins directly to major exchanges, to top up various freshly created accounts of online shops, and the best: exchange those coins directly on shapeshift and changelly and coin shufflers. Over and over again.

Imagine you can create free Bitcoins every 10 minutes, free Litecoins every 2.5 minutes, free (enter Bitcoin fork of your choice here) and exchange them right on shapeshift to every coin you want, send the coins to every major exchange to trade them for coins that you don't like. Until the bug gets finally identified and fixed, you can create the biggest mess the crypto world has ever seen. 

If you believe that Eminem killed MGK with one single song, try to imagine what this could have done to a 300 Billion Dollar market. 

Thank /u/awemany for doing the right thing and never forget it.

Edit 2: Waking up to reddit gold (premium) and news about a Bitcoin Testnet Chainsplit on a friday morning, priceless! Let me add a fun fact to show my appreciation:

Since BCH upgrades via hard forks regularly, this means that after the next hard fork upgrade in November **Bitcoin Cash will be the only fork of Bitcoin with 100% immunity against this bug**. Since the Bitcoin Unlimited Client was never affected in the first place and all other nodes have to be updated to still participate, bye bye Inflation bug. BAM! 

Good luck to all other coins that don't do hard forks. As long as old vulnerable nodes stay compatible, their coin will never be 100% secure. A miner with majority hash power can install an old node with the inflation bug anytime and blow the coin up.",2018-09-27 16:58:25
e6oxktn,NanoIsNeat,122,"I am an ideological advocate. I tend to appreciate things that have a bigger picture behind them. That is one of the reasons that cryptocurrency was interesting to me, beginning many years ago when I heard about this new idea called Bitcoin.

Over the past few years, Bitcoin has fallen by the wayside. Yes, I know is that it is still the largest and the oldest. It has a legacy of security that is difficult to ignore, and rightfully so.

What people have lost sight of was the original causation of Bitcoin's development. It was never supposed to become the Church of Bitcoin. Instead, it was supposed to be the scrappy underdog, a form of currency owned by no one and available for use to anyone. No politics, no control, no regulation. It would be a self-regulating exchange of value, answering to no one.

Bitcoin has lost that. It is now essentially controlled by large miners, charging enormous fees as they consume huge amounts of energy resources.

Additionally, issues have arisen with Bitcoin functionality. The idea of six confirmations at 10 minutes per has become antiquated. It should not take an hour for a transaction to take place. The fact that it does means you cannot use it for microtransactions, such as purchasing a coffee or paying for parking.

Nano has solved every issue holding back adoption of cryptocurrency as a global standard of value transfer. It is instant. It has no fees. It allows for the transfer of microtransactions. It is secure. It requires minimum energy resource.",2018-09-27 05:17:31

e6sj43h,Philosognostic,71,"You are 100% correct. There needs to be solidarity, but we cannot do it here on reddit. 

There is a fear that attempts in this direction will cause us to be next on the chopping block. I am of the opinion that they will come for us anyway regardless, and since we have alternatives such as voat when the banhammer comes it won't achieve what our enemies think it will, so fuck it damned if we do damned if we don't.

But this seems to be an unpopular opinion here. I understand the reasoning of those who believe we should keep our heads down, but I cannot condone it. In our blue pilled days, before we awoke, we appeased the women in our lives and look what that led to. In the 1930s, the reaction to Germany's expansion was appeasement, look what that led to. Appeasement to an aggressor does not work, rather it encourages them further.

One of the dangers of Mgtow is that it is easy to fall into the belief that we are all our own islands and that the larger world only effects us if we let it. This is not the case. We are faced with a fanatical foe, to whom the very idea that someone, somewhere is not following the narrative in anathema, a heresy so great it must be rooted out. They have taken the courts, they have taken academia, they have taken the media, and there is right now an attempt to take as much of the internet as they can. What's going on with Linux is a prime example. Video games, movies, comics, all forms of entertainment they have converged just so we cannot find refuge from them and their insane crusade. 

Sooner or later, together or alone we will all have to make our stand somewhere. 

I understand why many of our brothers might view talk such as this as ""not true Mgtow"", repeating that we are not a movement. They are correct Mgtow is not a movement. However since the left has declared a de facto war on all men, whether or not we are or are not a movement does not matter, the fact that we are men makes us targets and since the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"" no longer seems to apply, sticking our heads in the sand and pretending the storm will pass us by is suicidal. Extending a hand to those with whom we have a common cause loses us nothing, and there is safety in numbers. Again I am not speaking of reddit, or the internet even, ""meatspace"" is where this needs to happen where the risk of infiltration and surveillance is less. 

Human beings have an inbuilt ""optimism bias"". We are capable of acknowledging that bad shit happens, but we aren't so good at realizing that bad shit can happen to us. We tend to resist those kinds of thoughts with great vigor. Think on every man who came here and told us of how his marriage exploded, think on every relationship you have had that went sideways out of nowhere, think on our mockery of TRP's idea that if one lifts more, and holds frame, one cannot be metoo'd. Do you think that any of them ever thought, ever really acknowledged that such could happen to them? 

They did not. Neither did I at times, and neither did anyone reading this at some point or another in their lives. We learned the hard way, and in many cases that is what it took to take the red pill in the first place. The question is, do we have to learn the hard way again? 

The signs are quite readable, and have been since the coordinated attack on Alex Jones. Like it or not, open war will soon be upon us whether we would have it or no. Quarantines, and bans online is how it will start, but not where it will end. I would advise us all to be prepared for that.

How did it come to this? 

Many factors played a role, a collective appeasement of feminism, a left that has been organizing and radicalizing ever since Bush ""stole"" the 2000 election, a right that has been controlled opposition ever since Reagan got in, an economy that has never quite recovered from the 9/11 attacks onwards, forcing many to concentrate so much on day to day survival that the larger dystopian trends went unnoticed for far too long, the list goes on and much farther back.

So I will concentrate only on something that we as Mgtows easily fall victim to, becoming the davos man.

Not long after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a certain dumbass proclaimed that we had reached ""the end of history"", and that ideology was dead, only the ""market"" mattered and that humanity's next growth would be to become the davos man, with no ties to country, religion, or creed, living only for his own ""enlightend self interest"". Sounds like us on the surface, doesn't it?

You know what else it sounds like? Every woman I've ever met. 

The difference is that on this sub I have seen threads from men coming from low and dark places in their lives, and we supported them. Why? How does doing so serve our own self interest outside of a few upvotes? It does not, and yet we do it anyway don't we? You cannot convince me for a single moment that we have not prevented at least one suicide here, that we have not been the spark behind a man reclaiming his life and self respect, and so the question is since doing so does not benefit us individually, why do we do it? 

Because we are not davos men. Because within most of us is a core of empathy, a core of honor, an understanding of what is just and what is not and an instinct to fight said injustice. Don't believe me? Then why are there so many posts pointing out when some broad fucks some guy over? Warning others, yeah that plays a part, but there is more to it than that. Why so many posts over the last night bemoaning the world in which we live? 

Because it is stark injustice on full display and it sticks in our craw. The world we find ourselves in now is the result of people going full davos man. Self centered short term profit seeking and power grubbing at any and all costs regardless of who or what it destroys or what the long term consequences shall be. 

So we have a choice to make. Do we become davos man, and damn the world for what selfish pleasure we can gain from it, and become something no different than our enemies?

Or do we acknowledge that we are part of a civilization that was once great and could be again if only evil was confronted and stomped back down into the fucking earth? 

I do not in any way shape or form advocate a return to the plantation, let's make that very clear.

What I am calling for is us to stop pretending that world events do not concern us. We live in houses that rely on a power grid, we purchase more food than we hunt or grow, and we are all at the mercy of larger economic forces. (yes even you bitcoin lords and investors, where is your wealth when the power goes out?) And if unfounded accusations are the new standard of immediate conviction, not a goddam one of us is safe no matter how much we isolate ourselves. 

I understand that to many I may as well be speaking elvish, many of you are too young to remember a world where postmodernistic bullshit was not the rule of the day, and where taking a stand on something was respected, not mocked. I understand the reluctance to being tied down firmly to an opinion or a cause or an ideal for fear of being judged, that seems to be a common hallmark of almost everyone born since 1990, and the true reason behind the sjw explosion of the last decade. I wonder just how many of the sjws exist not because they are true believers, but because their fear of being outcast cripples them so deeply that can do nothing else but follow those who seem to in control. I also wonder how many were simply looking for something greater than themselves and joined up because all of the institutions that once served that purpose have been brutally descontructed over the last 30 years, leaving only the radical left....

Having said that, the fact you're here and Mgtow tells me you're strong minded enough to tell the herd to go fuck itself. So you've made your stand and a difficult one at that. I'm not going to tell you who to join, you know who we have common cause with and who we do not. What I will say is this, there are over 70 thousand of us, just on this sub. There are 300 thousand or so very pissed of TRPers right now, and I have a feeling our ranks intersect more than either they or we would be comfortable admitting. 

We could be a large thumb on the scale if we found the proper place to apply it.

A couple more of my own observations, here:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9jh2gk/deadalnix_can_you_please_stop_pushing_the_malfix/e6rjpk4/  

SegWit also never received consensus to get added to BTC by itself. Greg Maxwell promised it would get approved with &gt;95% of network hash rate, but the most miner support SegWit received on its own was just under 40% for months on end (briefly topping 40% on a few occasions.) As hash rate support for Bitcoin Unlimited / XT's adjustable block size hard fork was slowly climbing past 50%, SegWit2x got announced and quickly took over miner support. However, since then, ""BTC"" has repudiated the Nakamoto Consensus dictated by a [96% hash rate lock-in](https://twitter.com/mikebelshe/status/905737617718870018) and failed to activate the promised 2 MB block size limit. So the consensus agreement has never been fulfilled, and SegWit really has been added to ""BTC"" illegitimately. This action has also rendered ""BTC"" invalid per the Bitcoin white paper, and the name ""Bitcoin"" by rights belongs to the *valid* SHA256 block chain with most cumulative proof of work, which is Bitcoin (BCH) right now.  

Meanwhile, SegWit has now been active on the ""BTC"" block chain for over a year now, and it's still only adding about 0.44 MB worth of effective block size increase, on average.  

Perhaps worst of all, none of this has proven necessary. Scores of hard forks have occurred on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and beyond since last year, proving the claim that hard forks are catastrophically risky is entirely false. A malleability fix could've been added via a clean hard fork without Anyone-Can-Spend, the SegWit fee discount, and all the technical bloat. Together with a sensible block size increase, the Bitcoin community would still be unified. Instead, LN, which was supposed to be fully deployed and delivering on its promises in Summer 2015 is still perpetually 18 months away from being usable for most users, and fees regularly spike on ""BTC"" even in this continuing bear market.  

To sum up, SegWit is the codified lie that Core / Blockstream used to mutate the world's ""Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" into a crippled, nearly utility-free store-of-value-only system, and they did so by completely rejecting Nakamoto Consensus in the process.

On the other hand, monetary situation is bit particular, its not like in Venezuela or Argentina where inflation is breaking thru the roof. In cuba we have our own fuked up currency which never goes up or down ( cuz the government says so)  so prices of goods don‚Äôt fluctuate that much, there was a time in the 80s where u could buy all kind of things with almost nothing but back then we used the dollar and the country was supported buy the Russians, but after the 90s when we dropped the dollar mainly pushed by the USA we then went thru a critical social and exonomical crisis, we implemented our own shitcoin ( call the chavito or cuc ) in a desperate measure to save the economy, however we messed up even more at the point that today our country is fully OUT of the world‚Äôs economical system. Our currency have no value whatsoever abroad and no country exchanges it, you only find it in Cuba and if you want it u have to get it only there. Its more or less like a scammy ICO who got sold 100% and the company is dictating everything you do or the value the currency has since they ‚Äòthe gov‚Äô decides its value like if theres no market to decide for it, like a BIG BROTHER UP THERE.

Also there are packages that are sold out, meaning that assuming the mobile operator gave them a decent amount of data allotment, enough people continue to gobble up the data. 

Second, it doesn‚Äôt matter all that much. Why? Because in my eyes dent is an incomplete product right now. I‚Äôd rather have more people download and use the product when it‚Äôs got the best product rather than let them leave thinking Dent is only a way to buy data through a third party app. It will offer so much more in the next couple of quarters. How many users do you think will become fanboys/girls and follow all future product releases of some random app? It would be so much better if they discover it for the first time when it has features like watching ads for data, essentially giving people a way to earn free data especially in countries where data is very expensive. 

Third, marketing is key to why people don‚Äôt talk about it. Dent ramped up marketing earlier this year mainly to meet the roadmap goal and prove that they could do it, however I think that they slowed down because they don‚Äôt want to waste all of their money marketing a product that isn‚Äôt in its final form. Only 3.9 million users in a multi-billion person market? Yea they have a lot more room to grow and they left plenty of room for people that will be able to discover dent when it has so much to offer. Crypto in general has articles because certain crypto are buzz words, if you mention bitcoin, or vechain or any other, you‚Äôll get clicks, dent doesn‚Äôt have as much buzz around it so people talk about it less. That‚Äôs just how most media works, they just follow whatever is hyped and talk about it so that they can get more article clicks.

###How Dirty Money Disappears Into the Black Hole of Cryptocurrency
######Journal investigation documents suspicious trades through venture capital-backed ShapeShift

A North Korean agent, a stolen-credit-card peddler and the mastermind of an $80 million Ponzi scheme had a common problem. They needed to launder their dirty money.

They found a common solution in ShapeShift AG, an online exchange backed by established American venture-capital firms that lets people anonymously trade bitcoin, which police can track, for other digital currencies that can‚Äôt be followed.

Since bitcoin was introduced nearly 10 years ago, law-enforcement authorities have worried the technology could ease money laundering. Now a new breed of cryptocurrency intermediary is giving fresh urgency to those fears, operating in plain view with scant policing and often allowing users to engage in anonymous transactions.

A Wall Street Journal investigation identified nearly $90 million in suspected criminal proceeds that flowed through such intermediaries over two years.

Most operate beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, with unidentified owners and addresses in places such as Eastern Europe and China. 

Not ShapeShift, the largest recipient of the funds with a U.S. presence. The company is officially registered in loosely regulated Switzerland, but it is run out of a 1980s-era office building in a Denver neighborhood packed with tech companies and marijuana entrepreneurs. ShapeShift‚Äôs founder and chief executive, Erik Voorhees, along with its chief operating officer and its marketing chief, all live in the Denver area.

The company‚Äôs financial backers include Pantera Capital and FundersClub in California and Access Venture Partners in Colorado. Partners with Pantera and Access said their legal reviews satisfied them that ShapeShift is operating within the law. FundersClub and its partners didn‚Äôt respond to messages seeking comment.

A parade of suspected criminals has taken advantage of ShapeShift‚Äôs services since the exchange began in 2014, according to law-enforcement officials, independent researchers and the Journal‚Äôs investigation. 

After hackers believed to be from North Korea extorted millions of dollars in the so-called WannaCry ransomware attack on businesses and governments, the criminals used ShapeShift to convert bitcoin into an untraceable cryptocurrency called Monero, security researchers found. For the next year, ShapeShift made no changes to its policy of not identifying its customers, and continued to process millions of dollars in criminal proceeds, according to the Journal investigation. 

Many cryptocurrency exchanges say they follow federal rules intended to combat money laundering, even though the question of whether they are subject to them hasn‚Äôt been tested. They keep records of their customers‚Äô identity and monitor transactions to root out and report suspicious activity.

Mr. Voorhees has long scoffed at such constraints. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people should have their identity recorded to catch an occasional criminal,‚Äù he said in a May interview.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on software that acts as a digital ledger maintained across thousands of computers. The ledgers, or blockchains, for most cryptocoins are publicly viewable, and allow people to track the movements of coins from one anonymous online account or wallet to the next. That anonymity can be broken, though, when a criminal trades bitcoin for dollars. Bad actors must therefore figure out a way to erase traces of their crimes from their currency‚Äôs digital trail.

To examine the scope of crypto money laundering, the Journal built computer programs that tracked funds from more than 2,500 suspected investment frauds, hacks, blackmail schemes and other alleged crimes that used bitcoin and Ethereum by analyzing the currencies‚Äô underlying software.

The Journal‚Äôs analysis‚Äîwhich encompassed only a narrow slice of suspected criminal behavior involving cryptocurrencies‚Äîidentified $88.6 million laundered through 46 exchanges. Many alleged perpetrators are unknown or on the run. Some were arrested. A small portion of the money, less than $2 million that the Journal identified, may have been seized by law enforcement in a few cases, though court filings don‚Äôt list precise amounts.

The Journal found that ShapeShift processed nearly $9 million of the suspect funds, more than any other exchange with U.S. offices.

The Journal provided ShapeShift with a list of the suspicious addresses it found using the exchange. In response, Veronica McGregor, who joined ShapeShift last month as its chief legal officer, said the company reviewed those addresses and banned them from using the exchange.

Ms. McGregor also said ShapeShift plans to start requiring users to provide identification starting Oct. 1. She said the company is doing that to ‚Äúde-risk‚Äù itself in the face of potential new regulations and abuse by criminals, ‚Äúnot in response to any regulatory enforcement action.‚Äù She said the company plans to start monitoring for and reporting potential money laundering.

Ms. McGregor said she wants to separate Mr. Voorhees‚Äôs views from the company‚Äôs. ‚ÄúJust because it‚Äôs the personal philosophy of the CEO doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs how the business is going to be run,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not pro-money-laundering.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how the money trail was disguised in one example the Journal traced to ShapeShift. An online entity calling itself Starscape Capital collected almost $2.2 million from investors who were promised outsize returns. Investors paid Starscape by depositing Ethereum, the most popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, into an anonymous wallet. Starscape‚Äôs website soon went dark, and investors began complaining online about their missing money.

Ethereum, like many cryptocurrencies, has a publicly viewable ledger, even though the identity of the wallet holder isn‚Äôt readily apparent. So the recipients of the money decided to hide their trail before cashing out. They sent millions of dollars in Ethereum to two exchanges via separate routes. One stream of money went to another anonymous wallet and onto an Asian exchange called KuCoin, the Journal investigation found. Another $517,000 went directly to ShapeShift, which exchanged it for Monero. At that point the trail vanished.

The Monero could then be traded for clean bitcoin or sold for hard currency without any way to trace it back to the original transaction. The Starscape founders haven‚Äôt been identified.

The 12 million-plus transactions the Journal analyzed reveal numerous instances of suspicious behavior: The pseudonymous Marco Fike [raised more than $2 million for a made-up bitcoin startup and disappeared](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/cryptocurrency-scammers-of-giza-make-off-with-2-million-after-ico.html); Makoto Takahashi (also an apparent alias) got nearly $600,000 to develop an online betting platform that never launched; a ‚Äúsextortion‚Äù racket raised money blackmailing people by threatening to release explicit photos. Even spoofers who robbed ShapeShift‚Äôs own would-be customers by setting up a copycat ShapeShift website that stole their money used the real ShapeShift to launder their funds, according to publicly visible online data reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Voorhees points out that ShapeShift does offer a measure of transparency‚Äîmuch like bitcoin itself, it allows people to see the movement of cryptocurrency, but not to identify the owner. The exchange‚Äôs system lets people see which anonymous wallets received cryptocurrency, but in the case of Monero, recipient addresses and transaction amounts remain secret and the trail is severed.

Mr. Voorhees has argued that ShapeShift and similar cryptocurrency exchanges that don‚Äôt take custody of customer funds shouldn‚Äôt be subject to anti-money-laundering regulations. ‚ÄúThis whole narrative that the government is out to protect people is total bullshit,‚Äù he said.

The U.S. Department of Treasury appears to disagree. Asked at a recent event about ShapeShift, Kevin O‚ÄôConnor, an enforcement officer at Treasury‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said that any crypto-to-crypto exchange that has U.S. customers must comply with rules governing money transmitters. A FinCEN spokesman said Mr. O‚ÄôConnor was speaking broadly and not just in relation to ShapeShift.

Other exchanges, including U.S.-based Bittrex, say they follow federal guidelines. Among other things, Bittrex says it examines where funds originated and how many intermediary wallets they passed through before arriving.

Still, the Journal found that $6.3 million in funds from apparent criminal activity flowed into Bittrex. Some of that was confiscated by law enforcement, for example in the case of a man who recently pleaded guilty to selling drugs and laundering money.

Europol, the European policing agency, has investigated several cases in which criminals used ShapeShift, says a person close to those probes. U.S. authorities also are keenly aware of ShapeShift‚Äôs role in exchanging suspicious funds, says a person with direct knowledge. ‚ÄúYou can only run a red light so many times before you get pulled over,‚Äù the person says.

Lured by bitcoin‚Äôs boom, investors in Europe, California and Colorado looked past legal risks to put more than $12 million behind ShapeShift. They say Mr. Voorhees, who says he ‚Äúwould like the national government to be dissolved,‚Äù has convinced them he is a pragmatic businessman willing to follow federal laws.

‚ÄúI trust Erik. I know that Erik is not a first-time entrepreneur,‚Äù says Paul Veradittakit, of Pantera Capital, one of the most prominent crypto-focused venture funds and an investor in ShapeShift. He says Pantera examined the model of an instant exchange that doesn‚Äôt collect user ID, and decided it was worth betting on, particularly after meeting with Mr. Voorhees, whom Mr. Veradittakit calls ‚Äúa visionary.‚Äù

&gt; A passenger found in possession of ‚Ç¨30,000 in cash after disembarking the catamaran from Sicily on Friday, has landed a hefty fine and a suspended sentence upon his arraignment on Saturday.

&gt; Chinese-national Hao Lin, 26, residing at Catania, was stopped for routine checks by customs officials, stating he had nothing to declare.

&gt; However, a search of the man‚Äôs bags revealed ‚Ç¨10,000, while another ‚Ç¨10,000 were discovered inside his car‚Äôs glove compartment. A third bundle of ‚Ç¨10,000 were found hidden inside the man‚Äôs trousers.

&gt; Two counterfeit banknotes, a ‚Ç¨100 and a ‚Ç¨50 note, were also found in his possession.

&gt; The passenger who was arrested and arraigned on Saturday, pleaded guilty to charges of possessing counterfeit money as well as failing to declare the cash in excess of the legal threshold of ‚Ç¨10,000.

&gt; Upon the accused‚Äôs own admission, the court, presided over by magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech, declared him guilty and condemned him to a fine of ‚Ç¨7557 according to law which, in such circumstances, lays down a fine equivalent to 25% of the total sum involved.

&gt; As for the possession of the counterfeit money, the accused was handed down a 13-month jail term suspended for two years. The sum of ‚Ç¨20,230 was confiscated.

Romans, Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Incas of Peru.  Civilizations that didn't even communicate with each other. 

If you walked into a time machine with stocks, bonds, dollars, real estate deeds, cryptocurrency paper wallets, and gold bullion coins, and walked into a medieval village, only the gold bullion coins would have any value.

This is because gold has **unique physical characteristics**.

- Human beings find gold to be physically beautiful.  1.3 billion Indians even view gold as [mandatory for weddings](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/indias-love-affair-with-gold-30-05-2012/), as part of their culture.

- Gold is extremely dense, so it's hard to counterfeit. 

- Gold has a low melting point, so it's easy to work with. 

- Gold is corrosion-resistant. 

- Gold is a good conductor of electricity (all modern electronics have some gold inside). You and I are currently communicating using smartphones/tablets/laptops that rely on gold. [Link #1](https://blog.dell.com/en-us/how-much-gold-is-in-smartphones-and-computers/) [Link #2](https://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml) 

Today, most gold that is mined is used for [jewelry, electronics, industrial purposes](http://etfdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-gold-tree-infographic.png).  Only a minority of gold is used for investment / currency purposes.  Gold has intrinsic value, meaning that even if nobody will pay you for your gold, it still has functional value. 

People who say Bitcoin is ""digital gold"" are scammers.  Bitcoin does not have the PHYSICAL characteristics that make gold valuable, and Bitcoin has no link to physical gold whatsoever.  Just because someone declares something to be ""gold"" doesn't make it so.

Bitcoin was designed to be a currency &amp; payment system, a P2P electronic cash system, which is the path that Bitcoin Cash continues with.
