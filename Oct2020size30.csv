https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/mueller-clinton-arizona-hack/

&gt;“I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” said then-candidate Trump at a press conference, referring to emails Clinton stored on a personal email server while she headed the State Department. Mueller’s report said “within approximately five hours” of those remarks, GRU officers began targeting for the first time Clinton’s personal office.

&gt;More than a dozen staffers were targeted by Unit 26165, including a senior aide. **“It is unclear how the GRU was able to identify these email accounts, which were not public,”** said Mueller.

&gt;Mueller said the Trump campaign made efforts to “find the deleted Clinton emails.” Trump is said to have privately asked would-be national security advisor Michael Flynn, since convicted following inquiries by the Special Counsel’s office, to reach out to associates to obtain the emails. **One of those associates was Peter Smith, who died by suicide in May 2017,** who claimed to be in contact with Russian hackers — claims which Mueller said were not true.

https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/cryptocurrency-helped-russian-operatives-hack-the-dnc-in-2016.html

&gt;In an attempt to further conceal their identities, the intelligence officers created hundreds of different email accounts to make the purchases, converted funds into different cryptocurrencies, and acquired bitcoin through peer-to-peer exchanges. **Investigators found that the same computers that were facilitating the bitcoin transactions were also used to create and send test spearfishing emails.**

https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/13/russian-hackers-used-bitcoin-to-fund-election-interference-so-prepare-for-fud/

&gt;But the process of laundering, after all, becomes rather difficult when there is an immutable, peer-maintained record of every penny being pushed around. Small slip-ups in the team’s operational security allowed investigators to tie, for example, an email address used to access a given bitcoin wallet with the one used to pay for a VPN.

&gt;**""[U]sing funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators purchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the @Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used […] to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com website.""**

&gt;It’s likely that the very same distributed ledger technology that allows for anonymous international payments in the first place also creates an invaluable investigative tool for those savvy enough to take advantage of it. So although bitcoin has its shady side, it’s far from perfect secrecy, especially when exposed to the privileges of a federal investigative team.

g7b8wky,ARRRBEEE,31,"Alright now that the initial ""shock"" has subsided a little bit re: the BitMEX news, I've had a moment to gather my thoughts. Here they are:

* This is a *big* deal (indicted for Bank Secrecy Act shit in NY state is a yikes), and has the potential to snowball into a ***really big*** deal, but it will take time to sort out in court. Thankfully for BitMEX's founders they're all legit billionaires, so they will have the best legal defense money can buy. Literally. They'll certainly need it because of hilariously flagrant shit like this:

&gt; One defendant went as far as to brag the company incorporated in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. because bribing regulators in that jurisdiction cost just ‘a coconut'

* IANAL but the long-term most-likely outcome is that BitMEX simply settles and pays a [massive] fine (CFTC shakedown as another Reddit calls out below). As many have astutely pointed out below, BitMEX's exchange product doesn't touch fiat currency so there's a valid case to be made in their favor. Since CFTC has no jurisdiction over a business registered in Seychelles (or Bermuda), the exchange will continue to exist (albeit with strict KYC/AML procedures).
* There is a **BLACK-SWAN** possibility that a separate 3-letter US law enforcement agency seizes the BitMEX.com domain. This *might* occur if BitMEX refuses to settle with the CFTC and/or another agency is somehow emboldened to take action. This is probably very bad.
* If you're not a trader, but have a long-term bullish bias on Bitcoin--nothing really changes. This doesn't change the value proposition of Bitcoin as an asset. It *might* change the short-/mid- term supply/demand mechanics (resulting in low spot prices), but that still remains to be seen. DCA, buy the dips, whatever. You're chillin'.

Things I'm looking out for &amp; how I plan on trading this:

* 2 out of the 3 BitMEX founders need to be physically present to approve withdrawals from cold storage. ([Source](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-security/)) These guys will be out free on-bail same-day, but in the unlikely scenario where 2 out of 3 are in jail, then withdrawals will be temporarily suspended. This may induce panic in the market (although ironically, if you can't withdraw physical coins, then you can't sell sooo... bullish? /s)
* Keep a sharp eye on BitMEX open interest. Traders on the platform are now faced with two risk vectors: price AND counterparty. Logically, if you want to hedge *price* risk you can do 1 of 2 things: 1) withdraw and sell your coins spot **OR** 2) short synthetic swap/futures. If you you want to hedge counterparty risk, you simply withdraw--but first you must close out your position(s). If open interest falls dramatically along with the price, then that tells me traders are closing out longs (and possibly exiting the platform). There's not a whole lot of leverage left in the system though. (Mex OI is roughly 1/2 of what it was in February and we're at the same price)
* Pay attention to the spot market volumes &amp; CME/Bakkt. I used to shit on them, but Bakkt has quietly become a noteworthy force in the game. They're consistently doing at-or-above the same volume as Coinbase on the BTC-USD pair on their physically-settled daily futures product. CME volume was very low at the end of the last quarter and open interest is at-or-below summer levels. The biggest institutions don't give a shit about BitMEX so if they're thinking macro, the narrative that PJT espoused for example, still seems very valid.
* Despite all this FUD, we're holding the 50D EMA ($10,490ish on Coinbase/Stamp). No real need to panic--well within the chop zone. Daily close below $10K and we're probably fucked.

g7djypp,Tricky_Troll,12,"I know we hate to talk about it but here's quite an important PSA for many of you.

***Tax authorities have been gathering records from crypto exchanges and you may want to sort out your taxes before they audit you.***

Now, I get it. We hate to acknowledge it. The laws are outdated and unfair in most countries and why should I pay taxes if I haven’t sold crypto back into fiat? I’m not here to tell you whether or not you should pay taxes on crypto or not, I’m just warning you all so that you don't get an unexpected visit from the tax man.

The following countries have recently been going through this data and auditing cryptocurrency holders.

United States: https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-tax-looms-irs-orders-coinbase-turn-over-user-data/

Australia: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-30/ato-ramps-up-data-matching-in-cryptocurrency-crackdown/11059446

New Zealand: https://nz.easycrypto.ai/blog/inland-revenue-info-request-to-nz-crypto-companies-sept-2020/

**This is not an exhaustive list.** Other countries will be doing the same and if you haven’t paid taxes yet I suggest you do some research into what the laws are and if your government is auditing cryptocurrency buyers and traders. If you pay taxes now, you will avoid bigger fines which are given for not disclosing your gains in crypto.

**How do I know if I need to pay taxes?**

It is fair to assume that if you have made any crypto trade where the value of your crypto when making this trade is greater than when you bought your crypto then you should be researching what your tax obligations are. A trade includes crypto to crypto trades such as selling BTC for ETH in most countries (it doesn’t have to be back into US Dollars or your local currency). For example, if you bought 1 BTC for $5,000 and traded that 1 BTC for ETH when BTC was worth $10,000, then you have made $5,000 in taxable income in most tax jurisdictions. However, this is not the case in all countries, so you should research your local laws to see if this applies to you.

Anyway, I hate to even discuss this because I think that most crypto tax laws are unfair and outdated but that doesn’t change the fact that at some point you will have to pay them. Ultimately, I would rather pay them now rather than have to pay them later with extra fines and fees for not paying them on time.",2020-10-02 15:30:41

While phase 0 should go online later this year, the early phases are just about the implementation of PoS etc. But the phases that increase transactions per second (via sharding) won't be implemented for several years (!) according to Vitalik. So network congestion will be an unsolved problem for the foreseeable future. He suggests there should be a strong push towards second layer solutions, ZK rollups and better solutions to bridge sidechains now. If the majority of projects built on Ethereum would do that, it would practically solve the scaling problem even without having to wait for sharding and ETH 2.0 to be complete, according to him. 

Now, I don't know how practical or difficult such implementations are and how long this may take. But my takeaway message was that no, we won't see ETH 2.0 completed sometime next year and solve all the problems. High gas fees and congestion might plague ETH for quite a while. Sidechains will become more and more important over time. I didn't see him mention mention POA networks like the xDAI chain, but I assume that things like xDAI might become way more relevant (and with better interoperability with the main layer, hopefully also simpler to use), so we might use things like honeyswap a lot more in the future. 

I just hope that the network issues won't hurt ETH's price action in the upcoming bullmarket. On the other hand, Bitcoin has similar scaling issues and people still buy it. As a famous man once said ""It is what it is. We'll see what happens...""

&gt; Now, I don't know how practical or difficult such implementations are

From my perspective it's a step back in regards to user-friendly access and adoption, especially when it comes to new users. 

In a world where only eth exists as a platform we could figure it out. We're used to having seperated log-in's for every site we visit so if every dApp had a level 2 layer that be like having our metamask being the equivalent of the app drawer off our phone. 
We could make it work but we don't have to put all our eggs in one basket. Case and point; MySpace, perfectly viable platform but who still uses it? We found something better *kuch* and moved on. 

&gt; On the other hand, Bitcoin has similar scaling issues and people still buy it.

Bitcoin is digital gold, a store of value. The value proposition of eth is different. 
I'm not saying it's going to zero but if implementing sharding is gonna take years it's safe to say eth is going to loose it's second place on the charts.

For newbies interested in getting involved, I wouldn't recommend to do anything aside from accumulating bitcoin by dollar cost averaging.

At that point you will have a better idea how market movements work and hopefully learn more about the tech as you become more involved... and you should have made some gains in the process.

Short term trading is just gambling.

Trading with leverage is gambling.

Before any smarta** tries to say there are legal providers too, yeah there are but they won't give you m3u file of link, m3u file/link providers are illegal and always will be. M3u file was before used for other purposes but today it's well accepted file format that's mainly used for watching IPTV. Idk is there even any other format than m3u.

But legal providers have their own apps with hard coded streaming links and when you pay legal providers you pay them PER month and you have invoices you pay AS company (hotel company) and not privately via PayPal or Bitcoin....

So OP, be careful, there is just no way someone today or in far future won't report you for offering illegal IPTV channels. You could have unsatisfied customer who will go to police and simply say ""Hey that hotel has illegal TV provider"" despite customer had problem with something else, and you will be screwed completely.

But, you do what you want. Illegal IPTV is something you get for yourself, your friend or family member and not publicly to 100+ mad people.

The regulator who comes with these rules is the Dutch National Bank ( De Nederlandse Bank). Who on earth would make a bank the regulator of crypto firms?

So for me it's all a bit of the same bs. Now it's Bitmex, which one is next? 

Please explain why they react here, and not with banks laundering 2Trillion USD for almost 2 decades?

Please explain why at least since 2008 not a single banker was trialed, convicted or went to jail?

All the fraud (the list and fines are endless) and when they screw up, the taxpayer picks up the tab.

So yeah, fuck all regulators, KYC and AML is a pile of horseshit. Makes us jump through hoops when we want to buy a couple of hundred dollar bitcoin, but if you show up at a bank as a cartel boss, dictator or terrorist and you bring millions you get VIP treatment and they succeed in laundering the money for them for years in a row.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with BCHN.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with Jonathan Toomin on the DAA.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with big investors like Justin Bons Cyber Capital.

Bitcoin ABC has conflicts with someone who donated money to them in the past (eg. Marc De Mesel).

Let's call the IFP for what it is, if a person is willing to sabotage or cause harm to you when you don't give him money, that is an extortion attempt.

Despite all that, I'm happy to tell you that the most likely outcome in November is that Bitcoin Cash will upgrade normally as it does, except the saboteur can no longer stall the progress of others nor prevent others from scaling Bitcoin Cash anymore.

Blockstream and Bitfinex Tether have turned Bitcoin into a speculative ponzi scheme. When their lies and manipulation inevitably cause them to implode and collapse, it's going to create irreparable harm in confidence to cryptocurrency and use as p2p electronic cash. Bitcoin would have changed the world if Blockstream didn't steal it so they could try to profit off it.

g7jjjvl,crypto_grandma,4,"My 'aha' Bitcoin moment came about a year after I'd been investing in it. I had been living and working abroad for several years and as I was to be leaving the country shortly I wanted to send the money I had saved (a relatively small amount) from my foreign bank to my home country bank. The bank said they'd need my work permit for this, but as I'd left my job 6 months previously and had been staying as a tourist during that time I no longer had a work permit. The bank said I wouldn't be able to make the international money transfer without the work permit. 

That's when I realized that 'my' money *belonged* to the bank. I was already signed up to a crypto exchange in that country so decided if I couldn't send it to my home bank I'd purchase Bitcoin with it instead. At least then I'd be in control of it. 

Before that day, Bitcoin was just some magic internet money I'd gambled on hoping the price would go up. Ever since then, I see just how important it is. I find it liberating owning Bitcoin",2020-10-04 04:17:20

You can (and should) always calculate the spread by comparing the price at the ATM to the ""market price"".  The market price can be found by simply googling ""bitcoin price"".

For example, at the time of this post, the ""googled"" price was $10525.  I'd be willing to bet if you went to the coinstar to BUY, the price would be $11578 and if you went back to SELL the price would be $9473.

g7miamr,igadjeed,3,"&gt; Was there an additional fee over the 4%?

Yes, Coinme adds 10% to the exchange rate without disclosing it as a fee  
Or, they do disclose it, because they inform the buyer of the purchase amount, during the transaction, at the machine  
As with all Bitcoin ATMs, the buyer is responsible for comparing the machine's price with currently reported exchange rates  

This is a common misconception for first-time buyers, that they're buying ""130 dollars of Bitcoin"" instead of seeing that the ATM is selling 0.01 Bitcoin for 130 dollars  

Every ATM customer has a phone. Every phone has Internet access. Every phone has a calculator app. See that coinmarketcap quotes 10581. Divide 130 by 0.01, result 13000. Divide 13000 by 10581, result 1.23, therefore 23% markup",2020-10-04 14:35:08

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) supposedly exists in order to fight ""anti-semitism"".

The problem is that there's so little **real** anti-semitism that they have to manufacture it with fake hate crime hoaxes.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against American Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](https://www.timesofisrael.com/jcc-bomb-threat-suspect-reportedly-behind-over-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers “Paid with Bitcoin”](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew’s Bomb Threats against American Jews are “White Hate”](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semitic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world"". But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are America and most of europe (white majority countries)

Of course, these Jewish Supremacists pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jewish Supremacists express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under an [SJS - System of Jewish Supremacy](https://archive.fo/5cAQ3)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

g7pzfhs,I_Like_To_Bike,4,"So a friend came to me asking for some advice. He mined a bit of Bitcoin back in the day in his high school years. I helped him recently learn about taxes and everything as he is starting his first job at a consulting firm.

With regard to the crypto, he’s now thinking about selling it and cashing out to start actually saving for retirement and whatnot.

According to his current income, he is in the 15% long term bracket. As far as I can tell, he owes long term gains on the difference between the value on the day it was mined and the value the day it was sold. Don’t think the irs will chase him down for the mined cost basis as it was so long ago and worth so little.

Question, does selling the crypto now move him up into the next long term capital gains bracket? Or are the proceeds from the sale not counted as income? If so, I feel like I should recommend he split up the sale over 2020 and 2021 to avoid bumping up into the next income /cap gains tax bracket.

Along similar lines, does income from selling crypto bump you up into the ineligible category for Roth IRA where you need to do backdoor Roth?

Thanks for the help. For reference, it is about 20btc.",2020-10-05 05:48:26

So the Lira would also be then, at an all time low against the USD in addition to bitcoin?

When you figure that the top 5 have little change against each other, they then become the world bank that all smaller currencies are traded against.

g7t0hm0,LaxInTheBrownies,32,"Answer:  Seems like most of these answers are jokes, so I'll attempt a serious one. WSB goes private from time to time and typically never announces why. Sometimes it might just be the mods screwing around with people, sometimes it'll be for a reason no one understands. 

A decent amount of the time, it could be for an SEC investigation into market manipulation or something similar. For anyone who doesn't know, the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) monitors the stock market and tries to create a fair trading environment. Here's a [link](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answerstmanipulhtm.html) to their website explaining market manipulation.

Basically, WSB is a good place to attempt market manipulation because everything is anonymous and a lot of people read it. One way you could attempt market manipulation is to post that you're an insider and you have secret information that hasn't been released about the company. If you convince enough people this is true and they buy your position, it will make your position worth more and then you can sell for a profit, while all the others are stuck with a bad investment.

Another way would be to get a large group of users to agree to buy a small stock at the same time. This would raise the value, get the attention of other investors, and get more people to buy in (think bitcoin in 2018 on a much smaller scale). Then the group sells early, before the artificial bubble pops.

There's other creative ways to make money and defraud investors if you have a large group of people willing to buy whatever stock/security you pitch to them. 

The SEC will notice odd market activity and sometimes it will be linked to WSB. The SEC will work with the mods to investigate the subreddit and that's easier if it goes private for a bit. 


TL;DR Market manipulation and SEC investigations can cause WSB to go private",2020-10-06 02:00:44

g7ut56j,To1kien,12,"IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for Federal income tax purposes.  More information can be found in the 2014 notice and FAQ released by the IRS (see below).

https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions

They've also supplemented this guidance in 2019; that can also be found at the linked FAQ.

to answer your specific questions:

how are they treated?  like property (similar to stocks)

Do you pay taxes on gains from the sale of bitcoin? ""Yes.  When you sell virtual currency, you must recognize any capital gain or loss on the sale, subject to any limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.""

Are they treated like actual currency?  ""No. Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss for U.S. federal tax purposes.""

Do cryptominers pay taxes on what they mine?  "" Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income.""

Also, my understanding is that the IRS does not accept payment of taxes through any type of virtual currency, but there are third party servicers who may provide some sort of exchange function.",2020-10-06 10:56:56
g7tv512,Elean0rZ,12,"As a general comment, any given sub is going to have some cult-like qualities. The point of subs is to discuss the specific thing the sub is intended for, so there's nothing wrong with being focussed on that thing. But, of course, being focussed on something is a slippery slope towards cultishness, so the question is where do you draw the line. r/CryptoCurrency has cultlike qualities as well, after all; the difference is that here it's more about crypto in general, rather than any single project.

Specifically about Bitcoin, you have to remember that Bitcoin is the big daddy. It started the whole thing, so in addition to the usual fanboying that you'd find in any sub, there are additional layers of ideology and mythology, stemming from Bitcoin's idealistic early days and the now-almost-godlike status of Satoshi, and there are also additional layers of resentment since--from the perspective of the true maximalists--altcoins simply dilute and distract from the One True Purpose of crypto, which is for Bitcoin to become the One True Money (this is all ironic considering that the point of crypto is to be decentralized and open-source, so you'd think it would be axiomatic that anyone could do anything they wanted with the tech, but...). Anyway, my point here is that the Bitcoin sub has the same basic issues as any other sub, but turned up a few notches because of its longer history, deeper sense of identity, and, in effect, near-religious faith in Bitcoin as a concept.

But then you also have to look into Bitcoin's history to get the whole picture. Specifically, for years there were antagonistic factions within Bitcoin, which ultimately led to the BTC - BCH split in 2017. To massively oversimplify, the disagreement was around approaches to scaling Bitcoin, and about what those approaches meant for what Bitcoin fundamentally was. But it was made worse by the way it all went down. On one side were so-called ""big blockers"", who tended to adhere to a more originalist, grassroots, and idealistic vision; on the other side were ""small blockers"", who tended to adhere to a more corporate and pragmatic vision. Without getting into the pros and cons, what matters to your question is that the ""small blockers"" had more resources and influence, first in the form of control over major Bitcoin-related communities (r/Bitcoin, BitcoinTalk, etc), and second in the form of developer/lobby groups like Blockstream. Setting aside the question of whether the big or small block approach made more sense for Bitcoin, the small blockers were able to, essentially, control the narrative. From the small blockers' perspective, all they did was suppress trolls and keep the conversation focussed on Bitcoin's rightful development path; from the big blockers' perspective, the small blockers engaged in unreasonable censorship, suppressed discussion, and hijacked the future of Bitcoin. 

Again, whether we think this was for the best or not, the outcome was that r/Bitcoin became a place for people on the small block side, while r/btc became a place of protest for those on the large block side who were being censored from r/Bitcoin, and, after the BCH fork, became the home for Bitcoin Cash. The scars of that split are still present, with each side distrusting the other and layering fervent tribalism on top of the already robust maximalism intrinsic to all Bitcoin flavours. Personally, I find that both the BTC folks and the BCH folks are prone to annoying behaviour, and that the whole thing is like Democrats vs. Republicans or Israel vs. Palestine--like, there might be legitimate points to be made on both sides, but no one can calm down for long enough to cut through the chest-thumping and rhetoric and actually make them. So we end up with echo-chambers on both sides--which, again, is similar to what we see in other subs, just more entrenched and bitter.",2020-10-06 05:57:51

We have removed tons of crap (mostly articles copied from Wikipedia, some doxxing, obviously illegal stuff, porn, promotions of scam sites), **but I think this particular episode has nothing to do with ""\*CENSORSHIP* READ.CASH...""**, at best it is ""\*CENSORSHIP* TOBIAS RUCK..."", but frankly I see it as his right to leave only people that he wants to hear. His own bubble, no problems with that.

You're claiming censorship on read.cash behalf, but **nobody here is preventing you from publishing your comment as an article as a response to Tobias.** Which is actually even better, because you can publish a long-form content with proofs, images, etc...

The blocking mechanism is there to resolve conflicts effectively instead of an endless drama. People block other people and that's it, the conflict is done.  In my view, your article is your space, if you don't want to see something there, you have the right to see it gone and not deal with it. If somebody is actively trolling you and stalking you, you don't want to see that persons comments under your articles. Removing this for you, but leaving for others, that's worse, now you have to constantly login-logout to see if that person is writing something bad/wrong/lies about you on YOUR article.

Though, I think many people that actually care about BCH learned to ignore the IFP non-sense. Look at tippers on that post - it's a typical IFP gang: JStodd (paid AVAX supporter, here to sow chaos), micropresident (King of $5 meme kids / Mr. ""I'm building a read.cash clone for $25k""), Cain (can't say anything bad about him, but he is an avid IFP supporter).

One more thing: Tobias is obviously going the IFP way. read.cash is not. As previously noted, after the November fork, what read.cash calls ""Bitcoin Cash"" would be defined by BCHN. So, the IFP gang will be there, still trying to devastate as much of community as possible and it's in your power to block them too to prevent them from crapping on YOUR articles, instead of seeing crap under your articles endlessly.

P.S. By OP: ""Goerge[sic] ""I have nothing else to do than make crypto coin propaganda, grabbing funds from DASH now BCH, while not delivering anything"" Donnelly""... geee.. I wonder why people block this nice guy. Don't do this stuff on read.cash though - personal attacks will lead to a ban.

We just rode this thing up over 100% and you panic over a couple point drop?? I don't personally understand it. To me there are two strategies for playing SPACs:

1 - Trading - Get in early and sell after hype. VTIQ / NKLA was a great example of this. Good to make money off of short term, but not a long term hold. 

2- Investing - Legitimate long term investments - In my opinion SHLL/HYLN  and FMCI fall into this category. If this is your strategy, then don't pay attention to the daily ups and downs because SPACs are extremely volatile.",2020-10-06 04:12:40

Is what i used along with some quick guides on r/ethstaker.

I honestly recommend you don't use windows, (it's what i used) and I'm not familiar with linux. But in the long run it would be the best to use linux. 

Here is my attempt at a guide if you want to play around using windows and prysm. A lot of the guides are split between multiple web pages and by the end of it my browser looked like the end of a college research paper. So here is my attempt to consolidate it using windows and prysm.

**This is for Windows**

**STEP 1 - Getting Your Beacon Node up and Running**

For windows, I had a separate SSD that I used for everything eth2.0 validating related. The actual beacon chain data was stored on my C: drive. 

I used prysm - so that is my reference point. Make a new folder named prysm wherever you want.  

I just had it in my G: drive. You will be going there a lot using the terminal. remember the path to it (i.e. 

    G:\prysm or C:\Program Files\prysm, wherever you make that folder.)

Open up command prompt in windows (click windows icon&gt;search cmd&gt; run it)

It will take you to a black screen window. If your prysm folder is in your main HDD or SSD 

    (C:\) 

you are ready for next step. If you opted to put it in a separate HDD/SSD you will need to switch drives.

Just type the letter of the drive and : and press enter. Example: If it was in your G: drive just type

    G:

press enter

then navigate to the prysm folder type cd and copy paste the path the prysm folder. cd means change directory

    cd G:\prysm  or cd C:\Program Files\prysm

Follow prysm installation guide, mostly copy and paste the instructions remembering to change the path names to the ones that match your instance

1. once you are in the prysm folder it should look like

    G:\prysm    

copy and paste (**don't copy and paste my link use the actual prysm docs link for safe practice**)

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/master/prysm.bat --output prysm.bat    

I didn't run an eth 1.0 node because i didn't want to deal with syncing it. I remember doing that with bitcoin years ago and i really don't have the time. However, with actual eth staking I would run an eth 1.0 node and sync it (that will take a long time) I used a third party node infura. 

    Open up your browser go to infura and create account. 

    Log in&gt;click ethereum&gt;click new project&gt;name it&gt;click on the project&gt;Settings&gt;

    Under ""Keys"" change endpoint to Gorli&gt; copy the https link underneath 

Now go back to the terminal 

Make sure you are in the prysm folder still and type in 

       prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider=&lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT_without the =&lt;&gt; &gt;

delete everything after = sign and after it and paste (ctrl V) your infura link

It should look like this, where everything before \prysm.bat is the path to your prsym folder and after web3provider includes your link the your infura Gorli endpoint (there is space between proveider and your infura link)

    G:\prysm\prysm.bat beacon-chain --http-web3provider &lt;YOUR_ETH1_NODE_ENDPOINT&gt;

Your beacon node will now start syncing, it will take about about a day at it's current size. If everything is done right. And now you wait for you beacon node to sync. it will show you the progress and the estimated time in the terminal window. ctrl mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the command prompt terminal window.


**Congratulations, your eth 2.0 beacon node should be running properly and syncing now**


**STEP 2 - Getting Your Validator Keys**


Next go to the [medalla launch pad](https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/overview) and follow that instruction. Download the eth 2.0 client and extract the folder to wherever you want (i would keep it in the same drive as your prysm folder) [https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases) download the latest windows zip file under assets (as of now it is v.0.4.1 ""I am Zinkin...)

**I included links to everything but NEVER NEVER NEVER download using links from random people online (which I am) Find the official sites yourself and download it that way. PRACTICE SAFETY make sure the certificates match up, official sites, and the url is spelled correctly etc**

Get your 32 test net ether Gorli Eth via ethstaker discord or the clients discord or a faucet. Use metamask, change network to Gorli. You don't want to send real eth. I won't go in depth with this part, you should know the basics of working with ether and metamask if you plan on staking. 

After extracting the eth2.0 cli folder, I recommend changing the name of the folder to something manageable (ex. eth2deposit-cli)

Open up a new Command Prompt terminal. Navigate to the new eth2deposit-cli folder. Remember if it's in another drive you first have to change drives by typing the letter of the drive the folder is in and : then enter. If it's in the main C:\ drive just type cd and copy and paste the path the eth2deposit-cli folder

    cd G:\eth2deposit-cli

then copy/paste (change the 1 to whatever amount of validators you are running) (the instruction on the launchpad are clear I'm just putting it here to be redundant)

    deposit.exe --num_validators 1 --chain medalla    

follow instructions that show up. Here is where your mnemonic shows up (physically write it down). Create strong password for the wallet and write it down

After you finish that part, go back to the eth2deposit cli folder you should see a new folder validator_keys folder. Make sure there are 2 files and deposit data file and a keystore file. Upload the deposit_data.json file to the launchpad to make sure you are on the right chain and everything is good (medalla/zinken/etc.) 

Continue following the instruction &gt; you have to send the Goeth to the contract now. **Make sure you are on the Gorli Test net and you aren't sending real eth somewhere** It will confirm.

**Congratulations, you have your Eth 2.0 validating keys**


**STEP 3 - Running your Validator Keys**

Next up is running the actual Validator now

Open up a new command prompt terminal window,

Navigate to the prysm folder (you should know how to do it by now)


    G:

    cd G:\prysm

now you have to import the validating keys into prysm. delete everything after the =sign and paste the path to the validator key folder

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=&lt;loaction of your validator keys folder without the &lt;&gt; &gt;

Should look something like this    

    prysm.bat validator accounts-v2 import --keys-dir=G:\eth2deposit-cli\validator_keys

Follow instructions - and you are done.
 
You just have to wait for your beacon node to sync and then a little while extra for your validator to be activated on the chain. 


[https://beaconcha.in/](https://beaconcha.in/) is where you can view the list of pending validators and you can copy and paste your GOeth address to view your validators progress and operations.


Most problems I encountered were typos with regards to file/folder names and pathing errors (i would copy and paste but not properly change the path to my personal folders/files)

It's a good learning experience. The instructions from the prysm team and medalla launch pad are great. But they assume you know the absolute basics, which i obviously didn't know about.  I did not know about changing drives which caused some headaches at first. Google-fu is your friend, the folks over at r/ethstaker are great and immensely helpful. Discord rooms (ethstaker, prysm) are also filled with kind folks.

Links to those can be found at the their webpages and r/ethstaker sidebars. **Remember don't click on my links and use them, go find it yourself using official sources.**

g7xti9x,paperraincoat,5,"It's not arbitrary, 21 million, plus eight decimal places, is the amount that just fits inside a standard IEEE floating-point variable.

There's a good post by [ismith23](https://www.reddit.com/user/ismith23) about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/e5f69a/why_did_satoshi_choose_21_million_as_the_supply/f9jg8gn/). 

&gt;The number of satoshi (21,000,000 * 100,000,000) just fits in a standard IEEE floating point number so satoshi can be added and subtracted by floating point with no loss of precision. It requires 51 bits of the 53 available bits.


&gt;In the early days of bitcoin some code used floating point, possibly including some of the original Satoshi code. As well many languages use floats for library calls and a number of languages, including JavaScript, internal store all numbers as floating point.


&gt;Financial systems should use the 128 bit representations designed for financial use. Java has the BigDecimal class, and C# has the decimal type but in the early bitcoin days some floating point was used.

Yes it absolutely does. That's why a lot of popular merchants who used to accept Bitcoin said they're not taking it anymore. Steam would've been one of the biggest merchants for Bitcoin payments, but they didn't want to because of the compromised user experience.

Fees being expensive and the blocksize being capped has prevented more transactions from happening on the network (regardless of whether they are transactions of value or not) with the promise of Lightning delivering. Merchants who were previously accepting just Bitcoin now have to make a change to accept Lightning Bitcoins.

This leads to many issues, most of which can be boiled down to the fact that the sum of channel balances will be a large sum of money that has to be settled on-chain to ultimately sell for fiat and payment processing. There's no way around that...

Bitcoin Cash's lack of success doesn't prove that big-block Bitcoin would've been/is a failure. Crypto is a lot more political than it should be. Ultimately, mini bull-runs along with temporary fee spikes would actually be bad for Bitcoin's security long term. In the last 3 years alone, Bitcoin has lost 85% of its security despite only falling 40%-45% in price. For Bitcoin Cash, that number is 95%, but is likely to become more sustainable as it becomes less volatile. The same can't be said for Bitcoin.",2020-10-08 11:01:38

But, citizenship in America conveys a privileged perspective: there is a severe shortage of not just sound money, but sound-adjacent fiat money like USD.   

The Turkish lira is hitting a new all-time low vs. the USD today.   There are 83m people in Turkey and on average they make USD $377 per month, which is $4524 per year.   They don't want to see their savings eradicated by inflation.  They want exposure to USD, and they want hard money.  Crypto is the most secure, easiest way to accomplish that.  If each of those people wanted to keep a paltry sum of $100 in USD as an emergency fund, that would eat up over half of the total Tether market cap, and that's just one country under 100m people.  Low friction makes Tether and similar coins an easy way to get exposure to US abroad.  There is a massive, massive demand for digital assets.

So, how does that affect Bitcoin pricing?  Well, they want Bitcoin too, not just fiat, or fiat stablecoins (which may be better than fiat due to sovereignless remittance).

g860r2h,nullc,7,"I think this is the right take.

Some of the people that left might have had views you would consider dumb, but some might have had views that were basically the same as yours... we don't know.

Many people here have faulted some coinbase staff for walking out for outside-of-work things but not standing up against things like the hacking team acquisition, the company's  servility to absurd privacy invading rights oppressing regulators and law enforcement making demands outside of their remit, the company's conspicuous actions against the Bitcoin community, or their adoption of scammy ICOs.  For all we know these were major factors for some of the people who left... I doubt it was a single reason for most people.

It's okay for people to disagree. It's okay for people to have different priorities.  It makes me feel hopeful for humanity when people can sort out their disagreements in a civil and mutually respectful way.  The same thing that makes it okay for coinbase to ask employees to keep advocacy and politics out of the work place is what makes it okay for people to choose to not work there in response.

Even when we don't agree with someone's views we should respect them for standing up for them-- particularly when its their skin on the line and not ours. That applies both to the employees who are departing and the coinbase leadership here.",2020-10-09 09:07:03

g84wty6,soccersousa,6,"From page 41 of the [report](https://www.justice.gov/ag/page/file/1326061/download):

Anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies.

The acceptance of anonymity enhanced
cryptocurrencies or “AECs”—such as Monero,
Dash, and Zcash—by MSBs and darknet
marketplaces has increased the use of this
type of virtual currency. As discussed above,
because AECs use non-public or private
blockchains, use of these cryptocurrencies
may undermine the AML/CFT controls used
to detect suspicious activity by MSBs and
other financial institutions, and may limit
or even negate a business’s ability to conduct
AML/CFT checks on customer activity and
to satisfy BSA requirements. Some AECs,
however, offer features, such as public
view keys, that potentially can facilitate
the fulfillment of AML/CFT obligations,
depending upon the implementation of such
features.

The Department considers the use of AECs
to be a high-risk activity that is indicative
of possible criminal conduct. In most
circumstances, the Department does not
liquidate seized or forfeited AECs, as doing
so allows them to re-enter the stream of
commerce for potential future criminal use.
Companies that choose to offer AEC products
should consider the increased risks of money
laundering and financing of criminal activity,
and should evaluate whether it is possible to
adopt appropriate AML/CFT measures to
address such risks.

AECs are often exchanged for other virtual
assets like bitcoin, which may indicate
a cross-virtual-asset layering technique
for users attempting to conceal criminal
behavior. This practice, which is commonly
referred to as “chain hopping,” is discussed
further below.",2020-10-09 03:52:02

Far more hashrate - http://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

Larger community of users with much better network effect

Far more merchant support

Far less mining centralization

Far more node decentralization

Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.

Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels

_______________________________________
**B Cash (BCH)**


One of 50+ UTXO altcoin spinoffs from Bitcoin https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/

Few developers that are far less competent

Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security. Favors externalizing costs onto full nodes and users

Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 224 TPS max throughput(but miners only allowing 56TPS now). Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but are open the possibility up for L2.

Introduced another vulnerability with the HF called EDA that caused wild erratic difficulty swings and more inflation. They Hard forked to try and fix this with the DAA but thus far their difficulty is still more erratic than bitcoin.

Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9230 which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit

https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/asicboost-the-reason-why-bitmain-blocked-segwit-901fd346ee9f

Basically what happened was we got a note from the homeowners insurance saying they would no longer cover our house because of the fact we had too many layers of shingles. Keep in mind the home was purchased under first-time home buyers and so it should have passed an inspection. I was really pissed off because I really didn't have money to be spending on a roof. So I went and got a second mortgage.


 I did the fucking repairs myself. And I  was pretty pissed in that moment and decided to pay myself as a contractor and rewarded myself with my first Bitcoin purchase in 2014.   I was so fucking frustrated at The Game of Life.

Now I just know how to manage the frustration a little bit better. I'm not greedy.   I've never done anything lavish. My family doesn't fly to Florida to vacation.... I drive. And it ain't Disney. Stuff like that.

g88xod2,1MightBeAPenguin,3,"&gt;I think I am the minority about this, but it seems increasingly likely that BTC will add some fixed inflation before increasing the block limit? Something based on the coins not moved over X years so that the circulating supply of Bitcoin always remains under 21M, a sort of redefining of the old only ever 21M. 

It certainly is possible... It would be similar to the tail emission that Monero has, however such a change would require a hardfork, and likely cause a split in the community because of how controversial it is. Breaking the 21 million max supply of Bitcoin would be going against the social contract, which would be chaotic to say the least.

&gt;Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash having the same average total fees all other being equal would make Bitcoin more unstable since the revenue in ""fee markets"" are more volatile than a transactions per day over time. But just adding even the most marginal of fixed block rewards would sidestep the whole issue. 

Yes. It would be more volatile because miners are relying on a smaller group of people to pay more per transaction leads to an easier failure of the system. I think this could potentially lead to a chain death if banks and institutions really wanted it to. For a short burst of time, they can supply a lot of fees, increasing the hashrate, causing the DAA to increase difficulty, and then suddenly stop transferring anything, making the DAA a lot slower, and not allowing it to catch up for another confirmation.",2020-10-10 04:51:34

The way it works is the service monitors the donation address and then sends SLP tokens to the provided return-address (below the donation box).

(This means that if you donate from non-standard addresses, or from a wallet that does not support SLP then your tokens may be lost if you don't enter an address.)

The merch and physical-goods are priced fairly high because the tangible rewards are meant to be a way to show our appreciation without having to spend a bunch of time operating as a store that manages inventory, and shipping.  The rewards take time and money, and if we suddenly had a ton of orders then we wouldn't be able to spend as much time donating and it would diminish the value of your donation.

But I will reply again and elaborate more on why I like Digibyte. 

First and foremost I like it for the decentralization and community aspect. Nobody is paid to work on it, nobody is employed by a Digibyte company or corporation. Yes there is the Digibyte Foundation but that is volunteer based and by donations only, I have donated to the dev fund myself though I think we also need more attention on the marketing side. When talking about the foundation there was news this year of Jared Tate stepping down from his role with the foundation to take a much deserved break. In doing so he has turned to the community, in a philosophical sense, to continue this project without him to prove that no *one* person is more important than Digibyte itself. I have nothing but respect for him and his decision to do so and I have full faith in the other members of the Digibyte Foundation to carry the project forward. Proving it’s true decentralization. 

Another reason to like it is the five algorithms used to mine DGB. What that does is make DGB more accessible to more people regardless of what equipment they use, unlike Bitcoin which I won't get into here. There is a hope that one day you will be able to mine DGB on your cell phone, still an *idea* or *dream* more than a developing project I think but I would love to be proven wrong about this, and I think that kind of vision is great to have for a project. Outside of the hopeful goals DGB is still one of the better options if you have minimal equipment because not only will the reward:electricity bill be better but you will also be more involved with a community. I am saving up for a mining rig to get into it myself. 

Speed is an obvious reason that apparently you are well aware of but another thing to consider is cost. DGB is fractions of a penny to send and along with the speed it makes it ideal for sending money or better yet *spending* money, or Digibyte. In a fantasy world of adoption Digibyte really makes sense in a lot of ways. 

Digi-ID is a valid reason to be bullish. Suppose this scenario, Coinbase has yet to list DGB but when they do they will be more aware of Digibyte as a platform. I will admit coinbase is a longshot example but it's easy to use for reference. If coinbase, or any other exchanges and wallets, were to learn about Digi-id they would be able to consider it to reduce on KYC requirements by having a trusted blockchain ID. The potential use of Digi-ID is massive and who else has a working Blockchain ID? Icon is developing one and Ontology has recently released something but both of those are centrally controlled proof-of-stake networks. Nothing against PoS but I am against centralized control of a blockchain with intentions of ID. I will add that I think NEO is developing something ID but they’re also centralized. I share this for research purposes if you wish to look more into this stuff. 

Decentralization, speed, algorithms, ideologies, and core values.If you only are about the charts than a reason to be bullish is that coinbase is rumoured to be listing it, they have developments with RenVM in the works and the activity has been very upward lately. I'm stocking up, I am biased to the project with everything I say.

Bitcoin is great and it's very unlikely Monero taking over Bitcoin, but it certainly offers fungibility and privacy, so you should probably turn some of your Bitcoin into Monero to obfuscate your total wealth from bad actors, plus using it over Bitcoin for payments for more financial privacy and receiving Monero over Bitcoin for not worrying about receiving tainted Bitcoin. And paying far cheaper fees with faster confirmation times.

You'll find there's a lot of overlap between Bitcoin' and Monero' communities, so Monero is basically Bitcoin's younger brother, looking up to his big brother and just trying to fill the gaps his big brother is not able to fill because he already has a lot of responsibilities and has less room to experiment. While his big brother looks proudly at his younger brother and wishes him success because he likes his ideas, it is his beloved brother, and it would be nice not bearing all the weight of the cryptoeconomy alone.

People are getting defrauded as they turn to Square’s Cash App and PayPal’s Venmo to do more online banking in the pandemic.

By Nathaniel Popper
Oct. 11, 2020, 3:24 p.m. ET
Charee Mobley, a middle school teacher in Fort Worth, Texas, was a fraud victim recently on Cash App.

Charee Mobley, who teaches middle school in Fort Worth, Texas, had just $166 to get herself and her 17-year-old daughter through the last two weeks of August.

But that money disappeared when Ms. Mobley, 37, ran into an issue with Square’s Cash App, an instant payments app that she was using in the coronavirus pandemic to pay her bills and do her banking.

After seeing an errant online shopping charge on her Cash App, Ms. Mobley called what she thought was a help line for it. But the line had been set up by someone who asked her to download some software, which then took control of the app and drained her account.

“I didn’t have gas money and I couldn’t pay my daughter’s senior dues,” Ms. Mobley said. “We basically just had to stick it out until I got paid the following week.”

In the pandemic, people have flocked to instant payment apps like Cash App, PayPal’s Venmo and Zelle as they have wanted to avoid retail bank branches and online commerce has become more ingrained. To encourage that shift, the payment apps have added services like debit cards and routing numbers so that they work more like traditional banks.

But many people are unaware of how vulnerable they can be to losses when they use these services in place of banks. Payment apps have long had fraud rates that are three to four times higher than traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, according to data from the security firms Sift and Chargeback Gurus.

A Cash App marketing campaign known as “Cash App Fridays” provided fraudsters with a ready phone book of potential victims, according to security experts.

The fraud appears to have surged in recent months as more people use the apps. At Venmo, daily users have grown by 26 percent since last year, while the number of customer reviews mentioning the words fraud or scam has risen nearly four times as fast, according to a New York Times analysis of data from Apptopia, a firm that tracks mobile services.

Driving the surge is the apps’ ease of use. People need just an email address to create a Cash App account and a phone number to make a Venmo account. That simplicity has made it seamless for thieves to set up accounts and to send requests for money to other users, something that was not possible with traditional bank payments.

The apps’ instantaneous transactions — compared to the two or three days needed for a standard bank transfer — have also meant that Venmo and Cash App have less time to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent.

“Fast payments equals fast fraud,” said Frank McKenna, the chief fraud strategist for the security firm PointPredictive. The apps, which are sometimes known as peer-to-peer payments services, “are super convenient for customers but that also makes them ripe targets,” he said.

Square, PayPal and Zelle do not disclose the rate of fraud on their apps. PayPal takes steps to “limit potential fraudulent activity and mitigate any customer impact,” a spokeswoman said, but she did not address whether it had seen more cases of fraud.

Zelle, which was founded by a coalition of banks, appears to have experienced less fraud because it has more robust authentication for new users and more legal protections in case of loss, security experts said.

“Protecting consumers from abusive scams and fraud is a top priority for Zelle,” said Meghan Fintland, a spokeswoman for Early Warning, the company that runs the app.

Of all the payment apps, fraud issues have been particularly acute for Square’s Cash App. As the number of people using the app daily has grown 59 percent over the last year, the number of reviews about it that mention the words fraud or scam has risen 165 percent, according to Apptopia.

Annual Growth in Payment Apps

The Better Business Bureau also said it had received more than twice as many complaints about Cash App as Venmo over the past year. That is significant given that Venmo has twice as many users as Cash App, according to Apptopia.

Lena Anderson, a spokeswoman for Square, said the company was “aware that there has been a recent rise in scammers trying to take advantage of customers using financial products, including Cash App. We’ve taken a number of proactive steps and made it our top priority.”

Square, which is led by Jack Dorsey, who is also chief executive of Twitter, introduced Cash App in 2013. While the San Francisco company was founded as a payments platform for small businesses, Cash App has become its largest source of revenue. In the second quarter, the app generated $1.2 billion of Square’s $1.9 billion in revenue.

But Cash App has been more vulnerable to fraud partly because of how it handles customers, security experts said. Square has until recently offered only email support for the app, not a phone number for its customers to call. That led some customers to fall for fake help line numbers, like the kind that Ms. Mobley confronted. Venmo, in contrast, has a chat line on its app that customers can use for a quick response.

Ms. Anderson said Square began rolling out a phone line for certain customers on Oct. 6. It plans to make the phone line available to all customers over time.

Cash App also appears to be more prone to fraud because of how Square has built the business, industry analysts said.

In 2017, Square began a marketing campaign called “Cash App Fridays,” which gives money to Twitter users who post their so-called $Cashtag or username. The campaign, security experts said, provided fraudsters with a phone book of potential victims.

It also led to copycat campaigns, where people claim to work for Cash App and say they will give away a large sum of money if users first send in a smaller sum. One Twitter account, @CashappG, has been online since 2019 with the tagline: “Hi welcome to Cash App give away! Send money and we will send you double back!”

“It gives scammers a ripe opportunity,” said Satnam Narang, a researcher at the security firm Tenable who has written about the fraud on Cash App.

Posts About Payment Apps on the Dark Net

Emily Bradford, an unemployed 21-year-old in Washington, said she lost $75 last month after getting a message through Twitter offering her $3,000 through Cash App if she paid an initial “clearance” payment. When she sent the money, the person who messaged her disappeared. She reached out to Cash App’s support email, but hasn’t heard back, she said.

“I figured since they were dealing with money, especially others’ money, they’d have a very good security system and customer service,” she said of Square.

Ms. Anderson, the Square spokeswoman, said the company had recently added warnings about copycats on its messages about Cash App Fridays.

In 2018, Square also introduced the ability for people to transact in Bitcoin on Cash App. That has made it easier to move illicit gains off the app because Bitcoin can be sent to anonymous addresses that are much harder to trace or reverse than traditional financial transactions. Venmo and Zelle don’t offer Bitcoin.

Cash App’s popularity for fraudulent schemes is evident from conversations and listings on dark net forums and markets, where criminals gather to do business. In August, Cash App was mentioned 10,577 times on dark net forums, up 450 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis by the security firm Sixgill. Listings for Venmo and Zelle rose around 50 percent on the dark net in the same period.


Ashley Tolley, outside her home in Travelers Rest, S.C. A fraudster recently cost her $560 on Cash App.Melissa Golden for The New York Times
Ashley Tolley, 31, a mother of three in Travelers Rest, S.C., recently experienced the criminal activity on Cash App firsthand.

In August, she said, she received requests on the app from addresses that appeared to be legitimate, but with a letter or two changed. While some of the transactions were rejected by Square, one went ahead without her approval. The thief took $560, which was a month of child support payments from the father of her two youngest children, from her account.

Square told Ms. Tolley that she could ask the fraudster to send the money back to her. But the person had already deleted their Cash App account.

“I’m the sole provider in my household,” she said. “For that to be gone — I broke down, I was in tears.”

ETH 2.0 is going to be a long wait but it's a great project because of how many ERC-### tokens there are and developers and teams that are working on the ETH 2.0 POS upgrade.

Edit: Too long didn't read: I support investing in cryptos that are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a must have basically every crypto has an argument for it's existence when you are talking top 10 coins.

Unrelated; I don't fancy holding investments in XRP, XLM, EOS or Dogecoin.... I do like BCH and LTC.

https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2020/06/

Fastest one is 	Supercomputer Fugaku 415,530 TFlop/s 

Average modern ASIC now is running at 80-120 TH/s 

T/Flopps and T/Hs are different values not directly comparable. It is unfair to compare a general purpose supercomputer with a Bitcoin ASIC . Even if all the Supercomputers worldwide were hijacked and mined Bitcoin they would only be able to mine a very small fraction of Bitcoins global hashrate. 

Here is some math to get a rough idea of the conversion between T/Flopps and T/Hs

1 integer operation = 2 floating point operations

1 hash = 6.35K integer operations

1 hash = 12.7K floating point operations

A single ASIC can mine at ~100,000,000,000,000 hashes these days and there are millions of ASICs mining

A single ASIC thus has 1,270,000,000,000,000,000 Flop/s  in sha256 computing hashrate ability

A single ASIC thus has 1,270,000 TFlop/s  in sha256 computing hashrate ability

**So A single modern ASIC is more than twice as fast at mining Bitcoin than the best supercomputer**

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

g8q1t4w,Hustlebible,5,"Hello! Firstly, congratulations on the score. In the US, 1099s are issued for poker tournaments in the event of a NET win of $5000 or more. Which means, if the tournament was, lets say, $500 to enter, and you cashed for $5499, you would not get tax paperwork. That being said, you are technically obligated to report any earnings regardless if you got paperwork for it or not. If you keep track of your poker earnings and losses then you likely have tournament losses to offset this win and would only be taxed on the net for the year if there is a net. Bovada is not US based so they won't be reporting anything on their end, but any transfers of bitcoin into cash into your bank accounts have the possibility of being flagged as suspicious by your bank. However, none of this really matters unless you get audited. 95% of the time you can probably do nothing and it will be fine, though that is not what you are supposed to do. No one here including myself will recommend techniques for tax evasion because this is illegal, however, its to my understanding that the US lumps all gambling together, whether its lottery tickets, sports betting, or poker, so hypothetically speaking, a handful of scratch off tickets from your local 7/11 trashcan could offset this win, or any cash game losses at your local casino. (receipts from the ATM at the casino are a good record to indicate, plus a record book of the session time/date/location and buy in/cash out) To be on the straight and narrow, you should report your net earnings for the year in poker, and pay your marginal tax rate for those earnings.",2020-10-14 04:38:29

It really depends on how he obtained and stored it. Look through emails for anything mentioning bitcoin. An exchange registration email like Coinbase/Kraken/Gemini etc may give you a good idea if he was buying from one. Check his phone for any ""wallet apps"", assuming you still have access to it.

Look through any USB drives you can find. Look for a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger. (They look like this:  https://wiki.trezor.io/images/T1andTTtogether.jpg  AND  https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2974/4858/products/backup-pack-carrousel_large.png?v=1586175480)

g8utvkv,Talinoth,4,"Well the low resistance matters a lot too.

Why do computers make so much heat? You could heat up your house in a Siberian winter with a bitcoin farm.

For example, in computer CPUs. You know why we can't make CPUs that run 10s, 100s, 1000s of times faster than they do currently?

Why are CPUs so small, why not clock them faster, why not just add more silicon?

Among other things, it's because the resistance across the circuit from the electricity used to power the device doesn't just disappear... that wasted power is being transformed to **heat.**

A *lot* of heat, in a relatively small area. We're still stuck with ""2D"" cpus, instead of stacking the silicon like pancakes to make ""3D"" cpus, because adding more would create an absurd amount of heat beyond our ability to cool.

If we had low pressure, room temperature superconductors, that wouldn't be a problem anymore. *Zero resistance*. *Zero waste heat.* Heat becomes a trivial problem instead of the main roadblock.

CPU performance would surge upwards unstoppably. Well, until they come into contact with annoying quantum effects and hilariously high error rates but that's another matter for another time.

But it's not just CPUs. If you could make a long distance power line out of this theoretical substance, you could have lossless power grids that spanned entire continents. Generate geothermal energy in Iceland, send it across the power lines all the way to Italy!",2020-10-15 10:19:09

Hashrate has no influence on how many XMR are emitted. The XMR protocol has the goal of 1 block every 2 minutes. If the hashrate rises, which means faster blocks, the mining difficulty will be adjusted by the protocol so the 2 minute goal is hit again. In Monero this happens every block with a 200 (I believe) block average, so it's a very fast adjustment.  
This means the amount of XMR emitted per year is a set value, and the supply is only increased linearly.  
The inflationrate will decrease forever heading to 0%. In 2022 when the tail emission begins, it will only be a 0.87% yearly inflation, decreasing every year (after 10 years, it will only be a 0.79% inflation).  

This means the effect on price is absolutely minimal, sub-1%.

g8xaj7b,MobTwo,5,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cash’s long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the outdated BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",2020-10-16 03:38:43

- First is the game-theory economics of it.  In order to spend and receive money, you first have to put money into it, not just the money you want to spend/receive.  This is counterintuitive, and an extra burden for users.  It would be like, in order for you to receive your $1500/week paycheck, you have to already have $1500 in your account (channel capacity). 

- And who wants to just lock up $1500 into your channel with no real reward except the pittance in LN fees they *might* get, all the while risking some malicious attack by you.

- Routing.  Sucks.  Bigly.  It's not like the internet where the next hop in the chain aids in the routing.  No, instead the sender has to do all of the path discovery.  And those paths constantly change as node/channel balances change.  Result?  Payments get stuck.  Bolt spec demands in certain cases that channels get closed.  Onchain settlement is forced.  1MB blocks are woefully inadequate to handle the kind of capacity that would be ultimately needed. 

- Which brings us to flood attacks.  Basically, high onchain fees can make it profitable for an attacker to flood LN with send to self txs.  Since the receive gets paid first, and then back propagates along the path, the sender (who is also the receiver), refuses to pay the final hop, knowing that the onchain congestion makes it likely that the person in the middle won't be able to get their refund tx in on time before the timelock ends.  Think of it as an effective double spend, with the first routing node picking up the bill. 

- Back to routing. Path discovery requires well known public network topology. This is inherently antithetical to privacy.  So if these LN maxis ever want to get the network functioning smoothly, part of the cost will come in the form of privacy. 

- Bugs bugs bugs.  I have personal friends who got funds stuck and lost in LN. The network starts crashing at anything resembling use surges. 

- It's not even Bitcoin. You can enter LN with LTC.  And other coins with an appropriate signature/scripting scheme.  And no, you can't just swap for LTC and exit there if BTC gets too congested, because the swap still requires the ability to settle on the BTC chain if the swap enters failure mode.

Now I'm not saying that LN could never mature.  Or that some of these problems aren't solvable.  But I am saying that it has been 3 years, and the network and code are nothing resembling maturity or production ready.  And it doesn't look like another 3 years will be enough to get it smoothed out either.  Maybe, just maybe, by then it'll be looking more reasonably optimistic.

It could very well be that our best scaling option is to hope for hardware/bandwidth improvements, and to expect some level of low level server hardware/bandwidth to run the nodes. Think 100TB storage and a gigabit connection. 

Yeah thats not ideal, but it's better than trying to scale with some re-centralized federated trust model, a marginally functional LN, or just not scaling at all.",2020-10-16 10:32:43

g91upaw,jtoomim,6,"This release contains two significant performance enhancements of mine:

1. [MR !442](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/442) makes the `sendtoaddress` RPC call around 100x faster with large wallet files when the new `coinsel` argument is set to 1 or 2. This allows BCHN to generate transactions at 30 tx/sec to 200 tx/sec instead of around 0.3 tx/sec on large wallet files. This feature is intended mostly to be used for stress testing on e.g. [scalenet](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/750), but may also be useful for businesses with the need for high peak transaction throughput. I'll try to publish a short article on how to generate buttloads of spam on scalenet using BCHN v22.1.0 soon.
2. [MR !809](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/809) adds an optimization to the CheckRegularTransaction() function that reduces the amount of time needed to generate, validate, and propagate a 32 MB block by about 140 ms per hop. That ""per hop"" bit is pretty important: ultimately, this should speed up the latency-critical path for 32 MB blocks by close to 1 second. While that's not a game-changing improvement, it's quite respectable given that the code change needed to achieve this is only about 10 lines of simple new code, plus some reformatting, comments, and tests.

And this is only the start. We've got a lot more coming soon.

g922u00,kenchikka,3,"The really important thing to take note here, in my opinion, is what he talks around 3 minutes into the video. He talks about **cash** and how Central Banks could create a digital version of a currency with **some attributes** of cash. Then he goes on to say that people really enjoy the fact that cash is **privacy-preserving** but that it would be impossible for a Central Bank to provide such feature because ""money laundering"" and ""funding terrorists"" -- because these things are not happening at this exact moment with dollars.

A CBDC would and will completely eradicate financial privacy to the citizens. And although I understand most people don't give a single fuck about their privacy and are more than happy to have all their personal and financial data harvested by public and private entities alike, this would be a very negative to society in general. There's absolutely no reason to believe Central Banks and other regulatory entities wouldn't freeze your transactions, balances, wallets, at a whim. And with the death of cash you wouldn't have an alternative to operate in the traditional financial system.

This brings me to the part of the discussion that I find interesting, because anyone who understand how Bitcoin works also understands the lack of privacy it has. Chain analysis is real and even if you have the money and the amount of technical knowledge to use one of the (imperfect) methods to ""mix"" your coins, there are still chances you can be tracked. I know this subreddit focus its conversation mainly in Bitcoin but videos like these just make me realize the importance of other cryptocurrencies that enshrine the attributes of cash like fungibility and privacy, which Bitcoin unfortunately lacks. I personally do not believe that in 10 years we will have hundreds of different cryptocurrencies being broadly used by people but I also don't believe Bitcoin will be the only one, mainly because of privacy reasons.",2020-10-17 09:20:15

Keyword is living, yes. Usually on government support programs. They would be likely dead if they were in regions of East Europe, the Middle East, Africa, or West Asia. Not to mention the fact that poverty has gone down massively since the 1950's. 
And not just in America, which actually doesn't make up the entirety of North America and Western Europe.  

&gt;Folks being killed by police with little to no real justification or provocation ""have it made"".

Police kill on average 1000 people per year, and its likely not a lot of those people are innocent. For comparison, about 38000 people die in car crashes per year. Though American cops are corrupt, it isn't rampant enough to be a country destroying problem. Nor is it related to capitalism, but thats certainly an interesting and effective way to hijack a social issue for your own purpose.

Like other people are saying, value is subjective, and the way by which the money disappears makes all the difference. Because if it disappears through a government dictate, people lose faith in the money system itself (""If the government destroys money by this criteria today, they can do anything tomorrow""), and so the dollar goes to shit and is replaced by Bitcoin.

Alternatively, suppose the money disappears through a force of nature, and everybody understands this, and also understands that there will be no other interventions. In that ideal case, a process of price discovery will follow, where supply and demand come to terms with one another, with the price level eventually dropping to half of what it was.

g9ajtf8,szyblaszczyk,2,"I don't know what to think if I'm bullish or bearish. I was always prepared for event like this and as I'm in cryptocurrencies for years, nothing will suprise me, depress or excite much. What happens to crypto after stocks will burst (if they do) or if they are going to inflate them with printed money indefinitely, I have no idea. This is uncharted territory and China virus in times like this is not surprising for me either. This is huge political, economic game and we are tiny players in it.

It is what it is. Whole crypto world (even Bitcoin) still has relatively very low market cap (considering extreme hidden inflation and pure money creation inflating stocks) and whether we have manipulation here or it's the beginning of an end for CRO, everybody should know that and be ready for extremes.

My advices as a person who's also in CROs not deep but have some as I like this ""project"":

1) If you have some big bills to pay upfront, now is the time as cashback will be much nicer now

2) If you think it's temporary and don't want to sell (usually bad idea to sell after such violent drop), make use of every single coin and put into Supercharger, buy discounted coins during Syndicate events. If you are staking now, remember that everyday you get more CRO so it eases the pain

3) If you keep most of your crypto on Crypto.com, consider moving it to a safer space. We never know what happens, we had Bitconnect, we had hacks etc. (Not saying that as a comparison to Crypto.com)

4) Don't go all in Crypto.com coin now as it seems to be cheap now, just buy some if you think it will be fine and maybe some more later

5) It was wild ride for Crypto.com in 2020. Maybe top 10 in market cap in such short time was way too much. Cheaper CRO might mean in loads of people registering on Crypto.com during next bull run. They have good marketing. Question is if they are honest and if they will have now good enough offer to encourage more customers.

In that sense, Litecoin doesn't compete with Bitcoin, because no crypto *can* compete with Bitcoin in that regard, pretty much by design. Bitcoin is completely inefficient in every sense, but it was the first one, and Litecoin can never beat Bitcoin in being the first crypto and having the highest hash rate/longest history.

Litecoin is more of a payment crypto, and in that sense it's competing with other crypto*currencies* like maybe Dash, Nano, Monero etc. I'm afraid to be seen as shilling by explaining how I think Litecoin loses to several of those, so suffice it to say I don't think Litecoin does well in *that* comparison either.

If it succeeds in propelling BTC to new higher numbers that bring more attention, and takes things even higher we'll find both those who rotated out of other coins rotating back, and new money looking for alternatives.  Until ETH and Ethereum 2.0 become the now household name that bitcoin currently is, the bitcorn will almost always lead any new injections of capital.  Hopefully those days are drawing to an end, but I'm still happy to be dragged upwards even if it is by the old man for the time being.  Plus, as is mentioned in previous posts, diversification definitely helps temper the sour grape whine on days like today.

g9f8okv,TheGreatMuffin,1,"Not to dampen the enthusiasm, but the future is always uncertain and there are a few variables in bitcoin's future that are simply unknown.  

My ""favourite"" argument against bitcoin f.ex is that we simply don't know if on-chain activity will be enough to incentivize mining after declining block subsidy (newly mined bitcoin). This is a question that will be answered after the next 2-3 halvings (so within the next decade or two), and we cannot yet know what the answer will be.  

There are also always non-zero probabilities of bugs and unknown exploits (however low), upcoming contentious ""fork wars"" similar to blocksizes debates but on much larger scale, with much larger actors, f.ex on topic of privacy; none of the institutional investors will want too much on-chain privacy, because this means it's more difficult to regulate. This is in opposition to most of ""regular folk"" who  would desire a higher level of on-chain privacy.

g9f3570,SenatusSPQR,1,"Would you ""believe in"" a stablecoin with Nano's characteristics?

The reason I'm asking is that not having it be a stablecoin, or rather not having it pegged to the dollar or euro, is a design choice. A stablecoin has been built on Nano before (Nollar, I believe).

In my opinion making a stablecoin cryptocurrency is a contradictio in terminis. A cryptocurrency does not peg its value to an external, centralised entity. This was one of the ideas behind cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) when Satoshi first released it:

&gt;The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. ([source](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source))

That's what Nano is. It's trustless, no matter how much the dollar money supply is expanded, Nano's supply will always be at a fixed 133 million, and will therefore over time appreciate versus the dollar.",2020-10-20 18:56:12

g9hk278,Tattered_Colours,37,"New development:

I called back about my support case, and they agreed to waive the ""bonus"" rollover thing. There are only four methods of payout: LiteCoin, BitCoin, BitCoin Cash, and Bank Wire. [The cryptocurrency payout methods simply have you put in the amount to pay out, your wallet address, and comments](https://i.imgur.com/EJSPppG.png), but I don't have any cryptocurrency wallets.

The [Bank Wire option](https://i.imgur.com/SWY0F8n.png), however, is absolutely where I'm drawing the line. Not only does it require you to give them your SSN for some reason, but apparently the fee for this payout method is **$45**. If you didn't know, these betting pools cap out your wager at whatever would result in $50 of winnings should you win. So to recap, if you give BetUS...

* Enough money to earn $50-worth of winnings [in my case, ~$70]
* A picture of the front of your ID
* Pictures of the front and back of your bank card
* Your name, address, birthday, *bank information*, ***and SSN***...

You earn $5. Maybe.

If there are any future developments in terms of identity theft or fraudulent use of my card information, I will post them in reply to this comment and so on. I won't be pursuing the payout any more because at this point it wouldn't even be worth my time to figure out how to make a BitCoin wallet and then figure out how to somehow convert that into USD.",2020-10-21 08:17:28

If they weren't going to charge until the moment of purchase, then I'd definitely stay in, but it sounds like that isn't the case. If you do give them money, is it guaranteed you'll get a card on the 7th?

EDIT: According to the responses, they aren't charging until they ship. In that case, I'd absolutely stay in! There's nothing to lose at that point. If you get a card beforehand, just cancel. If not, you at least have a date down!",2020-10-21 07:30:36

g9gqr6p,Solfax,10,"&gt; Out of over 86,000 blockchain projects that had been launched, 92% had been abandoned by the end of 2017 

Seems a bit premature to judge the overall health of blockchain as a viable product using 2017. Outside of Bitcoin, there was not much talk at all of blockchain prior to 2017. That was the year that many projects came into being, most of which proposing an entirely new idea of how Blockchain can work. Also, I am surprised to the point of skepticism at that 86,000 figure. Is 80,000 of that just an companies employee saying ""blockchain is kind of cool"", and then counting it as a project? Regardless, with 92% of 86,000 failing, that still leaves 6880 projects which were not abandoned. This has and always will be a winner take most market. Theres no need for 6,880 blockchains, let alone 86,000.

It wasn't until later on in December that threads started getting 3k+ comments a day, and only in January did they start really ramping up, getting over 5k+-8k comments a day, with the largest comment count of all time being [on January 8th, 2018](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7owmot/daily_general_discussion_january_8_2018/) with over 14k comments.

From there, obviously, disbelief and sadness took over, leading to a general decline in comments. 

I just find it interesting that on probably the most momentous day in Bitcoin price history, where it almost touched 20k, so few people cared about it. Even then, it was a *huge* jump in comments from even a few months earlier.

The [most commented on thread in September 2017](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7112s7/daily_general_discussion_september_19_2017/?sort=confidence) had a measily 110 comments in it. And that's the highest in the whole month.

All macroeconomists agree that the federal reserve is going to continue to print money indefinitely and will eventually start doing UBI. This will devalue the dollars that you and companies are holding. If you believe that there already hasn't been any inflation because the CPI hasn't moved much, you need to looking into the effect quantitative easing has on assets and look at the asset inflation which has happened. Bitcoin is an asset that is already being added to company's treasuries to preserve their buying power. Also, as bonds stop yielding any positive real rate, this pushes money out of bonds and into risk assets, which could be bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a store of value. Its already a 200Billion dollar market cap, do people just expect it one day to go to zero?

Also no one in here is talking about what is going on all over the world. Bitcoin growth rate has been skyrocketing in countries like Nigeria, Belarus, Iran, Venezuela, Lebanon and tons more where they're currency is inflating away, they're under oppressive regimes, and need somewhere to store money.

Bitcoin allows people to bypass traditional banking systems and send money to/out of countries where it was not possible to do so before.

Bitcoin is a network which gains value from the number of users that are on its platform, similar to facebook. Its the most secure network in the world and it continues to get stronger daily.

On October 22 2020, bitcoin had a surge which pushed it above USD$12K.  This constitutes a 20x difference between the two dates four years apart, or just over a doubling every year (2^4 = 16).  If the same were to occur (which of course it won't) in late October 2024, we would see bitcoin at USD$240K after having topped out at about USD$350K, and having experienced a trough down to about USD$80K.

Whether it is $1M, $2M or $4M kind of starts being irrelevant.  At about that time, the relevance of non-bitcoin comparisons start to break down, because it would be assumed that this would be the point at which it is starting to be used as a state reserve asset.  The next phase (now to +4yrs) should be driven by corporate take-up, and especially to facilitate trade.  After what trump as done to america, there aren't going to be too many people trusting american institutions like they may have done in the past.

At best, it’s a commodity, not an investment and not a currency . There’s some decent arguements that it can be used as a hedge against inflation. The claim it’s a negatively correlated asset is wrong - it rises and falls with the stock market, when you’d expect the opposite.

I think it’ll be like beanie babies and eventually people will get bored of it and it slowly loses value. I could be wrong though. Unlike a real investment, it’s value is purely based on the greater fool fallacy, and as long as people think it’s worth something and want to buy it, it’ll keep going up.

Bitcoin is already archaic technology, so if cryptocurrencies are actually used as a currency instead of speculation, bitcoin won’t be what people use. In addition, currencies are only useful when values are relatively stable. Imagine if USD could increase or decrease 50-100% per year?

More short-term, we are in a very TINA (there is no alternative) market right now...people have a bunch of cash, but you can’t invest in bonds because of Fed distortion, can’t invest in equities because of high P/E ratios, can’t stay in cash/treasuries because of inflation risk and 0% fed rate....so people are just throwing money everywhere - bitcoins, tech stocks, baseball cards, magic cards, art work, etc...which are all increasing value at a fast rate.

Additionally, they have $376k coming due in short-term debts and an additional $863k in long-term debts and equity obligations.

I imagine most owners are also carrying their own less than enjoyable burn rate, but even if they aren't the moment the media spending dries up with the League they're going to be out to pasture.

Also worth noting that the Lloyd's own 34.1% of the league out right and then some portion (of which is seems likely to be a majority) of the 53% represented by two investment groups put together by Rob Lloyd.

Better to consider this a donation than an investment. Ten years ago I wrote a business plan for a league and figured best case scenario that some level of break-even sustainability could come when attendance averaged 2,000 paying fans per game. Additionally at that time, after extensive research in business publications, legal documents and trade magazine (not random Internet pundits) the consensus was that in the unlikely event that a sports league doesn't fold that actual profitability does not occur until a league acquires sports specific venues.

The truth of the matter is that the growth in ultimate over the past 10 years has NOT been explosive as many of us had hoped it would be back then. It has been solid growing at (what I'm going to say with absolutely no evidence to back it up) respectable single digit rates. But single-digit returns do not a growth opportunity make.

The AUDL was always a pipe dream and a money burner. If you have some to burn and love frisbee go for it, but if you want to speculate you're more likely better off with a few satoshis of bitcoin and if you really want to invest may I recommend a long-term holding of any of the excellent S&amp;P500 index funds.",2020-10-27 02:02:00

We are going to be more decentralized than bitcoin when d=0. Are already faster and as secure as bitcoin. We can do the same things bitcoin does, plus we can stake and earn rewards. 

This is enough to market this project and bring some awareness to it. Then we could explore some other angles here:

""We are the green version of bitcoin and don't burn the energy of a small country to keep our network alive"" (I'm not a marketer and there's a million better ways to phrase that, but you got the point)

It wouldn't hurt to market the price appreciation potential either:

""bitcoin was once worth 10 cents, and now it's worth 13k. We are now worth 10 cents, and we are here to make bitcoin obsolete. Buy Cardano and help change the world."" (damn I'm really not a marketer)

ga7f49p,MobTwo,6,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cash’s long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the outdated BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",2020-10-27 05:59:03

This is not at all true with respec to r/bitcoin.  That sub is heavily censored.  Up until less than a year ago I barely came on reddit at all, and I was impartial in the whole BTC vs BCH debate.  I own both.  Fine with staying out of the politics of it all.  Then on r/bitcoin there was one of those posts (I later figured out was probably fake anyway) about a user supposedly getting ""tricked"" by bitcoin.com, and it came down to the user having sent BCH to a Segwit wallet address.

&gt; Is my sender and asshole for being a cheap fuck?

That depends upon a lot of factors. If the sender knew that you needed the funds quickly and by delaying the funds it will cause you hardship and that is the intent of the sender, then yes... the sender is being an asshole.

If the sender is like you, new to Bitcoin Core (BTC), then they likely did not know about the difficulties in sending a transaction on that bitcoin chain. Likely did set the transaction up as an RBF transaction or used a disingenuous transaction type.

gagfj6o,JuanChaleco,16,"In general:
The progressive people tries to integrate them and treat them as chileans and just another person. The more conservatives go through the logic of ""charity starts at home"" and go full racist in some cases.

The objective view probably is that we are a small country that is/was not prepared to integrate them economically, and that has generated a lot of pain points, lowering already low wages and making entry jobs hard to get, Haitians will work forever for as little as nothing, Peruvians will accept working  in conditions chileans just won't, and venezuelans come taking janitorial, as 
house service or gardeners with law degrees or engineering titles. But the truth is that they didn't do it. The laws were soft and ""job creators"" just went full sweat shop on everybody. Is a meme were we saw mechanics and supermarkets full of peruvians one day and now full of haitians the next day. And it doesn't help, Black people speaking creole in already crowded busses and metro or in already unsecure perceived places full of unknown people speaking a ""weird kind of french"" or Venezuelans offering professional services for the smallest of fees that you can pay on bitcoin in job markets were you used to be able to maintain yourself, all in the downtime of their ubereats job.

At the end chileans are warm with the ones we know, from every side, even the most upper class segregated family will have a peruvian acquaintance from chimbote who told him about how real corruption is in other places, or a Venezuelan girl with a law degree serving you a cheese sandwitch, called in the least common name in chilean ""civil registry"", will talk about how things are unsafe were she lives, but no were near how it was in Barquisimento where she saw a guy killed with machetes ""because beer and 5 bucks owed or something like that"". The Chilean person will help both and consider them the same as any other person.

The problem in Chile is not really racism (not generalized at least and not by it self) the problem is Classism and snubness. If you are poor and i don't know you, unless you are a gringo, from europe or ""white asian""... you are ""dangerous"" or ""potentially dangerous"".",2020-10-29 12:24:23

The long answer to why it seems like you are just hearing about things now.

* The 2000 series introduced real time ray tracing in video games, which was a cool new technology introduced to consumer level products (technologies like this only come every decade or so). However the 2000 series was actually controversial because of a few reasons.

&gt; 1. Rasterization performance (the standard way to render game scenes when not ray tracing) was not markedly better than the 1000 series (single digit % performance increases but in some cases it even performed worse). 

&gt; 2. Ray tracing is computationally expensive, turning it on would mean that performance in terms of frames per second would be significantly worse. In fact many games use both rasterization and ray tracing so they don't have to do full ray tracing to save performance.

&gt; 3. No games actually had ray tracing available for about 4-6 months after the release of the video cards. You paid for features you couldn't even use until later.

&gt; 4. They were very expensive. Many people who had the 900 or 1000 series did not want to pay for expensive video cards (the bitcoin mining craze also hit video card prices and availability hard right before the 2000 series launched).

* The 3000 cards just released and actually had a big performance gain over the 2000 series in terms of both rasterization and ray tracing performance at a more affordable price (NVIDIA claimed that the 3070 at $500 could outperform the 2080 TI at $1000+). In addition NVIDIA has been working on DLSS 2.0, a AI upscaling technology that makes ray tracing and playing games at high (4k+) resolutions more viable.

* AMD (the second biggest video card maker) has been trailing in terms of market share for a while. However today they had a press event that had claims that they would match the performance of NVIDIA cards at competitive prices up and down the entire product stack. It's something they haven't managed to do in a while.

* New consoles are coming out this year so people have been keeping an eye on what kind of new graphics tech will be included.

So with the controversial 2000 series with new tech, the major performance gains of the 3000 series, AMD possibly making a comeback and new consoles, people/media are talking.",2020-10-29 11:10:31

gafx8td,Nagosh,10,"We're still above 13k and funding is about to go really negative, lol wtf. We are at resistance here so I don't want to get out of my short since you should never buy resistance, but something tells me that I should. All future premiums have dropped substantially, too.

This could still drop, and I honestly should wait for a little before making any decisions, but 13k is looking mighty strong.

Edit: To add a bit more to this - the reason we could be seeing such strength from BTC is from the most basic of fundamentals, supply vs demand. I don't know if demand has increased that dramatically but I think supply is dwindling fast.

People are shorting bitcoin since traditional markets are going down, hence the negative funding rate and the massive decrease to future premiums. But bitcoin isn't a company. There's nothing to sell, dividends to pay, or customers to make happy. Simple supply and demand dictate everything, and anyone who is currently buying bitcoin is probably just locking it away for at least a year. And when supply is gone, the price moves higher.

I'm still expecting a drop of at least 20% sometime in the near future, but it is looking less likely that it will happen at this price point.

Possibly something like this? [https://share.cryptowat.ch/charts/bud13ar5m2sd4qf0r10g-coinbase-pro-btcusd.png](https://share.cryptowat.ch/charts/bud13ar5m2sd4qf0r10g-coinbase-pro-btcusd.png)",2020-10-29 09:29:54

gaeslpy,MobTwo,8,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cash’s long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the outdated BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 250 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 250 billion will give you more than 50x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. It is inevitable that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the end.",2020-10-29 04:06:31

Not bullish or bearish, but fascinated by what's unfolding.  4 years ago today I stopped researching and wondering and started playing with pocket change.  I saw prices go up, ratios fluctuate but I had no idea what was happening from a historical perspective and it took many months for me to understand the intercrypto waves I was riding.  I honestly thought the growth potential was probably played out, thus the mere pocket change (oh how I kick myself now).  

Today I know where we're at and what it means.  The significance of it.  I'm not sure that we can make history again, much less that it will be soon, but history is well within our grasp.  There have been so many milestones since the 2018 bust, charting this path.  But everything up to now -- finding a bottom, the recovery, the halvings, the infrastructure, the institutions, the big names and all the headlines -- was just development and dress rehearsal.  Now it's time for the show.  The curtain is rising.  Snarky reviewers are watching for something to pounce on.  Audiences are waiting with bated breath.  

Litecoin did its part in 2019 workshopping and has settled into understudy status (where I suspect it will remain until Act 3).  Everything rests on Bitcoin.  Act I requires Bitcoin to close a monthly candle above $14k and then not invalidate it by closing another below, which confirms a double bottom (Dec 2018, March 2020) with a target of... $24k.  Then for Act II Bitcoin on the way to that target encounters the $19k ATH.  In 2017, BTC wrestled around the $1k ATH for 3 months, peeking above and diving below over and over like a cheeky dolphin goofing off.  No one knows if Bitcoin can breakout past $19k much less how long it will take.  If it does, then on to Act III, wherein Bitcoin will attempt to take an mcap somewhere between $2.5 trillion and $10 trillion, possibly even rivaling the mcap of gold (briefly, if it gets that far), during which time should Act 3 occur, Litecoin will take the stage to attempt a $100 to $300 billion mcap all its own to rival bitcoin's 2017 mcap.

A bad word of mouth travels faster then any paid advert or remaining perks that the card hold since those perks are also diminishing in value with every dropping cent of the CRO coin, thats all that I can say.

Like Kris said. CRO will never replace MCO and the last time, go buy some bitcoin :)",2020-10-31 05:45:17

ganvive,decibels42,10,"My friends: Raoul Pal is a visionary and is an excellent macro market analyst. He’s a crypto bull (both Bitcoin and Ethereum), but it’s apparent to me he is *lacking* on the full picture of Ethereum. Let’s teach him. 

If you’re interested, check out how much he talks about crypto with Ash in today’s daily briefing: https://youtu.be/ZosOo4FQEBw. They’re both clearly massive crypto bulls, and not because of bias, but out of necessity and because it’s *the best trade in the macro landscape today*.

/u/DCinvestor and honestly everyone’s let’s reach out to Raoul and get this guy on /r/ethfinance for a discussion ASAP. It’ll be a half AMA from Raoul and half educational session with Raoul, who desperately needs to be educated on the **real** fundamentals of Ethereum that most on this sub knows and understands (but is over the head of Raoul currently).

This isn't decentralization or anything, but honestly I'd say it's about time. I'm surprised they didn't do it sooner. Bitcoin is probably the only asset I'd want to see a robust, decentralized, trustless bridge built for. For the rest of them (and the limited purposes you'd want to use them for), I think this is sufficient.

As a result, users are overbidding eachother in order to get their transactions processed, by paying higher miner fees.

Eventually, the demand might slow down and fees might becomes bearable again, but it's not possible to accurately predict when.

For the future, if you need a chain that is built for scalability that doesn't have this problem, you could test and see if Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fits your needs instead.",2020-10-31 02:44:42
