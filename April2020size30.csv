fm31pg6,concernedcustomer33,4,"In August 2015, the BTC market looked a lot like it does now.  It had crashed to well below $200, after briefly peaking above $300 the month before, and was hovering around $230.  The wick down had reached a level similar to the bottom from seven months earlier, causing people to question the recovery narrative.  Many traders were shorting in expectation of further declines.  I wasn't invested in crypto at the time; as a casual market observer, I interpreted continued price weakness as evidence that Bitcoin was a failed Ponzi.  By early October, BTC had regained $250, and hasn't approached that level since.  

Does the above mean something similar will happen this time?  Perhaps not, but history often rhymes, and I think crypto is being  underestimated.  BTC isn't very flexible, but it's great in the role of scarce digital reserve asset.  While gold is the prototype of money, try keeping a significant amount of it safe, or transferring it to another party under travel restrictions.  If an orgy of fiat printing isn't good for crypto, what would be?  If governments can create as much fiat as they want without consequence, why do we pay taxes?  That's not rhetorical; more folks will ask such questions as central banks get increasingly desperate, which is bad news for the status quo.  

I'm thrilled that I'll (almost certainly) be able to earn (real!) ETH via staking in 2020.  I won't be able to move it for a while, but so what?  I'll be supporting the network, getting a good interest rate on ETH that's idle right now, and helping to kill the environmental scourge of PoW.  My theory is that large amounts of capital (both BTC and fiat) are waiting for eth2 to arrive (a long process, I know); I think the moment people perceive a production eth2 network as inevitable is when we'll see the ratio explosion.  If that happens, it will be because the fundamental market reality has changed, while simultaneously completing the pattern many of us have been expecting.  Stay safe, everyone; the situation won't always feel this bleak.",2020-04-01 12:10:43

fm2k3gc,fut-,3,"This is a pretty thorough post - wish we had more level-headed content like this.

Personally, my beef is not with people buying silver or gold. It's that they see this as a binary choice: cash under mattress **OR** gold, nothing else - because we ""don't trust evil banks"" and all that. And so, it ends up being this ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" kind of a situation... retirement fund? Gold. Want to hedge against inflation? Buy gold! Want to bet against the US economy? Buy gold! Zombies are coming? Gold! Etc, etc.

I think this unwillingness to learn about financial instruments is actually kinda harmful. In particular, if you want to make money when S&amp;P 500 is crashing... there are straightforward products that guarantee results. Gold doesn't, it moves in fairly unpredictable ways.

There are two other things that I think are missing here. One is that the ""counterparty risk"" is not as black-and-white as you make it seem. Because most people you deal with don't know the value of gold and don't know how to authenticate it, you are generally limited to specialized markets - and these markets exist at the mercy of your government. Private ownership of gold was banned in the US for many decades; many other countries resorted to confiscations / forced exchange in the times of crisis, too. When this happens, your market shrinks, premiums go through the roof, and every trade carries serious risks. Doesn't make gold worthless, but makes it a lot less versatile. The same applies to Bitcoin, by the way; the government can't ""shut it down"", but if they put enough people in jail for using it, it's gonna reduce liquidity and depress prices pretty fast.

Finally, less so for gold, but for most other precious metals - including silver - a lot of the value is driven by industrial demand. A profound, global economic contraction can depress the prices quite a bit, just because factories no longer need nearly as much silver as the mines produce. Doubly so for less common metals, such as platinum. Gold is a bit different, in that roughly half of all demand has to do with its ""consumer appeal"".",2020-04-01 08:58:05

I think it would be useful to set up a private channel on IRC or a create selected group from cs.rin.ru or whatever you can so you can have beta testers for your cracks. That would reduce the majority of the time and money you say you would spend doing this, which seems to be testing!

I bet cs.rin.ru admins can manage to do that! Unfortunately, relying exclusively on donations won't get you too far... maybe give you a couple of beers and a game or two... Even emulators projects which are very popular rarely hit 4-digit figures. And add the bitcoin layer for anonymity.. Very rarely people use it...

how is the exchange done trustlessly and how does ethereums keep network which promises ""privacy"" work? zksnarks?

id like some documentation on how this works

as the article says wrapped bitcoin has been done before e.g. wBTC but requires a centralised party to mint wBTC making it out of the question for defi.

edit: did some digging [there is a whitepaper](https://backend.keep.network/whitepaper) , but i just wanted a synopsis. 

soo i went on their github and looked at the readme on some projects; found a few interesting things, though not an entire explanation.

https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc

&gt; tBTC is a trustlessly Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token.

&gt; The goal of the project is to provide a stronger 2-way peg than federated sidechains like Liquid, expanding use cases possible via today‚Äôs Bitcoin network, while bringing superior money to other chains.

&gt; This repo contains the Solidity smart contracts and specification.



https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc

&gt; tbtc.js provides JS bindings to the tBTC system. The tBTC system is a bonded, multi-federated peg made up of many deposits backed by single-use BTC wallets to enable their value‚Äôs corresponding usage on the Ethereum chain, primarily through the minting of a TBTC ERC20 token whose supply is guaranteed to be backed by at least 1 BTC per TBTC in circulation.

finally this is the best:

https://tbtc.network/developers/tbtc-technical-system-overview

here is the first few pargarphs

&gt; 2020-04-01
tBTC incorporates novel design features that carry important implications for users. This piece explains four of these: TDT receipts, multiple lot sizes, Keep's random beacon, and threshold signatures.

&gt; TBTC Deposit Token (TDT)
The TBTC Deposit Token (TDT) is a non-fungible token that is minted when a user requests a deposit. A TDT is a non-fungible ERC-721 token that serves as a counterpart to TBTC. It represents a claim to a deposit's underlying UTXO on the Bitcoin blockchain.

&gt; TBTC deposits can be locked or unlocked. A locked deposit can only be redeemed by the deposit owner with the corresponding TDT. Each TDT is unique to the deposit that mints it and carries the exclusive right for up to a 6 month term to redeem the deposit.


my take away from this is that by using side chains that a trustless, not fedeared like liquid bitcoin sidechains sold by blockstream. it uses NFT erc-721 tokens (no two erc-271 tokens are the same) they use thse tokens it seems to extract UTXO from the bitcoin blockchain, store it in a wallet and mint it into tBTC. given this is all smart contracts, i muse that hte wallets / minting are all controlled by smart contracts. so this is a trustles way of getting a wrapped version of btc unlike wBTC which relies on a centralised company.

very cool. so um where is LN these days? i saw a graph showing that wBTC was already doing more transactions :P

looks like erc20 token trading is the way to go forward. just requires wrapping of exisitng tokens. this will get easier as time goes on",2020-04-03 06:33:27

fmcp8yf,OsrsNeedsF2P,3,"I mean, they did get away with it. They turned the Bitcoin into Monero.

They likely went for Bitcoin first for a number of reasons:

1) Bitcoins traceability could have tricked some authorities into thinking they could find them after

2) The victims immediately knew what Bitcoin was, and it's easier to acquire large sums of

3) Starting with Monero could have brought negative press and a downwards price on Monero after the ransom was paid",2020-04-04 06:41:25
fmc69af,CryptoGuard,3,"Yeah, my perspective is that this is the right answer.

From a currency perspective I think **Monero is still king**. It has a huge anonymity pool, solid privacy tech to back it up, and is private-by-default.

But **it has a bit of an issue when buying or selling things online as you can't doing it safely without involving a third-party**. What I mean by that is...how do you know for sure the person you send your Monero to is going to send you the item you purchased? You either need to trust the other party or ask for a third-party (and trust them too) to escrow the transaction.

This is what made me big on **Particl, which is like a sort of OpenBazaar, but private-by-default**. It's a decentralized marketplace with a two-party escrow system. It uses its own native privacy coin (PART), which uses similar privacy tech as Monero does, to settle payments but can also work with a ton of other cryptocurrencies. It has a custom implementation of RingCT that was built on the Bitcoin codebase vs the Cryptonote codebase. It also uses stealth addresses and Confidential Transactions, but that's really a detail for the point I'm trying to make.

Particl using a different codebase than Monero is the key part imo. It basically gives this ""Monero-like"" coin the ability to be used in smart-contracts and decentralized applications, which is basically what the Particl dev team did with the Particl marketplace.

But the thing is, PART, as a standalone currency, is not as private as Monero because it's not private-by-default on ALL transactions and has a smaller user base. BUT, the transactions made on its MARKETPLACE, they, on the other hand, are fully private. **A sort of sensationalistic, but actually true way to describe the marketplace would be ""the Monero of decentralized marketplaces"", as 100% of the marketplace transactions are untraceable.**

So after thinking about both Monero and Particl for, frankly, a few years now, I've come to the conclusion that **buying (or selling) something online should be done by using both coins (PART and XMR) at once if one wants to achieve the best level of privacy.**

1- You browse the Particl marketplace, find something you want to buy

2- Send in payment in Monero. You and the seller won't need to pay a fee or commission for any sale made on Particl

3- The marketplace smart-contracts receive your payment, and auto-converts it into PART.

4- The converted payment gets placed into a two-party escrow system so that neither you or the person you're transacting with can screw the other. Again, no escrow fee, no BS, 100% decentralized and trustless.

5- Seller sends you your order, you receive it, and both parties complete their end of the escrow.

You get your item, the seller gets his money, and nobody ever ran the risk of being scammed/exit-scammed/or have their funds frozen/lost.

Anyway, that's really just my two cents, but my point with this entire post is that we shouldn't be tribalistic about cryptocurrencies. **Some ""privacy coins"" aim to be the one single best and most private solution out there while some other privacy coins want to have good enough privacy but be complementary with other coins. Such is the coin with PART, a relatively strong privacy coin (but not the best) that gives utility and more functionalities to more private (and rigid, less flexible) coins like Monero or Zcash (or Arrr).**",2020-04-04 03:48:05

\- Dont send your product without getting paid.  There are ways where your customer can maybe try to convince you that the payment has been sent.  Beauty of Bitcoin, you can verify for yourself.  The flip side, the sender of Bitcoin doesn't have recourse, the transaction is irreversible.

\- Some customers wont know how to get BTC, but that will be a minority.  On the other hand, others that prefer to deal with BTC.

\- You'll need to figure out a way to get Fiat (Cash) for BTC - ie. how do you cash out, frequency, and through which exchange.  Through part luck/part strategy, this ended up winning Wikileaks a once in a lifetime fortune.

The author of the article hinges his argument on the misguided notion that the current financial system ""rests on very fragile foundations.""    
When in fact the way bitcoin has been ""used"" by the majority of its use base is more prone to react to negative news because they fear ""FUD"". The reason BTC market is so FUD sensitive is because BTC does not have any financial base to support it, the only reason it is at the current price is because of blind greedy hype.    
Hype is the only reason BTC goes up.  Which is why the community loaths FUD.   
If BTC has any real economic value then FUD would have little to no effect.   
Furthermore the author is stuck in the past where BTC was the only crypto in the market space. But that is certainly no longer true, there are hundreds of viable cryptos that are doing things better, faster, more secure and cheaper than bitcoin.

The line between them and the so-called ""legitimate"" MLM outfits is so blurred as to be nearly invisible (which is why we're all here).

fmpmn6i,PhantomFortune,6,"I'm not short, but I'm also not convinced what we're seeing right now is bullish. Volume isn't fitting the profile of a bullish consolidation after an upmove. With bitcoin, we're seeing above average volume on down candles, instead of a progressive decrease in volume while it moves sideways. If you take a look at eth, here is my evidence of large selling I posted in another sub:

Objectively, someone is selling a lot of eth here. If you are a trader, this would not be a bad time to take profit. Yesterday's volume: 398k eth (+20.1%). Today's volume so far: 308k eth (+0.34%)

In a strong trend, large volume creates price expansion in the direction of momentum (buying). Yesterday, perfect. Today, large volume with almost no price expansion. That is what buying into large, resting sell orders looks like.

When these price expansion/volume divergences happen, it usually means the top, or near top with a weak push higher.

edit: For bitcoin, I'm looking at 1hr. candle volume to analyze the flag it's in. For eth, I'm looking at daily candles. Bitcoin daily candles also show the same high-volume-but-no-upwards-movement phenomenon.",2020-04-08 03:19:01

fmr6r7z,mikkeller,4,"I got into Bitcoin back in 2013.  BS in Computer Science and was fascinated by it.

Became obsessed and learned everything I could about and the entire space.  I remember Ethereum gearing up for it's ICO and it was going to be like MasterCoin but better, which at the time was pretty hyped.   Ethereum was dubbed as ""programmable money"" back then which doesn't do it justice and to be honest I thought it was another crypto like Bitcoin with some ""extra features"" but I really had no idea until I got fully immersed and started really understanding what it was capable of/trying to do.   That's when it ""clicked"" for me, but it took a while for the click to happen.

Before it clicked I was a frequent in a multitude of IRC chat rooms, pump groups, and bitcoin talk and I actually bought into all the FUD and thought it was going to be a failure.  I successfully margin shorted it on Poloniex for months on end - it was like free money and I shorted it to it's all time low.

Around then I started really paying attention (or rather, doing my own research versus just listening to others) and I thought to myself... what can Bitcoin do that Ethereum can't?  Not only was the answer ""Nothing"" in fact Ethereum was exponentially more vast in what it's goal was than Bitcoin.   I saw that this was going to be one of the primary protocols for the future Machine to Machine economy and the decentralized open source movement.

At that point in time, my entire goal in trading was to increase my BTC stack.  USD value didn't concern me at all, it was all about increasing my BTC stack.  Around then (Late 2016/early 2017)  I sold my entire stack of BTC for ETH and never looked back.  My friends who were knowledgeable asked me why I did that and I said, if BTC will 10x ETH will 100x and BTC went on to 20x and ETH 200x.   The development in ETH and the growth of the community and ecosystem has surpassed my expectations related to the timeline I imagined and I believe ETH is destined for massive upside, I believe that BTC is as well, but the key to the future decentralized open source movement is in Ethereum's hand.

Doesn't mean you shouldn't hold BTC and it may outperform in smaller time spans, but long term, ETH is exponentially more valuable in it's potential that BTC, and it's pretty clear to anyone who becomes obsessed in their research and keeps an open mind.",2020-04-08 12:06:33

Besides, reddit is full of trolls who are unable to understand and appreciate marvelous wonder of Craig's beautiful mind. We have no time to talk with them and our congregation understands each other without words.

This basically means even with a custom client you can't scam someone or both of you lose your coins. 

From the wallet to the network, Bisq protects your coins and you own your keys. But, if you make a transaction, the attack vector is greater than just the keys and now the transaction as well.

Using a custom implementation, hackers were able to modify the transaction used in trading and change the donation address without the transaction counting as invalid. An unsuspecting trader uses the transaction with them, and the attacker aborts leaving all the coins to go to the donation address.

The problem with Segwit was that it was implemented:

1. As a soft fork, requiring a hard-fork to opt-out
2. As an  [omnibus package to push unpopular changes](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)
3. Was designed to ""[Reduce] UTXO growth"", which is a measure proportional to adoption.

But yes, Bitcoin Cash implemented [BIP 143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki) because it actually solved an urgent scaling obstacle. Specifically, it makes large blocks safer for the network to process by solving the Quadratic hashing problem.

fmv6c2o,WittyStick,8,"The big mistake nearly everyone makes is attempting to value Bitcoin in dollars. The idea is absurd, but most people have not yet understood what Bitcoin is and are still trapped in a fiat mindset. The issue is that there are a potentially infinite number of dollars, and the number of dollars in existence varies from year to year, and nobody really knows how many there even are (some estimates exist, but the errors in them are potentially huge).

Bitcoin, as we know, has a finite and independently measurable upper limit. We can say that there's a Absolute Maximum Bitcoin (AMB) of 21,000,000 and a Maximum Bitcoin to Date (MBD) of ~18,500,000. This means that if I have 1 BTC, I have 1/21,000,000 AMB and I have ~1/18,500,000 MBD. Often we hear 1BTC=1BTC, which assumes 1MBD=1AMB, which will eventually be the case, but at present is close to 10% out because Bitcoin's supply is still due to inflate by nearly 10%. So 1MBD = 0.9AMB. (The distinction is important if you want to measure Bitcoin now versus Bitcoin in 2050).

Either way, since both AMB and MBD are independently verifiable, then Bitcoin presents itself as the first (and last) commodity in history whose measure of value can be expressed in terms of itself (expressed outside of itself it is priceless). It is the SI unit of value measurement against which we can objectively measure the value of any other commodity, including of course, the dollar. So what does the dollar look like when priced in Bitcoin?

https://i.imgur.com/GgPNbyx.png

Note that this chart is been adjusted for the (approximate) MBD. In essence, this chart tells you how large a share of the MBD you can purchase with a dollar over the past 10 years. Note the log scale on the Y axis. Additionally, this Y axis need never change (unlike the charts you are used to seeing, whose Y axis will continue expanding infinitely), as it covers the smallest denomination of bitcoin at which you can even exchange a dollar for it. Eventually, you will not be able to obtain *any bitcoin for your dollar whatsoever**.

\**You may be able to obtain a fraction of a satoshi through extended protocols built around bitcoin.*

This ""upside down"" chart is the one which every exchange, wallet or bitcoin service should really be displaying. The ""number go up"" chart is extremely misleading because it presents Bitcoin as something whose purpose is to try and sell at the highest dollar price, when in fact, as the chart I've just shown you tells you very clearly, Bitcoin is about getting rid of your fiat money as quickly as possible because it is *rapidly* declining in value.

Morality is not part of the protocol. The entire point of mining and decentralisation is to stop this exact behaviour.

Bitcoin is amoral but Bitcoin core dev thought it was a good idea to use a anyonecanspend tx to trick old node in to following a chain they cannot fully audit.

How does that work?

To all no-Segwit aware node those transactions appear as they can be spend by anyone.

That way they could force hard fork-like and old would remain ignorant of the change.

Basically it is a hack.


BCH node don‚Äôt run segwit.

Some miner took advantage of it and tried to collect all the tx send by mistake on the BCH network.

Some other miner decided to orphan this block and replaced it by a block that returned the money to their owner.

Both transactions history is valid, 

Only some BCH miners decided to reject a block that stole users, basically they considered it invalid.



From the white paper conclusion:

&gt;	They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.

There is never **total** economic collapses. During recessions or depressions there are always winners and losers. Mining difficulty is dynamic both ways to insure Bitcoin is always profitable for efficient miners.

If you are concerned about block subsidy being cut during the upcoming halving on mining than - 

This is the third halving and many expressed the same concerns but most of this is overblown for these reasons :

1) many miners already upgraded or transitioning to newest 5nm ASIC chips , so are more efficient for same electricity

2) Many miners have fixed electrical contracts or sunk costs in renewable power so it makes no sense to temporarily turn off ASICs until difficulty readjusts (remember difficult is dynamic both ways)

3) Price will likely go up to cover at least some of the costs of inflation drop

4) some miners simply care about Bitcoin

5) even with a significant drop in hashrate , bitcoin hashrate has grown so much over the last year we will still be much higher. To give you an idea hashrate can be cut in half and we are still at 2018 levels 

We already tested this recently due to the wuhanflu economic scares and global economic turmoil in early march with ~40% price drop (simulating what a 50% inflation cut without price increase would do ) and hashrate barely dropped.

Biggest price drop was march 12th , and when looking at hashrate I see a mere ~20% drop in hashrate that rebound to up 17% on 14th so a mere 3% drop in hashrate

It really isn't a big deal",2020-04-11 08:39:46

I think one of the major flaws of Bitcoin is that it is based on the implicit assumption that all market participants believe in the long-term success under the current regime. As long as that holds true, it is in their self-interest to behave ""well"" in the sense that they have no interest in changing the system or outright exploiting it for short-term gain, the miner equivalent of an exit scam. 

But given that it is clearly not gaining any traction outside its relatively narrow ecosystem, this is more and more becoming a possibility, especially with a depressed price and vanishing margins.

Bullshit and who cares, Adam Back never did anything of any real relevance. He made an implementation of some work done 5 years prior by real academics, that doesn't make him a ""cypherpunk""

&gt;Bitcoin likely wouldn't exist without him. 

LOL, Satoshi only gave a passing reference to that clown, literally none of Adam's work is actually in the code, Adam was offered a chance to help and turned it down, because he is an idiot. He then used that reference to con venture capitalists into funding his corporate toolbox.

&gt;The next most prolific cypherpunk would be Nick Szabo, who has published hundreds of influential articles and also created BitGold, which was VERY similar to Bitcoin.

I cant entirely disagree on that

&gt;Adam Back and Nick Szabo have both publicly criticized BCH so unfortunately their names have been virtually erased from the history books on this sub. They are either ignored entirely or dragged through the mud by some new user who has no idea how important their contributions were. Bitcoin doesn't exist without Adam Back (Hash Cash) and Nick Szabo (BitGold). Plain and simple.

fn3dmnv,spirtdica,1,"I'm generally inclined to agree with you about PoS being, well a PoS. After all, it is very much prone to the centralization of coin possession. PoW allows for a more egalitarian coin distribution due to its lower barrier to entry. 


The reason I find Loki intriguing is because it still enjoys some of the benefits of PoW from its hybrid approach. Furthermore, to take advantage of PoS there is a sort of service requirement; it's not enough to just lock up coins and call it a day. Loki masternodes are obliged to serve as public nodes, ensuring that there is an incentive to seed the blockchain and provide services to light wallet users. 


I'm not convinced that this approach is preferable to the likes of Monero's RPC Pay feature; but one of the problems faced by any p2p network or anonymity network is the free-rider problem. Providing an incentive to provide such services helps mitigate this issue.  For that reason I find the approach interesting and at least worthy of more investigation. 



Like you said, there are definitely drawbacks to the use of masternodes in the network architecture. There are clearly both pros and cons; my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs. 



Monero is focused on its application as private digital cash, which it excels at. Loki strikes me as an innovative approach at using similar cryptographic primitives to achieve a different, more open-ended role as an incentive token to promote active participation in providing privacy services. In a way I look at it somewhat like ETH; ETH is not exactly a pure financial application of public key cryptography like Bitcoin or Monero. I wouldn't consider ETH to be ""money"" because it lacks fungibility, but it is still clearly valuable due to its utility on its network. 


That's fine, because the applications of blockchain are more than just censorship resistant digital cash. But in my eyes that means that comparing Loki to Monero isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison even though they share many underlying cryptographic primitives",2020-04-12 00:22:41

fn3fmyc,MusicallyDiverse,1,"I'm of the *opinion* that it comes down to immediate value.. When a global pandemic and/or economic crisis hits, such as the one we find ourselves in now, people turn to their investments and liquidate the assets that don't have a ""guaranteed"" value. 

Stocks in general are much more ""established"" economically than cryptos are - in the grand scheme of things, they're barely in adolescence, and I wouldn't even say that they're THAT far yet. Stocks have been around for over a century, and there are companies who have stood the test of time. Same with physical goods, such as gold and oil (though in this instance oil is a bad example of a store of value given that everyone is locked inside, greatly restricting travel and therefore oil's necessity), these things are viewed as less likely to plummet to zero in the event of a catastrophe. 

Bitcoin has not [stood the test of time], and it has yet to truly prove itself in terms its long term value and use cases. 

All this is to say that when people either need money or fear a ""sell-off,"" they turn to the least used and/or understood assets in their portfolio. Cryptos are still too young to be seen as ""valuable and sustainable"" as some of the decades-old companies represented by the stock market.

fn9rrjk,FaustianBargainHunt,524,"I'm exhausted and don't know what to do. Last week my dad, who's in his late sixties, apparently spent $10,000 to buy bitcoin from some guy who phoned and claimed to work at a bitcoin brokerage firm. He didn't tell my mum until a few days later, and was sure he was going to make like $50k in profit from it. My mum was furious and they had a big argument, and he promised he would never do it again. The 'broker' phoned back today and my dad spent three hours on the phone with him and ended up buying another $10,000 worth of bitcoin. And it's money my parents really don't have - it came out of their mortgage.

My mum called me in tears this afternoon about it, saying she didn't know what to do. I called my dad and tried to reason with him, and he was sure he would get rich from it and I told him that even if bitcoin went back to an all time high, at most he would make $5k. So he agreed to try cancel the second purchase.

Then as I was getting ready for bed I decided to look up the company and it turns out it's a big scam. Some guy based in Hungary (who lied and said he was based in the UK). So I called my dad and told him and he doesn't know what to do. And so I called his bank, and it's too late to reverse the second transaction, and the best they can do is try get the funds back if the receiving bank will cooperate. But now it seems hopeless and I'm scared for my parents, and for the sake of their relationship, and for my dad's mental health going through this. But what hurts the most is my sister and I had been saving money to try give them $10k as an anniversary/birthday present to help pay down the mortgage, and we both have decent jobs but hardly earn a lot. And it makes it so hard to justify saving money for them when dad just gets these stupid ideas and impulsively spends $20k on apparent bitcoin from some guy on the phone, without even checking that it's real. I just don't know what to do and I'm furious with him but also just need to help them and don't know how.",2020-04-13 22:01:36

This doesn't make any sense because Bitcoin uses checksums. A typo or leaving off the end of an address would simply means the tx is never sent.

Do you guys think the people buying bitcoin now are really strapped for cash? And would panic sell in case there food shortages like some have been saying? I know there are still dumbasses in this market who invest money they can‚Äôt afford to lose. But I don‚Äôt think that part of the retail buyers are the majority now, most of them have been flushed out during the 2017-2020 bear market. We‚Äôve already capitulated twice down to 3k/4k, and the jump has been strong. The people buying now are the ones who have extra cash to do so.

Those people have sold in the last few weeks. Also we‚Äôre starting to see death toll drop in Italy.

But that also means we shouldn‚Äôt expect too many buyers. Seems like a the perfect condition for a very long sideways movement, as the economy also need time to recover.

fnavjp8,darmon,18,"value added tax, is a regressive tax, meaning it disproportionately affects those with less money than those with money, and it is a retail sales tax, meaning everyone pays it at the time of retail sale.  So on luxury items like a PS4, there would be a large VAT $ associated.  That is you paying into the social programs of your country, because you purchased something that vast swaths of the country you're in could not afford whatsoever.

Instead of taxing the rich directly, which is impossible because they have entirely captured the political and social and legislative and media frameworks, which would raise MUCH MORE MONEY and alleviate oppressive inequality, we tax the people who demonstrably have no agency, political power, or social clout, who buy stuff,  for the act of buying stuff, which is easy to accomplish politically.

But more to your question: how do we pay for it?  How do we pay for anything?  Where does ANY money come from?  Any money.  One whole buck.  Where does it get born into the universe?  I grow tomatoes, you raise sheep, that guy builds barns, and that lady designs our respective websites: who, where, is injecting the dollars into this situation?

UBI is a dramatic REIMAGINING.  AS SUCH, you have to use your imagination!  Hard, given that our society has systematically, deliberately undermined the social ability to imagine alternatives to this system, INTENTIONALLY, for GENERATIONS.

Where does money come from?  tomatoes, farms, sheep, computers, these are real - kilometers, kilowatts, kilograms, these are real - is money real?  Money is a paleolithic attempt to quantify the universe we live in, the Earth we are on, and our relationships to each other, ALL AT ONCE, WITH A SINGLE VARIABLE.  It's like a catch all ""X"".  Exchanging spaceship parts for groceries?  money.  Exchanging oil for the watts to run a PC to farm bitcoin? money.  exchanging your lived hours, + your labor, to an employer for their projects? money. paying for the expenses of a loved ones funeral rites? money.  getting married? money.  having a baby? money.

To think that a single variable can/should/will indefinitely carry out every physical exchange in the cosmos is.... paleolithic.

UBI is a way to DEMOCRATIZE AND UNIVERSALIZE AND DECENTRALIZE the monetary creation mechanisms.

Instead of the current model: simply do nothing politically your entire life, while bequeathing the oligarchs, through tacit allowance, the capacity to create the currency with which they impose their oligarchy.

Think about it.  They are all in power.  They conspire, hey, tomatoes for spaceship parts applied across the distance between say, England and Peru, hey that's super um complicated how about we use a stand in note?

Bing bang boom oh hey look the illegitimate systems that had the oligarchs in power since time immemorial, can be draped in the appearance of their being ""gone,"" thanks to our totally fair monetary system,‚Ñ¢ which is totally more legit than what we were doing before (feudalism, perpetual war, other essentially paleolithic shit) we can launder our hegemony, and at the end say hey look we're still in power. Fucking plebs won't know what hit them.  We can buy them, with their OWN political power, for ""pennies"" on the ""dollar!""

The reality is, if we affix the price, the true price, of every consumer good on the planet, every industrial good on the planet, every transaction, in terms of CO2 contributed to the atmosphere/coast line lost/population displaced/toxic waste spills/indentured workers, the price on a pack of gum would be a trillion dollars, no one living could afford a single thing anyplace, and the system would irrevocably grind to a halt.

That is what it means to be living in a system that is wholly illegitimate.  That is what it means, to be living in a system where every transaction is illegitimate, not because of what is being transacted, but because deliberate shortcomings of the MONEY SYSTEM as exchange mechanism. Everything is influenced by it, and corrupted by it.  We need to stymie the corruption, with decentralized, adaptive, resilient, technocratic solutions that make our immediate communities more productive and more stable INTERNALLY, in models that are entirely new.

Imagine UBI in partitions.  It's not about ""where does the money come from?"" it's about ""what are we trying to quantify/signify/control?""

SHOULD we use our monetary system to exact and/or influence certain behaviors from people?  Isn't that highly immoral and antithetical to the recognition of individual rights of autonomy and movement?

So what are we trying to innumerate?  Bodies, their actions, their needs, their history, their future.

If money is paleolithic, it is the god damn 21st century!  We need a ""money 2.0"" and UBI gets us closer to that.

[I remember when they first launched in January 2019](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blockchain-based-game-publisher-planet-digital-partners-launching-with-former-nintendo) I thought investors were gonna laugh them out the room and shoot the baby in the crib. But alas, as I've learned with other disasters like Fyre Festival and WeWork, *Rich people are fucking idiots* most investors aren't like those guys on Shark Tank. 

You can convince dumb multi-millioniares to invest in your startup restaurant franchise where all you serve is literal dog shit on paper plates [as long as your video pitch has decent infographics and include the words ""block chain""](https://youtu.be/wp1hR-8YaBs).


EDIT: Im sick of the people and Twitter ""journalists"" that keep peddling the ""the game turns your Switch into Bitcoin mining machine!!"" myth because it ignores the scam these thugs in suits just pulled. You guys need to understand what this peak bourgeois degeneracy looks like.

To start a business you need capital, some get it in the form of bank loans, some get it by privately or publicly selling shares of their company (stock market).
So these parasites at Planet Digital chose making their own cryptocurrency and selling it like stock.

&gt;Planet Digital‚Äôs asset is the Rocket Token (RKT.) The platform will have a security token offering during the first quarter of 2019. There will be 50 million tokens, and the platform will run on the Ethereum blockchain.
&gt;
&gt;The project plans to sell around 38 million tokens in this initial offering, **with the leftover 12 million going to the team members, advisors, and other relevant parties.** Token prices will start at $1 each.

[Now take a moment to laugh at the current token value](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-fund) but there's more! If you look at the chart on that site (click on ""Price"" then ""Max"") you see its peak back in November at around $20 a token. (Actually the peak was even higher last April but it's probably because of another leak)

Now let's go back about a month ago, [a trailer for the game dropped and there was thread in the Switch subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/f5rqvb/cooking_mama_switch_announcent_trailer) the video was removed so I can't link it, but according to the comments in that thread some people noticed that the video was originally uploaded back in November but it was delisted until March. That video was most likely the ""vertical slice"" for their ""tokenholders"" and Office Creates. All that block chain language in that vertical slice probably got those tokenholders dicks hard and bought more tokens. The executives at Planet knew Office Creates wasn't gonna give them the pass, so they bailed while the tokens were still high and that was when shit started getting scrubbed from the web.

Planet claims they started with 12 employees, remember when they said they were gonna keep 12 million tokens? Let's assume it was split evenly. So the tokens were initially sold for $1/token, if all of them did infact bail on November 2019 when the tokens were worth $20/token.....easy math here guys, these cretins made $20 million each, cut off all ties with the company (Planet's LinkedIn is empty) and are currently quarantining in  their penthouses while they watch in ridicule as Office Creates sues what is essentially a semi-empty burning house at this point.",2020-04-15 16:29:00

I drove for Lyft from March 2018 till the beginning of November 2018 when I got into a wreck and totaled my car. I then had to live without a car until I moved to the city and while I was able to make it work, it was still rough as fuck.

To be honest, I'm not really sure what it means, but perhaps it suggests that China sees the importance of public blockchains, and realizes that if they want to have a relevant digital currency *outside* of China, they need to be able to interoperate with and compete with assets on public blockchains.

And for such economically important applications, what blockchain is more important than Ethereum? This Tweet and the linked Tweet from yesterday (talking about how the magnitude of overall value transfer on Ethereum has just reached parity with Bitcoin) summarize my view:

You now have $5,000 leftover and give me my 1 bitcoin back. You made $5,000 since you only had to pay 50% of what you sold it for in order to give back to me what you borrowed.

That's a successful short. an unsuccessful one is where you borrow it, sell it at $10k, price goes to $20k, and you have to give it back still. You buy it back at $20k and give it back to me. You're now down $10,000.

fnqigq5,the_plots,5,"First of all. The bonus episodes were like $1.50. And most people did not pay with bitcoin.  Im guessing less than 10 people traded their precious bitcoins for some solution based comedy.  I suspect Dick was interested and wanted to test it out so he built the payment method.  So maybe they made $100 in coins. Even if Dick kept that coin, Dick would owe half of that $100, not whatever it is worth now thanks to currency speculation.  There is ZERO chance that show sold $25k worth of bonus episodes in bitcoin alone, that would be over 16k episodes sold through that one payment method.

Secondly, i am shocked at how easily Maddox falls for this obvious fake story.

fnqi41s,derykmakgill,4,"I understand his feeling but I think he's wrong here.

**1/ The 'velocity of money' is a long-standing economic fallacy that has been used for decades to justify currency debasement, artificially low interest rates, etc etc etc.**

There is no \*ideal\* velocity of money other than the one that is constantly in flux on a free-market. I agree BTC is artificially slow velocity and it crippled a ton of businesses, but BCH has open blocks and velocity there is a function of all sorts of individual, rationally self-interested preferences. There's simply no reason to worry about that.

And telling people they should spend money they would otherwise save in order to support a particular business is a nice social cause, but understand that all we're encouraging is individually forgoing capital accumulation now and potential future investment to save someone else's \*failing\* investment now. There is no having your cake and eating it too.

Money spent now in supporting a business is potentially less money you can spend on another business in the future.

**2. Bitcoin Cash IS a deflationary currency.** We all signed up for that but sometimes people don't seem to like the implication. Deflationary currency discourages conspicuous consumption and incentivises holding cash for future dates. That's the deal so we should expect more intelligent buying habits.

That doesn't mean \*don't spend\* like the Core idiots say. It doesn't mean limit the block size. It means follow the incentives and seek profit. If you can forgo spending \*now\* so you can spend more at a future date, do it! If you can spend now and make more money on that spending than the future, do it!

**3. Buy and replace is silly.** Many of the benefits of Bitcoin Cash are lost when you purchase it on exchanges. This includes privacy, low fees, added tax liabilities, withdrawal times, account setup, etc. For example, if we assume a 1 cent transaction fee for BCH, then we can see that buying BCH on Coinbase to spend literally means a 100% or more fee markup when all is said and done. That sucks. Combine that with tax liabilities and it really sucks.

I spend Bitcoin Cash all the time, probably more than most people. I buy domains on Namecheap, pay contractors, buy gift cards on eGifgter (except now I can't buy baby diapers with Target giftcards. Bastards), but I wouldn't do it nearly as much if I first had to buy it on an exchange. I'm lucky I've been in a different position and don't need to do that, so I get the full benefits.

The reality is most people are not earning BCH now unfortunately. If that changes, expect more spending. But encouraging people to lose extra money in order to use Bitcoin doesn't work (Purse was a neat exception because they offered such steep discounts, but clearly it wasn't enough).

This is one of the reasons Hayden's work in Austalia is so useful. He's helping onboard people by earning it.

**4. Appealing to people's altruism is a bad strategy.** Ultimately a business needs to be able to market itself and its products so well that people want to part with their money. This is 10x harder when people expect the price of the money to go up in the future, but its still possible. It just raises the standards quite a bit.

fntvxkw,fatguywithfood,2,"&gt;Yes, even the people who are dollar cost averaging. Would you be putting money into a market that you expected to go down long term? If you are, there are other issues, but if you believe the market goes up, then you are timing it. Your time span is just very long. If you are shorting, you are timing the market in a short-term time span.

This makes no sense at all.  If DCA and periodic investing is timing the market, literally every single person is timing the market any time they invest.  It would be impossible to not time the market.

fnvkrb9,heySheryl,1,"With regards to the draft, I did get off the hook in the end after being officially diagnosed. Gender dysphoria is already enough and surprisingly, so is autism/ aspergers. 

Well it was a long story. I was already consciously aware of myself and the difference, even as early as high school. At that age, I was already floating the idea of how to get out of the draft. It was a huge motivating factor for me to make as much money as I can before college ends. In my mind, I just want to get out of the country as soon as possible. That's it. A plan thought out years ahead.   
Adding to the fact that my thinking patterns are just so logical being on the autistic spectrum, national propaganda rarely ever worked on me from a very young age without me questioning it deeply. I was already an atheist by middle school despite not knowing the actual word at all, and my parents have almost 0 influence on me in terms of religion too.  It was just so easy for me to see through the lies in the rather collective society that I live in, a good lie on history that keeps most people together and united.   
*Majority of people stick together and look to others for social cues because biologically it is always the safest way to navigate life, and it makes sense in the hunter-gatherer life during the early stage of human evolution. Those that went on themselves are probably eaten and thereby eliminated through natural selection.*    


With that in mind, it actually turns out to have a huge impact later in my life, as I invested most of my teens in my career &amp; my special interest more. Probably just occasional partying &amp; socialising once a month.  
I didn't go through the regular education route, surfing through high school &amp; tertiary education just barely passing. School was never about learning anything to me, it was always a legal way for me to delay the draft while I am still building my financials. So I'm mostly just a borderline pass-er in exams, or sometimes seen as a 'drop-out' because I had to purposely fail exams to be retained for a year.   


At about 17 I was already operating an online business as a software programmer with profits of up to 30k USD a month. Also found out about cryptocurrencies at the same time (7 years ago), and bought + traded bitcoin, and invested a lot of my time in learning to invest/ trade my proceeds too.   
 *(software programming &amp; trading the markets is all logical work and 0 emotions and its one of the most natural way I can express my thoughts most effectively being autistic.)*  
By now I'm kinda already set for life, more than what I can ever ask for this lifetime to the point where retirement isnt even a thing that I have to worry already. Programming, and contributing to open source codes online for free + trading the financial markets right now is just a past-time.  
 

After going through all these emotional trauma over the years, I honestly no longer feel anything to my country of birth anymore. Even hearing the name of the country disgust me so much.  Despite already being off the hooks, I am still making it a life goal right now for me to live aboard and settle elsewhere.   


Its quite odd how life turns out, despite the difficulties early on in my life. Being autistic, and the environment (a collective/ an authoritarian country) was actually the determining factor to my success. If I am able to go through life once again, I'll still take the rough path over and over again.   
\-----------------  
Yes I did freeze my sperm aboard 2 years ago 'just in case' before I started HRT. Fertility will still come back when I stop HRT though, but it will take over 3\~6 months for viable sperm to be produced again. *(This is something that some trans are unwilling to accept, as going off estrogen can be quite traumatizing emotionally, add on top of the slight masculinization during the few months.)*  
My hopes for parenthood are quite high, although I admit I still have a lot to work on emotionally before being able to commit to any relationship üòÄ Human to human relationship just don't come naturally to me, I have to work my way out and learn it.   


\-----------------  
Think of the times when you spend learning new things, it is frustrating isnt it? It seems to be the default mode of thinking for me regardless most of the time, I feel that it is why it seems to be quite logical from the surface. However, it is only because I'm going through so much more to come to any conclusion rationally. I'm still emotional like anyone else, but it is suppressed.

That surely also comes at a cost, when I get so drained at the end of the day when heading to events like parties. I just need a few days or a week to recharge at home. It was sort of a mask, despite the fact that I seems to appear normal just as everyone else in the room.

Let's say tether prints 1m fake tethers and buys bitcoin in tether/btc pair, then sells in usd/btc. They sell, because they want usd, not bitcoin. They earned \~1m in usd, which they spend frivolously, accrued 1m in liability in tether and suffered some minor losses, because of people arbitraging between tether/btc and usd/btc pairs. How does that inflate bitcoin price, they sold as much as they bought after all? Supply/demand for bitcoin did not change, maybe the velocity, but it does not increase prices long term.

Additionally, they can only do that so many times, as at some point they will reach 50% (or whatever percentage) reserves and it's unsafe anymore. Unless market is always booming and their 50% is always larger amount tomorrow, which is not true, as, for example, last may bitcoin price was 3k+ and many tether holders probably redeemed and left.",2020-04-19 20:26:23

&gt;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions**, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. -Satoshi Nakamoto 

When will BTC Maxis come around and accept that Bitcoin has failed its vision? I read that bit and I couldn't help but be struck by the irony of it all. The very thing that criticized traditional finance for high fees and unsuitability for small transactions has become known for its high fees and unsuitability for small transactions. 

I really just don't see the value of Bitcoin. It's not functionally unique. It's not like Ethereum. Ethereum offers unique functions. Everything built on the Ethereum blockchain can only be accessed through Ethereum. Bitcoin could disappear tomorrow and the only people who would care would be the people who were expecting to make money off of it. If the only function of it is to increase in value, then that's just a massive scam, not something practical.

fnwmlg7,GoneGaltUSA,2,"/u/hblask is right, but I won't fault anyone for holding some BTC. Everyone has their reasons.

Speaking of which, I have a story about that...

Back in 2015 when I first got into Ethereum and was mining ETH heavily, I also started buying it directly somewhere around $2 in early (Jan/Feb) 2016.

That was about 6 months before Coinbase listed it and the only way you could buy ETH then was with BTC on places like Poloniex, etc.  So, I had to do crazy stuff like use localbitcoins to purchase BTC with cash in order to buy ETH with it, before I finally got my Coinbase account setup and approved.

And I remember thinking back then, ""BTC is such garbage (it was and still is), it's so obvious Ethereum is the future...""

And I was so eager to dump that $400 BTC for $2 ETH. And to this day, that was the right move.

But the past 2.5 years have been hell for everyone, especially ETH holders who didn't have the luxury of getting in on sub-$1 or single-digit ETH.  Additionally, the past 2.5 years has proven to me that no matter how ""right"" one might be about something, a market's irrationality can turn that on its head.

Having now seen and lived through all of that first-hand, I've since realized that holding a little BTC isn't the end of the world. As such, I bought plenty BTC when it dipped back into the $3k range in early 2019. I see it more as a bet on ignorance (not to be too harsh) and irrationality, as all signs clearly point to Ethereum consuming everything, including Bitcoin. Yet somehow, BTC market cap persists (maybe for not much longer, but we'll see).

I guess my point in all of this is ... do what you feel is best, but definitely try to be objective about it, because things have a way of turning out in unexpected ways. And one way to help mitigate the risks of those unexpected outcomes, is with diversification, even if just a little. üëç",2020-04-20 03:34:32

Because a) the sub back then was more anti-Bill than it is today (more long-time Bill fans before) and b) was smaller so you knew what posts would and wouldn't do well, something was clearly up and several of the top commenters on here each came to that conclusion on their own.

fo5g985,cdazzo1,6,"As long as the Fed can print unlimited amounts of dollars, there is no threat of a ""hard"" default.  The threat is a ""soft"" default aka devaluation.

The generally accepted inflation rate has been 2-3%.  We don't have to debate whether this is true or not, the important part is that people and countries think it is.  

So put yourself in their position.  Assume your bank started to charge you interest for holding money there (analogous to USD losing value to other nations).  When do you withdraw your money?  I would pull my money out when I could find a cheaper safe alternative to store my money.  And I'm such a high roller that the logistics of dealing with cash are impractical (I wish!).  I could put my money in bitcoin (assuming it were 100% safe), but it's not universally accepted so I'd have to constantly exchange it which is annoying and can cost money.  I could buy gold, but like cash the logistics are very difficult.

Countries are in an identical situation.  They can't easily spend their domestic currency.  They can't easily spend other foreign currencies.  And even if other countries agree to accept it, they need an international clearing house to handle the transaction (like SWIFT) because physical currency is impractical.  Gold is also impractical for the same reasons.  

These are **expensive** and somewhat risky options when compared to 2-3% cost of holding dollars.  You would need:

1. A currency cheaper to hold than the dollar (less inflated)
2. A currency safer than the dollar (more trustworthy nation issuing it)
3. A currency with enough issuance to be used globally (global usage as reserve currency wouldn't destabilize it)
4. \*\*A world super power.  There is a more abstract aspect of this that relates to military strength and the role the US has assumed as the world's police force.  The ability to do that is intertwined with our ability to print money and being the world's reserve currency.  You'd need another nation to assume that role.

I would never say never.  But you need something monumental to make this happen.  The COVID spending shouldn't hurt us here because every other issuer of currency is doing something similar.  All currencies will take a hit.

fo3sth7,ThomasZander,5,"&gt; So a little nitpick but it's not the Bitcoin Cash mempool that has inherent limits, it's specific implementations that have these limits.

Absolutely.

The Bitcoin Core people almost seem like they really want to design a system that CAN NOT scale, and all parts of their software stack represent that. I mean, who on earth puts 100% of the tools (validation, wallet, indexing, block-template for mining)  in one application! And as a bonus it effectively is completely single-cpu.

The point I'm making is that good scaling software is going to need to take a hard look at architectural decisions made by the Bitcoin Core devs (and blindly copied by ABC). The mempool is one of them, its just stupid design.

Investor thinks that the idea of 140k bitcoin is ridiculous, but personally, I 100% agree with u/wardser that these prices are quite realistic.

Let's think about where the bottoms of the bitcoin bubbles are relative to the previous tops.  The first bubble top was 32, and the second bubble bottom was 174, roughly 5x the previous top.  The second bubble top was 1k, and the third bubble bottom was 3k, roughtly 3x the previous top.

So,  if we **1)** assume the bottom of the next bubble will be higher than the top of the previous cycle, and if we **2)** assume that the bottom will come after an +80% decline, then we can get a rough estimate of the top of the next bubble.  Since the top of the previous bubble was 20k, then the next bubble will almost certainly be over 100k.

If the bottom of the next cycle will be 2x the top of the previous cycle, that would leave us with a bottom of roughly 40k.  If 40k is 20% of the top, that means the top is around 200k.

An estimate of 150-200k also [lines up with the stock to flow model advocated by Plan B.](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)  

It also lines up with other historical bubbles.  200k bitcoin would give bitcoin a market cap of about 4 trillion dollars, and the dot com bubble was 6.2 trillion dollars.

So at the end of the day, if you assume that bitcoin will have another bubble, and if you assume that bubble will be similar to the previous two bubbles, then 200k is perfectly reasonable.  This lines up with theoretical models that others have proposed and puts in the ballpark with other historical bubbles.  u/wardser's estimate of 140k to 200k is on the nose.

And since Ordinary_investor tried to make his point using a diagram, I'll make my point using my own diagram.

foarwpf,Merlin560,8,"PNF Update

I was holding off a little this morning to watch.

We broke out a few minutes ago.  It is a double top break out.  there have been several of those in this formation, so lets not get too excited yet.

The current formation is 13 columns wide.  This indicates some pressure behind the formation and break out.  Using the width as a target, we would go up 13 boxes from the break out--which puts us at $7900 for a high end.  The second way to estimate a high target is to look at the last breakout which was 15 boxes high.  This puts the second target at $7,500.

These targets are ""30 day"" ranges, and bitcoin usually falls in the middle part.  Remember, these charts are for swings, not day trades.  They are for setting ""trigger points and ranges.""  These trigger points are usually pretty good.  But, sometimes the movements are fast so scalp what you can and save your profits.

Long term, they are great at providing direction.

Does this grow and form a new pattern?  Or does it get slammed back down to the old formation?  Anyone telling you one way or the other is a liar.

foe0hat,imadummyoptionsyay,68,"CAN CONFIRM. I started fucking with bitcoin in 2010, when it was under $1. I made very good money selling it as it was rising, then buying more on dips, selling and repeating. I would normally sell when up 2-3X.

Then I realized, fuck, this went from $1 to over $100 QUICK. I should just hold these things for awhile. They went up to $1250 and crashed down to less than $100 is 2 days in 2013. I kept holding for two years and finally just sold them all, my last 200, at $400 each as they were staying steady between 2-$400 for the nearly 2 years and I just did not think they would keep rising and I was VERY happy with a 400% return

I tell people how I sold all of them at $400 each and every.fucking.time. ""MAN, HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID?! OMG YOU'RE RETARDED. IF I BOUGHT BITCOIN I WOULD HAVE HELD ON UNTIL I WAS A MILLIONAIRE. WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE JUST KEPT HALF OF THEM? OMG, YOU'RE SOOO STUPID""

foedump,jtoomim,16,"When I joined Bitcoin in 2013, I saw tremendous potential for Bitcoin as the native currency of the internet. I valued Bitcoin's ability to provide inexpensive, fast, programmatic transactions that did not depend on any bank APIs or KYC or laws or governments, and depended only on math and code. I thought that Bitcoin would replace money within 20 years. Given that Bitcoin transactions had a fee of only $0.01, regardless of the amount sent, I thought they had a clear advantage over credit card and debit card transactions, which typically have a fee of 2-4% in the USA. And they were about 144 times faster than a typical bank wire transfer, while also being cheaper and not susceptible to account freezes or other government or bank shenanigans.

That vision depended on Bitcoin's capacity scaling. In 2013, it seemed obvious that Bitcoin could scale. People had done benchmarks of the ECDSA validation speed -- 5,000 sigops/sec on a typical CPU -- and UTXO lookup processes. We'd calculated bandwidth requirements and disk storage requirements. The hardware requirements started to get hefty for higher transaction throughput rates (&gt; 1k tx/sec), but they seemed reasonable for a high-end enthusiast or hobbyist. SPV wallets were getting widely adopted, so it was clear that most users wouldn't need to worry about that.

But the blocksize limit was never raised. In 2015, the blocksize wars started in earnest. At the time, a majority of Bitcoin users supported an increase in the blocksize limit. But a majority of the developers opposed it, and the owner of /r/bitcoin decided to censor any discussion of a potential hard fork to increase the blocksize limit. This caused a widespread protest against his censorship policy, to which he responded: ""[If 90% of /r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to leave.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/?st=ja45nlq1&amp;sh=ab0c785c) Only about 1/4 did. They left for /r/btc.

The censorship was effective. /r/bitcoin kept the majority of casual users and the inertia of the discussion. Moderators ensured that only one side of the blocksize debate was allowed to be presented. Over the next few years, that resulted in a shift in attitudes in the general public. The majority of support that the big block movement had in 2013-2015 was whittled away, and by 2017 it was a clear minority.

Once it became clear that the SegWit2x compromise would fail, the proponents of increasing Bitcoin's block size switched over to supporting a unilateral minority fork. We believe that Bitcoin was always meant to scale. As Satoshi said, the base technology ""[never really hits a scale ceiling](https://ohmysatoshi.com/timeline)"" Although there are certainly scaling ceilings in the current *implementations*, we want to overcome those limitations. We can't do that as long as progress is impeded by the BTC developers and by politics, so we left.

My opinion is that cryptocurrencies need to scale or they will stagnate and remain irrelevant forever. As long as BTC fails to scale and remains the dominant cryptocurrency, it will suppress the crypto ecosystem as a whole. 

The existing scaling strategies for BTC that I've seen do not look workable. I do not believe Lightning Network has a good enough UX to be viable, and it would also take about 45 years for everyone on Earth to open a BTC LN payment channel with the current 1 MB + SegWit blocksize limit in place -- and that's *without* giving anyone the ability to rebalance their payment channels, which I expect people would need to do once per two weeks.

So at this point, either BTC needs to change its strategy and start to bring in some workable and practical scaling solutions, or we need to shift over to a different cryptocurrency that does scale. ETH could be that currency if ETH 2.0 is ever completed and deployed. Something like Bitcoin Cash could also be that currency. But at this point, I don't think that BTC will be able to do more than limp along.",2020-04-24 13:10:06

Those Tezzy boys are in the same boat, looking to compete with and eventually beat out Ethereum. Cool project no doubt, but everyone‚Äôs sights being set on Ethereum has me with a couple takeaways.

1) Ethereum has succeeded in becoming a functional and attractive alternative to Bitcoin despite recent economic tension.

2) Those looking to challenge Ethereum are doing their best to maintain a sprint in hopes to catch a competitor already many miles in the lead. They will need a great deal more dev power and innovation to be able to catch up. Without help, one cannot maintain a heavy sprint - be it mentally or physically. Should a project catch up to ETH on a utility scale, then it will still need something to set it apart, something ETH doesn‚Äôt currently provide. This is what attracted me to holding some Tezos early on.

The allure of using ETH over BTC is ultimately the versatility of the ecosystem. ETH functions in ways that BTC cannot. If an alt comes along looking to clone all of what Ethereum has to offer, it will still play 2nd fiddle.

fogc7zp,Bob-Rossi,6,"All Grayscale products sell at a premium. GBTC (Bitcoin backed) is the most stable and reasonable fluctuating between *usually* the 10% to 30% range. 

The premium exists for 3 main reasons.

1) Grayscale is pretty much the only player in town. I think other similiar products exist but this is the biggest and longest running. And I think one of the few if only that has a share represtenting a defined amount of the replated crypto. 

2) By being setup as they are, its way easier for non-tech people to get into. No wallets to set up. No navigating and trusting exchanges like Coinbase to onboard your funds. For anyone with a stock account, you can buy it right now instantly, like your would buy Tesla stock

3) That big, beautiful tax haven. Oh, that sexy tax avoidance. The B-E-A-utiful $0 line item on your tax return. You can buy this in an IRA, likely for free now that the big banks are dropping fees to $0. So now I have an asset that mimics the voalitility of BTC that I can both trade for no fee and no capital gains (if you have a roth, or deferred gains if a traditional IRA). Want to try and scalp a 2% swing? Go ahead, you don't have to worry about $17 fees eating into your margins or triggering a ST Capital Gain. Hot. Very hot indeed.

The 3rd point is why I think you may always see a slight premium over a physical BTC. But its actually been in the single digits of late. 

Now, why is ETHE so high? Well, for starters Grayscale's ETHE fund is 1 share for .1 ETH, but they listed the thing at a price that represent a 1 for 1 share backup. Different prices back then, but it would be like listing ETHE for $190 today when it should only be worth $19. So that fucked the market initially and it never recovered. Basically sat at a 2x premium for a long time.

The other big reason is this thing is not very liquid and not much supply. When an ETHE is issued to the primary investory, they can't sell it to us until after 1 year passes. So right now the only ETHE available for sale to us normies is what was issued on April 24th, 2019 OR earlier. So GBTC has a lot of liquidity to absorb high buying pressure and keep the premium normal, but ETHE does not.",2020-04-25 02:51:53

foh6373,benditbackwards,6,"You are missing the point of the halving.  The halving is a time of celebration for everyone.  You need to read up on the mechanics of Bitcoin.  The mining reward is basically Bitcoin's inflation, when a halving event occurs the inflation of Bitcoin is reduced, since there is now LESS supply of BTC being introduced every 10 min.  So if you have the same demand as before the halving, but now half the supply rate, then the price of Bitcoin should go up!  This means then that the miners will be making more money even though they are making less Bitcoin.  This is the opposite of how a fiat system works, because the govt / fed print money, they 'inflate' ( increase supply ) of dollars, so if there is the same demand, but more supply the value of every dollar is debased ( goes down ) this appears in the marketplace as the price of goods going up.  

In regards to your theory of bitcoin not being as secure, after a halving, that is not so, because the difficulty that is to say the algo of Bitcoin adjusts itself to the available miners every couple blocks or so, I think its about every 10 days.  This means that miners can come and go and there will still be good security on the Bitcoin network,  the remaining miners will basically make more money as the 'weaker' miners quit.

Trust is a relative thing, Bitcoin's method of preserving its value is still far superior to any other kinds of money.  Fiat.. LOL no comparison, most corrupt form of money ever!  Stock market.. LOL give me a break, lots of corruption there too.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/PX8vGkIs/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PX8vGkIs/)

I don't often look at volumes in BTC because they're extremely manipulated and the largest trades happen during high volume. Volume is completely faked in this market.

As far as the halvening is concerned, history does tend to repeat I agree- but this is the very first time BTC has had a halvening with futures.

I do think later this year we will see a major run up in BTC- but I also believe that will be the last high Bitcoin sees for many years. Alts will likely follow Bitcoin up and then decouple once the halvening pump fades.

Alts are where the money is at right now, anyone who says otherwise is either clueless or purposely misleading people. It's just a matter of being as patient as maxi's were around 2012 or so.

There are a lot of reasons Bitcoin is bullish af right now, mainly the higher lows on the daily. Problem is we are directly under extremely crucial fibs as well as a MA100/200 cross. I can see $9k at *maximum* happening before a tremendous fall back down to re-test that gigantic cap wick.

The 4h RSI refusing to go below 60 is about the most bullish thing I can see right now. This flag is taking too long and absolutely *screams* bart.

* According to the Lighting Network whitepaper, it needs Bitcoin to have 133 MB blocks for global mass-adoption. Bitcoin post-2017 (post Core takeover) is permanently limited to 1 MB blocks, or 300K txs per day. In other words, it can't handle more than 0.01% of the world's payments. 1% if LN if works perfectly (it doesn't). That means it makes no impact on people's ability to take control over their own wealth.

* With Bitcoin's limited capacity, fees will skyrocket anytime adoption picks up, as it did in late 2017 when average fees spiked to $32.

fosyj32,WeaponizedMath,9,"Every Bitcoin transaction has a scripting language - programmable money.

The scripting language is limited. Eth grew the programmable money feature of cryptocurrency while the Blockstream fork of Bitcoin had features removed to make way for proprietary products made by Blockstream.

Eth is like a world supercomputer. Your tx fee rents a little bit of processing time from thousands of computers. Eth's scripting language includes the ability to do payment processing... and a lot more.

Instead of thousands of computers verifying your financial transaction, thousands of computers verify the application you run performs the same way on every computer. This model includes everything Bitcoin can do, and a whole lot more.

It's also technically infeasible at this point for the Blockstream fork to catch up. For Bitcoin to retrofit and increase the features in its scripting language many things would need to happen - raising the blocksize is among them. However, Blockstream developers have already called out advanced programming features like the Ethereum programming language 'block pollution'

Most of the Ethereum devs/projects started on top of Bitcoin, lookup Counterparty, Colored Coins/Colu, and MasterCoin. Blockstream chased them out. Now they have to compete against them.

If anything, Bitcoin is broken and Ethereum is kind of our last chance at getting the utility of cryptocurrency to as many people as possible.

Part of the Eth value proposition is that after all the Eth are minted, users have to spend Eth to run the programs on the Ethereum network. This gives the currency a future utility after the network grows.",2020-04-28 11:25:39

PlanB did a great job of implementing the model, and creating lots of easy to understand content to explain it all.

When someone says ""gold is valuable because it's scarce"", they actually mean that it has a high stock to flow ratio.

For instance, platinum is much more rare than gold, but gold is worth much more than platinum.  Absolute scarcity is not actually the most important factor.  The stock to flow ratio is the ratio of how much exists compared to how much is created each year.

Gold has the highest stock to flow ratio of all precious metals, which is why it's worth the most.  Platinum is much more rare than gold, but has a much lower stock to flow ratio.",2020-04-28 06:08:09

*don't invest heavily in things you don't understand*

First, invest a bit of your time to learn the basics: what Bitcoin actually is, the basics of how it works.

Start here:

The Trust Machine:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4)

A great **book**: The Bitcoin Standard, by S. Ammous.

Then,  pick a legitimate exchange, create an account, buy a small amount of  Bitcoin (in case you fuck up and lose it all).  Get a good wallet, then  transfer your Bitcoin to your own wallet.

*not your keys, not your Bitcoins*

Do not store your wealth on somebody else's computer system.

After that, maybe buy a pair of wool socks or something with some of your Bitcoin.

When  you know how it works, what it is, how to buy it, how to securely store  it you'll be ready to buy and hold larger amounts, long term.

As  far as trying to time the market?  Don't.  Technical analysis (TA) is  bullshit superstition and you'll likely end up losing a lot of money in a  hurry.  Why be stupid?  Don't be stupid.  Just buy and hold --- for  many years.",2020-04-28 05:36:55

foss0ig,krokodilmannchen,6,"3) Sure. It's always better to own your coins, for the sake of owning them, and to minimize the incentive for an exchange to do weird stuff with customer's funds.  
4) Yes. Long term speaking both events are terribly important. I have exposure to both so I don't get your question.  
5) Everything that gets better with time. So everything Andreas Antonopoulos, I like @PlanB if you're into S2F (and The Bitcoin Standard for a wider view on crypto, see also Jack Dorsey at Lex Fridman's show recently); I try to avoid crypto twitter because it's mostly garbage (too much noise vs signal). The Ethhub podcast is great. Danny Ryan writes Eth2.0 updates. It really depends on what level you're searching for knowledge. I mean it never hurts to go into the archives and read Nakamoto's posts, if you're into that. You might just as well enjoy Eric Weinstein's talk with Vitalik (on The Portal) - really depends.

fosjn7c,-Teekey-,5,"&gt; And Riot's also had their share of problems, notably with a bitcoin miner that was installed through the Brazillian League client a while back.

No, that was on the Garena server, which Riot does not control the client for. Every knows and agrees that Garena is trash, and Riot has cutting all ties with them for future titles since League.

&gt;The mass hysteria on reddit when it was discovered that Valorant was a kernel-based AC likely wasn't good PR for them

""Discovered"", because you know...it's not like they didn't [announce it publicly MONTHS ago](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/dev-null-anti-cheat-kernel-driver/).

&gt;It's the fact that this directly interfaces with a user-level program that makes a dangerous bridge, while GPU/Device drivers have to interface with Windows before getting any information.

Uh, you really think GPU drivers don't interact with user-level software at all? What?

&gt;And if they're taking steps to secure their software, why can't they take similar steps to settle the minds of the user base they're selling it to? 

Because it's legitimately not an expectation for ANY anti-cheat software and never has been? There's really little reason why it's suddenly an issue other than people not liking Riot, conspiracy theories about Tencent, or people being bored and wanting something to complain about.

&gt;the fact that they're not trying to get that PR back outside of ""Just trust us, bro"" makes it even more sus.

But that's the entire fucking point. If you don't trust them, you simply shouldn't be installing ANY of their software for ANY reason. So why get up in arms over a kernel driver if you suspect they're trying to invade your privacy?",2020-04-28 09:00:08

In case I misunderstood your question I'm gonna lay down the very simple process of money laundry here:

I have 100000 dollars that I made selling drugs and I want to spend them on a nice car. You can't buy an expensive car without saying where you got the money (spoiler: you can't tell the IRS you sold drugs for it)

So what I do is create a shitty game and publish it for a lot of money. Then I buy that game lots of times with my drug money (you can pay people to help you create many steam accounts, borrow people's credit cards, use different credit cards at your name, pay with cash, pay with bitcoin, etc.).

Key point here: Steam nor the IRS will ask you where you got the money for each of those games.

Problem here is considering Steam taking a 30% share of what you made and taxes, you will loose around 40% from this process.

BUT now you have $60000 that you, a **game developer** made **selling one game**, when you go buy that car and the IRS asks you where you got the money you can confidently say you ~~sold drugs~~ sold videogames.",2020-04-29 01:49:49
foxgtnp,Tricky_Troll,16,"The recent price action has had me feeling very bullish and lately we have been slowly becoming less correlated to traditional markets again. However, I‚Äôm going to play devils advocate today. I‚Äôm a permabull on ETH and you‚Äôll always find me buying at almost any price whenever I am able to. But sometimes it‚Äôs worth arguing against your own beliefs to prevent yourself from becoming stuck in a bubble or an echo chamber. So here we go, here is my bearish argument for the short term.

**Stonks:** In my opinion the stock market is one big bear flag right now. Just like in the great depression, the fast drop down was followed by a recovery which lasted a few months before falling for multiple years. However, I believe that in the modern day, we could recover much faster, just as we fell much faster than in 1929.

https://i.imgur.com/cxTQqnh.jpg

So what might be the straw which breaks the camels back? I don‚Äôt think it will be a single event. Rather it could just be record low earnings reports and defaults from companies which are heavily indebted or run on thin margins having lost economic viability such as airlines and US oil producers.

#BRRRRRRRRRR (https://brrr.money/)

***Oh shit, what‚Äôs that sound?***

Oh yeah, I may be wrong about this. JPow and the gang may save the day with unlimited QE. However, this would of course be at the expense of inflation among other things. But the good news is that this would probably be a great thing for the whole crypto space.

**Technical Analysis:** We have a few factors working against us right now. These are:

Bearish divergence: Notice the rising price and falling volume. Admittedly the volume doesn‚Äôt fit the trendline perfectly, but TA is rarely precise.

https://i.imgur.com/yeOfxCt.jpg

Rising Wedge: Rising wedges *usually* break out to the downside and we‚Äôre in a pretty clear rising wedge. Also, the recent jump above 200 hasn‚Äôt been enough to break out of the wedge (yet!).

https://i.imgur.com/Vq0CmQm.jpg

**Bitcoin Halving**: Historically there has been a dump post-halving before a stratospheric rise in the following months and years. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if post halving ETH outperforms BTC due to staking hype.

**Conclusion:** I‚Äôm expecting a pull-back in the short to mid term (probably after the halving), but after that I‚Äôm full bull mode to 10K since we all know about the stunning fundamentals of ETH. üöÄ HODL strong ETHFam.

fovfe9r,SloppySynapses,16,"The weekly candle that just closed is the only one that has closed without even a small upwards wick (&lt;1%) this entire month-long rally. The wicks for each candle continue to get smaller, too: 19.2%, 18.8%, 7.0%, 8.1%, 2.5%, and 0.6%.

Is that bullish or bearish?

https://tradingview.com/x/7EbDdDkj/

Copied from my twitter, was curious to hear people's thoughts on it. 

https://twitter.com/CryptoChunky/status/1255209255600300032?s=20

Personally, I think it's potentially bearish, because it means the entire rally has just been gearing up to touch this area eventually, and now that we're here there's no one to take it higher. Note that this area is where the dump began- and it is not unlike bitcoin to fully retrace large momentum dumps just to dump back down again. (see $12k -&gt; $6k -&gt; $12k in feb 2018, $10.9k -&gt; $7.4k -&gt; $10.5k in sep/oct 2019, $10.5k -&gt; $6.4k -&gt; $10.5k in jan/feb 2019)

On the other hand, it's potentially about to break upwards out of this range and soar, especially with the general disbelief that's pretty apparent in the market right now. Every minor pullback, we see negative funding spike, futures discount to 0.5-1%, and people seem to get very sure of a rugpull.

fovp06x,lightfair,7,"&gt;I have never ever heard of a scammer depositing money directly, can't even find anything online regarding it.

Something similar seems to be quite common for the fake ""sugar daddy"" scams: They offer to pay off the credit card debt. The victim (the sugar baby) attaches the bank account - supplied by the scammer - to her/his credit card. Credit card debt disappears. Scammer asks for some gift cards for gratitude or emergency (or asks to pay off another ""sugar baby""). Original account holder notices fraudulent charge and reverses it. Sugar baby is back to her/his original credit card debt plus the money she sent to the scammer.

There's always one problem with stolen/phished accounts: They cannot be connected and traced back to the scammer. So transferring the money out of them to the target account is not an option because the banks will claw it back (I believe most banks have a mutual understanding about this issue anyway). So what the scammer does is using this money to trick someone else in sending a certain amount in untraceable form (gift cards or - as in your case - Bitcoin).

So it's not money laundering in the usual sense: The scammer is directly ""stealing"" from the second victim. The ""first victim"" (the one whose bank credentials got stolen) is usually not losing any money.",2020-04-29 05:17:24

2. There are no attempts at hiding anything like this
3. I've personally done a number of videos and Medium posts, all of which have been shared on Telegram and by DigiByteCoin twitter account etc specifically looking at this very thing

Now, we also need to address your use of the word ""compromised"" because it's also very misleading, and I think this stems from a misunderstanding around how MultiShield works.

Coming back to this having been discussed before, if somebody has \*all\* of the Bitcoin hashrate in the whole entire world, spread across BTC, BCH, BSV and a bunch of other small-cap coins, and they threw 100% of the worldwide hashrate at DigiByte, they would at most get about 55 blocks when I last did the math. By comparison, they would be able to get 100% of all BTC, BCH and BSV blocks. THAT is compromised.

The reason for this is that if you have one algorithm, let's say you're mining 100% of all SHA256 blocks, the hashrate neded doubles every 5x blocks. Starts off small, 5 blocks, maybe 10 blocks, but then you start getting to a 15-block attempt, and a 20-block attempt. Sure, that's 5 minutes worth by now, but you're already having to use 8x the hashrate than you started with. That's OK, there's still pools that could attempt that... But then you look at 

I'll humor you and presume that all 3 of those top entities are actually one, despite them being unknown, and there being being indications they are not (Which I'll get to later), however in-doing so I'll also show you what compromised really is: Litecoin. The top 3 are all in the same geographic region, the top 3 are all using the same hardware, and we've seen things like Antbleed before so it's not hard to imagine that kind of thing happening again. We have historical evidence of the accuracy of what I'm proposing.

Now, let's say that these 3x individuals colluded on DigiByte, and took their \~32% mining hashrate away: More would flow back in to DigiByte from other places. We know this is true because people mine multiple cryptocurrencies, and we've seen the likes of the Baikal miners switching around between both DigiByte-supported algorithms and others. Their 32% spread across 3x algo's wouldn't be sufficient to pull off any kind of sustained attack.

Sure, they could probably get in a few blocks, we've already seen in a couple of instances where they'll get two blocks in a row (Which we also have seen happen on BTC, so this isn't anything to worry about either), but that doesn't mean they've got enough to go and do some kind of deep reorg.

Again nor do we have any reason to believe they would, we've seen funds going to Bittrex, presumably to sell for the power-cost, but we have no confirmation / indication either way about the trading activities of that individual, and Bittrex wouldn't tell you if you asked them. That said, I've spoken with the Bittrex team, they're certainly not idiots, this isn't their first rodeo, and they're very \*very\* switched on when it comes to looking in to this kind of thing.

But back to 3x entities colluding, they still don't have enough to attack DigiByte because they'd need to both rent enough SHA256, enough Scrypt, and they'd still need to \*hope\* that nobody else came and mined DigiByte during that same time on any form of profit-switching after the difficulty dropped after a few blocks. So it's plausible that 3x entities could collude and could also rent additional hashrate, but it's still not a guarantee that they'd get anywhere.

What baffles me the most though is that we're talking about collusion from 3x different entities like it's a ""done deal"" (""compromised"") when it's really not, it's making a TON of presumptions, and yet at the same time DigiByte is \*still\* more secure than Litecoin? Because if those 3x entities on Litecoin colluded, they have well over 50% and the chain is actually fucked at that point. If we're genuinely looking for \*actual\* problems, let's look at one that's staring everyone in the face, let's address that!

Back to DigiByte though:

Somebody mining 12.5% of all blocks is not ""compromised"". It's to be expected, like I've mentioned in many of my previous videos etc on the topic. Of \*course\* we're going to have some rapid evolution of hardware and FPGA bitstreams for Odocrypt, that was always going to be the case. It's a new algorithm. We aren't sad that Bitcoin is currently pushing hundreds of Exahashes per second, when back in the day you could happily mine on a CPU. Odocrypt on the DE10-Nano was already a thousand odd times faster than a CPU, which was why nobody ever bothered trying to make / optimize a GPU miner for it.

We then see the BlackMiner F1 Mini first of all adding support, which was several times faster than a DE10-Nano, but similar up-front price and power consumption (extrapolated). Then we have the BlackMiner F1, further optimized still, then the next generation of F1-Mini+... But there is still no indicatoin of ""compromised"", both at an individual algorithm or overall level. It does show an interest and a rapid improvement, which was expected, and no doubt somebody is going to be the first to do that. You recall the early ASICs on Bitcoin how they were originally Butterfly Labs, CoinTerra and the likes? They got in early, but where are they today? They're not here because somebody has to be the first, and then people iterate and improve and beat them out of the market.

But your comments of ""It shouldn't be a way for one company to print money, it should be to secure the network"", despite me disagreeing with it, I'll humor you and carry on with that train of thought, looking at how Bitmain dominate most of the market here. What company manufactures most of the hardware for SHA256 and Scrypt? Bitmain! Sure there's a few others like innosilicon coming out with their miners, but you get what I mean, there's always waves of innovation from different companies. Those companies mine with their hardware first, it makes sense if they have a competitive advantage, it's just good business sense to do-so. They then on-sell them usually after the profitability isn't as high, or as they get sufficient stock etc and so we may well also see this play out with the Qubit / Skein hardware.

We simply don't know!

What we do know however is that we have absolutely nothing going on right now that's malicious. We have no indication anything malicious would be attempted. We have no indication that even IF we had the collusion of the top 3x miners that those miners would even be successful at anything more than a few blocks.

Kucoin has only 6 confirmations? Cool, great, that's on their head. If they're confident enough in the network that 6 is all they want, then fucking sweet. Good for Kucoin. They're welcome to set it to whatever they want, low or high. I think Bittrex have theirs set to 40, that seems reasonable enough, and is still only 10 minutes -- Which puts it faster than Bitcoin still if you're waiting for it to be on-chain + 1x additional block.

So yes, let's talk about the weak points here.

Yes, let's address mining centralization, that is happening on FAR far worse on other top 5 market cap coins, but can still be improved upon for DigiByte.

Let's also look at what we're doing replacing SHA256 with ProgPoW and other such things.

Let's not stick our head in the sand though, I've done many videos etc on this before looking at these weak points. I literally made a fucking table on Medium and posted it.

But finally, let's not just use DigiByte as a scape-goat for misinformation when the scenarios you're describing of collusion between entities is FAR easier to pull off on other places.",2020-04-29 06:25:47

So they can keep the government of other big companys offline forever. Its not like people cant get new IPs and the problem is solved in those cases.

fp09zoo,ahorner,18,"Some back of the napkin math...

A modern ASIC Bitcoin miner calculating 16 TH/s and consuming 1480W of power running 24/7 will generate on average 0.0035 BTC or **about $31 per month.**

Given this device plugs into your car's 12V outlet (typically a max of 15A) we can extrapolate that it would consume up to 180W of power which, if it was mining bitcoin, would be **just under $4/month if it was running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week** which your car does not.

Now they claim it's not mining Bitcoin but some other crypto but this begs the question: if they have a device that can efficiently generate some crypto, why not build a bunch of them and power the devices themselves?
