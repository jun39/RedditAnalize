There is a huge political battle raging in the bitcoin community right now, and it's very possible the currency could split into two separate blockchains, which would mean you would have double the coins.

Most likely, one set of coins will become worthless while the other retains value but if, somehow, both become viable, you could have even more to worry about telling the IRS about. :)

Basically, you must resell and replace the miners every 8-12 weeks. This allows you to use the miner for a while, then sell it for a profit. The bitcoin you earn from mining is used to pay off the solar system costs. It is all based on bitcoin inflating, of course. But we all believe that will happen so I feel that I don't often have to say that.

This way, you have a new miner and the solar system is paid for. Now you can continue mining for free with a current miner cuz your panels will last 20 years, your batteries will last at least 6 years and your miner is new.",2017-07-01 11:15:53

It's a small but real consolation to see many of those same attackers voluntarily douse themselves with figurative gasoline while they sing kumbaya and try to figure out how a matchbook works. And the best thing is that it's all organic and straight-forward: an earnest and thoroughly obvious conman meets a community desperate to believe against all reason and sanity in a Bitcoin unconstrained by physical reality, others desperate to spread FUD and pump competing systems, complementary shapes made for one another. I couldn't have constructed a better match with unlimited time and unlimited budget. They deserve one another.

djn132i,kainzilla,79,"I know that bear sentiment in general is very unpopular since it's frequently people trying to FUD for their short sells, but there's a lot of people in here that keep talking about their ETH price projections and ETH movement without any discussion of the crypto market as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

[Take a look at the total market cap.](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) We have a very clear, **very obvious** halt to the incredible growth we had over the course of the year until now, with an overall downward trend at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

I think most of us understand that the long-term prospects for both ETH and a lot of other projects are strong, so this isn't an absurd sky-is-falling call - but this overall downward trend presents a clear opportunity for both market traders who sometimes short, and also long-term hodlers that like to choose selectively when to buy in. If you're in these groups, keep an eye on that general market chart to get a feel for when sentiment in general might be turning back to bullish.

&amp;nbsp;

Why is the market in general halted and trending downward, with so much *good* news coming our way for cryptos in general? I'm not smarter than the market, but my guess is people are sidelining in fiat on exchanges to see how Bitcoin handles their concerns in regards to the August 1st UASF / unknown-date SegWit2x hard fork. I'm predicting the general market sentiment will return to bullish after those concerns have been cleared, and that between now and August 1st, you will see some great buying and shorting opportunities for crypto in general.

djn9t3b,BeijingBitcoins,52,"Transcription:

It's nice to see you guys here, and my topic today is about why multiple implementations are quite important for Bitcoin. More than 2,000 years ago, Aristotle argued that there were six ways of how society can be organized. There is monarchy, aristocracy, polity, tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. And in open source software management, we can usually find two ways of management. The first one is called benevolent dictatorship. The other one we call design committee. Benevolent dictatorship is the most frequently seen one, that usually the dictator or the founder of the project, or the ones who have contributed the most significantly to the project, he knows the project very well, he contributes the most, his skills are well recognized, he knows everyone in the project who contributed, and everyone knows him. In Linux, Linus is the most famous dictator, right? And in most of the cases, it functions very well. Design committee is quite rare, actually, and usually when open source becomes design committee it doesn't function very well.

One question is why we cannot see other forms of organization as Aristotle described. I think it's because democracy is not possible in open source software, because developers' software is quite complicated, abstract activity, and who is good and who is bad is most times quite obvious and you cannot just vote to decide which way the software is going to go. And tyranny, because there is a lack of enforcement there, so if you want to seek the benefit of a tyranny, it's not open source software, it's Microsoft, it's Windows, it's Office, right? We can maybe see this kind of tyranny, maybe that's why Microsoft is widely hated in the open source community.

Another question we want to ask is why benevolent dictatorship is so common in open source software. I think it's about human nature, it's about the complication of the software development. Just like Steve Jobs said, one very good software engineer is 100 times better than an average one. So there is no democracy here; if you are a good developer, if you contribute the most, everyone knows about it. If you look at the Github for most open source software, you can all see that the number one contributors contribute far better and far more than the other contributors. So it's just a natural process that there will be a dictator there. We also have to notice that there is another tendency in human nature, that is obedience to authority.

In 1961, in Yale University, there is an experiment called the Milgram experiment, that showed a very strong willingness for human beings to obey the orders without just contradictory(?) to their consciences. We also have to pay attention to another cognitive bias, called the Halo effect. Because people's judgement over certain things are highly influenced by the past behavior of the entity, without just understanding 100% perfect about the fact itself. So if there is a kind of very significant contributor in a project, if this contributor makes a judgement, because of the halo effect lots of the other contributors or members in this project are very likely to follow. And we know that there is also a bandwagon effect in the social dynamics. There is an experiment that in a group discussion, the experiment asks the participants to say which pen is longer. It's obvious that Pen A is longer, but everyone else says that Pen B is longer, it's a lie, but the only one left in the room doesn't dare to say the truth, and just follows the other people. This effect is very strong, that if you are the lone person to hold an opinion, even if the opinion is true, [there is a lot of pressure not to speak out]. But it's also very interesting that if there is only one companion standing beside you, that this person will be much more brave to speak out. So if you really want to control many people, censorship is required, you just shut everyone up so that everyone feels he is lonely.

We need to pay attention that software development is very pressure[?] and highly complicated intellectual activity, and most of the time the contributors don't have direct economic incentives. He contributes for fun, or to feel good, it's voluntary. But if he contributes with the possibility that he will be attacked and face political pressure, and everyone [] him he is doing very wrong, most likely this one will quit. He will not continue to fight for this project.

So I think given all these kinds of effects, I think it's very natural that open source software most likely will be organized in a kind of dictatorship. Actually there is nothing to blame, and most of the time it's fine, because this is the most effective way given our human nature. Maybe the dictator will usually advise that the lead maintainer be humble and humorous and manage the whole order of the software development, but if he's doing something wrong, it's not unacceptable, because there are so many software [projects] in the world and there is no perfect piece of software, and people can just use other software.

If we look at the case of Bitcoin, that Bitcoin was founded by satoshi, and then the lead maintainer position was transferred to Gavin Andresen. Satoshi was definitely a dictator, and he made lots of code changes into the codebase without much discussion. For example, the one megabyte blocksize limit, he might have discussed with two people, then he just added it into the codebase, and maybe one year later Jeff Garzik found it and started to discuss it. When Gavin became the lead maintainer, the transition to the design committee began. Gavin Andresen at that time worried about maybe he will be hit by a bus, so he gave the commit access to a few other people. From then, all the changes have been seriously discussed in the community, and everyone is very conservative, so right now I think we can safely judge that Bitcoin Core is governed by a design committee. 

Another phenomenon we need to pay attention to in open source software, is that usually there is very clear ownership of a software project. This is somehow contradictory to the instinct, because the code is open source everyone can fork the code away, everyone can copy it, can use it, it's free. But in the common law of the open source community, there is definitely some kind of ownership, that if you fork away the code and you add some patches and release a binary without the consent of the original founder or the existing everyone recognizes as owner's consent. This will be called a kind of rogue patch, that you steal the project, people will still blame you, everyone will point fingers at you. So in common practice, there is a very strong practice that open source software will have kind of ownership.

So who is owning bitcoin core right now? Usually people, lots of devious arguments, will say ""oh Bitcoin Core does not actually exist."" Right? Have you heard about that? But it's a joke, Bitcoin Core does exist, and everyone knows exactly who are the committee members of Bitcoin Core. Maybe they have a kind of hierarchy inside the committee, but the ownership is quite clear, that this software project is owned by some people in this world. It's not owned by everyone, it's owned by a small group of people.

So we need to think about this. If Bitcoin is just a kind of software, it would be just fine that this software has a kind of ownership, even if it's owned by just one person its fine. If you don't like it, you just don't use it. If you don't like Microsoft Office, it's fine, you just change to some open source alternative, you can choose Google Docs. But it seems that Bitcoin is not only a software, because if you don't like the one megabyte blocksize, you can just choose another piece of software, like Dash, right, is going to create a 400MB block, right? And why everyone troubles themselves creating /r/btc and forum.bitcoin.com to try to fight and to increase the blocksize? I think that Bitcoin is a kind of social agreement established since 2008, that everyone who signed up for Bitcoin with this kind of agreement. The most well known terms would be the 21 million coin cap. 

There were also lots of trolls on the internet in 2011. When they were first met with the bitcoin concept, and when they would argue with everyone else, they would say there is a kind of one megabyte limit, it can most likely process 7 transactions per second. ""Dude, it's not going to be a very good payment network or good monetary tool"", and I always argued that Satoshi had established the roadmap that the blocksize can be increased someday that it is required. 

So such kind of arrangement is an agreement that existed in the mind of everyone that has been investing in or buying or holding Bitcoin. It's not a kind of thing that could be a tradeoff of software engineering, it's not a kind of feature that you can choose to have or not have, it's not technical, it's a social agreement. Peter Todd used to say ""oh the 21 million coin cap is a kind of technical arrangement."" No, it's not. It's a kind of social agreement. It's unchangeable. If you change it, you are basically violating the agreement.

djnamwx,sziehr,50,"So there is a great 60 minutes article about how some the GSM 3gg network is to hack into once you have a few keys. Those are around on the dark web.

When the price goes down and people say the fundamentals have not changed I can't help but disagree.

You know, the same idiots that got burned margin trading on GDAX. We also now have a precedent of Coinbase bailing out these idiots so presumably they're still around and haven't learned their lesson. It worries me that if all these ICOs start failing, it could crash the price of Ether for a long time. In short, lots of dumb money.

Personally, I got in at a price that is well below the current price and I am planning on HODLing for at least 5 years or when Serenity comes out (learned my lesson from trading Bitcoin), but I'm skeptical near-term because my gut feeling tells me that the ICOs are a huge issue. I can't help but laugh at the $1,000 ETH predictions by the end of the year. Such a valuation would make me a very rich man, but it's probably not going to happen. This is all anecdotal, but all the people I have met who recently invested in Ethereum have no idea what Serenity is and this worries me because it means that lots of people here have no clue what they're doing.",2017-07-02 10:55:36

I think this is quite interesting.

Basically right now, ethererum start to build pow/pos hybrid system. This kind of system if you [unintelligible] if you look through the saying. Basically this miners and coin holders are sharing the inflation revenue together.

**I don't know how bitcoin can do that, if we do it a simple way maybe we can do some kind of soft fork do it, but I really don't know how to do it exactly the best way. But this is something emerging, its new, I do believe its good.**""",2017-07-02 13:46:45

djnz3my,ydtm,36,"I think it's one of the most important speeches made in the history of Bitcoin.

Yes, Craig Wright is eccentric and arrogant and obnoxious.

And he's not a great speaker.

And he also sucks a designing GUIs.

But he happens to be right about two very, very important things:

- Bitcoin can and will scale massively on-chain;

- Bitcoin is based on hashpower and hardforks.

---

And not only that: he's actually _doing_ something about these things - he's _applying_ his knowledge to provide a concrete service.

He's setting up a mining pool which is going to:

- Do massive _on-chain_ scaling for Bitcoin

- Reject all SegWit transactions.

(And on top of that, he has the courage to go on a public stage and call out the toxic devs of Core / Blockstream by name - such as Luke-Jr, Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd - and tell them to _fuck off_. And it's about goddamn time someone stood up like that and fought fire with fire. I and many other people are goddamn sick and tired of Core / Blockstream being the only ones who are ""allowed"" to fight hard. They are simply bullies - and maybe it takes someone like Craig Wright - an eccentric, arrogant, capitalist mathematician - to finally stand up to those bullies and publicly tell them to _fuck off_).

Craig Wright believes in capitalism and competition.

And he ""gets"" that Bitcoin works based on hashpower and hardforks.

He is going to offer a mining pool that:

- supports bigger blocks

- rejects all SegWit transactions.

**After all this doom and gloom of these past few years, all these people trying to shove SegWit and small blocks down our throats, I am totally cheering on Craig Wright and I will do everything I can to support him and his vision for Bitcoin.**

As a fellow _mathematician_, I understand that Bitcoin _is_ defined by hashpower and hardforks, so I fully expect that Craig Wright's vision for bitcoin (based on accepting bigger blocks, and rejecting SegWit transactions) is going to totally destroy the small-blocks / SegWit version of Bitcoin.

And as as fellow _capitalist_, I will put my coins on the big-blocks / anti-SegWit chain - because I want economic sovereignty, and I don't want my coins tied up on some bullshit [anyone-can-spend slow-as-molasses insecure SegWit chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57brcb/bitcoin_unlimited_is_the_real_bitcoin_in_line/).

djo3ogl,Automne888,36,"I remember the excitement when we reached $90 &amp; it was already insane. I already thought it was the top, at least for this year, tbh...

Then, we went to $200 &amp; crashed to $140, and then irrationality took over lulz. Yeah, I'm not sure where we are heading off, but getting emotional over potential profits we might have missed (aka greed) is probably the worst thing people can do to themselves.

As far as I know, I didn't work to get these profits. Just stepping back a little bit &amp; peaking into the real world shows us how we should just be grateful &amp; refocus on whatever life we have. ;)

As a side note though: it seems to me that blockchains are getting more and more resilient, as the pool of users (who bought in at different levels) get wider.

Take a look at Bitcoin for example, in 2013/2014 because people like to take that example to illustrate today's situation (irrelevant imo but welp...). That's when there was no endorsement by any big company or plan to build anything long-term yet. That was when we had huge black swan events (MtGox + China's ban). That was when it was followed by community issues &amp; debates that are still never ending *COUGH COUGH*.

And yet... the price only around lost 80% from its ATH ($1000 -&gt; $200, yeah I'm slightly exaggerating but that's for the big picture).

Ethereum ? Look at all these endorsements &amp; great projects being built upon it right now. Look at all these companies reading to cooperate to improve the whole platform overall. Look at all these smart, yet nice people, with such a high level of integrity, working towards solving global issues.

Unless there is a real other black swan event, and NO, the bunches of ICOs are not: the fact that people are throwing away their profits is totally fair, they can do whatever they want with it; I'd actually be pretty surprised if we fall to more than 50% of our ATH ($400) to sub $200.

Trying to sell the top &amp; catch the bottom is not really worth the stress &amp; time: whenever I think how, two years ago, I imagined events would unfold, and how it actually did, I already can't be more satisfied rn.

[That's a personal repost from another subreddit, but it fits the thread perfectly. I'll also add something here:

Human beings in general are always looking for patterns. When they are unsure about where the trend is going, they look into the past &amp; think it will repeat itself. They saw what happened during the second half of last year, and think this is going to be the same. That's what would drive a bear market right now. A self-fulfilling prophecy... that will last until it doesn't anymore.

Just ask yourself what drove the market last year, aside from speculation ? (Hints: DAO, Bitifinex, network attacks, hardforks (of which one was controversial because of a minority, but please, stop spreading that a hardfork is a bad thing, this is a *protocol upgrade*), a climate of FUD, no endorsement of the scale of EEA... should I keep going?) ]",2017-07-02 11:06:39

djobkjp,nullc,27,"Uh. By the technical definition of turing complete  Bitcoin script: It has (sharply!) bounded execution and memory limits.  (By this mark Ethereum's VM is not turing complete either, FWIW).

However, Bitcoin script is universal and can simulate any circuit that fits in its limits, also called a total language-- this is obvious from the fact that you can use it to construct a controlled not (for example). (See also the [script talk page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Script) on the Bitcoin wiki)

&gt; This was clearly known to CSW 1.5 years ago, which stumped Nick Szabo and no Core dev agreed 

Hogwash even the comment on the wiki there predates wrights nonsense by eons, and I'm sure if I looked I could easily find places where it was pointed out on bitcoin-dev back in 2010 or 2011.

Wright's babbling about the alt-stack is just that: babbling.  Forth like languages have a second stack because it's a massive convenience: it allows writing shorter and simpler programs. But since Bitcoin script has random access to its stack (via opcodes like PICK) if you ignore the resource limits you can convert _ANY_ script using the altstack into one that doesn't use it... though the script may be somewhat longer because you need extra stack manipulation operations.

Wright claims to have a script implementing wolfram 110  ""running"" on the Bitcoin network. This is not especially plausible due to the lack of effective covenants (and other resource limits on script), but if it exists and actually works I'll happily go convert it to a version that doesn't use the altstack: he need only point to the transactions (but he very likely won't because he isn't telling the truth).

In his recent comments Wright is confusing this random-accessable forth like stack with a very different kind of stack used in a very different kind of system: If you build a finite state machine (which Bitcoin script is not) and equip it with two simple push-down stacks where access is limited to the top elements, then this can be shown to be turing complete (but not if it has only one).

Moreover, turing completeness is meaningless for anything actual application Bitcoin Script: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/666ihb/posts_theorem_and_blockchain_languages_why_turing/  ... when there is something that Script can't do ONLY because the resource limits don't permit enough operations or because the enclosing environment hasn't provided the right access to the relevant data.",2017-07-02 15:00:06

For those of you who don't know who Craig Wright is:

* In 2004, Wright was convicted of contempt of court by the [Supreme Court of New South Wales.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales) He was sentenced to 28 days in jail for breaching an injunction that prevented him from approaching customers of DeMorgan Information Security Systems, which he resigned from in 2003. The sentence was suspended on condition of performing 250 hours of community service. After appealing the decision, the ruling was upheld in 2005 and also in a subsequent appeal to the [High Court of Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia) in 2006.

* He is the founder of the cyber security and computer forensics company Panopticrypt Pty Ltd
* Wright was the CEO of the technology firm [Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Group](https://www.facebook.com/pg/HotwirePE/about/?tab=page_info) which planned to launch Denariuz Bank, the world's first bitcoin-based bank, though it encountered [regulatory difficulties](http://www.investordaily.com.au/latest-news/35127-bitcoin-bank-hits-ato-roadblock-hotwirepe) with the Australian Tax Office and [failed](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/aussie-technologists-are-opening-the-worlds-first-bitcoin-based-bank-this-year-2014-2) in 2014.
* 2 May 2016, Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of bitcoin. [Link here](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/09/aussie_nakamoto_named_then_raided_by_feds/), [here](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36168863) and [here](http://www.economist.com/news/briefings/21698061-craig-steven-wright-claims-be-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin)
* His claim to be the creator of Bitcoin was debunked, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky in his blog concluded Wright's claim was a scam. Craig Wright confirmed that he would provide extraordinary [proof](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36193006).
* His ""extraordinary proof"" was that he claimed he would sign a message with the 'satoshi's keys'-- but what he provided was a copy of the signature extracted from the second transaction in the blockchain, wrapped in layers of obfuscation to make it seem like it was a signature of a message he provided.
It was thoroughly debunked shortly after posting it (This point compliments of /u/nullc)  **Edit**
* He then posted a statement on his [site](http://www.drcraigwright.net/) which has since been expunged:

 &gt; I believed that I could do this. I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot. When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this. I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen.

djq0fyq,dofubrain,421,"This is an update of last week's support &amp; resistance [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6jhhiz/ta_supportresistance_updated/)

Before I get into the breakdown of the updated S/R levels and the triangles (yes, I know you guys fucking hate triangles), I'd just like to clear up a few issues that's popped up over the past week.

I've been openly accused of advocating pseudoscience (TA) and misleading misinformed traders into making bad investment decisions.

Let me say this clearly and firmly now - **These charts that I post are not predictions, forecasts, or buy/sell indicators. They are info to help you make informed trading decisions.**

**Here is how I view Technical Analysis:**

* [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis#Principles) is what wiki says about the principle of TA.
* TA teaches you how to spot reoccuring patterns through price action.
* Through recognizing these reoccuring patterns, you base your decision on the *reaction* of the price. E.g. Support at $250. Buy after it clearly bounces at 250, not prior.
* By basing your decisions on reoccuring patterns, you have a *probabilistic edge* for your trade to succeed. This doesn't mean it will.
* TA enables you to visualize market mentality. It's like learning how to assess road conditions while driving. If you see fog, SLOW DOWN. If you see pot holes, SLOW DOWN. If you see a huge fucking red candle break a strong support, DON'T BUY, WAIT FOR A FUCKING BOUNCE.
* TA allows you to formulate a trading *plan* - a clear set of logical decisions that **removes emotion from trading/investing**. E.g. If $250 breaks, I will not buy. If $220 holds, I will buy 50%. If $250 is reclaimed, I will buy another 50%.

I post these charts in the hopes of educating the general populace of /r/ethtrader so people don't panic sell or fomo buy. Use these tools to your advantage. If you disagree, simply disregard my advice.

Enough ranting, onto the chart. I'm angry now. Here's the fucking chart explaination.

**The fucking triangle**

* Is the construction of TWO trendlines. A bearish trendline, and a bullish trendline.
* The red trendline represents a bearish momentum.
* This bearish momentum began on the 14th of June, and still persists almost 3 weeks later.
* Until we break this fucking red trendline, bearish momentum persists.
* The green trendline represents bullish momentum.
* This bullish momentum began on the 27th June, and is still in effect as it hasn't been broken yet.
* Bearish momentum + Bullish momentum = Fucking consolidation.
* Consolidation = indecision in the market.

**The fucking MACD triangle**

* Read [this](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) if you have no idea what a fucking MACD is.
* Yes, you can use fucking trendlines on a MACD too.
* MACD shows converging momentum.
* Converging momentum means indecision.


**The fucking Pivot Zone**

* This Pivot Zone (PZ) sits at exactly 50% fib retracement, and the $260 support.
* Above this PZ, price has a bullish bias.
* Below this PZ, price has a bearish bias.
* Bias. Meaning an edge. Not a buy/sell signal.

**The fucking 200EMA (exponential moving average)**
 
* It's that fucking light blue wonky line, and it's really fucking flat.
* A flat 200EMA means fucking consolidation.
* What did we learn about consolidation? **INDECISION.**

**What does this all mean?**

* Tight ranging price action between $220(S1) and $300(R1) until either the buyers or sellers make up their fucking minds.
* If R1 breaks? Expect bullish momentum to pick up.
* If S1 breaks? Expect bearish momentum to pick up.
* When will it break? No fucking idea. Maybe after the cunts over at /r/bitcoin makes up their fucking minds about the UASF.
* I can say cunt because I'm Kiwi. So fuck off.

**My personal opinion**

* The market is fucking ADHD and can't stay in one place for long. Consolidations usually leads to breakouts into the next bull/bear leg. *This is why fucking triangles actually magically works sometimes*.
* The red trendline should break because it's been tested 6 fucking times already.
* However, breaking the red trendline doesn't mean a new bull run to the fucking moon. Could just mean a bigger fucking ranging movement (between R2 and PZ or S1, or any of those fucking levels I've got on the chart).
* Don't forget about support and resistance levels. I can bet you that most huge orders on exchanges are congregated around there like a group of lost naked hikers spooning for warmth.
* Put your buy/sell orders AT THE FUCKING S/R ZONES. Price almost always makes a fucking dive for those areas. Don't waste money on a shitty entry. Don't be a dumb cunt.

Sorry for the language. I'm in a bad mood. Hope this helps.

This in turn causes prices for GPUs that would have been in the low $150-$130 range to rise and are now higher in the $200's (higher demand, higher price). 

This leaves us non-miners or 'first time PC builders' out of luck. As either the GPU is out of stock or the price is inflated to the point where its not even a deal compared to  the pre-mining 'boom'.

&gt;Imagine you would have a magic book. There are people around the world who also have a copy of the magic book. Now, everyone can write into that book; if you write something into the book, it appears in all other copies of the book, around the world, pretty much instantly. Nobody, not even you, can erase what you wrote into that book or what someone else wrote into that book. That's basically blockchain technology, on which Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other cryptocurrencies are based.

Bitcoin, for example, uses the magic book to log transactions of the virtual currency ""Bitcoin"". You'd basically write into the magic book ""I give Cathy 1 Bitcoin"". The book then checks through all the entries of any entries of me having Bitcoin in the first place and if so, send the intended 1 to Cathy. Now Cathy has an entry in the magic book and now it knows she has some Bitcoin too, so if she tries to send one, the magic book can confirm (thanks /u/Kroucher for the suggestion).

Ethereum goes further, here you can basically write small ""self-executing"" programs that can't be deleted. So with our book analogy, you could write into the book ""I bet 1 ETH with Amy that the weather on May the 2nd is sunny and nice"", and include a data link to Google Weather or similar which the program can check. You pay a small fee to deploy the program. The code then keeps getting executed on thousands of computers worldwide. 
If it actually rains on May the 2nd, the program sends 1 ETH from you to Amy's wallet. Since anyone can check the code of the program, Amy doesn't have to trust me, the creator of the program, she can check my code for herself. Also, the program can't be suddenly deleted (so I can't just quit the bet after looking at the forecast on May the 1st). 

So Ethereum is basically a giant, coordinated decentralized swarm of individual's computers connected to each other on the web where anybody can deploy his mini-programs (called smart contracts) for a small fee.

Example, - You use your internet for a terrorist activity and the Police go to your ISP for more detailed logs of everything that happened on your IP address, and if the ISP has nothing since you always used a VPN, they could hold the ISP responsible for collaborating with you in the terrorist activity. With this clause in the TOS, they are essentially putting themselves in a position where they can say - ""We don't allow any VPNs from being used on our network that would prevent us from giving the Police the requested information. It is even written in our TOS. This customer found ways to mask his activity on our network. We actively screen and disconnect any connections that we determine to be cloaking the traffic."".

djqei74,samworthy,68,"This starter pack is inspired by people who mine crypto currencies(crypto) . The basic idea of it is that you use your computer to process transactions of crypto or solve complex math problems in exchange for payment in that crypto. Over the past few months a newer crypto called etherium has become very popular and is very profitable to mine using your computer's graphics cards, especially cards from amd's latest generation and its refresh the rx  470, 570 480, and 580.

An ASIC is basically a super efficient computer purpose built exclusively for mining different cryptos, mostly bitcoins(the most valuable, stable, and longest lasting crypto). ASIC mining made it impossible to mine bitcoin profitably with a gpu and the creators of etherium didn't want that to happen to etherium and have since designed it to be a currency that is very difficult to create an ASIC for. 

The smiley face with bitcoin signs for eyes on the bottom right is the logo for nice hash. A mining program designed as an intro to crypto mining. It runs benchmarks on your pc to determine what coin is most efficient to mine using your hardware and then begins mining that for you. What's different about nice hash compared to mining on your own is that you are paid in bitcoin for the face value of the coins you mine as they are mined rather than keeping the different coins that you mine. This means that if you've been mining a currency for a while and it's price spikes you don't own the coins and won't profit as much from that but if the price crashes you don't lose much. 

The phrase at the bottom ""what do you mean difficulty"" refers to the way that etherium is designed to become less efficient to mine as more of it is mined (so that currency will be deflationary rather than inflationary). This is done by using more vram(video memory where the gpu stores information that it is currently using). In around a monthish the amount of data stored in vram while etherium mining will increase to the point where the memory bus (the amount of data able to be written/read in vram per gpu cycle) on rx 400 and rx 500 cards(like the rx 470 mentioned in the pack) will be too small and they will see a massive decrease (30%/40%) in mining efficiency. 

Edit:almost forgot, the cable in the picture is a sata to 6pin pcie cable that's used to take a connector on the psu intended to power a hard drive and use it to provide power to a gpu, these cables are often times sketchy and depending on power draw of the gpu and how many are hooked up to a single cable from the psu could cause all sorts of issues from psu blowing up/catching fire to killing the gpu/multiple gpus etc. 

Abbreviations used 

Gpu(graphics card) 

Psu(power supply)

This is us drawing the line over the shenanigans of all those fools.

Yes, bitcoin is an adversarial system that will always be under attack, but that doesn't mean we just have to let the attackers get away with their bullshit.  Craig Wright is an out and out fraud.  That he shared a stage with Jihan Wu and the BU people this week should send a very clear signal that nothing but shenanigans is what **all** these people are about.  What just happened to the mempool that was so badly clogged that we needed 8 MB blocks?  That too turned out to be shenanigans.

djqm9az,jstolfi,27,"&gt; I'm not sure how much thought you put into the ""10 million"" numbe

Estimates of the current bitcoin user base range from a few hundred thousand to a few million.  If the block size limit were lifted high enough, it could accomodate maybe 10x as many users in a few years time -- with transaction fees lower than $0.10 and almost guaranteed next-block confirmation for ant transaction that paid that fee.

Thus, in order for the LN (or any layer 2 solution) to make sense, it must enable expansion of the user base significantly beyond a few million users, still in a few years time.   

Ten million is only the adult population of a single large metropolitan area.  The US has 250 million adults.  So ten million is the lower range for what the LN should handle.

Moreover, the LN will only work if it is a mostly closed economy, where all coins that each user receives through the LN are normally spent through the LN as well.  If only 50% of the bitcoin users are LN users, the latter would need to open and close channels all the time in order to interact with non-LN bitcoiners.

&gt; My original idea was to have the network so that 8 million of the users (80%) would have only 2 channels. I couldn't find a topology to make that work, and I had a self-imposed deadline of a week.

A model that seems to be often used in theoretical studies of networks that try to be realistic is this: add nodes one at a time.  For each node X, try to add k edges to previous nodes, at random.  Specifically, at each attempt, pick a previous node Y with probability proportional to the number of edges that Y already has.  If Y is already connected to X, do nothing.

This process creates a connected graph with a rather skewed distribution of degrees, because nodes that happen to get more edges early on will grow faster as the graph grows.  It is assumed that such graphs are good models of actual networks -- at least, better than the purely random model (pick two vertices X and Y at random, add the edge if they are not connected, and repeat until the desired number of edges).

When k = 1 the resulting graph is still connected, but barely so -- it is a single tree.  That topology would be too fragile for the LN, however. 

&gt; and most of all thanks for writing ""10 million"" and not ""100 million.""

djs7yhg,Live_Forether,71,"First time posting. Background: I first got into crypto in Jan 2017 via bitcoin, quickly found eth and diversified, and before long had moved everything into eth after reading more and more about it and liking what I saw.  My first investment was around £11 and I invested all the way up to the ATH.

For most of the time I've been investing the sentiment here has been positive, largely because it was easy - we recovered quickly following any significant dips and the gains were unprecedented and frequent. However, even at the best of times the majority of users echoed the same sound advice: only invest what you can afford to lose, and be prepared for massive fluctuation. Some people mock the celebratory mood of traditional stock traders after profiting  5-10% in a year, but must also know that the ridiculous 4,000% gains made in a few months in crypto can only happen when the threat of a reverse trend is ever-present.

Perhaps a month ago somebody here made a survey asking when people intended to cash out. As I recall, the overwhelming majority said 1 year+. If this is true, the recent struggles should not be a major cause for concern, as investors entering eth with the intention to hold strong for such a prolonged period of time must have been aware that their resilience would be tested and that the major uptrend was not sustainable. Instead it is the technology and long-term potential that should excite holders, and this in theory should be merely a blip on the radar long term. There are plenty of big developments in the coming months that should be very lucrative.

With that being said it is practical and healthy to stay on top of your investment and not blindly hope for the best. Looking for any developments that could see eth fall behind rather than form an emotional attachment and become 'loyal' to eth is good business. However, I see no significant changes in eth's roadmap and I for one remain confident in my investment, even if the downtrend of the past few weeks continues.

This is primarily a message for any hodlers who may feel their heads being turned by negativity and talk of a bubble that they fundamentally disagree with. If you invested in eth because you did your research and see this as the beginning of something great, stay strong. If you invested looking for a quick buck without researching, keep reading (and not on Reddit, although much knowledge can be found here too). 

I believe the dips being experienced recently will be insignificant in 6-12 months based on everything I've learned about eth, but every investor has to make their own decisions and live by them.

Good luck to everyone here. This forum was the first place I truly began to learn about eth and without it I would be a poorer man, so thank you. Moon kids and all.",2017-07-05 07:11:37

Choosing for €/$ might be wise with all this uncertainty. Then again, you won't get any tokens on the possible fork(s). However, if whales start dumping the other chain(s) in favor of their own, you migt be able to pick them up a lot cheaper.  

Ltc is an interesting one. I never thought it had a real usecase left after it became asic mineable. It being essentially a 1-1 copy of btc, people calling it a potential back-up for issues with btc (from a cryptographic or codebased kind of disaster) seemed weird to me. But behold :) I was wrong, with the issues plauging bitcoin being of a political / governence nature, this is actually THE usecase of litecoin.  

Another interesting hiding place might be Monero. Reason is that is has shown a lot less correlation to the btc price than most other alts did. It has a pretty steady growing userbase, limited inflation and hasn't pumped to ridiculous levels yet, meaning the potential downside should be a lot lower as well.  

I personally do not like dash, so that's out of the question for me. I think Eth has had such a phenomonal rise that the potential downside risk is high. Especially considering it kind of failed on one of its promises, scalability. Most other alts are either too small, too illiquid or not a (supposed) store of value (i.e. Ripple).

**EIUC**: We can do smart contracts too!

**Us**: Sure, if they're either (i) trivial, or (ii) reliant on a multisig of known intermediaries to actually execute then you can, but not natively.

**EIUC**: Smart contracts are useless!

**Us**: ENS auctions have users. Contracts for token sales that implement logic like funding caps have users. Multisig wallets with single-sig daily withdrawal limits have users, and have been a substantial convenience boon for the ethereum foundation itself.

**EIUC**: Ethereum can't scale!

**Us**: [raise the gas limit](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) by 40%

**EIUC**: No, we mean technical capacity! Like that chart that shows geth nodes take up 150 GB.

**Us**: First of all, that 150 GB is only true if you full-sync; fast syncing gives you 15 GB. Second, this can be handled with state tree pruning, and if you want it now the Parity client already has it, and takes up only ~10 GB. And by the way, we have a really nice light client that you can run instead of a full node and it has basically the same functionality and thanks to Merkle Patricia state trees it can even directly verify the state of any account without any need for interactive protocols or centralization.

**EIUC**: But it's not parallelizable!

**EIUC**: But it's not cacheable!

**Us**: The version of EIP 648 with full-length address prefixes. And by the way, cacheability only helps reduce stale rates, not initial sync times, and we have an alternative technique to mitigate the practical impact of stale rates, namely the uncle mechanism. And when full proof of stake hits, it'll become okay to have block processing times that are much longer, as long as they can reliably stay under 100% of the block time, and in that case cacheability isn't really all that beneficial in the first place.

**EIUC**: Proof of stake is fundamentally flawed! Nothing at stake! Stake grinding!

I'd rather have a clean, simple 15-line Solidity script with `startWithdrawal`, `finalizeWithdrawal` and `cancelWithdrawal` that anyone can understand and audit.

**EIUC**: Smart contracts are not for noobs, noobs will inevitably screw them up. Smart contract programming should only be done by teh elite experts with mad computer science skills, and such experts don't need that kind of user-friendliness.

**Us**: Even if it is true that only teh elite experts should be coding contracts, (i) a model that's noob friendly is still superior as it'll make it easier for experts to understand too, and (ii) noob-friendliness is still crucial because it greatly expands the set of people who can audit a given contract and make sure it's doing what it says it's doing.

dju5vhc,MidnightOnMars,129,"I have some new information to share that will hopefully put a smile on the faces of some of the new Eth investors who bought near the all-time high last month and are nervous about where they stand. Long term, we have a ways to go upward. I’m dumping this in the daily thread since I have to stay relatively vague, but hopefully some people will find this interesting.

I work at a financial services firm that is an EEA member and have worked for other EEA members in the past – when Eth was around $20 I broke the news that State Street would join the EEA a few months before their actual announcement and said that there was a lot more in the pipeline from the banks in the consortium. I said that we should expect to not just match, but exceed, parity with Bitcoin’s peak - at that time a ludicrously high $240 per Eth! Yet just a short while after surpassing that goal, investor morale seems low even though this is what people were calling the moon a few months ago. I get it, if you bought in at $420 you aren’t feeling too hot. I thought I was crazy for continuing my weekly buys at $50 and felt sick when we slipped back to $42 for what felt like an eternity (it wasn’t.)

There is a lot more news coming, although I must obscure a few things to protect my job and those of my friends and ex-coworkers at other banks that have passed on info to me about blockchain developments at their firms. Keeping in the radar means I’ll be able to continue to share solid info with all of you. Here goes:

A friend who was recently at an internal conference at one of these EEA banks listened to a talk given about the state of that company’s fintech initiatives and afterwards approached the person in senior management who had given the lecture to ask a few questions. When asked about the EEA, they revealed that this bank was currently developing a Quorum (JPM’s enterprise Ethereum implementation) based middle office solution that has a roadmap for going into production in about a year. Not a proof-of-concept or experiment exploring the tech, but a major bank implementing an Ethereum-based blockchain solution into their regular operations. They declined to mention details about what function it was being used for specifically but beamed about the projected cost savings from “eliminating redundancies” (presumably meaning cutting the jobs of entry level data entry or Excel jockey type employees). They also said that the eventual goal was integration of this platform with the public chain. Hard to say what it will be, but my guess would be transfer agency functions, which is a big deal.

If you’re new to Ethereum and don’t work in finance, this might not seem all that exciting, but this is uncharted territory for crypto. Trolls on Reddit and Twitter constantly harp about how there is no Eth use case, but I would posit that it’s the public chain with far and away the most major real world applications in the pipeline. Everything else is hype and Reddit arguments. Bitcoin and Litecoin have some point of sale transactions and… I’m not sure what else? Just off the top of my head Ethereum now has the UN refugee project, under the hood remittance payments via Circle, Innogy’s electric car charger network, Daimler-Chrylser’s recent promissory note issuance, ICOs, and now at least one global bank planning an implementation of some kind of function at first internally using Quorum and then interoperating with the public chain. Use of the public chain certainly seems indicative they anticipate other parties will be adopting the technology as well.

Fintech is a big money arms race and the banks that are in the EEA are competing for the same client dollars. Blockchain is the financial services buzzword of the year and there is no way these banks want their competitors to reap the publicity of being first to market with a working implementation that saves their clients money as well as showing off that they’re leading the market from a technological standpoint. 

I’m sure some will question the value of an ambiguous post like this since I draw the line at mentioning the bank’s name, but big things are coming in the next year. Is it a pump post? Sure, but it’s backed by something solid and I’m glad I found this subreddit and posts like this last year. I consider my timing extremely lucky, but my decisions were also influenced by people here on Ethtrader that were in the know. I’m not a developer and if people like my friends are I are picking up these breadcrumb trails then there is a lot more under wraps than people on this subreddit realize.",2017-07-06 11:37:44

djtqrs2,xyrrus,105,Seeing all the butthurt responses is quite amusing. Vitalik is basically showing that ethereum devs have been listening and actively addressing every criticism ever brought forth and all these guys can do is nitpick every little thing as if they're precious btc is some bastion of crypto perfection that has already solved all the things ethereum is currently engaged in. That's the major reason on why the flippening will happen. You go into r/ethereum and lay down a valid criticism of the protocol and the devs will listen and take you on in the debate and possibly create an eip to address it in the future if it turns out to have merit.

What a stupid way of looking at it.  They put out software, the market chose that software.  I prefer the software this way and your ideology does not have the right to my economic activity, clear?  For the record I owned virtually no DAO and support the fork on political/ideological/technical/moral not financial grounds.

&gt; The reason you can now use some old software is because ethereum nodes don't validate; they blindly trust like Bitcoin SPV clients.

No, I meant you can use old software **on the old chain** because difficulty adjusts continuously and you don't have to mine several 2016 block periods in the event of a massive hashpower dropoff.

Literally every single person in the Ethereum community knows you are lying.  Client crashes != network crashes in Ethereum (or even Bitcoin, as you know from BU).

djunf0m,0xstark,64,"Vitalik's post here is specific to criticisms of the ethereum protocol itself, but it's also important to consider valid criticisms of the broader ecosystem and community. 

For instance, while it's true that bugs in smart-contract code are not an inherent flaw of ethereum (any tool can be used poorly), they are a barrier to usability and adoption. BTC-types often make an exaggerated version of this point. It might be fair to say that a valid criticism of the ethereum *ecosystem* right now is that it is harder than it should be to write safe smart-contract code. 

There are also fair criticisms of groups like the core devs and the foundation. Again, while not a technical issue, the way that decisions are made has an impact on the platform. Doing things like streaming core dev meetings is a great start, though I think there's more we can do here. Likewise, the foundation is often criticized for not doing more with its funds to support the project.

As a community we can be defensive about these criticisms (especially when they come from maximalist-types), and respond by pointing out that they aren't really problems with the technology itself. Which is true - but part of ethereum's ethos since early days has been about building an ecosystem and a community that best supports the technology - this is one of our large differentiators from bitcoin. If, *unlike* bitcoin, we care a lot about our ecosystem &amp; community, we shouldn't say that criticisms of them are off-topic.

Yet that is dwarfed by u/nullc's own reply of ""You made it to line three before you tossed out an outright untruth, good show"" which exhibits a level of smugness and incivility that's not designed to entice a debate of ideas, but to antagonize and polarize.  

We are all poorer for it. Two technical minds could have had an interesting discussions on the relative merits of implementing ""Möser-Eyal-Sirer vaults"" over Bitcoin and over Ethereum, what the trade-offs are in each case, etc. 

But no. It became another pissing contest where taking potshots is the only reason to participate, and anything of technical value is just another bullet, only as useful as the next argument you can conjure to explain why Your Coin is the only Good One.

Anyway, as far as I can tell, those Möser-Eyal-Sirer vaults are described in a paper written specifically to describe an extension to Bitcoin. So, yes, they can be implemented on top of a UTXO model. No, they don't work in Bitcoin as it stands today, but if it ever becomes possible to update Bitcoin's consensus model, it could be added easily enough without changing the fundamentals of Bitcoin.    
So, it looks like Vitalik misspoke, and at most we can say that those vaults can be deployed on Ethereum today without needing to wait for new specialized opcodes to be introduced.

It is an important datapoint.. 

ETH could win because of this feature alone [ even though its current utility and hype seems to be around smart/programmable contracts ]

certainly people are avoiding trading daily in BTC as the costs are too high for small stuff.  It cant just be the currency I use to buy a car or house or expensive Bianchi bike - I need to be able to buy a cheap flight online with it, donate funds to Bernie Sanders [ or even Trump :] and purchase a coffee.    I dont need to wait around 5mins for the coffee trans to clear, for sure, but anything more than 50 bucks I need to have certainty its been paid, or Ive been paid.  [ I turn down work on paypal because I can never trust it wont be reversed.. its soo much better than banks, but it still sucks. ]

I actually haven't read much about side chains... but it seems that it needs to become a graph rather than a chain of transactions, so it can scale.  

I think we should be looking at raising block size soon _and_ take all other approaches like side chains seriously .. there will be so many technical upgrades, we need a process to make upgrades smooth, so technology that has been shown to be mature and trustworthy by all market parties, can be smoothly turned on without any chance of losing volume, latency, downtime, money etc.   I think its pretty obvious that we need a process where new code is tested on test rigs, then on low value alt-coins, then higher value alt-coins, then migrated into bitcoin when the code is mature/rocksolid and its been tested and working in the wild and all aspects been open to abuse for some time.   Call this the ""altcoins are your friend, bitcoin"" aka ""no surprises"" approach.

djvxaku,Aldacia,68,"When I first heard of Decibel, I thought it was a joke. Sure, cryptocurrencies have been expanding in terms of how they are ""mined"". But Decibel, that literally broke the sound barrier.

So naturally, like any startup investor, I started a mining rig for Decibel. The price was low, at 0.0001 USD per DCB. I knew that this had potential though, and was ready to drive up the price to at least a cent per DCB.

I knew my neighbors wouldn't appreciate it if I had a loud setup, so I bought a greenhouse in the middle of Texas. It's a great thing that my speculation in Bitcoin worked out, as I could easily fund my rig.

I ordered some industrial speakers, capable of 500 decibels, which would shatter somebody's eardrums in seconds. The permits were difficult to acquire, but I knew that Decibel would take off soon. 

So there in my greenhouse, I had twenty industrial speakers lined up and hundreds of machines. I was ready to get some Decibel. I put on some headphones, and walked at least a mile away before I turned on the rig. Even from a mile away, I could hear singing voices.

Why singing voices you ask? Decibel detects pitches and awards more decibels to singers. I could hear Taylor Swift all the way from a mile away. On my first month of decibel, I gained over 1,000,000 decibel. 

But then, there was the crash. Apparently, 1 person (me) owned 98% of the decibel and people were calling it a ""pre-mine"" scam. I tried to sell off my decibel as soon as I could, but the market value was now near 0.

So now, Decibel is ear-relevant.

UASFs are good, but they take time: I'd ideally like to see a year between the release of UASF-enforcing software and activation (though maybe 6 or 9 months could be OK in some cases). If the UASF isn't going to ever be included in Core (which BIP148 isn't), then you might need even *longer* than a year in order to be somewhat safe. Therefore, I expect Aug 1 to be very underwhelming: We'll see some posts on /r/Bitcoin about how BIP148ers now have stuck blockchains, and nothing else of significance.

Yes, it is unacceptable how things are now. Asicboost is a dangerous attack on mining, miners should never be able to block protocol enhancements, etc. But that doesn't mean that we need to panic and do *something, anything, regardless of how dangerous or unlikely to succeed it is*. Let's remain clear-headed, and do something that will actually *work* (ie. BIP149 or similar).

I find it especially annoying when people treat this as if it's some grassroots political campaign where we just need everyone to ""get out and vote"". *There is no voting in Bitcoin.* You can set up a million BIP148 nodes and it won't make any difference. For that matter, any individual person doesn't have much economic force, so I'm not sure that it'd make much difference even if you got 50% or 75% or 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to personally hard-enforce BIP148. You need *significant economic actors*: Bitcoin-accepting businesses, exchanges, etc. Maybe it's *possible* to succeed in a UASF without much business support, but then you need *massive* end-user support, which requires default-on hard enforcement in common software like Core. You're never going to succeed with grassroots political tactics but ~no time, ~no business support, and ~no default-on support in common software.

I trade bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies full-time. I left my last job more than 3 years ago to do this. It was never my plan - an interest turned into a hobby which turned into a job. You need intrinsic motivation to do something like this, and a very unique psychology I think. I have talked with hundreds of traders, successful and broken over the years. What drove a lot of them is a love for the market and a very deep understanding of the market itself. Intrinsic motivation can be very powerful. 

The good:

* Work whenever you want really. And it is not even work to me like crunching a spreadsheet or cold calling people. You talk with your friends in chatrooms. You watch charts. 

* Very ""seasonal"" work. Can get months of 24\7 action, can get months of nothing with complete freedom.

* A typical week can have big changes in your net worth (up and down), but you must not be thinking about that. But I've done well for myself - student loans paid off 5 years ahead of schedule among many other things.

* Market is 24\7, so you can live anywhere in the world and still be able to participate. Because of this you don't have to live in a specific city or country, all you need is an internet connection.

* You tell people that you meet that your job is trading and that typically spawns very interesting conversations.

* You get consulting work for cryptocurrency companies and special deals to additionally pad your income. This is the closest I come to an actual job. 

* No credentials to actually do this. No degree. No previous experience. 

________________________

The bad:

* You're a bitch to the market because it trades 24\7\365. Sleeping? hahahaha. PRICE ALARM PRICE ALARM PRICE ALARM

* During bubbles (like it is in now) you have lots of action, but when things are quiet you can go weeks without making any serious money. I have had 3 month stretches where I made $500 total. You must budget your living expenses extremely carefully to maintain a float. You can not trade today to make rent next month. 

* It basically is gambling at the end of the day and can be dangerous to those who have that gambling bug. However, unlike slot machines where the odds are fixed against the player, trading is very dynamic. I believe there is a bell sharped profitability curve where you have  successful people and unsuccessful people. Sadly it is skewed such that the profitable side of the bell curve contains many fewer people than the unprofitable side.

* You have to have specific psychological makeups and close off your emotions when planning and executing a trade. It is something easy to say but difficult to do. Either you have ""it"" or you don't IMO. 

* You don't earn money directly based on how much work you put in. You can do everything right and still loose money. You only get what the market gives you.

At the end of the day it is a cutthroat job. You are at the whim of the market. But I am one of the lucky ones. Both in a bull and bear market, I have survived. What happens to so many people is they do good for a while within a trend, but the moment the market changes, they fall out and get destroyed. I would say 70-90% of people who try and trade end up loosing money at the end of the day. 

Making the leap from trading on the side to full time is very difficult because not getting a paycheck every month can be unnerving to some. You must understand the risks and do your due diligence to protect against them.",2017-07-07 00:25:40

The bottom line is, miners are terrified of BIP 148, because if it succeeds it proves the hash rate doesn't lord over its users. They don't like the idea of Bitcoin not being controllable by them. So, just like with LTC, they are going to capitulate while claiming a victory.

We have not won yet.  Banks and governments look somewhat cooperative, but until we have hundreds of bitcoin exchanges in the US, it's far too easy for the government to choke out Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex and lay the smack down on crypto currencies.   

Bitcoin is the foundation that all other cryptos are built from.  Not just code, but the idea and shared liquidity pools.   Bitcoin should have the safest most conservative roapmap and the most decentralized, because if Bitcoin can be subverted, then all the rest can too.

Its understandable though, because Monero is a completely different codebase, so you can't fork, rebrand, tweak and release, it all has to be written from scratch.

Fortunately the Monero community, and the devs that work on Monero are very active, especially these days. As a bonus, much of the work is funded directly by the community! I'm incredibly proud of the fact that Monero's community have fostered a very symbiotic development environment where devs make proposals to the community based on what the community wants, and the community then pays them with monero to make it happen. I used to say Monero development is much like Bitcoin's early days, but frankly, I'd say Monero's development is *better* than Bitcoin in it's early days.

## Continued
 
Below is the original post on the DNC hack that began much of the conversation about the attribution of these atacks
 
https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/
 
&gt;CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach. We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR.
 
&gt;FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as rundll32.exe “C:\Windows\twain_64.dll”
 
As discussed above these tools are indicative of Fancy Bear and have appeared wherever they have been involved. Its also important to note that less developed versions of these tools are covered in that initial fireeye report and kaspersky has an article that allows one to translate between names
 
https://securelist.com/blog/research/72924/sofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset/
 
&gt;Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.
 
These implants would later become the newer SeaDuke and SeaDaddy implants discussed in other sources.
 
&gt;SPLM (aka XAgent, aka CHOPSTICK)
 
The Malware Crowdstrike calls XAgent is called CHOPSTICK extensively in fireeye sources.
 
Another security company, Fidelis, corroborated the CrowdStrike account and came to the same conclusion
 
http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/dnc_update.html
 
&gt;Who is responsible for the DNC hack? Based on our comparative analysis we agree with CrowdStrike and believe that the COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR APT groups were involved in successful intrusions at the DNC. The malware samples contain data and programing elements that are similar to malware that we have encountered in past incident response investigations and are linked to similar threat actors.
 
&gt;In addition to CrowdStrike, several other security firms have analyzed and published findings on malware samples that were similar and in some cases nearly identical to those used in the DNC incident. Many of these firms attributed the malware to Russian APT groups.
 
I would also like to reiterate that none of this malware, or afaik exploits from it, is found in the recent Vault7 releases. If you really believe that consistent use of malware does not constitute credible evidence then you may regard this evidence as inconclusive at worst (you shouldn't really believe this but ok). However below is evidence that, likely the bitly account above, is not dependent on malware used.
 
***
 
The following articles are by ThreatConnect and Fidelis (mentioned above) and detail how the DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) was hacked by Fancy Bear
 
https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/
 
Same post on the fidelis blog if you like them better:
 
http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/08/fancy-bear-has-an-it-itch-that-they-cant-scratch.html
 
The findings are detailed in the article and summarized below
 
&gt;First, the registrant – fisterboks@email[.]com – behind the spoofed domain secure.actblues[.]com has registered three other domains, all of which have been linked to FANCY BEAR by German Intelligence (BfV).  
 
&gt;Second, the timing is consistent with an adversary reacting to heightened focus after the DNC breach was announced.
 
&gt;Third, the two name servers used by fisterboks@email[.]com to register four suspicious domains are the same ones used by frank_merdeux@europe[.]com, the registrant of misdepatrment[.]com, a spoofed domain that previously resolved to a FANCY BEAR command and control IP address used in the DNC breach.
 
&gt;Finally, a pattern exists where the actor is creating fictitious registrant email addresses by leveraging free webmail providers, such as 1&amp;1’s Mail.com or Chewie Mail, to register faux domains which contain minor character transpositions or modified spellings.  Additionally, the actor is favoring registrars and hosting providers that seemingly provide anonymity by accepting bitcoin for payment.
 
These points tie this attack to both the DNC hack as well as the attacks on the German Government that were detailed in the excellent Fireeye report above.
 
The following article details Fancy Bear attempts to hack a group investigating the attack on flight MH17, another example where Russia is uniquely motivated
 
https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/russia-hacks-bellingcat-mh17-investigation/
 
&gt;Higgins shared data with ThreatConnect that indicates Bellingcat has come under sustained targeting by Russian threat actors, which allowed us to identify a 2015 spearphishing campaign that is consistent with FANCY BEAR’s tactics, techniques, and procedures.
 
Another ThreatConnect post examines the hacks against WADA during the Russian doping scandal
 
https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/
 
The conclusion?
 
&gt;ThreatConnect’s Research team reviewed these domains and found that the sites were recently registered and their registration and hosting information are consistent with Russian FANCY BEAR tactics, techniques, and procedures
 
&gt;The WADA and CAS-spoofing domains and activity most likely are intended to support Russian government intelligence collection and/or influence operations related to the WADA and CAS. Our assessment is based on the following findings:
 
&gt;1. The registration of these domains on August 3rd and 8th, 2016 are consistent with the timeline in which the WADA recommended banning all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games.
 
&gt;2. The use of 1&amp;1 mail.com webmail addresses to register domains matches a TTP we previously identified for FANCY BEAR actors.
 
&gt;3. These domains were registered through ititch[.]com and domains4bitcoins[.]com, two registrars that accept Bitcoins for payments. The use of such registrars also matches an identified TTP for FANCY BEAR actors. Two of our previous blog posts also highlighted domains at the ITitch and Domains4bitcoins name servers and their associations to FANCY BEAR activity.

This post would not be complete without addressing the Guccifer 2.0 persona who claims to be a lone Romanian hacker responsible for the DNC hack. No facts line up with this assertion and researchers widely believe this to be Russian Counterintel.
 
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/guccifer-20-is-likely-a-russian-government-attempt-to-cover-up-their-own-hack
 
&gt;However, considering a long trail of breadcrumbs pointing back to Russia left by the hacker, as well as other circumstantial evidence, it appears more likely that Guccifer 2.0 is nothing but a disinformation or deception campaign by Russian state-sponsored hackers to cover up their own hack—and a hasty and sloppy one at that.
 
Motherboard had an interview with Guccifer 2.0, the supposed Romanian Hacker, in which he did not speak good Romanian and did not know much about hacking
 
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-full-interview-transcript
 
ThreatConnect again has a good post on the more technical aspects of the Guccifer 2.0 illusion
 
https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/
 
&gt;In our initial Guccifer 2.0 analysis, ThreatConnect highlighted technical and non-technical inconsistencies in the purported DNC hacker’s story as well as a curious theme of French “connections” surrounding various Guccifer 2.0 interactions with the media. We called out these connections as they overlapped, albeit minimally, with FANCY BEAR infrastructure identified in CrowdStrike’s DNC report.
 
&gt;Now, after further investigation, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN service to communicate and leak documents directly with the media. We reached this conclusion by analyzing the infrastructure associated with an email exchange with Guccifer 2.0 shared with ThreatConnect by Vocativ’s Senior Privacy and Security reporter Kevin Collier. This discovery strengthens our ongoing assessment that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort and not an independent actor.
 
This analysis is somewhat circumstantial and not as compelling as the initial evidence that Fancy Bear is behind the hack but it is funny that Russia attempted to redirect suspicion with such a poorly prepared operation.

**Final notes/TL;DR: The evidence presented in this post overwhelmingly establishes that Fancy Bear perpetrated the Podesta, DNC, and DCCC hacks and demonstrates that Fancy Bear is associated with the Russian Government. In order to reasonably disbelieve this you would need to believe that there is a massive international conspiracy involving not just the DNC, American Intelligence, and German Intelligence, but also many of the top private security companies that investigate APTs. These companies include Crowdstrike, ThreatConnect, Fidelis, SecureWorks, Trend Micro, Kaspersky, and Fireeye. The people of these companies have done amazing work and it is incredibly frustrating to still see ""there is no evidence of russian hacking"" over and over. Before anyone responds to this with the assertion that this evidence is not enough or does not demonstrate what I have claimed it does, I ask that they read and understand at least the majority of the sources I have provided here.**",2017-07-07 09:36:28

djwh2mf,fab13n,25,"First, we don't know what they really expected as a subscription level. Maybe they wanted to appear massively oversubscribed, and intentionally gave very low targets. Maybe they had no idea, even within an order of magnitude, what it would be like, and considered they'd rather under-promise and over-deliver: a money that appears to target 50M and barely raises 5M would have appeared like a failure, and those appearances tend to be self-fulfilling prophecies.

About motivation, I don't buy that crap: only poor people are motivated by money, rich and secure people are motivated by success, and replacing Ethereum if not Bitcoin is the kind of goal that keeps you working at night, even when you have more money than you could spend on super-yachts.

""Too much money"": they state quite clearly that they don't care to leave money on the table for ""fast-fingers"", people who're very quick at buying capped or highly time-limited shares, and mechanically make a profit by flipping the coins the day trading starts. I strongly agree with them, although it doesn't align with my personal, fast-fingered interests: that kind of profit doesn't reward any kind of meaningful contribution, I'd rather give that money to bums under a bridge than to financial leeches. Or better yet, to a foundation which will actually help Tezos striving.

Now those fast fingers sure are pissed off, and you read them a lot on forums; but their real beef is that they aren't invited on the gravy train, because their contribution is not needed. Only long-term investors who believe in the product need apply :-P

Moreover, it might not be worth $200M in purchasing power: it exists mostly in BTC and ETH, in volumes which probably won't be easy to convert into fiat money. BTC and ETH valuation might currently be in a bubble (my personal intuition is that they are, especially for ETH). One can even imagine that a spectacular Tezos success could affect its competitors' valuation.

What could they do with that money? I'll voluntarily ignore the ICO overview slideware (not that I disbelieve it, but there's no point in paraphrasing it). Tezos has 2 killer-features: on-chain governance, and proof-friendly smart contract VM. I'm no social scientist so I can't predict how to support good governance with money. I'm more competent in maths and computer science, and this proof thing could use some money.

Programs can be seen as mathematical objects; you can then do maths on them, i.e. state theorems about a program and its properties, and provide formal proofs of these theorems (non-random example: prove that a given DAO smart contract can't let anyone take more money out than they've put in it). The thing is, writing such proofs is very difficult, it's mostly specialized  mathematicians who can do that. And even before writing the proof, writing the program in a way that's proof-friendly is already difficult. In a world where most software engineers consider Haskell a difficult programming language, that's a problem, there's a huge lack of skills on the hiring market. I believe that in order to make smart contracts mainstream, you have to somehow fix or circumvent that skill scarcity.

How money can fix that? Some example come to mind:

* Sponsor great training material, as MOOCs, partnerships with math universities, books...

* Better tooling: good IDE, good language (it's difficult for a language to be both proof-friendly and friendly to mathematically untrained software developers);

* Help bootstrap consulting companies;

* Offer generic smart contracts, written by super-experts, which can be parameterized or customized by mere mortal developers while retaining some provable qualities;

* Sponsor public research on the subject.

Then there are many other ways to help Tezos strive: basic marketing to exploit hype, sponsor various forms of meetups to foster a community, funding development for features such as secret transactions...

Finally, my belief is that Ethereum's design is technically flawed (EVM seems about as well engineered as Javascript to me), and that it doesn't deserve its current success; actually, I'm shocked and bummed that it survived the DAO fiasco, and my hope is that some competitor such as Tezos will suck the life out of it, the way iPhones made Windows ""smart""phones hopelessly obsolete. I think a huge reason why it strives despite its poor design is because the Ethereum Foundation does its job well. I'm very happy that the Tezos Foundation is going to massively outgun it.",2017-07-07 22:56:50

The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century. The earliest known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902. Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation. A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land.

djz18cr,SaladBarbarian,123,"So, a couple of notes from someone passingly familiar with this crap. 

1) Netflix, Google and Apple would prefer not to have DRM or ECE, but the studios they work with demand it.

2) If they didn't have ECE, you'd have Silverlight 32.0 or some other freakish nightmare to deal with (see games industry, only a new platform for probably every studio and release). Do you really want to buy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The App that's 500Mb , asks for every damn permission and eats your battery? Because that's how you get it. (Well, that or you'd have to buy a dedicated Fox Studios Movie Player that would complain that someone on the network is using a Universal Studios Movietron because it got hacked and is now running *Bitcoin The Miner* 24/7.)

3) Saying ""Well, just don't buy or watch DRM content"" is actually 100% A-Ok with studios. They're insane. They would love if DVDs came back, or even better, you had to go to theaters and watch during the period they want you to. Frankly, feel free to oblige them since DVDs can be ripped easier anyway.

This is a compromise. ECE, albeit horrible, is at least a standard, meaning that it can be sandboxed and controlled and not provided by studios who would have no problem finding a discount Easter European ""consulting"" firm to create whatever and sue the crap out of anyone pointing out that it's a RAT.

This does mean that some sites may decide to use DRM for stuff like articles or pictures or whatever. Those tend not to be run by the insane and might just respond to proper market pressure. Still, yeah, feel free to vote with your wallets and just refuse to consume any DRM'd content. 

Under firefox settings: look for  ""Play DRM Content"", 

Under Chrome settings: look for ""Allow sites to play protected content""

djzcjr0,rdnkjdi,81,"Ethereum was massively marketed as ""Decentralized Web"" incorrectly when Charles Hopkins left the project and turned it over to Tual.  Originally it was marketed as ""Smart Contracts with the power of a single smartphone"".  The power didn't lie in the processing power of a world computer the size of a smartphone - but one that could do consensus calculations with an insane amount of security and agreed upon state similar to that of bitcoin with the added features of touring complete contracts to enable insurance contracts, betting markets, decentralized exchanges and apparantly commodified ""how to get around the government regulations for ICOs""

Morons started talking about programming games, etc.  From what I can tell it only has 4X the transaction thruput of bitcoin and that's only IF it sticks to simple transactions.  And if miners raise the gas prices.

That said, PoS + Sharding should improve it 100 fold if that ever becomes a thing.  There is very little computation to move a currency from one address to another compared to run calculations.

In the end I suspect something like sharding or modified zSnarks where the chain is able to validate work was done on a single machine with 1/1000th of the processing power.  So the code can be run on a single machine and quickly validated by the network.

Guys, seriously, don't be stupid. We all got into this thing early... why the hell are people still getting shaken off? Why are you letting noobs get their hands on bitcoin without paying a premium? Why would you ever sell below your buy-in price and bet against bitcoin's nine year history? If every bitcoin HODLER refused to sell, do you know how fucking insane the price would have to jump to catch up with demand? More than you can imagine. In fact, there will be a time when there won't be a reason to sell... when merchants and consumers around the world transact with bitcoin, why convert your money (bitcoin) to fiat and pay a large chunk of capital gains to the government? You can retain ALL of that value when you transact directly with bitcoin. Don't think it's happening? Japan, Korea and Switzerland are already taking aggressive steps to make bitcoin easily available to the public and accepted by merchants all around the country. This is it fellas, we are on the verge of hitting mainstream. Stop selling bitcoin, all of us hodlers will flourish if we all just stay put and HODL together. Some things to consider: 

1. Every single metric (coinbase 1million new users/month, localbitcoin data, hashrate, transaction count, new wallet addresses) is showing signs of massive continued growth! NOT the opposite as people will make you think with all the FUD. 

2. THERE ARE ONLY 21M COINS!! Even less considering all the lost coins, the HOLDLER coins, Satoshi coins, etc... people need to understand how LIMITED the supply is. At the growth and popularity bitcoin is seeing, there is NO WAY the price can remain at this level with such a limited supply. Another 15 million people in this world can't even buy 1 whole bitcoin!! 

3. As mentioned above Japan, Switzerland, Korea, India, and Australia are embracing bitcoin, regulating it, making it readily available to citizens and many merchants are rolling out with tech that makes it easy to accept bitcoin payments. Japan alone has over 100K stores that will start accepting bitcoin this summer. This trend will only continue to grow as bitcoin becomes more efficient and as more people acquire bitcoin. 

4. The big bad ""scaling debate"" is like the only FUD people have about bitcoin... and the funny thing is, we HAVE the solution to scaling. Both parties that hold the key to ending this debate have incentive for bitcoin to succeed. Buy the rumor and sell the news people... the rumor is that bitcoin will scale, bitcoin will move forward, things are gonna work out and this debate will be a thing in the past like Mt Gox and Willy bot. 

5. Bitcoin is here to stay. Don't care about Ethereum or the the million other centralized alts out there. Bitcoin is unique, bitcoin has no face or centralized foundation that change the protocol at will (hence why scaling took so long), bitcoin has the most recognition, the best reputation and the most trust, bitcoin is becoming a name everyone has heard, bitcoin is a true commodity, bitcoin has the most liquidity and security, bitcoin has the best developers in crypto, the higher the market cap grows the more stable the price will become and bitcoin is way ahead of the competition. With sidechains, colored coins, LN, smart contracts and other second layer enhancements... bitcoin can do pretty much everything the alts can do, while being far more secure and immutable,  and finally it keeps it simple and does *what it needs to do*--be a currency, a store of value, and a limited/trustless/decentralized/immutable commodity--and it does it the best.

djz7yte,nullc,46,"Fiber is even cooler than that, it still gives me chills with how cool it is, even though I did a fair part of the coming up the original ideas behind it and thus have no real right to be so impressed with it.

Problem: You learn a block and need to get it to a bunch of computers as fast as possible; but everyone is all over the damn earth, and it takes 200ms to go round trip between Australia and California and if the whole thing isn't done significantly faster than that then you're much slower than ""as fast as possible"". 

Worse, 1% or so of packets on long international links go missing, plus links and whole nodes randomly go offline.

To your benefit, 99% of the data you're sending  is already known to the other computers, but you don't know _which_ 99% and they still need to learn what parts end up in blocks in what order plus the parts they are missing.

Plus you've got all these computers with their own network interfaces and bandwidth that are sitting idle if they're just receiving and you won't be as fast as possible unless you can use everyone's bandwidth.

So what Fibre does is that it first sends a very small sketch of a block which lets a node reconstruct the block from the transactions they already know, then without waiting for any replies it starts sending error correction data. Flow control for how fast the data is all set in advance. The error correction is setup so that if you're missing 50 packet worth of data you need to only receive _any_ 50 packets of correction data-- doesn't matter which packets you got, or which you were missing. Behold the power of linear algebra-- it works for the same reason that any N+1 points uniquely define a N degree polynomial.  The sketch is also sent using error correction data.

(The sketch part is very similar to BIP152,which Fibre was jointly developed with.)

Moreover, it doesn't send the same data to each peer: it sends every peer different data, and those peers then send other peers the data that they got (which will be non-redundant).  So everyone's bandwidth gets used, none wasted.   When someone gets enough data to recover the block they start producing new error correction packets distinct from the ones created by the original source.  They all keep sending, avoiding any duplicate packets being sent, until they get told to stop by the far side (or hit a pre-configured maximum amount of overhead, which is something like 2x the size of the block).

Because of this all the resources are maximally used and the block is received by every host at very close to the best-path communications delay to the source. Every Blinking Time. Not just sometimes. Not just only if the block is similar to the node's mempool. Not just if packets aren't lost. Not just if links don't go down.  But Every Time.  Even if packets are lost, even if a link goes down, even if a whole host goes down (obviously the down host doesn't get the block until it comes back. :) ).   And even though the whole process finishes before the speed of light in fiber would allow sending a message back to the original sender to say ""hey, I missed something.""

Fibre ""uses every part of the buffalo"".

Pulling this off required some pretty swank engineering and optimization on Matt's part, work someone couldn't have pulled off without years of experience running earlier generation relay networks to understand the sources of delay in the real world. -- and a large helping of diverse talents.

There are many ways that it could be improved and made even more robust (and slightly faster) too... though not *too* much faster... not without shooting beams of neutrinos through the earth. :P  (Obvious areas of improvement would be automatic routing to better handle links/hosts which are offline a long time, better packet scheduling, faster error correction decoding...) 

However, it's been a challenge supporting the network.  To really exploit the benefits the participating hosts need to be _fast_ dedicated servers, carefully positioned, in networks which have great routing. All this fancy protocol stuff doesn't help if the computers are busy serving someone elses porn or if the ISPs are needlessly routing all traffic through Timbuktu. This isn't cheap, and Matt was finding that the sponsorship model was really not working well (e.g. having to spend a lot of time reminding sponsors to pay, etc).

Fibre and BIP152 work together:  BIP152 tries to get the fastest transmission possible assuming that the source and receiver have low latency between each other, which generally implies minimizing the bandwidth used-- there won't be much loss, retransmission works fine, and with many peers bandwidth waste means slower transmission. Computers in a fibre network minimize latency at all cost, and spend a lot of extra bandwidth to do so-- but they don't have many fiber peers, and all of them are far away.  To get blocks everywhere in the Bitcoin network as fast as possible Fibre blazes through the long haul paths, BIP152 handles the last mile. If fibre nodes are not functioning right, no problem-- BIP152 will do the whole job on its own, though not as quickly.

BIP152 combined with Fibre and general optimizations in block processing speed (since 0.11.x I believe we've now made ConnectBlock &gt;60x lower latency) have radically lowered orphan rates on the Bitcoin network which had increased a lot with network load in the last couple years.  These improvements lower the incentive for validationless mining (which causes empty blocks and erodes security for SPV clients) and avoids larger miners getting an unfair share of the blocks as well as reducing the impact and risk of selfish mining. Without it mining would be much more centralized because the next best option for miners to mitigate latency is to centralize.",2017-07-09 16:30:57

djzpvb2,hairy_unicorn,85,"The miners have agreed to put a signal in their blocks before August 1st that will trigger the activation of a set of improvements called ""SegWit"" that are already deployed to the vast majority of Bitcoin nodes, ready for activation, and have been since late last year. 

The miners had agreed to activate SegWit much earlier by common agreement, but politics and self-interest got in the way and they stalled signalling.

To counter the signal stalling, a contingent of users came up with a method to activate SegWit: BIP148, which is a user-activated soft fork (UASF). UASF is the old way of activating protocol upgrades that doesn't rely on miners signalling their readiness to upgrade. BIP148 says that come August 1st, participating nodes will reject blocks from miners that don't support SegWit. 

The miners saw this revolt coming and make a big showy deal of pretending to come on board with SegWit called the ""New York Agreement"" (NYA): They will activate SegWit using an unnecessarily complicated signalling method, and then three months after activation, they will implement a hard fork that will arbitrarily *double* (2x) the block size capacity on top of the doubling that SegWit already implements.

This ""2x"" increase is widely seen by a majority of Bitcoin Core contributors as reckless and dangerous because it foolishly adjusts the consensus parameters soon after a major protocol upgrade, it would be implemented using hastily written code that's developed in secret (despite their public GitHub repo which looks to be just for appearances), and would necessitate a dangerous chain-splitting hard fork due to its highly controversial nature.

**So what will happen?**

On August 1st, we will get SegWit. Yay! No chain split is expected then.

Three months later, the miners *might* attempt to continue with the 2x hardfork plan, but it's highly doubtful that they will. *Why*? because unless the rest of the community has upgraded to the 2x node software by that point, the miners wouldn't dare to start mining larger blocks, since the nodes would reject them - meaning, the miners would be mining an altcoin. Miners cannot change the consensus rules without the participation of the *economic majority* of nodes. 

*What do we have to do as concerned users?*

You could install a BIP148 node and use that as your principal way of making Bitcoin transactions. This will help to ensure that the miners keep their word and activate SegWit by August. Or you could do nothing. There's a good chance that the miners will activate SegWit regardless.

As far as SegWit2x goes: don't install the 2X software and tell your exchange and favorite Bitcoin businesses that you're concerned about dangerous hasty hardforks and that you want them to IGNORE SegWit2X.

djzr2we,Taek42,77,"This may be uncomfortable to hear, but Sia is fully dependent on the Nebulous dev team. If we all got shot tomorrow (dead), that'd be the end of Sia, I am fairly certain. It may sputter on for a while, and there are a few open source contributors who may be able to keep pushing things along for a bit, but I don't think that Sia would survive.

That is centralization. In terms of project age, Sia is a young child. It's not a toddler, it can walk without us. But if we stop feeding it, nobody else is going to pick up the slack, and it'll probably die. It can't fend for itself. At this stage of its life, it needs us.

There's really only one project in this space I think which has jumped the line to independence, and that's Bitcoin. Mom and Dad divorced in its early teens (the block size debate), and somewhere amidst all the fighting Bitcoin has grown up and learned how to fend for itself. If we shot all of the Bitcoin developers today, Bitcoin would keep marching. (in this weird metaphor, I'd say Bitcoin is like a 16 year old. If you stop feeding them, they'll be able to figure out life and live without you. They aren't ready, but they'd survive. Sia is probably like an 8 year old. Can't even let it go unsupervised for more than a few hours at this point. If the devs leave, it's going to need new parents ASAP or it's going to die.)

------------

Our goal is to get Sia to that point. I want to create a decentralized cloud storage infrastructure that is completely independent, is useful to the world, and can't be manipulated by some devs who have ulterior motives. I think we will get there. I think Sia gets closer every day, but as we've seen from all the posts recently, it's really not at that stage yet. Sia has a lot more growing up to do.

I know this is a touchy proposition, but imagine that we dilute the coin supply by 2% to pay ourselves. This would allow us to hire 5 more devs, 2-3 community managers, and hire actual PR, and have enough money to keep them paid for 12+ months. Would the coin price drop because we diluted things by 2%, or would the coin price go up because we tripled the size of the team?

Seems like a pretty obvious trade to me.

I'm not sure it's a legal move though. It's less risky than selling siafunds, but it's still risky. It's also not something we're seriously considering at all. We are still exploring our full options, but this came up as one which, if I were a large holder in siacoin, would be a no-brainer to me. It's an easy trade, except that it gets forced on the entire community simultaneously, and the only way to opt-out is to sell your holdings, or reject the hardfork (which is a real option, except that I don't think any fork of Sia would survive at this point without help from the dev team. Sia just doesn't have the maturity yet).

--------------

Overall, I think Sia is in a fine place. The software is evolving rapidly, and we've pulled the strings that we had to in order to hire a fourth dev. (process isn't complete yet, but this guy is really skilled, passionate about the project, and we really can't wait to have him working with us full time).

If you are uncomfortable with the fact that we can't afford more than 4 devs to manage a cryptocurrency worth $200m, you should be thinking about ways to turn that $200m into more developer money. If you think that Sia is worth $200m because we've done a great job and have a bright future, I agree with you. I think the siafunds will kick in when the time is right and provide recurring revenue based on utility, instead of a one-time financing based on speculation.

Sorry if my comment scared anyone. I know everybody has been on high alert since the Obelisk announcement, and since the price has fallen to less than 1/2 of the peak. But we're still almost 2x where we were just 60 days ago. And I legitimately, legitimately believe that Sia, in its current maturity, belongs in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. We have much more in terms of decentralization, in terms of coin dilution (nobody holds more than 4% to the best of my knowledge - that's not true for any other coin I know of, including Bitcoin), in terms of team experience, in terms of launched products.

You may question whether what we have is worth $250m today, but I think it's pretty easy to argue that it at least belongs in the top 10.",2017-07-10 03:01:50

I kid you not this is all verifiable. 

I suggest you read up on how this hole thing started, take an objective look shall we:

[Gavin Andersen started discussing the need to increase the block size in public 2 years ago](http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent). Prior to that time it had been discussed for years censorship free and no one objected to the idea we needed to fork before blocks filled up this was accepted and never contentious. Limiting block space created demand for the products BlockStream are developing. Blockstream employ the most influential bitcoin developers who are injecting changes into the bitcoin code base, the conflict of interest goes ignored. 


Adam Back - the CEO of Blockstream responded with **FUD** and accused Gavin of doing a coup when he released BIP101 for review by the Core developers:


&gt;Adam Back: ""[Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/the-bitcoin-for-is-a-coup)""

**Contention is being manufactured where there is none** - people can choose to support or not. 

BIP101 which included the  following features which should make **it obvious it's not a coup**: 

* 1 year of preparation before it could be activated.

* it required 75% of miners to agree to the block size increase. before it could be activated.

* if activated a grace period would allowing the network to upgrade before a &gt;1MB block could be mined. 

* an additional implementations of bitcoin called XT - Effectively more distributed control over development - less centralization the opposite of a coup and centralized control takeover.

* if more than 25% of miners found it **contentious** - it would never have an opportunity to activate.  

* at the time Gavin held full control over Bitcoin repo on GitHub, and did not dictate what happens in bitcoin development


Ignorant small bock fundamentalists proclaiming this was contentious and would split the network.

u/adam3us could maybe give us a definition of what he meant when he says ""coup"" he sounds very aggressive as if his control of bitcoin was under threat: 

What followed was a closed door Hong Kong meeting where the CEO of Blockstream Adam Back meat with 80% of the bitcoin hashing power. [After a 17 hour meeting an agreement](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff), to block any hard fork proposals and wait until BS/Core releases segwit, was made. 

&gt;**what Adam said:**

&gt;Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

&gt;**what Adam did:**

&gt;He went behind the community's back, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

and that is how we recognized bitcoin was under centralized control and we got the contentious segwit soft fork.

djzuu8j,ginger_beer_m,28,"Dogecoin isn't just all meme coin. Here are some pros:

- It's fast. Once you get used to dogecoin's transfer speed (seconds), bitcoin feels so slow in comparison. It's widely supported in many wallet apps, hardware wallet etc. 
- The mining period is over, so there's no crazy hyperinflation like other new coins. 
- The dev team is committed, they've been working on this for years - through market downturn and up to now. They are focused on stability, instead of introducing gimmicky features. 
- Community. People are in dogecoin because they want to have fun, not just talking about going to the moon and buying lambo all day long (although admittedly it was better in the good old days). It has the longest running tipbot service in existence.  
- Being the [King of meme coins](http://i.imgur.com/VnPAdH3.jpg), doge is kind of immuned to market crashes, and will always be around. Noticed the past few years, doge is generally quite stable. There's no huge pump and dumps. Also just like litecoin, it's traded a lot against CNY. If the entire USD crypto bubble burst and there's a mass evacuation to Fiat, people will still trade dogecoins just for lulz. So it probably won't really die ever. Just like Terminators. 

Now here are some cons:

- Perpetual 5% inflation per year means that just like real life, your money keeps losing value. You hope that the entire crypto market grows by more than 5% to offset that. 
- Community focused too much on the 'good old days' but sitting on their asses now. 
- Devs focused too much on stability, so there isn't enough hype cycle, necessary in this age of pump and dumps. But the devs are responsive in porting the latest bitcoin features over to doge. 

At the end of the day, nearly all crypto are highly correlated against bitcoin anyway, so it doesn't really matter if you put your money in BTC, LTC, doge or whatever. When BTC goes up, they all go up, and when BTC is down, they all go down. Even if you put your money into dogecoin, you're still invested into the larger crypto world. 

Disclaimer: I used to hold tens of millions of doges. I've graduated from Dogecoin now, but it will always hold a fond place in my heart, and I suspect for many people, this is the case too. One day after all my profit have vested, I will buy all my doges back. So visit /r/dogecoin and decide for yourself whether you like what you see there. If yes, then don't be afraid to throw your $100 there.

AMD has the upper hand in more ways than one: The instruction set used for mining can be done on an AMD card with a single cycle, Nvidia cards require **three**. 

&gt; AMD cards outperform their Nvidia counterparts in BTC mining (and the current Bitcoin entry does cover this) is because the SHA-256 algorithm utilizes a 32-bit integer right rotate operation. This means that the integer value is shifted (explanation here---&gt;@), but the missing bits are then re-attached to the value. In a right rotation, bits that fall off the right are reattached at the left. AMD GPUs can do this operation in a single step. Prior to the  launch of the GTX Titan, Nvidia GPUs required three steps — two shifts and an add.

dk2eyy0,Eth_Man,80,"Ok lets nip some of this in the bud.

1)  Look folks bitcoin is still at 2360USD and ETH is trading sub $200.  Conclusion ETH is weaker than BTC so if BTC dumps ETH will keep dumping even more.

2)  Not the slightest support at 200 usd, passed through 185 like it didn't exist with lower volume btw at 175 USD.  We still haven't found our support line.  I honestly will be surprised if 160 holds.  I am convinced 160USD will be tagged if not in the next few days within a week for sure.

3)  Last time I checked total support for segwit was floating at 85% but while support for this has improved the mechanisms for signaling are different.  Take a look at blockchain.info stats on segwit btw ~45%.  Network is still split on HOW segwit comes about.  BIP91 or BIP141/148.  While there is consensus on moving forward with segwit there is not a consensus on which BIP activates it.

Now lets talk details.  As predicted by self and others volatility is expected to go up here.  Trading sentiment is negative, and charts support this.   If you are playing short good luck to you because as others have posted IF issues with Bitcoin resolves expect a significant up move in ETH.  BUT as I have stated above ETH basically has a negative drag on it.  Bitcoin could go to 2600 but I would be surprised to see ETH trade much above 240.   Even if Bitcoin revisits 3000 I honestly would be surprised to see ETH trade much above 260-270.  Shorts will pile on again if we get a rise..  If you are long you want shorts to pile on here lower to set the stage for a short squeeze.

Honestly $400 ETH is looking more like it won't happen again this year.

The negatives.  ICO drag.  Block reward (ice age was delayed at least a year).  A lot of FOMO buyers holding ETH at higher prices.  Generally ETH falling more and rising less with same Bitcoin moves.  No tangible good news or developments.   Scaling is still a major issue.  Government regulation is under discussion in many major governments (US/EU).   Price broke psychological level of $200 easily.  The longer this stays below $200 the stronger the resistance there.

The positives.  A lot of people who took profits on ETH are waiting to plunge in again.  Shorts are heaping on.  All the previous ETH buyers stuck at higher positions, if still in, will be looking to add and hold.  ETH isn't going away, just dropping in price.  Which means players looking at $1000 ETH in a few years will be drooling at $100 ETH or lower entry prices.  News flow - at least more people are learning about crypto!

In the short run I see $160USD tagged possibly as low as $100-120 in next 1 to 3 months.   $200 will be psychological resistance on the upside.  The longer it stays below the harder to break through.  BTW.  Since we hit $420 expect every support to become resistance on the upside.",2017-07-11 19:53:11

dk2gk2y,kainzilla,56,"Good morning all! My observations this morning:

&amp;nbsp;

* (Just mentioning this again:) I've been of the opinion that the general market cap for all cryptos has been deflating under worries surrounding hard fork and chainsplit possibilities for Bitcoin. There are multiple dates that are possibly bad but we should have a good understanding of the *final* result after August 1st.
* ICOs taking in too much money and then EOS and Tezos dumping on the market sucks, but it's not why we're trending down - it's the crypto market as a whole.
* This general bear market trend will probably continue until at least Aug. 1st. Don't freak out, things are still going down. There will be lots of volatility both up and down. If you want to sell and rebuy later, short the market, hodl, or hodl and buy at these depressed prices these are all good ideas. *Do not sell and then walk away!* If you sell, use your judgement to rebuy later at lower prices.
* I've been holding 100% fiat for a while now, but we've entered a price point now that is honestly pretty attractive, and I've bought in some now (dollar cost average!) even with the understanding that we're still likely to trend downwards until Aug. 1st. Keeping some fiat for more buy opportunities, and kinda excited about these opportunities.
* **An interesting (to me at least) realization that I've had** - the market seems to be slowly siphoning out of alts and traders appear to be taking two approaches that I was *not* expecting. Some traders appear to be buying into BTC pre-fork to ensure they hold coins on all chains, under the idea that prices will rise after a clear successor is found; I believe they're hoping to avoid the possibly volatile and devastating loss that could come from buying the wrong BTC chain after any forks. Other traders uncomfortable with the potential BTC price loss are converting entirely to fiat, and not alts. As a result, people making *risky* bets are going to BTC, and people making *safe* bets are going to fiat, and people that are betting on *alts* are still waiting for the bottom to buy with the understanding that prices will be lowest as we approach Aug. 1st. I believe this has led to the surprising resurgence in BTC market dominance, and depressed prices on alts that don't reflect their long-term values. I wasn't expecting this market movement at all, but it's crazy to watch.

We're still bearish, but these prices are looking good for buying...",2017-07-11 20:52:12
dk1nruj,papabitcoin,55,"&gt; I still very strongly disagree with lots of you people here who go too hard on wanting massive blocks or BU or are too obssesed about only on-chain scaling and rejecting sidechains etc. 

Then you have had the wrong impression all along.  We don't want massive blocks, we want sensible organic growth in keeping with the growth in technological capacity and see no reason why after around 8 years we are constrained by 1mb hard limit.  We have argued that the limit should be replaced by some other mechanism so that fees and confirmation times don't become unpredictable - which perhaps you will also concede is what happened.  These things damage early adoption and building of a broad user base - a broad user base has the effect of massively increasing the network effect - which is what stops mass migration to other coins and helps bitcoin stay relevant and valuable.

I have not really seen anyone who is opposed outright to second layer scaling - only that reasonable onchain scaling should be a priority.  You cannot stop people building second layer over a chain if they want to explore that.  But it should not be the only game in town.  Blocking onchain scaling has the effect of driving people off chain into alts or to these second layer solutions - the higher the demand for off chain the higher the fees that can be harvested by second layer.

18 months at least have gone by where we have lost the opportunity for a sensible hardfork as a starting point and to give the network breathing space and time for innovations to be developed.  Core stubbornly pursued an only segwit policy which they knew to be contentious a fact which was born out by the actions of a large percentage of the miners.  Whatever their technical skills may be, there governance and stewardship of bitcoin is highly questionable and has only led to division and distrust.

What you may fail to appreciate is that if the coin is artificially constrained then it can be easily outcompeted by another coin with exactly the same configuration but without the artificial constraint.  Can you imagine coke limiting its production to 100,000 cans per day so it doesn't have to build another factory, meanwhile pepsi keeps growing its capacity - maybe you prefer coke, but maybe you will find it harder to obtain and more expensive to buy...you might start switching to pepsi.",2017-07-11 06:58:57
dk1xeui,pigeon768,55,"There are two things. Bitcoin uses the sha256 hash as its proof of work. Sha256 requires a rotate right operation. In 6 digit base ten, this would be something like 123456 ror 4 = 345612. AMD has this as an instruction on its gpus, but Nvidia doesn't because rotate right doesn't mean dick for all other workloads, and you can do a rotate right with a shift left, shift right, and an or. In 6 digit base ten, this is 123456 shift left 2=345600, 123456 shift right 4=000012, 000012 or 345600 = 345612. So AMD gpus are three times as fast as Nvidia gpus on this one part of Bitcoin, but games don't need that operation. I don't know very much about ethereum.

AMD gpus also parallelize better in a certain way than Nvidia gpus. In most scenes in a game, some parts of the scene are a lot more work than other parts. Rendering the skybox is super easy, rendering a region with a bunch of overlapping polygons and edges is hard. But on a GPU, the scene is rendered in regions, and the next region can't be moved on to until the current region is finished. Nvidia gpus have a relatively small number of very fast computational units, (like Intel CPUs) and AMD gpus have a large number of relatively slow computational units. (Like AMD gpus before ryzen) (note that I'm using the term computational units loosely. If I weren't on my phone, I'd explain it more precisely) This means that an AMD GPU stalls more often because some stuff is still working on a slow part of the scene while the other units have already finished rendering the skybox or whatever. But in Bitcoin, this isn't true. Sha256 always takes the same amount of time. All the units always finish each chunk of work at almost exactly the same time. So AMD have a relative advantage on Bitcoin mining, and Nvidia have a relative advantage on rendering graphics.

There's a third thing. Crypto currency mining is 100% integer operations, graphics are about fifty fifty floating point (geometry, transform, lighting) and integer. (Colors, except HDR rendering... In which case rendering is 100% floating point) I think that Nvidia cards are better at floating point. I know that deep neural networks are utterly dominated by Nvidia, and neural networks are all about floating point performance.

Note that at the end of the day, it's not *that* big of a deal. It's not like you can't mine on an Nvidia card, you just make fractionally less money. Crypto currency miners are just as subject to fanboyism as anyone else.",2017-07-11 10:22:05

TL;DR: Please have some critical thinking, check history, check facts, check connections between people, don't let yourselves be led by the nose. There is a lot of history buried in Gox.

dk4auy7,Merlin560,50,"Point and Figure Update

We seem to be entering another phase of consolidation, albeit at a lower level than the previous week’s prices.

If you look at the chart for a longer time frame (going back to May) you will see our double bottom is settling right at the levels seen at the end of May.  At that time we had a nine column wide formation that bumped up against $2,300.  That resistance has now become support.

If we break that support the next support comes at the trend line which is currently at $1,640.  That level is 31 boxes down the price chart.  That would be a helluva drop, and I am not expecting that much volatility.  

Based on the articles I am reading about August first I expect some movement as people move their bitcoin into Alts or fiat.  Most of the stories I’ve read over the past couple of days are pretty alarmist and they paint a very dire picture.  I am confident it won’t be as bad as they write.

But—I think it will have a suppressing affect on the price.  Two weeks is not that long to wait.

Here are the numbers:

Unless the price rises over 2420 today, we’ve reversed into another column of Os.  The lows of last night matched the lows of yesterday, creating a tentative double bottom on the chart.

If the price remains under $2,420 the tentative column of Os becomes official—and the reversal price is at $2,320.  This means that we are already over the price point to reverse again to a column of Xs.    That is the sign of a consolidating market.  People are trading the chop, and that is fine.

The positive breakout would occur at prices up in the $2500’s.  If we reverse tomorrow the break out happens at $2,420.

The breakdown would happen if the price drops below $2,260.

The formation is 3 columns wide.

A new metric I am including is the distance between the formation and the trend.  As we consolidate that distance is going to shrink.  It is not a concern right now, but it is a number we should keep an eye on.  We certainly do not want to run into the trend during a consolidation—that would look more like a long term top and it would bode well for the next several months.  Once again, we are not there yet.

This is false.  Transactions of either address type can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. [example](https://blockchain.info/en/tx/650d8ad0369c8ee46bff19e2c401e3ef6146350b3ca005121742b99e703e3bde)

Basically, Type ""1"" addresses are for Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH).  Type ""3"" addresses are for Pay To Script Hash (P2SH).  These types relate to what is necessary to spend the coins associated with the address.

There is a bunch of complicated processing involved in both cases, but to super (over) simplify it, coins on a P2PKH address can be spent by simply possessing the private key that matches the public key that hashes to that address (which is used to produce a signature, which can be verified using the matching public key, which is also supplied, and which can be verified in relation to the address itself).

P2SH addresses, on the other hand, allow the ability to spend to be controlled by an arbitrary script, which may have a number of relatively arbitrary conditions associated with it, such as requiring multiple signatures.  Coins on that address are spendable if you can supply a script that matches the hash, and data for the script that causes it to return true.  While the conditions can be arbitrary, the vast majority of P2SH addresses out there are probably for multi-sig wallets, which require signatures from multiple private keys to spend.

Copying my response from medium:

&gt; This statement is misleading, because he is really only talking about what a 51% attacker could do to the very last blocks in the blockchain.

No, I’m talking about what a 51% attacker can do to *any* block in the blockchain. The great majority of costs of mining are capital costs, not operating costs; last time I did the math the ratio was something like 3:1. So if an attacker has the capital to do one attack on six blocks, they are 75% of the way to being able to do attacks on years of history.

&gt; After the multi-billion mining equipment acquisition costs, the cost of running the Bitcoin network for 200 days would be over $700 million (7.5 TWh at 10 cents/KWh).

Ok, seems like we agree on the above ratio.

&gt; there will always be a tug of war between attackers and defenders — no matter which security mechanism one uses. To speak of a cost/defense ratio of 1:1 is quite meaningless in my opinion.

How so? In order to have the $2b cost of attack, it was necessary for bitcoin miners to have burned substantially more than $2b worth of resources. That’s a 1:1 ratio (in fact, worse than 1:1), which is very meaningful. With PoS we can have a tug of war where the defenders have a 10:1 advantage, or better.

&gt; Or the attacker can strategically target a huge amount of users, making sure to only inflict a small amount of financial damage per user — so that the cost per individual to rally against the attacker is higher than the loss incurred by the attack.

This is not feasible. You’re talking about a 4-month-long chain reversion here; there is no way to make that inflict only a “small amount of financial damage”. This is a consequence of the inherent “all-or-nothing” property of a blockchain.

&gt; they often entirely disagree on how it should be dealt with

Sure, but in the case of a long range attack the way to deal with it is incredibly clear: follow the chain that showed up earlier, and not the chain that showed up later.

&gt; Given that TheDAO bailout passed by supposed ‘community consensus’ even though less then 6% of Ether in circulation voted on the matter in a process of under 2 weeks, it seems risky to ‘offend’ the wrong people in the ETH community.

This has nothing to do with a discussion on proof of stake. It’s entirely possible to have a proof-of-stake based chain that opposes DAO-style hard forks.

&gt; but what we can not count on is the idealistic concept of social consensus.
Then how do you know what software to run when running a full node?

&gt; To my knowledge, proof-of-stake has no equivalent applications in either human history or biology.

Government agencies use security deposits in various contexts all the time. Money transmitter and banking license surety bonds are one example. Bail bonds are another. The use of hostages in various forms of negotiation throughout history is a third.

&gt; A PoW 51% attacker can significantly slow down the network, but even a single attempt to revert historical transactions requires a huge and long-running expense

A cost at best equal to, and in most real-world cases substantially less than, the cost paid by legitimate miners to create the blockchain. PoS can achieve a much more favorable ratio.

&gt; SolidX’s Bob McElrath makes the point that the strategy of ‘economic punishment’ of attackers is moot if the punishment itself can be forked away.
Sure, though if a chain censors punishments, then *that chain* can once again be forked away, much like Bitcoin Core developers advocate changing the proof of work in response to 51% miner coalitions censoring everyone else’s blocks.

&gt; Another criticism of bonded PoS, as recently voiced by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, is the question how one prevents honest stakers from being tricked into interacting with the network in a way that triggers the punishment that is supposed to protect them. (Think of it as the crypto equivalent of large scale swatting.)

This is not possible; a validator cannot lose their security deposit unless they violate one of a set of slashing conditions, and compliance with these conditions can be verified client-side.

Validators can also be penalized for appearing to be offline, but the algorithm is designed so that causing others to lose a large amount of money also requires the attacker to lose a similarly large amount of money. Note that proof of work also has this property, as 51% attacks can fork off other miners’ blocks arbitrarily, causing them to burn electricity mining but not receive any revenue — in fact, proof of work is worse in this regard because 51% coalitions can “grief” outsiders at a profit, whereas Casper only lets you grief at a cost.

&gt; An alternative attack scenario, suggested by Galois Capital’s Kevin Zhou, is one where the attacker tricks enough honest people onto his network, so that it becomes these honest peoples interest to support the attacking chain as the true chain.

Except that if this attack succeeds at reverting finality, it still costs the attacker a really huge amount of money.",2017-07-13 06:37:41

dk4irgd,jgarzik,172,"It's a fair question.

The **short answer** is:  segwit2x is the best solution for BTC continuing as one coin, in my honest opinion.  The worst case scenario is segwit2x fails, and BTC definitely splits into SegWit/Core coin and BitcoinABC-without-SegWit coin.

The **long answer** is:   The community is stuck, without SegWit-only or big-blocker-only solutions winning the day.  Putting the two together seems like a way to get the entire community past this point.  It has been suggested independently many times.

My ideal world - ironically enough - is to follow the original vision of sidechains:  Deploy tech like SegWit on a real-money chain and let it mature and test adoption for 6-12 months, then include it in the next bitcoin upgrade.  This is kinda-sorta happening with litecoin+SegWit.  By this yardstick, SegWit still needs another 6+ months of real money testing + evidence that libraries and wallets want to adopt the feature.

If real money testing succeeds and market adoption appear on litecoin (or sidechain), then upgrade bitcoin to include that new feature.  That's my ideal deployment plan for SegWit on Bitcoin main chain.

So, I heave a loud sigh of displeasure at how little real money testing and adoption of SegWit has occurred in litecoin, and rationalize:  SegWit adoption will likely be slow, keeping a good pace of real-money testing with BTC.  Therefore the risk of a rushed SegWit deployment at the node level will be tempered by slow wallet new-feature uptake.

For the SegWit haters, I disagree with that position :)  SegWit does provide a good foundation, when (a) deployed as a hard fork and (b) slowly adopted organically over time.

For the SegWit promoters, I disagree that SegWit will actually have a meaningful short term impact on the #1 issue impacting users today:  block space (and lack thereof).  Listen to in-the-field users outside your bubble.

The hard fork is limited in scope, crafted specifically to minimize wallet impact and maximize wallet compatibility, and will give us good information on how to upgrade the network further.

dk62iau,silenc3x,69,"&gt; I still don't understand ~~how~~ bitcoins ~~can be mined out of thin air...~~

Bitcoin isn’t actually creating money, it’s creating value; it helps to think of it as a physical thing. Whenever someone mines Bitcoin and they get paid in bitcoin, no money is actually created. That person now has 1 bitcoin, not $1200 or whatever the cost of a bitcoin is. That bitcoin can exchange hands as many times as it likes, it's still a bitcoin. If they would like to exchange that bitcoin for money, someone has to be willing to buy it. If someone does buy it, they give that person USD and get BTC. If one bitcoin is worth $1200, the person hands over $1200 and gets 1 bitcoin. No new money is created, that person just traded money for bitcoin.

People are sending bitcoins to each other over the bitcoin network all the time, but unless someone keeps a record of all these transactions, no-one would be able to keep track of who had paid what. The bitcoin network deals with this by collecting all of the transactions made during a set period into a list, called a block. It’s the miners’ job to confirm those transactions, and write them into a general ledger. This general ledger is a long list of blocks, known as the 'blockchain'.

The Bitcoin rewards are given to miners who are invested in hardware to support a blockchain network. The blockchain architecture and protocol on which Bitcoin is built was designed is to create a trusted decentralized network. What this does is take away power from a central trusted body and share it among the network stakeholders. Today the Federal Reserve of equivalent in every nation “generates money out of thin air” by printing notes and coins. The Bitcoin (and others altcoins like Litecoin, Ethereum etc.) simply do the same. The difference is they take away control from a trusted body and decentralize it.

When someones “mines” bitcoin, they are almost playing the lottery, hoping that they will be assigned one of the few remaining, out of circulation bitcoins out there, and since (as I mentioned earlier) there is only a finite amount of bitcoins available, you have sort of created value out of nowhere. But its more like you have been assigned some piece of unique code with a promise that people will want to buy it from you.

One of your arguments against soft-forks has been that they ""fool nodes""(1) by changing the rules in undetectable ways. One of the counter arguments to your argument is we explicitly ensure that soft fork mechanisms use nVersion
signalling to ensure all nodes are given an opportunity to learn that the fork is happening; malicious soft-forks of course don't do this, but the fact they're possible is an unavoidable by-product of Bitcoin's design.

From the point of view of a headers only lite client, segwit2x is a soft fork with no nVersion signalling mechanism.

Now, to be secure all wallets, lite clients or not, will need updating in the event of a hard fork to - for instance - ensure they're getting seed nodes from appropriate places and the like, and to ensure funds aren't lost in replay attacks. I'm unclear as to why something that can be fixed in a line or two of code - code that needs to be changed anyway to safely support the hard fork trumps these important issues of user consent that you have brought up before yourself.

These are hostnames. When your node doesn't know any other nodes (e.g. the first time you start it), it connects to (some or all of?) the ""DNS Seed"" nodes to bootstrap itself onto the network.

This commit (on the btc1 repo, *not* the Bitcoin Core repo) changes from a bunch of seed nodes operated by some individuals who (probably) run Bitcoin Core or BIP148, to a bunch of seed nodes operated by some companies who (will eventually) run btc1.

Here's the latest list on the Bitcoin Core repo: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c1be28536467e90ce75eaa7d8c338f6485c4bee5/src/chainparams.cpp#L126

The parameter at the end that has been changed from true to false in btc1 is ""supportsServiceBitsFiltering"". It indicates whether or not that node supports ""service bits filtering"". I don't actually know what that is, but I guess it says whether the node is able to keep separate views of the Bitcoin network based on which service bits people are setting, and only connect you to nodes which agree with you.

EDIT: I'm wrong. Service bits are things like ""this node supports bloom filtering"". Certain clients require certain services from nodes they connect to, so service bits filtering means the node will only introduce you to other nodes which support the services you require.",2017-07-14 18:46:07

It the technology is the first true leap in fundamental distributed ledger architecture since Bitcoin itself. Sure there has been a lot of different experimentation and adjustments to the blockchain, but fundamentally all of them are still a blockchain, IOTA is not. IOTA resolved the scaling problems, the fee issue and the centralization issue, literally the top 3 concerns of blockchain that has kept it out of real world use forever. Even just solving one of them would be revolutionary, as is evident by hundreds of projects proclaiming to do just that, they solved all 3! It's hard to overstate, in fact almost hard to believe, until you look at the code and play with the protocol. 

Secondly is the team, the entire core team of IOTA consist of blockchain veteran seminal thinkers who pioneered everything from full Proof of Stake to 2.0 functionality like Asset Management, Voting etc. as well as first movers in the field of combining distributed ledger tech with Identity, Internet of Things, Voting, Supply Chain before pretty much anyone else. They have consistently shown that they are years ahead of everyone in terms of vision and creating technology that enables the vision. Thirdly look at the community and ecosystem. There is already 10s of thousands of people, their Slack alone got almost 7000 people and it is growing by hundreds each day. There is a 10 million dollar ecosystem fund for everyone to build projects on the platform. Finally they got real world companies involved, only Ethereum can rival them here.

From what I've read on other boards about how the trade works, a lot of them are sending their funds through multiple wallets and tumblers (digital money laundering essentially) before withdrawing into a tangible currency but even then you've got to store your newfound fortune somewhere, so I imagine at some point these dudes would have to launder money in a traditional sense.

I've been in this game for 5 years now, it has been my sole source of income throughout the period, the success of which is dependent on knowing the following: 


- All cryptocurrencies follow bubble like patterns; all of your memorized bullet points about the technical benefits of a particular crypto currency are largely irrelevant from a pricing perspective. Forget segwit, forget the ETF, forget every goddamn other point regarding a technical position; these are just used to move the markets in particular directions. 

- There are people that own vast hordes of crypto that mined/bought it for sweet fuckall; these individuals have little issue with dumping 1k here and 10k there, they're also well aware of the bubble dynamic which thanks to their owning millions in real worth from spending $10 back in 2009 means they can strategically play their hand without being emotional. 

- Large scale (months - years) market movements have always followed bubble like patterns, these patterns play out over the years, if you're following the day to day movements and making longterm trading decisions based on the whims of the 30M bars you're being a fucking idiot*. 

- If you're not a bagholder and wanting to trade large scale movements you have to have patience, you cannot trade based on emotion. That means being able to sleep easy when short term movements go against your strategy and not FOMO'ing then panicking when the market turns back around a few days later. If this is you then you need some serious self-reflection. 

- Cryptocurrency destroys zealots, unless those zealots got in at fractions of a cent way back when. If you think that Bitcoin is about to rebound to 3k+ anytime soon and you're holding your bag writing spiteful messages on here and other crypto forums you're a zealot.

- Attempting to time the top is a losers game, unless you spawned in life with massive amounts of luck/have enough crypto to create the top. When the 3D metrics (I recommend RSI) start being fucking absurd (aka mirroring previous bubbles) sell, wait, profit. Selling within a few hundred dollars of the top is far better than holding a bag and smoking hopium. 

Now what is yours truly doing at the moment? I sold a month ago @ 2400, before the market pushed back upwards and stayed there for a couple of weeks safe in the belief that the bubble pattern which has been true the past 6 years would hold true (no, this time it isn't different) with the intention of buying back in around 1600-1700 and getting back out again when we push back up (aka all the previous bubbles) anywhere from 1950-2200. After which I'll wait until we find a real bottom again. 

tldr - trust in the bubble pattern, don't be emotional, zealots get fucked.

If a new actor comes into the market and wants to purchase $240 Million Ethereum, with a daily market volume of $700 Million, with a natural growth of 1% daily, then it can support $7 Million new purchases a day without adjusting the projected market cap (spot price vs total volume).

I suspect that issuing an 'at market' purchase of $240 Million would change the spot price more than the actual US Dollar input. Accordingly, it should change from say $200 to $202.40, however I suspect the spot price would change to $680, or akin to such (remember a $13 Mil sale on gdax brought the spot price below $1 and rested down 10%).

Effectively the Ethereum foundation canceled a $240 Million dollar sale order of Ethereum that was to occur over the next couple months, relatively unexpectedly, beginning August 1st, a few hours ago.

Or one less $4 Million dollar sell order issued daily. Or one less $4 Million dollar sell order issued daily forever if you invested prior to full comprehension of block reward, etc.

I suspect this will have an effect on the spot price between 20% to 5%, considering how it's spread out over a couple months and perhaps was already anticipated by major investors.

WHO THE FUCK DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS!

I'm flipping my shit.

OK, here is the big kicker my Eth friends. Understanding the Block Chain Market Place. The following is the approximation of the amount of US dollars devoted to block chain security of the major crypto currencies.

* Bitcoin $1.6 Billion (at $2,400) or $4.3 Million daily (4%)

* LiteCoin $229 Million (at $44) or $627k  daily (10%)

* Dash $96 Million (at $180) or $265k daily (7%) - With equal % devoted to staked Mining.

* Ethereum $2.3 Billion (at $220) or $6.4 Million daily (11.3%) (corrected for over supply calculations, 93 Mil units)

Of Bitcoin and LTC, at least 50% (wild guess) is ASIC mining or $2.5 Million daily.

Therefore we can deduce the total pool of computers world wide devoted to mining crypto which are not ASIC is approximately:

$9 Million daily from the major chains, and let's say another $9 Million daily from all others combined, or a global market cap of computers at use in mining crypto at $18 Million Daily, non ASIC.

In other words, Ethereum is likely purchasing 35% of all computers available to mine crypto world wide, at it's current rates. The immediate plan is to take this down to approximately $3.8 Million daily, or 21% of global crypto computing power (6.76% inflation).

Long story short, I suspect long term Ethereum needs less than 1.5 Block per second (vs 3 or 5), or 3.3% of the Market Cap devoted to the purchase of global computer security or $1.9 Million Daily or 10% of the global computer security Market, but am incredible ecstatic about the reduction from 5 to 3 as well =)",2017-07-15 05:16:06

dk9c27f,jstolfi,155,"In my understanding, allowing Luke to run his node is not the reason, but only an excuse that Blockstream has been using to deny any actual block size limit increase.  

The actual reason, I guess, is that Greg wants to see his ""fee market"" working.  It all started on Feb/2013. Greg posted to bitcointalk his conclusion that Satoshi's design with unlimited blocks was fatally flawed, because, when the block reward dwindled, miners would undercut each other's transaction fees until they all went bakrupt.  But he had a solution: a ""layer 2"" network that would carry the actual bitcoin payments, with Satoshi's network being only used for large sporadic settlements between elements of that ""layer 2"".  

(At the time, Greg assumed that the layer 2 would consist of another invention of his, ""pegged sidechains"" -- altcoins that would be backed by bitcoin, with some cryptomagic mechanism to lock the bitcoins in the main blockchain while they were in use by the sidechain.  A couple of years later, people concluded that sidechains would not work as a layer 2.  Fortunately for him, Poon and Dryja came up with the Lightning Network idea, that could serve as layer 2 instead.) 

The layer 1 settlement transactions, being relatively rare and high-valued,  supposedly could pay the high fees needed to sustain the miners.  Those fees would be imposed by keeping the block sizes limited, so that the layer-1 users woudl have to compete for space by raising their fees.  Greg assumed that a ""fee market"" would develop where users could choose to pay higher fees in exchange of faster confirmation. 

Gavin and Mike, who were at the time in control of the Core implementation, dismissed Greg's claims and plans.  In fact there were many things wrong with them, technical and economical.  Unfortunately, in 2014 Blockstream was created, with 30 M (later 70 M) of venture capital -- which gave Greg the means to hire the key Core developers, push Gavin and Mike out of the way, and  make his 2-layer design the official roadmap for the Core project.

Greg never provided any concrete justification, by analysis or simulation,  for his claims of eventual hashpower collapse in Satoshi's design or the feasibility of his 2-layer design.

On the other hand, Mike showed, with both means, that Greg's ""fee market"" would not work.  And, indeed, instead of the stable backlog with well-defined fee x delay schedule, that Greg assumed, there is [a sequence of huge backlogs separated by periods with no backlog](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all).  

During the backlogs, the fees and delays are completely unpredictable, and a large fraction of the transactions are inevitably delayed by days or weeks.  During the intemezzos, there is no ""fee market' because any transaction that pays the minimum fee (a few cents) gets confirmed in the next block.  

That is what Mike predicted, by theory and simulations -- and has been going on since Jan/2016, when the incoming non-spam traffic first hit the 1 MB limit.  However, Greg stubbornly insists that it is just a temporary situation, and, as soon as good fee estimators are developed and widely used, the ""fee market"" will stabilize.  He simply ignores all arguments of why fee estimation is a provably unsolvable problem and a stable backlog just cannot exist.  He desperately needs his stable ""fee market"" to appear -- because, if it doesn't, then his entire two-layer redesign collapses.

That, as best as I can understand, is the real reason why Greg -- and hence Blockstream and Core -- cannot absolutely allow the block size limit to be raised.  And also why he cannot just raise the minimum fee, which would be a very simple way to reduce frivolous use without the delays and unpredictability of the ""fee market"".  

Before the incoming traffic hit the 1 MB limit, it was growing 50-100% per year.  Greg already had to accept, grudgingly, the 70% increase that would be a side effect of SegWit.  Raising the limit, even to a miser 2 MB, would have delayed his ""stable fee market"" by another year or two.  And, of course, if he allowed a 2 MB increase, others would soon follow.  

Hence his insistence that bigger blocks would force the closure of non-mining relays like Luke's, which (he incorrectly claims) are responsible for the security of the network,  And he had to convince everybody that hard forks -- needed to increase the limit -- are more dangerous than plutonium contaminated with ebola.

SegWit is another messy imbroglio that resulted from that pile of lies.  The ""malleability bug"" is a flaw of the protocol that lets a third party make cosmetic changes to a transaction (""malleate"" it), as it is on its way to the miners,  without changing its actual effect.  

The malleability bug (MLB) does not bother anyone at present, actually.  Its only serious consequence is that it may break chains of unconfirmed transactions, Say, Alice issues T1 to pay Bob and then immediately issues T2 that spends the return change of T1 to pay Carol.  If a hacker (or Bob, or Alice) then malleates T1 to T1m, and gets T1m confirmed instead of T1, then T2 will fail.  

However, Alice should not be doing those chained unconfirmed transactions anyway, because T1 could fail to be confirmed for several other reasons -- especially if there is a backlog.

On the other hand, the LN depends on chains of the so-called bidirectional payment channels, and these essentially depend on chained unconfirmed transactions.  Thus,  given the  (false but politically necessary) claim that the LN is ready to be deployed, fixing the MB became a urgent goal for Blockstream.  

There is a simple and straightforward fix for the MLB, that would require only a few changes to Core and other blockchain software.  That fix would require a simple hard fork, that (like raising the limit) would be a non-event if programmed well in advance of its activation.  

But Greg could not allow hard forks, for the above reason.  If he allowed a hard fork to fix the MLB, he would lose his best excuse for not raising the limit.  Fortunately for him, Pieter Wuille and Luke found a convoluted hack -- SegWit -- that would fix the MLB without any hated hard fork.  

Hence Blockstream's desperation to get SegWit deployed and activated. If SegWit passes, the big-blockers will lose a strong argument to *do* hard forks.  If it fails to pass, it would be impossible to stop a hard fork with a real limit increase.

On the other hand, SegWit needed to offer a discount in the fee charged for the signatures (""witnesses"").  The purpose of that discount seems to be to convince clients to adopt SegWit (since, being a soft fork, clients are not strictly required to use it).  Or maybe the discount was motivated by another of Greg's inventions, Confidential Transactions (CT) -- a mixing service that is supposed to be safer and more opaque than the usual mixers.  It seems that CT uses larger signatures, so it would especially benefit from the SegWit discount.

Anyway, because of that discount and of the heuristic that the Core miner uses to fill blocks, it was also necessary to increase the effective block size, by counting signatures as 1/4 of their actual size when checking the 1 MB limit.  Given today's typical usage, that  change means that about 1.7 MB of transactions will fit in a ""1 MB"" block.  If it wasn't for the above political/technical reasons, I bet that Greg woudl have firmly opposed that 70% increase as well.

If SegWit is an engineering aberration, SegWit2X is much worse.  Since it includes an increase in the limit from 1 MB to 2 MB, it will be a hard fork.  But if it is going to be a hard fork, there is no justification to use SegWit to fix the MLB: that bug could be fixed by the much simpler method mentioned above.  

And, anyway, there is no urgency to fix the MLB -- since the LN has not reached the vaporware stage yet, and has yet to be shown to work at all.",2017-07-16 01:39:43

I wish I could say this was the first time I woke up in the morning and looked at something much uglier than it was last night.  But, I digress.

So, we’ve broken down.  We blew through the target lows.  We’ve blown through the Low Pole Warning.  And now we are in a freefall towards the trend line.

If you recall, I started tracking the distance between the price and the trend line.  The trend line goes back to the lowest point in the previous cycle.  In this case the trend started in March.  The bear part of that cycle lasted just a few days and we were running back up.

Just about every cycle end is tied to a specific event.  It could be Mt Gox, Silk Road, the ETF, and now the Segwit2 stuff.  Some  bear cycles last days, some last months.  I am thinking this is one of the “days long” cycles—if it changes. 

The trend remains up.  We were 30 boxes away from it yesterday.  Today we are only 14 boxes away.  Even if we level off in this zone, that trend is going to come up at us pretty quickly.

If you haven't thought about what you are going to do—what your personal pain threshold is—you might want to start thinking about that.

So here are the price points for the day:

We are in a triple bottom breakdown.  We have already exceeded the short targets for this formation.  The next resistance is in the 1900 range and it is piss poor.

The price will reverse at a price above $2,020 tomorrow.  ""Dead Cat bounce"" is a phrase we should all keep close.  Scalping a few dollars on bounces might be fun, but keep tight stops.

The low pole warning was triggered last night.  This means we could expect a quick reversal back up 1/2 of the length of the column.  That price point is around $2,200.   That's what the “text book” says.  I am not that strong in my prediction.

So, take a look at the formation.  Make your own judgement.  Keep your eye on the next BIG resistance around $1,700.  And yes…it could drop that far pretty quickly.

dk9lzvt,Codebender,38,"Unfortunately passwords are one of those areas where computers simply outclass humans.  There's only so much you can do, and it comes down to how much effort you're willing to expend to get incrementally smaller levels of security.

The first thing, and it bears repeating, is never re-use passwords.  Inevitably a site you use will be hacked, and that will be the one doing stupid stuff like storing your password in plain-text or with a weak, un-salted hash.  Bots will then put that in their lists, and if they ever get hold of even a strongly-hashed database from another site, they'll have your account in seconds.

Simply appending the site name to the end is a big step above a shared password, though obviously the names of every site are also in all the wordlists.

Essentially, it all comes down to *entropy*.  That's commonly said to be the ""randomness"" but I find that description to be less intuitive than it could be.  A better way to describe it, without getting too technical, is as a measure of the number of different ways you could arrive at a given arrangement.

To take a trivial example, if I flip three coins, there are 2^3 possible outcomes:

    HHH = 3 heads / 0 tails (1)
    HHT = 2 heads / 1 tails (3)
    HTH = 2 heads / 1 tails (3)
    HTT = 1 heads / 2 tails (3)
    THH = 2 heads / 1 tails (3)
    THT = 1 heads / 2 tails (3)
    TTH = 1 heads / 2 tails (3)
    TTT = 0 heads / 3 tails (1)

The outcomes HHH and TTT can only result from a single one of the 8 possible outcomes, while getting two heads or two tails each happens in 3 of the 8 outcomes.

If I drop three coins and they all land heads-up, we say that has ""low entropy"", because there are few ways in which that could happen.  If you drop a thousand coins, you expect an approximately even number of heads and tails, because there are a practically infinite number of outcomes with that result, but still only one outcome where they're all heads.

The analogy with passwords is that we would want to choose a password which can be arrived at in a great many ways.  This is why, despite being long, a password like ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"" is still terrible.  But you have to remember that crackers aren't just trying letters, they're also trying words and variations of words, so ""BigCock"" only takes thousands of attempts, not the billions that might be implied by the character set and length.

One approach is to generate passwords randomly.  Many systems will generate such passwords, like ""7M9DT8Gt"".  Assuming each of the 8 characters has 26+26+10=62 possibilities (upper+lower+digit), password entropy is calculated as log2(62)*8=47.6, meaning it would take around 2^47.6 = 200 trillion guesses to come up with, i.e., 2.5 days at 10^9 / second.

But of course those are a bitch to remember.  Another approach is to use words.  The math is similar, but there are many more possibilities for each one (thousands instead of 62) so many fewer words are needed, and the result is more human-friendly.

As with most topics, [there's an XKCD for that](https://www.xkcd.com/936/).

And something like [http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html](http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/pass_phrase.html) can be helpful, since humans are really bad at randomness.

I don't know about you, but I still can't remember dozens of such phrases for all my different sites.  A decent compromise is to come up with such a phrase, one which doesn't appear anywhere in the corpus of all human knowledge like ""correct horse battery staple"" (of course, if you google it to check, now it's in a database somewhere...), and then come up with a scheme where you modify that in a predictable way for different sites.

So your passwords might look like:

    PotpieSquawkBordelloPinfishAllegoryFacebook$ucks
    PotpieSquawkBordelloPinfishAllegoryGoogle$ucks

There are a few problems with this approach, though:
 - Some shit sites run by fucking idiots limit password length/characters (looking at you, American Express)
 - If the site name changes (e.g., ShareBuilder is now CapitalOne investing) then your predictable variance scheme means your password has to change, or you have to remember what it was based on before.
 - If your password is stored plaintext somewhere and leaked, someone might figure out your scheme and add your ""base phrase"" to a dictionary.  Somewhat unlikely, though, as generally nobody looks at each entry, but they might look at the outliers, like the longest ones, and think you might have something really valuable to protect.

For maximum *digital* security, I would use a phrasebook approach, completely different for every site, and store that on paper with multi-site backups.  That's a *huge* pain in the ass, though, and far more effort than is justified for most people.  And, of course, if you're ever personally targeted, someone might get hold of all your passwords, so then you need to consider writing them down in some kind of cypher... ugh.  (Note that this is effectively the recommended approach for Bitcoin private keys, but you need those only rarely)

Realistically, I think the best approach for most people, and most uses, is to pick something like 1Password or LastPass and use it to store good, unique passwords like those generated by fourmilab above.  If you're paranoid, add *another* word to every password you store there, so that you use it to auto-fill your good password, then type in ""TinFoilHat!"" manually (using an on-screen keyboard to foil keyloggers, of course).  That way, even if LastPass utterly failed, you would have some time to change all your passwords to a different base phrase while the hackers are busy looting everyone else's accounts.

Of course if you're storing them you can use shorter passwords of random characters, but you're eventually going to have to type them in, e.g., on a mobile device, and I find that words are easier to communicate and remember.

The Lighning Network is not one (test) transaction between two friendly nodes who are willing to jump through hoops in order to demonstrate it.  It is a **network** of millions of users sending  millions of payments per day, because they find it better than other payment methods.  

Announcements like that tweet, that intend to make people think that the LN is ""ready"" and ""just waiting for SegWit"", are very close to fraud, to put it mildly.  In fact the LN concept has several major technical, economic, and usability problems that still do not have satisfactory solutions, and may not ever have any.

[Apologies for the length]


This entire comment section is VILE. Some context: I recently came out to myself as a trans woman - after trying *hard* to prove to myself I wasn't; I *really* wanted to deny it. After I finally came around, for some reason without really thinking about it, I fell into half-believing that people might just live and let live. That maybe my personal hurdle to clear was the hardest one, and everyone else could just learn to accept it. But the samples of living scum on display here are a necessary wake-up call, like, this is a part of why even admitting yourself, *in private* that you might be trans is frightening. You're practically subhuman to them. They are openly, unrepently proud of how disgusted they are by you.

I'm sorry if this is a little incoherent, but I really need to vent... (Any bolding or emphasis is mine.)


&gt; [-7 points] My cisgender wife is 6'2"" and is built like a shitbrick house. She's been mistaken as a dude, despite her huge tracts of land and has gotten harassed. Meanwhile, me, a trans guy with a shitty neckbeard and man boobs, has never been noticed in the mens. 
&gt;&gt; [+3 points] So you're a ""guy"" but you have a vagina?

Look at how casual and unprovoked this is. There was no imposing, no aggression, he just said he's a trans guy, and some shitstain immediately jumps in to deliberately misgender him and mock his genitals.


&gt; **Oh, grow up**. Girls in a shower room do not want a male going in there, and they have that long-entrenched right to privacy. You know damn well that people are naked in showers and locker rooms. **That's a big mistake the trans movement made**, forcing the ""new rules"" to include not just bathrooms with stalls, but showers as well. 

&gt; [separate comment] A **miniscule unimportant half delusional** fraction of the population has ZERO fucking right to be dictating their terms to the rest of us.

Trans people are insane, irrelevant, unimportant, delusional, immature. They are asking WAY too much, these trans-tyrants have tread on me for the last time and I won't take it. How dare you want to use a shower? You have the gall to ask me to use a different name and pronouns? TYRANNY! CIS-OPPRESSION!


&gt; Iran is also a country that openly encourages people with gender identity issues to go full operation rather than be homosexual, so logic would infer that they have a large group of people to draw evidence from. 

**Fuck you** from the very bottom of my heart. Iran forces gay cismen to undergo HRT. They are inflicting gender dysphoria on people as a form of punishment. They warp your body and flood you with hormones your brain isn't really built for. It's sickening and cruel, not encouraging.


&gt;Are you stupid? You are **not a woman down to a cellular fucking level** no matter how much you think you are a woman you are not **you're a man**.

&gt; [separate comment] It remains true that the surgery and hormones only change the gender on the outside, never the inside, **never the chromosomes**

Yep, femininity is a cellular, biological property. Cool. Posture, body language, manners of speech, styles of dress, hair length, the entire system of mental cues your brain uses when it asks ""masculine or feminine"" is encoded into a cell. Take a girl from 2017 and introduce her to a girl from 6000BC, they have basically the same DNA and chromosomes, so I guess they'll act and talk and present the same way. That's awfully neat. Their secondary sex characteristics looking similar is just a coincidence too, because hormones apparently don't even play into this. Nope, it's chromosomes all the way down.


&gt; How come believing yourself to be a gender other than you demonstrably are, is praised as ""being courageous"" instead of being regarded as a mental disorder? 

Trans people who publicly present according to their true gender identity regardless of how well they pass as cis require courage *because of fuckwits like you*. **You are the problem.** If you would just fucking accept it and not constantly talk about how you think she's an extraterrestrial freak of nature,  maybe, surprisingly, we wouldn't have to make a big deal out of this. You have no idea how much I'd love to just start presenting as feminine tomorrow, go on with my life, and treat it as a normal thing. But **you** can't let that happen. You're all about ""personal liberty"" for legal weed or unregulated firearms or bitcoin in stores or whatever, but *god forbid* someone violate your fucking puritan ideas about gender.


&gt; Most people over 30 still consider it a mental disorder. Pretty sure it's still classified as one. These people need legitimate therapy.

Well we agree on one thing, I definitely need legitimate therapy. Maybe I wouldn't need it as badly if, I don't know, I could just sit down and talk openly to one of these ""most people over 30"" and not have to worry about whether they'll permanently evict me from their social circle because of my ""disorder"". **You are the problem.**

dkby9uq,zyuko22,28,"In short: Backbone of the machine-2-machine economy. ex) drones autonomously paying a charging station to recharge and deliver goods. ex) EZpass payments.  Although has much more indepth uses. Also look up DER solar grids.

Here are the reasons:

No Miners: Doesnt use third party miners to verifiy transactions (every other blockchain, or coin for that matter, uses miners) because its revolutionary tangle ""blockchainless"" ledger is programmed such that when you send out a transaction, you verify two previous transactions.

Zero-Fees: No miners means no mining fees for the user (the fee is to verify two previous transactions).  This is essential for micro/nano transactions.  Say you send .0005 cents, then a fee could be larger that what you are actually sending.  No other blockchain as absolutely zero fees.

Infinite Scalability: This model allows for transaction speed to increase as more people use the network, opposed to every other blockchain whos network slows as transaction volume increases.  This is important for when Blockchain technology would/will grow to a global scale.

Not only are these points the answers for why every blockchain WILL NOT work on a global and micro/nano scale, but there is more.

Lightweight:  The ability to participate in the network requires minimal computing power, can be done on a smart phone, or a really small microchip.  Eventually ternary processors will maximize these capabilites.  It can literally transact on a microchip in a tiny sensor.  These will be known as the light nodes.  However, light nodes will need to ""report"" to a full node to verify the transactions.  The full node can be run offline and, for example, will be run by a company wanting to utilize the IOTA tangle ledger in their business model (and many businesses will utilize this tech, ex) Microsoft, Cisco, Bosch, Innogy are all implementing as we speak, and as of 5 hours ago, SatoshiPay is switching from Bitcoin blockchain to IOTA).  Think of this metaphor, if I dont want to use a portapotty to go to the bathroom, I should consider installing plumbing.  If i want plumbing, I gotta buy the pipes and pay for water to run in my house.  IOTA = Plumbing, Full Node = Pipes/Water.  Entirely new business models and apps will be able to run using IOTAs tech, and it will literally change the world as we know it.

Quantum Secure:  Every computer is susceptible to hacking, likewise, all blockchains are susceptible to hacking or ""attacking"".  However, blockchains are highly, highly secure.  Buuuuut, with the invention of quantum computers, they will basically be able to brute force their way into any blockchain.  IOTAs tangle ledger has algorithms in place to protect from a potential quantum attack in the future, even though it is wayyyyy down the road.  Basically theoretical at this point. Either way fully secure in almost everyway.

But dont just think of IOTAs as a currency, the tangle network is a means for sending data between computers, with no fees, instantly.  Now can you see why companies will want to use it? Instead of using, say, comcast business, verizon or other greedy pointless monopolies like that.

This a very simple explanation for why IOTA is the FUTURE of cryptoassets. Consider yourself very lucky to have stumbled upon this miracle that will enable the 4th industry revolution.  IOTA is a very big deal.  Its a new internet that will actually work, unlike what every other blockchain is claiming it can do.  I recommend you do as much research as possible, as I have, to fully understand to its core why this is such a big deal.  It is the youngest and most innovative tech in the crypto space as we know it, and it is partnering with actual moguls of the tech world as we speak.  I fully believe in this tech, but dont just take it from me... do your research and become a pro.  Compare this breakthrough back to when steve jobs forsaw everyone using a personal computer, before they were even created.  It has that widespread adoption capability.  Its that significant.

dkcr0de,LuaMater,82,"So, since right now we're so tightly coupled to bitcoin, I went down the rabbit hole of /r/btc, /r/bitcoin and had a read through the various BIPs everyone keeps bringing up to try and make sense of what's happening with this August 1 debacle. [Here's a cute little flowchart](https://image.ibb.co/gh1wxv/Bitcoin_flowchart_2017.png). I think I'm getting a general idea of why the price of BTC (and consequently, the price of ETH) is starting to rally. It seems like a good portion of it has to do with [BIP 91](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0091.mediawiki). The TL;DR of BIP 91 is that instead of being a UASF (user activated soft fork) like [BIP 148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0148.mediawiki), BIP 91 is an MASF (miner activated soft fork) that needs less than the 95% supermajority for BIP 148. The way BIP 91 works is that if in a rolling window of 366 mined blocks on the bitcoin network from July 21 to July 29, at least 269 blocks are mined with a bit in the version field signaling BIP 91 agreement (i.e. ready for segWit processing), then the network starts rejecting blocks that aren't segwit enabled. This effectively makes BIP 148 useless, and essentially makes August 1 a red herring, as the network will be using segwit well before then and the 2MB blocksize increase (segwit 2x) isn't slated to happen until mid November.

The sudden optimism and bullishness most likely comes from the fact that [AntPool, BTC.com, BTC.top, BTCC, Bixin, BitClub and many others have already mined at least one block signaling BIP 91](https://www.xbt.eu/). Over all, these mining pools represent [50+% of the total hashpower on the network](https://blockchain.info/pools) with roughly 80% needed for BIP 91 to be successful. All top 5 pools are now signaling BIP 91 (many of them, like AntPool, for the first time today). In the flow chart I posted as well, it mentions that Bitcoin ABC will fork regardless, and says that many of the pools signalling BU (Bitcoin Unlimited) will most likely move to Bitcoin ABC. Many of the pools that were previously signaling Bitcoin unlimited are now signaling BIP 91 instead. 
From here, it seems to me like there are a few possible scenarios


**1. BIP 91 fails to achieve 269 blocks and it fails, paving the way for BIP 148 to go into effect**

Probably the worst case scenario in the short term, it's the shorters wet dream and also seems like it's the most unlikely. The fact that there's already majority hashpower signaling BIP 91 almost week before the ""observation period"" starts and almost 2 weeks before it ends makes me suspicious of the idea that miners will wither a) suddenly back out and/or b) that the momentum wont carry to 80% HP. If it does, then the mess with August 1will still be alive and well and there will probably be further contractions for all crypto across the board.



**2. BIP 91 goes into effect, and August 1 becomes more or less a non issue. Bitcoin ABC has some what significant/very significant/majority support**

Massive rally after news of August 1 being ""called off"" starts to go around, possibly lasting until after August 1, then a decent ish drop as people start migrating to BTC ABC. Lots of uncertainty and drops as more money leaves to the sidelines as people wait for the dust to settle between legacy BTC and BTC ABC. Not really sure how to call it after that. The height of the rally and the magnitude of the drop will be dependant on how cleanly and quickly BIP 91 passes and how many people decide to jump on the BTC ABC bandwagon.



**3. BIP 91 goes into effect, and August first becomes more or less a non issue. Bitcoin ABC quickly becomes irrelevant or gets outright abandoned**

Not exactly moon, but i can see 300+ pretty easily a week or so after August 1 after people realize the whole thing was Y2K tier hysteria.



**4. The above, but EEA3 is also announced**

We organize a moment of silence for anyone that still has leveraged shorts sub 200. 

The most important thing to remember hear is that even if scenarios 3 or 4 occur, we're still going to be on the hotplate for November 15, which might end up being the ACTUAL apocalypse everyone here has been professing for the past week or so. 

Now please tell me about how wrong/stupid/new I am. I'm sure at least a portion of this is pretty misguided and I'd love to hear some constructive and not so constructive opinions

EDIT: Ok, so here's a summary of what I took from my meeting with John. FWIW he does not think the bottom is in for Bitcoin just yet. He expects (as do I) a second test (or 'echo' as he called it) sometime in the near future. He said he would be very interested in entering a long on the second run down.  

**1.**  Bitcoin is great for conventional TA due to it lacking pervasive/widely traded indexes, options, futures, arbs etc. He does not expect this to change anytime soon. 

**2.** Wyckoff is a solid resource for learning the fundamentals of market action. Humphrey B. Neill for psychology. Re: Wyckoff look into springs &amp; up-thrusts. 

**3.** Extremes (tops &amp; bottoms) are good high probability trade zones, especially in bitcoin. Tops tend to come in 3's and bottoms in 2's due to the nature of the psychology of the market. 

**4.** Tops and bottoms have different psychological frameworks. Tops are slower to form (generally) because greed manifests differently than fear. Conversely fear tends to illicit sharp and fast bottoms. This affects the urgency of trade entry and exits in these environments.

**5.** Stick to what you know. Find your edge or niche and exploit it. Dont try to trade every timeframe and every market. Find what suits your personality best and hone that. 

**6.** Be careful with session definition in 24/7 markets (I.E. a daily candle close in bitcoin is different than a daily candle close in conventional stocks)

**7.** Not having discipline is what hurts you most in trading.

**8.** Bitcoin has a tendency to form W bottoms. Key to look for is the second test of the bottom that does not break the BBand on the daily.

**9.** Daily is (JB's) preferred view. Weekly used for reference and hourly for entry, but daily is what he bases all of his setups off of.

* There's probably going to be a split
* This will be caused by a software fork called BIP 148 which was written to force Segwit 1.0. I don't know who wrote this or why they thought it was a good idea. Apparently nobody knows??
* Miners are not even interested in Segwit 1.0. They had a big meeting at a famous sex tourism resort in Thailand and agreed to implement Segwit2x, which was written by one guy on a long drug bender and is supposedly better. However, some are suspicious of the claim that some random dude outside Bitcoin Core can do this all by himself, especially since they tried a test run of Segwit2x last week and it shat itself.
* In any case Segwit2x is incompatible with BIP 148 so it doesn't resolve the split.
* Yet another random dude wrote some code called BIP 91 which, if it reaches 80 percent of miners by next week (currently at 50%), would both prevent the BIP 148 fork and magically resolve conflicts between Segwit 1 and 2, but ONLY if it is implemented by next week. I don't know why the 91 is smaller than 148, as I thought the BIPs are proposals that appear in sequential order.
* Some miners have enable BIP 91 even though they are not prepared to mine Segwit blocks themselves. Nobody knows why. BIP 91 would not itself implement Segwit by force, so maybe it's just to avoid the clusterfuck of BIP 148 while they upgrade their hardware for Segwit.
* It is hard to tell 100% if any of these hacks will work properly, as all of these pieces of code are literally written by some random guys as opposed to the trustworthy key Bitcoin developers

2. when we're going up, that brings out the nice from everyone and this sub is funny, charming like a friendly banter wagon. when we're going down fear takes over, and everyone is shouting louder and louder with less and less evidence presented to support their claims.

4. hodling only works if you truly believe that the price is going to recover above your dca. when we're approaching 130 at lightning speed, that faith can get shaken quite easily. 
5. we're no where near big enough to determine the direction of cryptoland.. one day maybe, and it's fun to joke around about the flippening, but if the clusterfuck of the past weeks have showed us anything, it's that cryptoland has one true king, and ruler and it's called bitcoin. we're just its shadow. for now.. it will change I believe, but it will take time..
6. the only psychological defense mechanism the human mind has in case of a colossal fuckup is lying to itself.

What you are seeing is the beginning of the exciting climax of **The Scaling Debate**. Essentially, the bitcoin system has seen a recent increase in activity for the last year and there's been a huge increase in transactions. Right now, the bitcoin network can process roughly ~4k transactions every 10 minutes (every 10 minutes miners mine a new block. A block can hold roughly ~4k transactions because the block size is **1 mb** (this is important).
 
This issue has split the community right in half with 2 camps emerging, /r/bitcoin and /r/btc. On one hand you have the maintainers of the [bitcoin repository](https://github.com/bitcoin) who aren't in favor of increasing that block limit but instead are looking to a new technology called **segwit** to alleviate pressure in the system. Critics of this solution say that this solution doesn't address the high miner fees that are present in a backlogged system (the miner fee is so high that many usecases of bitcoin are prices out) and accuse the maintainers (the Bitcoin-Core team) of disobeying the white papers by overruling what the miners vote on or of attempting to monetize the Bitcoin network for their own gain.

One of these attempts to take power away from the miners (who process transactions in the network) was the **User Activated Soft Fork** (UASF). In cryptocurrency, forks are a phenomenon that occur when the blockchain is split into two chains that do not meet again, somewhat like a fork. This is also one such way to upgrade a blockchain network, a soft fork implements changes that will still work with older nodes running different software while a hard fork implements changes that are not compatible with the other nodes in a network and so these hard fork nodes only communicate with each other, forming their own network. The UASF software ignores all incoming blocks that do not signal segwit (past a certain date, this means supporting segwit. That date is August 1st). This is a big deal because the announcement essentially declared war on the miners. The miners, in return announced another fork known as [UAHF](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/uahf-contingency-plan-uasf-bip148/) which is essentially a hard fork that implements an 8 mb block size. (NOTE: As of July 28th, the UAHF fork has branded itself as Bitcoin Cash (BTCC)). 

On the other, you have a ton of companies (including chinese mining companies) who came together and attempted to hash out a middle ground solution. This middle ground solution is known as **Segwit2x**. Segwit2x is a solution that upgrades to Segwit and 3 months later will hard fork and implement a 2 mb block size (thus addressing the current block limit constraints). The thing is, if this happens and the Core team doesn't merge changes that accept this hard fork then the maintainers of bitcoin will be pushed off the blockchain with a significantly less amount of mining power as most of the miners ([87%](https://coin.dance/blocks))
are forking off to segwit2x. 

**So TL:DR** Debates on how to scale the network have ravaged the bitcoin community for years. August 1st is the beginning of the exciting 3 year finale.

dkfyjiv,tituspontius,1090,"I didn't expect people to actually leave their wallets there. I just wrote the sign and went to sleep on the sidewalk. By the time I woke up, there was an overflowing amount of wallets from random strangers. They seemed almost attracted as they would drop off their wallet and disappear. I removed the sign and almost immediately no one paid attention to me. *Interesting,* I thought.

After a hot meal from the local McDonalds, I began to count my cash. I also withdrew as much from the credit cards as I thought possible into my Bitcoin wallet. I began to stare at the sign I put up: it was a small whiteboard and black marker, all with a kickstand. I erased the message and rewrote another one: ""Give me all of your cash."" As I placed the whiteboard on the kickstand, people began coming up to me and dropping cash into my Big Mac container. ""Hey,"" I pulled my Big Mac container away. People then just put the cash on the ground. I pulled out one of the wallets and replaced the message: ""Put all your cash in this wallet."" Soon even the cashiers began emptying out the registers and giving me cash. I was fucking rich. I walked out of the side entrance just as a man in a Rolls-Royce pulled up on the other curb. I began to scribble as I crossed the street. As the driver got out of the car, I flashed the whiteboard in front of him. Soon, I pullet out with a brand new Rolls-fucking-Royce.

The next few days were spent doing some of the dumbest shit I've ever done: causing fights in the middle of the street, getting hot women to undress in public, having jewellers just hand me free jewellery. It was truly a mess. I also tested what caused the epidemic. First I replaced the marker, and it failed miserably. Then I replaced the whiteboard and it also failed. Finally the kickstand didn't help the situation. It was a combination of all three that made it work.

However, the marker began to run dry. Panicking, I needed something that could ensure that I would never need to do anything in my lifetime. I began to plan how I would do this. I has someone set up the tripod and the lighting so I could record the video. I struggled to write down the words but as I finished, I turned them around and flashed the words. I uploaded the unedited video to YouTube. 1 view. *Refresh.* 3 views. *Refresh.* 8 views. *Refresh.* 30 views. The view count grew almost exponentially. I laughed almost maniacally as the video blew up.

And that's how I became ruler of the world.

dkfohxk,fpgaminer,281,"Here's some clarity for those who are confused (I was too initially).

**Coinbase is saying they won't support BitcoinABC.**

They also mention BIP148, but don't specify any stance on it one way or the other.  It's not clear from this statement whether they'll support the BIP148 chain or not.  (I don't know if they've given previous statements that express their position).

There is no mention of SegWit2X/BIP91, AFAICT.

Hopefully that clears it up.  I know a lot of people thought UAHF in their statement refers to BIP91/SegWit2X.  It doesn't, and that's why you're confused :P  AFAIK BitcoinABC actually is a UAHF; all BitcoinABC clients will fork off on August 1st regardless of what miners are flagging.

Here's the full text from the email they sent out:

&gt; The User Activated Hard Fork (UAHF) is a proposal to increase the Bitcoin block size scheduled to activate on August 1. The UAHF is incompatible with the current Bitcoin ruleset and will create a separate blockchain. Should UAHF activate on August 1, Coinbase will not support the new blockchain or its associated coin.

&gt; The User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is a proposal to adopt Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin blockchain and could result in network instability. It is scheduled to activate at the same time as the UAHF.

&gt; To ensure the safety of customers’ funds, we will temporarily suspend bitcoin deposits, withdrawals, and buy/sell starting approximately 4 hours before activation of either fork.

&gt;     If you currently have bitcoin in your Coinbase account, and do not wish to have access to UAHF coins or have immediate access to your bitcoin, you are not required to take any action.
&gt;     If you wish to have access to UAHF coins or you wish to have immediate access to your bitcoin, you should send your bitcoin from Coinbase to your external address by July 31.

dkgcd5t,trizephyr,217,"The bitcoin block chain might be split in order to help with scaling the bitcoin blockchain . It is all based off of a new proposal that, if voted upon, will split the coins into two different parts. Here is a more detailed view, note that it is a complex issue, but this article can help you get started https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-beginners-guide-surviving-bip-148-uasf/

Edit: here is the ""motivation"" for the coin split based on the github page

Segwit increases the blocksize, fixes transaction malleability, and makes scripting easier to upgrade as well as bringing many other benefits.

It is hoped that miners will respond to this BIP by activating segwit early, before this BIP takes effect. Otherwise this BIP will cause the mandatory activation of the existing segwit deployment before the end of midnight November 15th 2017.

dkh4y0x,mechanack,111,"UAHF prevents the original Bitcoin chain from being re-org'd and lost forever in the event of full SegWit activation, for one thing. 

Many of us don't want SegWit at all for any reason and want to see the original chain and project preserved and upgraded the way it was always meant to be. 

SegWit Bitcoin is an altcoin created by pretenders as far as I am concerned, and it doesn't matter who divorces who, these chains need to be separate entities and judged alone at this point after 3 years of pointless gaslit bickering. SegWit shills can have their cake, and so can Satoshi purists like myself, as blockchains are designed to split up in case of these irreconcilable differences in the community, which is something most fail to understand as a fundamental property of blockchains to do that. 

For someone so sure that UAHF is a stupid idea, you seem awfully concerned about it happening. It will at least have my hashrate behind it on Aug 1, and I will probably not be alone.

dki17oc,petertodd,87,"BIP-91 lock-in does not guarantee segwit will be activated unless BIP-91 is actually enforced.

Soft-forks are ultimately enforced by users, not miners, and right now practically no users are running BIP-91 enforcing nodes like [segsignal](https://github.com/segsignal/bitcoin). So a majority of miners can reneg on BIP-91, fail to activate segwit, and get away without any long-term¹ consequences because the BIP-91 invalid blocks they would be producing are considered to be perfectly valid by the vast majority of users' nodes.

Will this happen? It's notable that even though BIP-91 just activated - something which is supposed to signal clear intent to activate segwit - a bit less than a majority of miners are actually signaling segwit. While no smoking gun, it's a sign that we *may* be in a situation where a majority of miners do not intend to actually activate segwit.

I don't think this is the most likely outcome - there's other pressures like social that probably would serve to enforce BIP-91 - but I'd give it significant odds of happening. Maybe 25%?

edit: FWIW, the reason why I think it's as high a chance as 25% is because there's a few ways to reneg on segwit with plausible deniability. For instance, miners could ""accidentally"" mine a bunch of BIP-91 invalid blocks - e.g. claiming it was due to validationless spy-mining - and then decide not to reorg out those blocks. At that point, the BIP-91 rules have been broken, but lots of transactions depend on them, so the whole thing gets called off with vague mutterings of ""we'll try again once we upgrade our systems"" or ""well obviously soft-forks are just too dangerous!""

1) In the short-term reneging on BIP-91 could lead to a large reorg - why I recommend that people be *very* cautious about trusting confirmations until segwit is fully activated in (hopefully) a few weeks. It's quite plausible that we'll see even 6+ confirmed transactions get double-spent due to reorgs.

dkisq5c,CarrionCall,51,"With Bitcoin sitting at ~$2700 I get the feeling that a lot of people who rode the wave up yesterday are still sitting in BTC. A lot of that came from trading across from ETH, as seen by the depressed ratio.


The drop from near 3k showed a bunch of people selling the news on BIP 91, probably those who rode it up from ~$1800 the other day.
They've cashed out &amp; are looking for the next pump.

People on here are asking if it's a good idea to jump across to ride the next wave up to 3k, and while that's not a terrible idea based on it's movement yesterday, my gut just feels off on it.

The reason I'm not so sure of BTCs direction is because those who have cashed out will be looking for the next *big* swing opportunity. BTC's ATH is 3k so there's a lot of mental resistance to huge gains beyond it, if-and-when a pump stalls out somewhere north of $3000 (be that $3500 or wherever) it's going to be what, a 10-30% hike on current prices? With people selling the rise all the way up, cashing in from yesterday and today.


However, ETH is 50% *down* on it's ATH. That's a lot more headroom.
Flood it &amp; push it up into FOMO territory and you have enough room to go to ATH &amp; (perhaps) just beyond. 
~~50-60%~~ 100-120% gain on the current price today? Plus *everyone* on here is expecting it to go back up, so sell pressure would ease once it broke through our recent resistance levels. Those who got out recently are looking to get back in, rather precariously staring at the price. Those who got burned are looking to make up losses or could be easily pulled in by FOMO on a massive rise.

That's a *hell* of a lot more profit to be made here than trying to run BTC up past 3k.


Not saying it's going to happen of course, after all, these past few weeks have been a lesson on the capriciousness the market.

dkiq4js,Merlin560,48,"Point and Figure Update

This is one of those days when you think that bitcoin investors are simply psychotic.

Yesterday we had the mother of all reversals.  The column rose nearly 35 boxes.  We topped out at $2,956.  These are the days when everyone walks around like they are investing geniuses.  How could you NOT be successful in a market like this.

Of course this was all due to the acceptance of the scalability plan by a large majority of miners.  This scared a ton of people off the sidelines and back into the mix.  While shorting and options are not as significant in bitcoin, this looked like the short squeeze of all time.

The problem with so much goodness, is that it eventually overshoots and we come back down a little.  This is happening this morning.  After peaking yesterday at $2,956 we fell overnight back down into the $2,600s.  Based on where we started this week, that is still nothing to sneeze at.  Expect the long pole warning to resolve, falling about 15 boxes from the top.  That would put the reversal point at the low of this morning.  So, by the time you read this we should be moving upwards again.

Here are the numbers:

We are in a tentative reversal down to 2640 or so based on a long pole warning.
We reverse at a price that was lower than $2,900.
The bottom of the reversal is 41 boxes above the trend line.  This is bullish.
The formation is 2 columns wide.  If we follow the pattern for the past year or so, we should see a consolidation around the 2,700-2,800 range.

I hope we have a good weekend.  Its nice when a plan comes together.

dkhljbx,Uptrenda,47,"I always hated this about the Bitcoin world. Everyone is so smug in the way they give feedback and every little mistake that a person makes is made personal or given a political meaning. It means that the only people who can flourish in that environment are anti-social because an environment where experts build up credibility by mocking anyone new to the space isn't going to lead to more experts...

People don't want to contribute to a space where they feel like they will experience personal and public humiliating for every little failure they make. That is why its important to give feedback on ideas and not to attack the people making them (and even the way you give feedback on ideas needs to be done somewhat carefully because there are real people behind them.)

Another benefit of doing this is that people are more willing to learn from their failures. For example, if something goes wrong here most people aren't rushing to cover their asses to save face in the same way as I've seen people do in the Bitcoin world.... Since a person's credibility hasn't been built up by a long history of acting smug and superior to everyone else - a person has no reason not to admit when they've made a mistake and learn from it (everyone makes mistakes.)

After-all, they know that there aren't a bunch of smug experts ready to pounce and lay judgement on anyone to boost their own status, so why wouldn't they want to take the opportunity to improve their work? It just seems to me that most Bitcoin experts are extremely negative people to deal with in general and its why I personally have never wanted to collaborate with many of these “experts.”",2017-07-21 04:20:11

dkkh0yi,BTCrob,65,"First rule of thumb about anything to do with investing. If you're ""sure"" something will happen, and everyone else is ""sure"" will happen, it never actually will.

There are so many different factors that go into the price discovery of a complex, highly traded investment vehicle that it's a fools game to try to figure out exactly why something is happenning or not. It's likely dozens of different factors all playing off each other.

Bitcoin is going to be highly volatile and unpredictable. It could go to $1500 before it goes to $3000 again. You need to be prepared for that mentally.

The only way to keep your mental health in Bitcoin is to believe in it. Take a longer term view. Study blockchain technology, and think about what problems in the current global financial system it will solve. If you believe in it, and you decide that it IS going to be a transcendent technology, then just be secure in that and ignore the minutiae of the daily price action. 

Without that solid conviction backstopping your investment, there's no way in hell you'll be able to stomach the swings this thing is going to go through over the next few years. A good example is last weekend. If I didn't have such a strong conviction in the future of BTC, I would've sold my entire position when it dropped 20% over the weekend. Because of it, however, I was comfortable buying all through the weekend in small chunks every few hours. By the time the recovery started on Monday, I was able to accumulate close to 5 bitcoins at prices that we may never see again. And if we DO see them again, I'll happily scoop up more.

If you truly believe in BTC, you're happy to see it go down, because all it means is you're getting a steep discount on it's way up. If you don't believe in it, you shouldn't be invested in it. It'll keep you up all night and drive you insane.",2017-07-22 23:56:41

• Because some of them literally worked on, built, or were heavily involved in many internet standards that we use today. 

• Because most worked for free, without any paycheck, for an incredibly long time on making bitcoin more secure, private, and efficient. 

• Because none of those priorities have changed, and their main method of scaling adds in onion routing by default and essentially hides *each individual transaction* from *everyone* but the immediate person you transact with.

• Because there are a lot of people and policing agencies right now who are extremely concerned about *stopping* financial privacy more than anything else.

If we scale in layers and in application specific sidechain/drivechain networks, that connection between user and specific addresses will become murky.

At current ratio it would be ~$60. I am a huge advocate for the future of LTC but believe BTC will appreciate at a faster rate compared to LTC.

Massive legions of paid Reddit posters flooded r/BTC for Long time convincing many people that were not tech savvy the miners were underdogs and simply knew better than the devs what the path of Bitcoin should be.

dkl5mj3,SpiritButler,58,"I am sorry, but even if I knew the owners of Dream had their balls in a LE vise, I wouldn't stop conducting limited business through there based on the current facts.

If LE had access to Dream a month ago, as with Hansa, what would that mean for me?  They could collect metadata like login times and my password specifically for Dream, and they could watch some bitcoins move around in a way that does not connect to me.  They also find a bunch of PGP messages.  None of this concerns me.  There hasn't been a bust of anyone so far that hasn't made an OPSEC error as far as we know.

The biggest risk from Dream is that they may get busted/exit scam, and that you lose some coin.  That would suck, and I won't deny that it would be number one on my list of ""next markets to go dark"", but still, all business conducted over DNMs should be done AS THOUGH LE ALREADY *DOES* HAVE CONTROL OF THE SITE.  THe lessons learned so far from the people that have been burned by this whole mess:

1)  Encrypt shit yo' self

2) Use unique passwords for every site

3) If using bitcoin, tumble yo shit/don't contaminate any wallets/tx chains with anything leading to your IRL persona

4) Do not click/copy any phising links

5)  Never allow javascript to run on a TOR site

6)  Keep a local copy of your vendor's PGP key, as it could get swapped out and cause you to have communication directly with LE/scammers.  

Between these tips and the general OPSEC rules already posted in this sub, I can't seem to see what the big fuss is about, other than LE scare tactics are working.

Edit:  As suggested by a couple smart folks below, I added number six.  And P.S.:  I don't mean to sound arrogant about my safety or dismissive of the events that have cost us all a lot lately, I am just not going to bow to scare tactics.  What these developments do for me is to remind me of how fucking dangerous it is to be dealing drugs right under LE's noses, and that the only thing keeping me from handcuffs is strict adherence to proper OPSEC.

dklrpe3,TheSecretMe,56,"Well to keep it simple, bitcoin.org describes bitcoin as 'a payment network and a new kind of money'. Bitcoin fails at both.

As a payment network it's slow and most of the promised advantages aren't really in place. It's slow and you end up paying fees for each transaction. Rather high ones at the moment.

As a new kind of money, it fluctuates harshly, sometimes by hundreds of dollars in the space of days or weeks. Absolutely useless as money.

In the end, bitcoin ends up as a commodity that people hoard, hoping to make money off the next bubble.

Pretty much the only people getting any real use out of bitcoin are the ones converting traditional currency into coin, making the transaction and converting coin back into real money on the other end immediately before they can lose money on fluctuations.

dkl6nso,BoatyboatMcBoatface,40,"   Its been a while since the bitcoin trust (GBTC) was at 539 a share.  That was back when bitcoin hit $3,000.  So the Rothschild trust is definitely underwater on this trade as it was trading at 390 Friday.  With that said, bitcoin is going to go higher, much higher, and this is further confirmation.  And for those of you who like to trash the trust, it has a great many things going for it.  For large investors it allows you to buy and hold through your brokerage of choice, trade instantly, and pay tax the way you normally do on stocks.  You don't need to be a tech and manage your own wallet.  And the premium to asset price disappears as the asset price rises.  The trust is able to be purchased by institutional investors who are subject to investment guidelines and can't maintain private wallets.  And the trust is managed by Barry Silbert's group which includes Coinbase and they are regulated by SEC rules for exchange traded securities.  Silbert's group has great flexibility if they ever want to split the trust to make it more affordable after substantial bitcoin appreciation.  And certain safeguards that matter to large investors are present that will never be present in private wallets that can be stolen, lost or otherwise encumbered.
    
I am aware that the bitcoin trust is not the vehicle of choice for the tech community, which worries a lot about borders and central banks and evading the purview of the IRS.  But large investors are more accustomed to buying and selling registered securities on stock exchanges and compliance with existing capital gains taxes; they simply aren't interested in investments that appear to skirt the rules.  So before you impugn the bitcoin trust you should know that this type of security is what exists in every country with a stock exchange that sells etf products, bonds and stocks and mutual funds.  Its necessary for investors to be able to access this type of security.  And investment advisors and stock brokers worldwide will soon be telling clients to consider the bitcoin trust.  When the 401k managers of Americans can begin pouring 401k money into bitcoin the wealth potential will increase.  The trust has gotten some bad press because of a couple of journalists who are regularly bashing what they don't really understand.  But if you wanted to drop a hundred grand of your retirement money into bitcoin tomorrow I would strongly support your decision to buy GBTC shares instead of trusting your money to a wallet.",2017-07-23 09:37:12
dklpjti,christophe_biocca,40,"There will be 2 splits away from Core:

- Bitcoin Cash is the ""early"" split. It is guaranteed to happen, although it is not guaranteed to have much hashpower. It happens August 1st.
- Segwit2x's block size increase to 2MB will happen in November, and currently has 80%+ hashpower support. However longer timeline =&gt; more chance of something happening to derail it. It is designed to be able to happen even with minority hashpower support, should that prove necessary.

&gt; Is this Bitcoin Cash the same as the Bitcoin Unlimited token on BitFinex?

Not the same. The BU token is an hypothetical token for when the BU miners and nodes would fork off, which they never did because they needed &gt;50% hashpower to do so.

&gt; It will become a blockchain like Ethereum Classic, if a BTC split occurs?

Yes, as long as even a few blocks are mined, it should become functional.

&gt; Is this split likely on Aug 1st, despite apparent agreement on this segwit2x compromise?

Yes because the people splitting away are those so opposed to Segwit, or so skeptical of the 2x part of segwit2x, that they're willing to split off right now instead of synchronizing with the 2x hard fork.

&gt; I'd love to start HODLing, if a split away from them is likely.

If you have BTC now and you control the private keys, then you'll have both sides. My recommendation is to just split them into separate private keys after August 1st, and wait until the end of this year before making more decisions. The chain may die quickly, or it may end up getting more support if 2x doesn't happen, or it may die once 2x happens and the main-chain is more scaling-friendly.",2017-07-23 20:24:53

dklsx4a,somereallystupidname,38,"&gt; The value of bitcoin comes from two things, first its scarcity, the maximum number of bitcoins that will exist is already known so yours won't be devalued in the future by new ones being created. 

This is more of a source of risk than it is a source of value. Once all bitcoins are found, they will constantly be increasing in value due to bitcoins being lost/hoarded and shit, but if a hoard of them is found then the value of bitcoin will rapidly fluctuate.


&gt;The second source of value is that it allows to send and receive wealth almost instantly to and from anywhere in the world without the need of any intermediaries, this is a huge improvement efficiency wise.

This is a legit source of value. That said, 99% of the value comes from it's ability to help launder/smuggle wealth and facilitate trade in (usually digital) contraband(i.e. child porn, ect), as transferring wealth between countries in any amounts worth mentioning without going through the proper channels is illegal, so while it IS a source of value, I don't know if that is the best thing to... idk if advertise is the best word, but still.",2017-07-23 22:36:43

It gets tiring reading *nothing* but bad news. So here's some shit to consider. Remember the lightning network, which means instant 0-conf payments and millions of TX per second?

Can you give it literally a *MINUTE* before you spin up more trash and fud to try and depress the sentiment and the price?

Look. Short all you want. Just because I think the price is going to go up over time and I'm patient enough to wait for that doesn't mean it won't or can't dip in the meantime.

dkmdlcy,nullc,38,"I'm so tired of responding to the same untruthful points over and over again.

E.g. the first thing it argues that that segwit doesn't provide a know capacity increase because people need to choose to use it.

Well no duh, people need to choose to use more capacity for it to be used. That is what capacity is... And this very morning [miners were producing](https://blockchain.info/block/000000000000000000fc4f7efce8c42dacccf97b3ddb9a2b2cd1459c931371c9) &lt;1MB blocks because their just isn't enough demand to fill that (much less 4x more!)  Moreover, the fact that SW adoption is gated by the normal slow software upgrade is not a downgrade over his hardforks: with his HF you also have to upgrade to use it,  and the process means that there can be a gradual increase rather than a system shock of going straight back to ~0 fees and then a system shock again as fees come back into effect.  --- reducing these shocks was a specific and intentional design goal in SW, one which his HF efforts have simply ignored.


&gt; have zero direct sensitivity to block size.

In fact they do not-- they can directly observe the size of blocks by the size of the resulting hash trees they have it.  I previously asked if any of them had been tested (and to see the test plans) and only got answers of ""there is no effect!"". I agree they're likely to do okay, but that doesn't replace testing.  This is symptomatic of the general recklessness around these proposals:  Effectively ""we're going to change things, against people's will, and if they don't like the results well I guess they'll get to fix it later.""

&gt; At large enterprises, there is literally a legally mandated de-risk’ing process 

Yes, and the development methods and timeframe of segwit2x make it physically impossible to meet best practice deployment.  They don't even have a correct written specification for their irreversible consensus rule changes-- even though they claim that they are so simple; don't even have a release of the software (only a release candidate), and yet they expect to have 100% of Bitcoin users upgraded to these rules within 90 days or be subject to exposure for funds loss.

For critical networking infrastructure it's common for operators to do months of their own testing on a vendors release before taking it into production; prudence which is physically impossible for Jeff's segwit2x even if all companies dropped all other projects and immediately began working on just this. The timeframe alone demands we collectively reject it.

By comparison, segwit underwent 6+  months of public discussion and review and operation on a test  system before being placed in any release, then had months post release before any possible activation to allow further testing, and this is for a change which is opt-in unlike Jeff's hardfork.

Jeff continues on with a deceptive unequal comparison-- basically comparing a plain Bitcoin Core user without custom software upgrading but he calls that the 'hardfork' upgrade, then he seperately describes a situation with someone unfortunate enough to use BLOQ's library software that in spite over a year of opportunity does not yet have segwit support (and doesn't appear to have started on it-- BLOQ has apparently been too busy working of mandatory AML/KYC wallets to bother keeping up with the Bitcoin industry) and basically describes all the complexity created by BLOQ's unmaintained software as segwit complexity.

His second case should have had an example for a user running their wallet infrastructure with Bitcoin Core or another maintained offering (like BitGo). It would be ""test a new version, deploy a new version"" like the above; but unlike the hardfork they can do it on their own timeframe, and use standard risk mitigation techniques like partial roll outs.

But what you're really missing by reading that isn't all the point it said but got wrong, but all the things it didn't mention:

It doesn't mention that frankensegwit ignores many attack vectors and performance issues and makes some worse, leaving them still [debating kludging on](https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/pull/41) additional consensus rule restrictions to protect it. Another highlight pointed out by that that is that ""segwit2x"" isn't even a done deal-- the consensus rules for it are still changing and not clear, so how can it expect useful review?

It doesn't mention the process-- that segwit2x is the product of a closed door backroom agreement between a VC and several of its investment; which has actively sheidled itself and rejected community review and commentary-- which it [continues to do](https://twitter.com/james_hilliard/status/889196962406379522) even against the very people who wrote the consensus rules they copied; that it's success would bring serious doubt to the long term security and viability of Bitcoin as an autonomous system free of central control.

It doesn't mention that it has been [uniformly rejected](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support) by the public and open development community, and that most of us will not go along with it both as a matter of engineering integrity but also out of the principle of public involvement and transparency. The same people who have been tirelessly growing, protecting, and maintaining the Bitcoin system since 2010/2011.

It doesn't mention his last year of comments ranting against soft-forks (the only consensus upgrade approach used by Bitcoin's creator...) because the are 'opt-in by default', but how his proposal summarily closed [suggestions](https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/pull/46) to use the ""hardfork bit"" approach to make his hardfork straight forward for lite clients to opt out of. ... a change would would have prevent the day long network fault their system had on testnet, the product of a (minor) design flaw that they've still failed to correct.

dkm0qkv,bah_si_en_fait,37,"It's also written by Vitalik Buterin, who has proven time and time again he is not a competent developer. Gavin has left the team for over a year now. https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/01/11/last-blog-post/

&gt;Also ""Ethereum Hack"" is a misconception, ethereum itself was not hacked, a smart contract was hacked. If someone stands up a vulnerable web server on an EC2 instance and the site gets hacked, do the headlines say Amazon was hacked? In the same way, just because a smart contract was hacked does not mean the ethereum protocol itself was hacked. The DAO hack is another great example of this.

This very view is incompatible with the response to the theDAO hack. On one hand, the ethereum foundation sells it as some kind of wonder world where the code is law, so obviously, what happened with the DAO was not a hack. The hard fork proves this is just a bunch of bullshit and that Ethereum is still a centralized, controlled cryptocurrency. 

It's a bunch of bullshit snake oil. As proved over and over again, both by their handling of the situation and their inability to write good software (and languages). Copying a post from HN so everyone can see how utterly incompetent they are. This is about Solidity (which was mostly written by Gavin).

&gt;All state is mutable by default (this includes struct fields, array elements, and locals). Functions can mutate state by default. Both are overridable by explicit specifiers, much like C++ ""const"", but you have to remember to do so. Even then, the current implementation doesn't enforce this for functions.

&gt;Integers are fixed-size and wrap around, so it's possible to have overflow and underflow bugs. Granted, with 256 bits of precision by default that's harder to do than usual... but still pretty easy if you e.g. do arithmetic on two inputs.

&gt;Operators have different semantics depending on whether the operands are literals or not. For example, 1/2 is 0.5, but x/y for x==1 and y==2 is 0. Precision of the operation is also determined in this manner - literals are arbitrary-precision, other values are constrained by their types.

&gt;Copy is by reference or by value depending on where the operands are stored. This is implicit - the operation looks exactly the same in code, so unless you look at declarations, you don't know what it actually does. Because mutability is pervasive, this can can have far-reaching effects.

&gt;Map data type doesn't throw on non-existing keys, it just returns the default value.

&gt;The language has suffixes for literals to denote various units (e.g. ""10 seconds"" or ""1000 ether""). This is purely syntactic sugar, however, and is not reflected in the type system in any way, so ""10 second + 1000 ether"" is valid code.

&gt;Statements allow, but do not require, braces around bodies. This means that dangling ""else"" is potentially an issue, as is anything else from the same class of bugs (such as the infamous Apple ""goto fail"" bug).

&gt;Functions can be called recursively with no special effort, but the stack size is rather limited, and it looks like there are no tail calls. So there's the whole class of bugs where recursion depth is defined by contract inputs.

&gt;Order of evaluation is not defined for expressions. This in a language that has value-returning mutating operators like ++!

&gt;Scoping rules are inherited from JS, meaning that you can declare variables inside blocks, but their scope is always the enclosing function. This is more of an annoyance than a real problem, because they don't have closures, which is where JS makes it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with this approach to scoping.

There's also something about everything being 256 bits wide, even byte. Except byte[]. But I can't find that link again.

Read that, and repeat after me: PHP is actually a better language than Solidity. _PHP is better than Solidity_. How the fuck do you even get here, if not by being completely incompetent? At least Rassmus Lerdorf admitted that he doesn't give a fuck about making a good language and just restarts the server.

The only purpose of Ethereum is to make Ethereum Ltd. money, from people who do not know better or are just here to speculate.

dkmgz46,guybehinddesk,32,"To all the newbie young bloods looking to claim their stake in the digital gold rush. 4 basic rules that are a MUST! 

The crypto game is less about making money and more about avoiding self-controllable mistakes that result in losing your money. 

#1. Follow the money
Initially was exposed to bitcoin in 2013 as merely a hedge and curiosity factor. In 2014 I started following Tim Draper (VC/Visionary/Badass) and doubled my positions after his massive auction scoop. Guys like Tim and many others have a vested and invested stake in the success of bitcoin/crypo and the future infrastructure. Why throw darts at ICO's/alts or think you know how to read a white paper and forecast the value of the proposed technology when their investors carving the infrastructure path with big money and more importantly big brother collusion or cooperation depending on your take. Tim's one of many, read his story and find others like him. Invest in their business innovations and vision its more likely to end up as a real project with tangible application uses then a box of ICO rocks. 


#2 DON'T Trade
Enter your position and DON'T trade. Your not a robot and you won't be one anytime soon. You don't have the liquidity, risk threshold or the skill set to be a manual day trader and you most certainly can't not pick tops or bottoms.  90%+ stock traders don't beat the primary indexes they trade on over time. And that's in a regulated market with minimal manipulation- not the wild west crypto kids. Secure your position and sit on those damn hands, which leads to the next and most important step....

#3 Shut off your computer
Secure your position, store your funds offline and shut off your computer for 1 year minimum. No joke, shut that shit off and keep your greasy fingers off of it. Obsessing over the price or thinking you have any control over the outcome is insane. It will distract from work, family or worse result in you making some knee jerk reaction trade or sell that you'll regret later.  Time is the only commodity that matters. If you enjoy crypto great, then spend time to keep current on subs/investors etc. so In 1-3 years you have the knowledge to consider exchanging some of your profits to further diversify into future projects/coins. 

#4 Patience
By far the hardest of the 4 steps. Our natural impulses, volatility and cultural 24 hr news cycle make it impossible to not 2nd guess a prior decision/investment. Stick to the plan Stan. It takes years to reap life changing benefits from the decisions you make today and this be 1 of very few life changing/disruptive technologies in your lifetime.

If you have additional funds add to your positions over time on dips (50%-70%dips) and rinse and repeat above steps. Weekly recurring buys are great brainless way to average out over time. 

For those that like to learn the hard way- like me, enjoy yourselves just consider allocating a small percentage of your funds so you won't regret it when you come nothing but pocket fuzz and come to the realization that you should have considered the above more seriously.

There are 115 Federal prisons. 


The cost for one person in the Bureau of Prisons Facility is: 31,976.00/year or 2,665.00/month. So Randall Lord's cost at Club Fed would be a total of 122,590.00. That doesn't even take into account any cost to the wife and children being left or any societal cost.


In 2005 the American criminal justice system held more than 2.3 million people in 1,719 state prisons, 102 federal prisons, 901 juvenile correctional facilities (2014), 3,163 local jails, and 76 Indian Country jails as well as in military prisons, immigration detention facilities, civil commitment centers, and prisons in the U.S. territories. I can only imagine how much more that number has grown.

These numbers do not include shelters, group homes, ranch/wilderness camps, or residential treatment centers.


We aren’t currently aware of a good source of data on the number of the facilities of the other types. Let me know if you see any.


Randall Lord is not going to jail for tax evasion or drug smuggling of any form. (Would you be shocked to know media gets things wrong?) He even contacted authorities when he thought wrong doing was happening. 


The Federal Government is imprisoning Randall for 46 months because they claim he was operating as a bank (money transmitter). 


He plead guilty to not having a license. When he first started this business he read the state laws regarding this issue and it was his understanding that no license was required as Bitcoin is not currency. After being charged with not having a license, his attorney convinced him that he had misread/misunderstood the law. Since he didnt have a license, he plead guilty to that charge. Later he contacted the Office of Financial Institutions and they told him he was correct, no license was required as Bitcoin was not ""currency"". Based on that, he attempted to withdraw his plea, but the judge said it would not be convenient for the court to do so.


He will appeal but can't until the asset forfeiture is complete which indefinitely postponed. He leaves soon. 😢

:)

True ""ELI5"" : Ethereum is like a hotel. Many people coming in and out. Now every hotel has a Security Guard, or bouncer. Not really an important part of the hotel, but they all have one. Now the Security Guard told Ethereum, when they were broke, he'd continue to guard their hotel in exchange for 11% of the hotel's worth each year, forever, like a tax.

* This amounted to $106 Million in 2016.

Today, if Ethereum hits a price of $500, the Security Guard wants $5 Billions, each and every year. The most any competing hotel owner, built after 2010, pays to their security guard is $225 Million. Even the oldest hotel, Bitcoin, only pays $1.6 Billion, based upon an agreement locked in place in 2009.

One person, Vitalik, is considering reducing the cost from $5 Billion to $3 Billion, at the $500 price. Another suggests reducing it to $1 Billion. By paying the Security guard $2 Billion less annually, then more money can be paid out to the owners.

* When Money Coming in is bigger than Money Going out = You get Value or Profit.

By reducing Money going out by $2 Billion, or $4 Billion, you add $2 to $4 Billion in value, annually, forever, at the $500 price point.

First, your statement reflects that you have done zero research on the topic, yet here you are making strong statements as if you are a expert on the topic. Doesn't that bother you even just a little?

Secondly, the effect is a long term detrimental effect upon centralization. If only some pools are using it it allows a unfair advantage by cheating the proof of work. The entire point of a proof of work is that you actually prove that you did the work. If you didn't actually do the work but you say you did the work and you cheat (such as falsely filling out your timecard at your work place), you are disadvantaging the network while advantaging yourself.

Bitcoin's largest problem is has and will always be mining centralization. The consolidation of too much power into individual hands is the destruction of the network. It allows one or multiple individuals to collude or to get hacked and some security breach in which they can then unleash catastrophic damage to the network. We've already seen what damage they could do to the developmental progress of Bitcoin over the last year-and-a-half, it's really mind-blowing to me that after watching the situation and fold beneath everyone's eyes that we can still pretend that what happened didn't happen.

This isn't fear-mongering this is the threat that Bitcoin has faced since the white paper was released. The only problem here is that you're lacking education on how this process works and on the game theory behind this industry. 

I see this mentality perpetuated a lot. It's this clear demonstration of not understanding how the system works and then putting that ignorance on display for everyone trying to reason out common sense scenarios that only makes sense if you don't understand how the system works.

And the greater problem is is that these problems are complex and it takes a lot of time and education to understand the system. You get enough people like you in a room(or subreddit) and the dunning-kruger effect kicks in and then you all think your experts on the subject and then you all spread out to your mini societies and start spreading that misinformation that you all think you're so sure of.

I like that you asked a question in the first sentence. I didn't like that you made a concrete statement As your finishing sentence. Next time just ask the open-ended question without making the assumption as all you're doing is putting your ignorance on display and then making a claim right afterwards as if we should trust your viewpoint.

If only overt asicboost was the possibility then the playing field would at least be even and it would not lead to more centralization effects. But that would still not take away the fact that it encourages detrimental Behavior to the network. It's not cool to mine empty blocks. I understand that miners can do this and that they have the power to do this and it's their choice but to go far as to encourage this behavior is to encourage negative actions upon the network.

Why would we want to encourage shooting ourselves in the foot? I think the only solution is to kill asicboost in every single form possible. If you want to keep the network healthy then you need to keep the network Fair, it is really as simple as that.

The entire point of Satoshi using sha-256 as the proof of work was to prevent Asics from being created. The whole reason from preventing Asics from being created was to not diminish the concept of one CPU equals one vote. Once you diminish the one CPU one vote then you have centralization effects. Once you have centralization effects then you lose your decentralized properties.

If you can accept that form of logic then you can certainly accept eliminating asicboost to keep the playing field level.

I do agree with you that the creation of Asics has been the most detrimental thing to bitcoin. But it's also something that in hindsight could not have been prevented so instead of crying over spilt milk we need to focus on the reality we face now and the solutions for it.",2017-07-25 00:04:43

He is a full-throated supporter of ObamaCare.

Now that you know his positions, let's look at his life.

His father and grandfather were both successful businessmen in his home town.  Oh hey, look at that, they also were both mayor of that same town.  And his uncle?  Yeah, his uncle was a state congressman and secretary of state.  He's been part of a political family since birth.  He's been in politics since 1982.  *35 fucking years* since this man has held a job in the private sector, and even those jobs were working for the long-established family business.  He has literally never had to sit down and interview for a job.  He's never had to put together a resume.  

He has held damn near every governmental office in WV.  House, senate, secretary of state, two terms as governor (when it seemed like there was a scandal every other week), and now senator.  We'll get to his senate seat momentarily, but first let's talk about his daughter.

His daughter went to WVU and got a Political Science bachelor's.  big surprise, huh?  But wait, there's more!  Right out of college she started working for a huge pharmaceutical firm called Mylan (remember that name).  While working there she started work on her MBA, but never finished it.  But that didn't stop the president of the college, a longtime friend of Joe Manchin and a politician himself, from just giving it to her anyway!  How convenient!  Oh, did I mention that he was also a lobbyist for Mylan?  Yep, that Mylan.  The one where Heather Manchin was employed.  Now let's fast forward to 2016 and find out what Heather's doing now.  Oh look, she's the fucking CEO of Mylan now!  What a coincidence that the daughter of the governor/secretary of state/US senator of WV managed to become CEO of a massive pharma company on the strength of her political science degree and an unearned MBA.  How lucky for her.  CEO of Mylan.  Wait a minute.  That name is familiar.  Mylan...Weren't they in the news recently? Oh that's right!  They're the ones that sell EpiPens and jacked up the price by 500%!  But wait, it's okay, because a few months later they also introduced a generic version of the EpiPen that's half that price (only triple the original price for those keeping track).  How generous of them to cut the price by 50%!  What a wonderful company that's run by the daughter of the former congressman/state senator/secretary of state/governor/current US senator from the company's home state.  I'm sure everything that happened to get us to this point was all completely above board.

But anyway, back to good old Joe Manchin, current hero of The_Donald because he's not toeing the Democrat party line.

Let's take a look at how he was first elected to US Senate.  You may be familiar with a senator named Robert Byrd.  [You know, this guy?](http://i.magaimg.net/img/5j5.jpg)  yeah, *that* Robert Byrd.  Well, he was the US senator from West Virginia for about 137 years.  In 2010, he finally kicked the bucket.  Guess who was governor at the time and got to appoint his successor?  Yep, our boy Joe Manchin.  Now, the Grand Kleagle's health had been failing for a while and the media had been asking Gov. Manchin about who he would appoint to the seat if he died and he continually said he wouldn't appoint himself, and he was true to his word when it happened.

No, instead of appointing himself he appointed a 35 year old legal aide from his office with no political experience and no name recognition who could just step aside when the election was held.  About a week after appointing this nobody to the vacant seat, he announced his intention to run for that seat in the general election.  Big surprise, huh?  What do you think his odds were as the single biggest name in WV politics and the sitting governor?  Yeah, he won easily.  Shocking, I know.  He also won re-election in 2012 as the incumbent.  Again, shocking.

Now, I will say again that I do respect the man's *positions.*  I do not, however, agree with *how* he holds them.  He tends to wait until he sees which way the wind is blowing, *then* makes his stand, rather than stand up early and be the one at the vanguard.  In short, he always plays it safe and never takes risky positions.

In other words, *he acts like a lifetime politician.*

Make no mistake, folks.  Regardless of whether you agree with his positions or not, the man is as establishment as they come.  He is a fucking *lifer* and his corruption runs deep, it just hasn't come to light because he hasn't been a national name for very long *and both sides want his vote*.

But don't fool yourself just because he's saying some things you like right now.  Joe Manchin doesn't want to MAGA.  He doesn't want to Drain the Swamp.

Joe Manchin *is the swamp.*

dkntswr,sjoelkatz,39,"We're thoroughly committed to making the public ledger as decentralized as we possibly can. We see absolutely no advantage whatsoever to centralization and an enormous number of disadvantages. Payment networks like bitcoin's and XRP's make enormous technical sacrifices so that they are capable of operating in a decentralized way. Making those sacrifices but not actually operating in a decentralized way is just a failure.

Bitcoin is currently experiencing that failure because well more than 50% of its mining power is in China. That means that censorship resistance is compromised as the government of China could pass rules about which UTXOs can be mined. I can't imagine anyone (except maybe the Chinese government) coherently arguing that that's a good thing and I think everyone should agree that we'd prefer jurisdictional distribution.

Why? It's not so much that we think the government of China is actually going to pass such laws. And it's not that it's rational to worry about such things on a daily basis. It's just that it's a thing, and it's not a good thing. It's something you have to trust that there is no inherent reason you should have to trust. And the more you have to trust, the more worry you should have about whether your trust is justified.

It also compromises neutrality. If you want to be the world's asset, even for just some limited use case(s), you want to be jurisdictionally neutral.

This is our goal for XRP. We built the technology to facilitate that goal. IMO, we did a better job than bitcoin did because PoW forces centralization. Someone will have the best price for power. Someone will have the best ASICs. Consensus does not have that centralizing influence.

Of course, consensus can also operate fully centralized if you want. But that's a shame because it adds more risk.

To be clear though, the risk is just censorship or a denial of service on the network. Ledgers and transactions must be valid and validity is checked by every server. Also, everything done in the consensus and validation processes is by signed message. So any malfeasance will be provable with cryptographic proof.",2017-07-25 04:13:23

dkowqpl,Merlin560,38,"Point and Figure Update

We broken through the bottom of our range last night.  We hit a low of the morning of $2,550.

So, we are in a negative breakdown; more specifically a double bottom breakdown which is the least dangerous formation.  We’ve already passed the low pole warning.  The column is 11 boxes low, so we can expect a bounce back up 5 or 6 boxes.

I guess if we are going to look for good news this morning it is that we’ve now retraced the high point of this formation 50% (and a little more.)  

And all mixed into this mess is the FUD about a hard fork, soft fork, China Coins and all of that stuff…  What does that mean for the price?  Uncertainty of course.   My guess is that we bounce around a little bit over the next week until this all settles out.

I go back to my statement from last week:  I don’t think the people “running” bitcoin are suicidal.  Therefore, they will work in their own interest.  I think we bounce around a little and then we get back to work.  And by work I mean, going up enough so that I do not have to work.

Here are the numbers:

Reversal happen at $2,600
Positive break out happens over $2,780.
The formation is 6 columns wide.  This is an average formation width.
The price remains 35 boxes over the trend line.  This is 10 boxes fewer than yesterday.

I think we bounce around this price range for a few days with more volatility around August 1st.  After that, if the world does not go crazy, we should see a steady climb again.

However, anyone can use the protocol and there are already companies completely separate from Factom that are developing applications to utilize it.  Over time, I expect to see an entire ecosystem spring up around the protocol.

Some may say the problem Factom is tackling isn't that sexy.  To that I say, TCP/IP isn't that sexy either.  But what has been created, over time, that utilizes TCP/IP is beyond sexy (most of the time ;) ).

dkqqnrl,supermari0,85,"There are a lot misunderstandings around what bitcoin is and isn't and what it can and can't be.

Bitcoin is **extremely** inefficient compared to stuff like VISA, MasterCard or Paypal. But there's a reason for that, which is decentralization or censorship resistance.

There is no controlling company behind it and it's currently virtually impossible for governments to completely shut it down or regulate it.

This is what sets it apart from any other payment network / monetary system. This is what makes bitcoin unique. This is what must be preserved at all cost.

As long as that goal is met, we want to onbard as many people as possible. But if at any point we have to decide between allowing more users / cheaper transactions and censorship resistance, the latter will always win.

It is true that Satoshi had no issues with full nodes requiring datacenters. But only with a very important prerequisite: the ability to detect fraud with a SPV client. This prerequisite has not yet been met and it looks like it's a hard problem.

People like Roger do not simply want bitcoin to be successful and change the world, which I believe it will, they want to decide the way it's going to do it on a technical level. But they're unqualified to make those decisions and incapable of admitting that and delegating the decisions to those who are. They want it so bad that they're willing to risk destroying it in the process. Thankfully, that's not so easy. But Roger and Jihan have set bitcoin's development back at least a year or two.

Thanks to the hard work of several top notch developers, bitcoin will perhaps indeed never hit a scale ceiling. But this involves another idea of Satoshi: payment channels. The basis for the Lightning Network. In this scenario, bitcoin's on chain transactions can be viewed more as a way to settle.",2017-07-26 22:11:25

Like clockwork for the past 7-8 years though, the ATH skirts back down and settles around the previous all time high almost every time without fail.

dkrgowj,ruvalm,113,"My thoughts on what we've been experiencing here lately:

**Hacks, ICOs, Laws and the Media**

* We've watched an [EEA 3 announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6o2oua/enterprise_ethereum_alliance_becomes_worlds/) being eclipsed by news of the [Parity Wallet Multisig Hack](https://blog.ethcore.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/). The reason why the market didn't react in a stronger fashion to the hack was precisely due to the fact that the EEA 3 announcement brought us some new good names, IMO.

* The timing of the release of the EEA 3 names seems strange at best. The fact that EEA decided to release its new members on a pretty sunny random day in the midst of the ongoing uncertainty in BTC-land has been igniting some thoughts of mine that there's something else that was left unsaid. Stupid and wishful thought but still worth my consideration.

* The day after the release of the new EEA names brought us the Parity Multisig Hack. Although I have to agree that it was easy to have avoided such an event through more attentive code reviews, I'm pretty astonished with the response that the developers, or 'white hats' if you prefer, have quickly produced. This could have been a DAO hack 2 event and it wasn't thanks to them. Big up for the quick reaction.

* From a reactive approach to a proactive approach in order to avoid repetition of such events, lies a very thin line. It's getting thinner and it will tend to disappear as practices improve (smart-contracts auditing, extensive code reviews, less pressure on delivering and more attention to hiring processes and technical training).

* Since the Parity Multisig Hack event, the party just kept getting crazier: [announcements of intention to Hard-Fork BTC](https://qz.com/1037971/bitcoin-cash-is-a-new-twist-in-the-hard-fork-debate-and-a-way-to-bet-on-the-outcome-of-the-cryptocurrencys-civil-war/) happened just after the BIP-91 lock-in, [SEC press releasing stuff about ICOs](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/sec-regulators-are-coming-after-icos/), [exchanges closing temporarily for the strangest of reasons](https://medium.com/crypt-bytes-tech/whats-up-with-btc-e-is-it-exit-scam-2de2952ec7d) and [old ghosts coming back to haunt crypto](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/26/16035702/btce-arrest-bitcoin-alexander-vinnik-mt-gox-theft-suspect). This is definitely [the 'wild west' of the Internet](https://steemit.com/wildwest/@aggroed/steemit-tips-crypto-is-the-wild-west-of-our-day-2-more-followers-to-1-000-top-125-account-by-followers), one that [may eventually become a paradise](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html).

* SEC press releasing stuff about ICOs made me wonder if this it was a good or bad thing. I think it's both but in different timescales: bad short-term because it'll constrain many ICOs in the near future and increase capital flight from crypto, good in the long-term because the ones that matter will still be done with the proper increase in accuracy and care.

* SEC press releasing stuff about ICOs made me sure of another thing: the law and regulation entities are following crypto very closely in all of its fronts. Scammers are more aware of that and will be thinking twice about doing their thing. Further moves to attempt to regulate the ecosystem are definitely on their roadmap. Doing it without compromising the required decentralization motto that we all care and rejoice with, will be a longer and harder battle in years to come.

* I still believe that ICOs are extremely important for the whole ecosystem. [They are a driver of expansion, experimentation and market liquidity](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-ethereum-blockchain-tokens-icos-why-should-anyone-care-890b868cec06). The shrinking of the crypto global market cap seems to be lagging in regards to this new incoming reality of funding businesses and value transfer through decentralized Internet platforms and services. Or then it's just and exclusively a reflex of what we're seeing in BTC land.


**A nightmare full of Bitcoins (some more valuable than others)**

* A Hard Fork will drive capital flight to many other 'alts', which should most likely be felt stronger in Ethereum and Litecoin.

* A Hard Fork seems a stupid decision in nature, but looking at the way things have been ongoing in the past years, it increasingly seems like an inevitable outcome at some point in the future.

* Mining cartels play the Bitcoin price (and apparently the rest of crypto) as much as they want. Crypto needs PoS. Some of the existing community consensus problems will be removed from the crypto landscape and new ones will surely arise. Electricity will be spared though.

* The 2nd of August. The 2nd of August. The 2nd of August. Ask the best traders around what's to come and nobody will be able to tell you. Ask the bear opinions around and they'll call $0.10 ETH in September. Ask the bull opinions around and they'll shout about $1000 ETH in October. Nobody knows and when it's like that, I prefer to think that the most likely scenario is that nothing really changes much, with volatility here and there on both directions.


**Dapps**

* There are plenty of Dapp releases scheduled for the next 2-3 months. When the first big release happens, the 'We're developing this massive idea' mentality that some teams carry will be shifting gradually to 'We may be losing our time-to-market value' mentality. I'm expecting the beginning of the Dapp revolution to start in the next 6-12 months.

* This implies two things: 1) a lot of value will be transferred from the commodity crypto assets to the applicational crypto tokens. 2) More smart-contracts in production will provide a bigger attack surface for all those willing to attack. Incremental increase in best practices and development patterns will follow.

* I'll be using a few of them and investing in very few. Augur and Maker are some of the very few.


**Metropolis and more releases**

* [Metropolis is coming](https://themerkle.com/top-3-ethereum-metropolis-changes-to-look-forward-to/). I'm expecting a swift release, hopefully without noticeable incidents in the middle. [All changes introduced](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/#accepted-eips-planned-for-adoption) will increase the likelihood of Ethereum approaching a market cap leadership in crypto land.

* The fact that [Vitalik plans, experiments, thinks and writes so much about Casper and PoS](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/casper4/papers/casper_economics_basic.pdf) tells me two things: 1) Metropolis testing and last improvements are doing fine. 2) PoS will be delivered and true scalability will be achieved.


**The Market and Price Movements**

* I'm expecting August to be boring for its most part. I'll be on holidays so it'd suit me, since I won't be trading on its movements.

* I expect a significant increase in price either during Devcon 3 or right before Metropolis.

* I don't expect ETH to go much lower than the current levels, but apparently that's not entirely up to ETH, is it ?

* The total mix up of signals in the charts that we're currently seeing call for increasing caution among trading strategies, especially with margin positions.


I expect you to argue against my statements politely. Do your best and have a great week.

He thinks that none of the currently existing tokens will outperform ETH on timeframes of 1 year+, but potential for significant price spikes coinciding with project milestones should make them worth trading anyway (just not as completely passive, long-term holds). He also feels that Bitcoin as an investment is basically pointless at this point because most other cryptos will outperform it in terms of returns; the only 'advantage' of Bitcoin is that it is likely to lose a smaller % during downtrends but that is irrelevant as you should be either looking to sell off your stack before going too far into a downtrend and rebuy at a lower price, or hold passively -- in either case, Bitcoin loses. If you are going to cash out completely without rebuying during a downtrend, you shouldn't be investing in crypto in the first place.

Consider if they went another way-- what about the next one? and the one after it? People could effectively flood them with them, a fork a week--  forks that contain malware backdoors that steal your Bitcoins, forks that will never have more than a few dozen users.  etc.

The difficulty to mine gets adjusted every 2 weeks to reflect that average, so that block creation maintains and average of every 10 minutes.

Bitcoin-Cash attempts to backdoor the integrity of the Bitcoin protocol by slipping this feature in with their fork.

At any point, they (Antpool) can stop mining altogether and watch the mining difficulty ~~~immediately decrease. ***Then,*** they can start mining again with an extremely lower difficulty, and find blocks every minute, or 30 seconds, collecting the block reward that comes with it.

The difficulty won't adjust back up when they start mining because it's set to wait 2016 blocks to readjust the difficulty upwards.

The only way POW blockchains can justify their **very expensive** existence is censorship resistant value transfer and sound digital money in highly hostile environments. In all other scenarios, Paypal's ~~blockchain~~ database works faster, cheaper, and is infinitely scalable. This is why both Taleb and Ari correctly identified that a cryptocurrency only offers lasting value if it can survive in extremely hostile environments. 

&gt;""In the short term the market is a popularity contest; in the long term it is a weighing machine."" - Warren Buffett

Right now, blockchains are in the popularity contest phase, where any scam can attract speculation. On a long enough timeline, only censorship resistant currencies that function as sound money will survive. It's possible that no POW blockchain is up to this task. With Ross Ulbricht in a cage for the rest of his life, and Alexandre Cazes dead in a Thai prison, how do you think Evan Duffield, Zooko Wilcox, and Vitalik Buterin will hold up when the pressure is applied?

Do you think a centralized bitcoin fork with mining, development, promotion and exchange controlled by a cartel in china is going to be the cockroach protocol that wins this war?

Eventually, fundamentals will come home to roost, and the weighting machine will determine the winner of the blockchain war... if there are any survivors.",2017-07-28 04:30:42

dkud5la,gizram84,54,"&gt; Since the signature data in SegWitCoin is deleted

They aren't deleted.  They can be pruned.  This is optional.  So your entire premise starts off with a lie.

&gt; There is no way to track ownership.

Yes there is.  Through the chain of outputs referencing previous transactions.  Just because you choose to prune the signatures doesn't mean the history of the txs are gone.  Besides you'd reject a bad signature right away, so a tx would never be in the blockchain if it were invalid.  This whole post is laughable.

&gt; This means the Bitcoin consensus rules for a finite 21 million bitcoins is threatened by the potential introduction of miner induced fraudulent inflation. 

Any miner who tried something like this would hard fork themselves off the network.  What you're talking about is incompatible with consensus rules.  This would be a hard fork to implement.  So it never affects the bitcoin chain.

dksq8tw,SazzeTF,52,"Alright I'll try again:

* Download Tor Browser
* Start Tor
* Find adress to the site you intend to buy from on the regular internet. For me that would be flugsvamp, a Swedish vendor. So I'd google ""flugsvamp adress"" and find this: http://flugsvamp72rajmk.onion
* Enter above mentioned adress in Tor
* Register your account, just like any account on any site really. Just make sure it's something incoherent and not linked to your other usernames 

* Register account on let say, localbitcoins. Easy process. 

Buying is a little bit more difficult on localbitcoins because the transactions can be spooky because you're sending your own money first. As a Swede I can use Swish, which is an app similar to paypal, but the banks actually approve it. Check if your country has similar payment methods, or just use paypal.

* If you've bought bitcoins from a user with good reputation, the seller will release the bitcoins as soon as he gets your payment (they generally sit in escrow).

* So now you've got bitcoins on your localbitcoins account. The next step would be to tumble; Tumbling is basically laundering. Bitcoins, just as regular money, have serial numbers. Through tumbling, you'd be switching bills basically. Put in a bitcoin with the serial number 999 in the tumbler, and get a new one with the serial code 565. This is in order for your transaction not to be traced by anyone. Though, tumbling is not a must, but it's prefered. 

Note though: In order to tumble, you must register an account on any website that tumbles bitcoins. When I do this, I always make up a new spoof email to register

* If you've chosen to tumble your bitcoins, they'll be sitting on the site that you've tumbled them on. When they arrive and are available (tumbling may take up to a few hours, but generally only takes a few minutes), you hop onto the website you're buying from (e.g. flugsvamp) and find the address you will be sending your bitcoins to (generally just called a wallet). These addresses look something like this: 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2

* So then you log into the tumbling website, go to transactions, find ""send bitcoins"", paste the above mentioned adress into the address field and hit send. Your bitcoins will then arrive at flugsvamp in a few minutes, but this might take up to a few hours as well. 

* Alright cool, now we've got our bitcoins on the site we intend to buy from. This is just as any online shopping, so you just find what you want, and press buy. 

* Now it's time for PGP. This is just a program, available to download for free on the regular internet. Download it and start. 

* After you've pressed ""buy"", [this](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla8.gif) will probably pop up. The highlighted text is the PGP key the seller uses, which you also will use to encrypt your name and adress. Simply click on ""Import keys"" in the PGP-program and press ""From clipboard"" and the seller will pop up to the [right](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla10.gif)

* Next step is to write down your adress, and name. Then hit ""Encrypt"" and a bunch of [gibberish](https://www.flugwiki.se/filer/Handla11.gif) will pop up. Copy that gibberish, and paste into the order.

dktvyrn,captaincryptoshow,52,"You are going to get the Cliff's notes:  
- Not a technical question, but who's Craig Wright? **He is some cryptographer that claimed he was Satoshi at one point. Most people believe that was a lie. Now he is pushing for bigger block sizes and arguing against SegWit. He gave a speech at ""Beyond Bitcoin"" conference a few weeks ago where he used very colorful language to push for bigger block sizes. I believe he is Australian (based on his accent).**  

- What is SegWit? **It is a proposed feature (that is now going to be implemented) that helps reduce the data size of Bitcoin transactions, so that more transactions can fit in per block. Essentially it stores the signature-related data outside of the blockchain.**  

- What does 80% refer to in the context of SegWit? **That usually refers to signaling, meaning that miners or nodes can show whether or not they support SegWit (or any other proposal).  BIP91 (which I believe proposes SegWit implementation and an increase in block size to 2MB had to reach 80% for a while and it did).**  

- I've heard that there was a compromise. Between who? And why?  **Big-block supporters compromised by accepting only an increase to 2MB (instead of unlimited / dynamic sizing based on the market), while small-blockers accepted the increase (which they didn't want). Also the big-blockers who oppose SegWit decided to accept its implementation, except for those forking off into Bitcoin Cash (BCC)**  

- What's SegWitx2? **I believe it means SegWit + 2MB block size increase.**  

- What's BIP 91? BIP 148? **I believe BIP 91 was the formal name for the SegWit2x proposal. I believe BIP148 was going to be a soft-fork that would have some nodes rejecting any blocks that do not support SegWit**  

- What's Lightning? **Lightning network is a proposed feature that can handle off-chain transactions to prevent too many transactions on the blockchain. Some argue it's a great idea while others (big-block supporters) often argue that it will lead to centralization.**  

- There's going to be a hard fork on Aug 1st. Why???  **Because some people decided that they do not like SegWit.**  

- What will the difference between the two be? **BCC, which will likely be the smaller fork, will not have SegWit implemented, and will likely push for on-chain scaling (no lightning network, but would likely have bigger blocks).**  

- What's Bitcoin Cash? **It is what will likely be a new currency that has forked away from BTC (see question before).**  

- Who decided that there will be a fork? Who's pushing for it? **Technically anyone can fork a currency, you just likely won't get many miners, users, or support from exchanges, etc if you don't provide enough added value compared to BTC.**  

- Are most users for/against one side of the fork, or will we not know until after it happens?  **My guess is that BCC will have significantly less support than BTC. This guess is based on the futures for BCC being traded at ~$500 vs BTC trading at ~$2600**    

- Are SegWit and the fork related, or do they just happen to be happening at around the same time?  **Yes they are absolutely related. The main technical difference between BTC and BCC on August 1st will be that one has SegWit and the other does not.**",2017-07-28 14:24:32

(In that previous thread, you sounded like ""a dev having a bad day"" - overwhelmed with all the additional programming necessary to handle some ""breaking changes"" in the the code - so it was normal for a dev to get frustrated in that kind of situation.)

---

You also mentioned this:

&gt; the inferior security of Segwit. Do I really want to keep value in such an inferior security model?

That's an important point!

A dev for Bitcrust has a really interesting post about this recently, which should be getting more attention:

&gt; BITCRUST 2017-07-03: ""The dangerously shifted incentives of SegWit: Peter Rizun pointed out a flaw in SegWit (discussed by Peter Todd) that makes it unacceptably dangerous. A txn spending a SegWit output will be less safe than a txn spending a non-SegWit output, and therefore will be less valuable.""

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6q149z/bitcrust_20170703_the_dangerously_shifted/

Ultimately, we want to make sure we are using the best technology - which continues to maintain Bitcoin's solid security and incentives.

Unfortunately - as more and more people are starting to discover, after years of propaganda from a certain ""incumbent"" dev team - that particular dev team made some serious mistakes in their design of SegWit. 

Now they're in a difficult position (probably partly due to their massive fiat funding from legacy financial institutions, and their lack of communication with actual users due to their reliance on censored forums), where they can't admit the mistakes they've made with SegWit - so they're moving forward with it, _despite_ the fact that several devs now have exposed what you just said:

&gt; the inferior security of Segwit. Do I really want to keep value in such an inferior security model?

So, long-term, Bitcoin Cash will be better than ""SegWit Coin"" in every way: 

- Bitcoin Cash will immediately have bigger blocks, for lower fees and faster transactions (but still plenty of fees ""in the aggregate"" for miners) 

- Over time, SegWit Coin's security will degrade, due to the serious errors which some careless, overconfident (overpaid) devs introduced into its security and incentives, as described in this very important post from a Bitcrust dev:

&gt; **The dangerously shifted incentives of SegWit**

https://bitcrust.org/blog-incentive-shift-segwit

So, unfortunately there is a bit of ""extra work"" involved now, in adding strong replay protection in order to keep the Bitcoin Cash chain truly separate from the SegWit Coin chain.

But this extra work is necessary - and it will be well worth it in the long-term, since we will be able to use Bitcoin Cash to continue enjoying Bitcoin's existing excellent security and incentives, unaffected by the errors of SegWit.

dku8m9q,pinastri,39,"Since everyone is talking about bitcoin/bitcoin cash on an Ethereum sub, ill pitch in as well. I've been following this fork and reading up a lot on bitcoin forums and such, and this is the strategy you should take (unless you just want to hold ETH, then you will be fine):

First of all, the time to get into the bitcoin pump from an ETH holder standpoint is almost done. If you wanted to profit off of it, you should have done so when the ratio was still above 0.08. From here on out, it is going to be diminishing returns.

Secondly, if you want to profit off of bitcoin cash, do not spend $2800 on BTC to get 1 BTCC. What you should do is wait for BTCC to dump to double digits, or a very low dollar amount. Then spend the same $2800 to get MANY BTCCs. When the fork happens (august 1st), it will be VERY cheap.

The date to watch out for is November. Why is it important? Because that is when the 2x part of Segwit2x will either be activated or not (from what I have read, BTC will probably not be getting bigger blocks). If BTC does not get bigger blocks in November, then all the big blockers (with massive amounts of BTC WILL jump ship to BTCC). A lot of miners who support big blocks (and ""Satoshis vision"") will also jump ship to BTCC. BTCC will PUMP then. All the chinese miners, Roger Ver of bitcoin.com, and Jihan have a lot of mining power, and they also have a lot of BTC. They will HOLD the ""free BTCC"" they get. They will PUMP BTCC once BTC doesnt have a block increase.

There isn't a crypto out there with a better development team and vision. No other crypto has as many developers and major companies around the world working on improving the platform and building applications on top of it. Bitcoin might be finally getting some of the issues with scaling worked out, but then what comes next? It still lacks the potential that Ethereum has. Don't get me wrong, I like Bitcoin, but the technology isn't nearly as exciting to me as Ethereum. 

This trend will pass. As long as the market cap of Ethereum is less than Bitcoin, the I firmly believe that Ethereum is still undervalued. We've had a great year so far, but the market definitely got a little ahead of itself. There was a lot of new money jumping into the crypto markets this year. Greedy, new, dumb money. These people know very little about what they were investing in, and really have no interest in learning more about it. They FOMOd in expecting to get rich quick, throwing their money at every shitcoin and ICO that had some decent advertising. 

Now that the market is cooled off the greedy dumb money people are losing interest and cutting their losses, or trading their portfolio for what is hyped up for the time being - Bitcoin. I really have no other explanation for why Bitcoin is pumping this much before a hardfork. Obviously there is a lot of whale manipulation involved, but it also seems pretty obvious to me that the dumb greedy money just piles onto whatever is most hyped up at the moment. In the beginning of the year this was Ethereum. 

The hype storm surrounding the fork wont last forever though, and then what does Bitcoin have going for it? Segwit activation? Speeding up transactions is good, but what else can it do? And what comes after that? Nothing really. Probably more infighting between the Bitcoin communities (which will be even more divided after this fork.) 

Ethereum has so much more in store for the future, but the dumb money doesn't even have a clue about that yet. They don't care about fundamentals, development roadmaps, or potential applications. All they do is look at the price trends and jump on and off bandwagons. And since the price of Ethereum has been going down for a month, they're looking for somewhere else to move their money. The good news is that this has little to no impact on the actual development of Ethereum and dapps. Smart money will follow development. And eventually the dumb money will roll back around to jump on the bandwagon again.

dkvo22n,Amichateur,38,"&gt;If your exchange isn't giving you your BCC/BCH, it might be because they don't have your BTC. Discuss.

No. You may also argue the opposite:

If an exchange DOES give you BCC (ex. **Kraken**), its customers are likely to keep their bitcoins on the exchange, have no increased incentive to withdraw their bitcoins before 1 Aug. This is exactly what exchanges need if they run on fractional reserves - they must prevent a ""bank run"" by all means. If running on fractional BTC reserves worked, running on fractional BCC reserves will work just as well.

If an exchange does NOT give you BCC, much more of their customers will withdraw their bitcoins within a short time, all at once, before and over 31 Jul/1 Aug. This is exactly what you'd call a bankrun. Such ""bank run"" would be even more likely if the exchanges openly inform their customes well in advance by email and recommend to withdraw their bitcoin if they want BCC (ex. **Bitstamp**). Clearly, an exchange running on fractional reserves wouldn't do that.

Conclusion: **An exchange expressively  NOT supporting BCC is LESS likely to run on fractional reserves.**",2017-07-29 17:20:45
dkvufeu,ruvalm,37,"My thoughts on the next 3-4 days (July 29th - Aug 2nd):

* 1) I'll be avoiding margin trading. It's a rule of mine in the next few days that will start now (closed my last positions a couple of hours ago).

* 2) I won't be buying back my trading stack of ETH nor will I be staying till the HF in BTC. Volatility will most likely be high from Sunday night onwards and volume will increase.

* 3) Exchanges control what you trade and how you trade it. If a new ETHBCH pair becomes available and margin trading is activated - this won't be happening in the next 3-4 days but most likely will later - expect another channel of downward pressure.

* 4) I'm expecting a bounce near the previous low. Its strength will determine if it can be considered a double bottom or not. I'm not a big fan on double bottoms to be honest, I don't give them as much attention as some do, but at this point they may serve as a psychological turning point of the current mess that Bitcoin has placed all crypto in.

* 5) If you're a hodler, don't sweat what's coming. Go on holiday and come back a couple of weeks to a month later. If you're going to trade this, all the best luck.

I do not change my long-term position towards Ethereum. I'm extremely bullish on the technology, the adoption, the fulfillment of the defined roadmap and on the expansion of the ecosystem.

You don't need to be a genius to understand why I'm bullish. If you've been here just 6 to 9 months ago and remember how the Ethereum ecosystem looked like back then and compare it with what it looks like now, it's reason enough for you to understand what I'm trying to say.

Meanwhile, u/nullc seems to be afraid to attempt to actually respond to the points raised by Peter Rizun in his presentation:

1. SegWit coins have a different definition than bitcoins, which gives them different properties.

2. Unlike with bitcoins, [with SegWit coins] miners can update their UTXO sets _without_ witnessing the previous owners' digital signatures.

3. The previous owners' digital signatures have significantly less value to a miner for SegWit coins than for bitcoins - because miners do no require them [the digital signatures] in order to claim fees [when mining SegWit bitcoins].

4. Although a stable Nash equilibrium exists where all miners witness the previous owners  for bitcoins, one [such a Nash equilibrium] does _not_ exist for SegWit coins.

5. SegWit coins have a weaker security model than bitcoins.

---

In fact, u/nullc (inadvertently?) _confirmed_ everything Peter Rizun said, when he admitted (as quoted above in the OP) that no solution for this has been implemented yet.

So... Greg has admitted that he's been trying - for 18 months! - to deploy SegWit, knowing this whole time that it enables the ""SegWit validationless mining"" attack vector discovered by Peter Todd - **and yet Greg did nothing to attempt to prevent this attack vector** - basically saying that he have a solution in your head, but he can't be bothered to implement it until _after_ disaster strikes.

So... what's Greg's strategy been here this whole time? ""Security through obscurity"" - hoping people wouldn't discover this attack vector?

It's just so sad that Greg has been prepared to jeopardize a ledger holding tens of billions of dollars in investors' coins - apparently because he's such a sleazebag that he'd rather shit-post weasel-words in defense of his corruption and incompetence, rather than openly discussing _and fixing_ the problems which several devs (not only Peter Rizun - but also Peter Todd, and Tomas van der Wamsen of Bitcrust) have exposed in SegWit.

If u/nullc had a shred of honesty and decency, he wouldn't be talking about Peter Rizun's job title or business partners here - which are entirely irrelevant to this SegWit attack vector.

Notice how u/nullc carefully avoids actually talking about _fixing the goddamn attack vector which Peter Todd and Peter Rizun and Tomas van der Wamsen have all confirmed_. Instead, like a typical toxic bully, he tries to deflect - talking about irrelevancies like Peter Rizun's job title and business partners. And then he has the nerve to call _other_ people unprofessional? 

Remember, u/nullc - the CTO of Blockstream - is desperately trying to deflect attention away from a deadly attack vector caused by the crappy code which _he_ has been trying to force on everyone for years now - and he has the _nerve_ to call someone ""unprofessional"" for merely exposing this deadly attack vector in his code. Really?!?

Let's try to stay on-topic here - and try to be ""professional"".

Three major devs have exposed a deadly attack vector which would be enabled by SegWit - enabling miners to add invalid transactions to the chain, without being noticed. 

Are you going to _address the fucking problem u/nullc_ - or are you going to try to deflect and blather this irrelevant nonsense questioning Peter Rizun's job title and business associates.

It's better if we fix that in advance of course, but at worst we'll get a temporary problem, assuming the political environment is sane; if the political environment isn't sane, then this issue is likely overshadowed by even greater threats.

How to redeem my BCC?
---------------------

BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.

Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.",2017-07-31 21:59:58

Bitcoin (cash) will be able to process more tx/s within less than a day, even with a hash rate as low as 5%, because a single 8 MB block per hours can already hold more transactions than 6 separate 1 MB block per hour.

Just look at how r/bitcoin treats Gavin, Mike, and Jeff.  All of them are now demonized and attacked--and they are the guys who built bitcoin!

It showed us that we weren't quite ready for the limelight yet, and that's fine. GDAX is faster and too many people are getting burned from ICOs for them to continue being honey pots. And we grew. 

It also showed the world how bitcoin performs as a world currency, slow and inefficient. The futuristic promise of bitcoin was dropping, retailers stopped taking it, operating costs exceeding holding costs. The rally, for bitcoin ended up triggering a set of events that is causing it to buckle from the inside out. 

I said it before but the flash crash solidified it. Things are gonna suck until Aug 1, and while we've outlined the possibilities over and over again, nobody knows what the fuck is in store. 

HOWEVER, just because you have people dumping crypto for fiat in the short term I guarantee you they're not out yet.

dkyjt28,jessquit,33,"You forgot how Segwit instantly cuts the network's capacity in half.

Since I know I'll get attacked again for pointing this out, I'll offer a terse explanation.

A while back some quality research was done and it was determined at that time that the [network could safely upgrade to 4MB payloads](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4cqbs8/cornell_study_recommends_4mb_blocksize_for_bitcoin). For the sake of argument let's assume that's still the case.

That means we can safely upgrade to SW which permits payloads up to 4MB, but not SW2X because it permits payloads up to 8MB. Consensus will reject this as too risky: the whole point of the limit is to prevent the risk of ""too big"" blocks.

We could also upgrade to a 4MB block size limit without Segwit.

With Segwit we expect to see *up to* ~1.7-2MB payloads under normal use.  It's possible to build larger Segwit payloads, but we would only expect to see these in unusual ""attack"" situations.  Under normal use, Segwit maxes out at around a 1.7-2x throughput bump, or up to ~6 tps.

Without Segwit we can expect to see *up to* 4MB payloads under normal use, or up to ~12 tps.

So for a given safe network upgrade limit, say 4MB, the network can get 6 tps with Segwit or 12 tps of capacity without Segwit.

They call that ""scaling?""

O_o that isn't scaling that's a poison pill!

Another way to look at it is that a 2MB *nonsegwit* payload gives you up to 2MB of expected capacity with a max 2MB attack block footprint; with Segwit, you get up to 2MB of expected capacity with a max 4MB attack block footprint.

Segwit is anti-onchain-scaling. It literally moves us backward.

Edit: I rounded up the Segwit numbers just to give it all of the benefit of doubt.

There are also several other exchanges offering either one or both of these services to their users. Do remember that most exchanges will be halting trading or deposits/withdraws before and after the hard fork to minimize the risk of replay attacks happening on the new Bitcoin Cash chain.
