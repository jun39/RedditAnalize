There are a great number of Bitcoins that are lost; due to loss of private keys, but that number is uknowable; and as Bitcoins price increases those lost keys may be recovered through expensive recovery operations that only make sense at an extremely high price of Bitcoin.

For instance someone threw out a harddrive with 10,000 BTC or so on it. It is at a landfill somewhere. It is worth about 10M USD now; probably not worth going through the whole landfill for it. But if BTC reaches 1M; that HDD will be worth $10Billion and excavating an old landfill may be profitable at that point.",2017-02-01 23:45:15
dd6ot8b,robbak,50,"Because B.U. does allow the miners and those running nodes to grow the blocksize, it does mean that the work of a node will grow somewhat faster than if the world sticks with core and its permanently restricted blocksize. However, this is known, and developers are actively looking for changes they can make to reduce the node's workloads.

However, as the blocksize is worked out based on what miners and nodes want to accept, based on messages and behavior of both miners and nodes, the block size should remain at levels that the network and almost all nodes can handle, so should not centralize bitcoin.

One should also consider how having ever increasing fees will push users off the decentralized network and onto centralized, private services.",2017-02-01 20:33:17

dd5um9m,chalbersma,33,"Yes. The initial hard fork from a 32MB limit to a 1MB blocksize limit additionally there was a bug in earlier clients that allowed unlimitd coin creation. Stopping that was a hard fork also. 

And after Satoshi we had the BIP-50 hardfork (bug) and (most importantly) we practised a blocksize increase with the 500kb soft limit upgrade. We use to have an effective limit of 500kb on bitcoin block sizes.

dd5dj89,Arbitrage84,29,"Check out what Gemini is doing: 

&gt;We are thrilled to announce that Gemini, the next generation digital asset exchange, is now offering zero-confirmation pre-credited Bitcoin deposits, so you can keep trading even when the Bitcoin network is clogged with transactions.

&gt;Here’s how it works:

&gt;Deposit Bitcoin into your Gemini account as normal.

&gt;If we determine your transaction is eligible, we’ll pre-credit the amount of your deposit and make it available for trading immediately.  About two out of three deposits are eligible for pre-crediting.

&gt;Once your deposit reaches its required three network confirmations, you’ll be able to withdraw the amount of your deposit or any USD or ETH purchased with your deposit.

&gt;You can read more about this exciting new feature on our blog.

&gt;Happy trading!

&gt;Onward and upward,

&gt;Team Gemini

Very nice for taking advantage of price discrepancies between exchanges, although only beneficial when Gemini is overbought.",2017-02-01 01:40:19

dd5gayl,jtoomim,24,"&gt; It's an opensecret that Jihan is using the smaller puppets pools to signal BU

That's an interesting rumor. I'll make sure to keep it a secret from the Illuminati. It's an open secret that the Illuminati want to make sure that they don't have any competition when it comes to monopolies on financial systems, and would crush Bitcoin if they knew how powerful Jihan's pet project was becoming.

But seriously, there's another explanation for why miners are voting for Unlimited. Maybe they're doing it *of their own accord*. Maybe *some people other than Jihan* actually prefer Unlimited, and are willing to put up their own hashrate in favor of it.

*Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate.* Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.

1) 33 percent of your investments are in a fairly speculative lithium stocks, and 10 percent is in Lego. Really?

2) I don't know why you're so keen on purchasing a property when you've only got a 20% deposit (excluding additional costs) for a $450k property. What happens if interest rates go to 6 percent and/or the property is unfilled by tenants for two months?

3) so you love travel, you really want to travel, but you're concerned because you're not sure which property option to go for? How about option 3, which is not getting a mortgage because you're still in uni and neither of you even have real jobs?

dd5cy6g,jtoomim,22,"The thing I dislike about your assertion is that it is not disprovable. 

It seems that you're asserting that there is a special channel by which miners can get substantial volume discounts (beyond the 1.5% listed on their website) that only exists for miners who support Bitcoin Unlimited. 

Without access to Bitmain's full financial or production records, it is impossible to prove the absence of such a channel -- we'd need to document every sale that Bitmain made, and prove that it went through the existing non-politicized channels. However, if it actually existed, it should be straightforward to prove the existence of such a channel -- we would just need one instance of someone who bought Antminers from Bitmain and who got a discount or access to greater availability because of their politics. Can you provide that?

I also find it interesting that you're alleging that Bitmain is favoring Bitcoin Unlimited buyers when both of Bitmain's own pools, Antpool and BTC.com, are mining with Bitcoin Core.",2017-02-01 01:29:18
dd5d9j6,Bitcoin-FTW,22,"I really think it's noise. I think the market realizes now that scaling is not the emergency some people thought it was. 50% or more miners just simply don't give a shit. The price keeps going up so why would they?

3tps, 6tps, 12tps, 24tps, 48tps..... take your pick, it's the same fuckin shit: Not enough. Doing a contentious hardfork to kick the can down the road is retarded. Anything under thousands of tps will not be enough for global adoption, and clearly there are significant drawbacks to having blocks big enough to support thousands of transactions on chain. 

Luckily, global adoption is still miles and miles away. We are in the stage of proving bitcoin's utility as a store of value. Then merchants will want to actually hold bitcoins, then paying for shit with bitcoin won't be this absurdly stupid process of ""I buy bitcoins with fiat (pay a fee for this), I send you bitcoins (pay a fee), merchant immediately sells those bitcoins for fiat (pay a fee), and then the purchase is finally complete. 

Furthermore, it's becoming more and more clear that not all bitcoin transactions need to be on chain. In fact, in a customer to merchant transaction, it's quite ideal that the transaction is off chain. Then you don't have to worry about waiting around for a confirmation. ",2017-02-01 01:35:19

There are things that would still be good to buy: solar panels, an electric vehicle, tourist dollars in countries with the highest [democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).

Things you should *stop* spending money on: bars, restaurants, fossil fuels (see above), any superfluous items, unnecessary domestic trips. 

Donate the money you save to the ACLU (It's great that they just collected ~400% of annual collections in one weekend after the refugee ban). Or other humanitarian, environmental, or scientific organizations (I personally support biogerontology research through SENS Foundation). 

As someone who's had cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for a few years I'd say that's a great form of financial protest. All cryptocurrencies are currently worth [$18.55 billion](http://coincap.io/) and growing, with bitcoin alone worth $16 billion at $988 each.

The issues here are fundamental -- there is not a scaling solution for bitcoin, much less one that everyone would be happy with. The requirements and acceptable limits for people on all sides of the debate do not have an overlapping area of acceptable solutions. On one side you have growth maximalists who want every transaction on the chain, at least for the foreseeable future and will require regular doublings of the block size as limits are hit. On the other extreme you have the decentralization maximalists that see room for no more than a constant factor increase and want blocks to be full so that settlement-layer technology (payment channels and fee markets) can be tested.

We just broke $1,000 again.  This time feels different, at least to me.  The climb has been slow and steady (and in the world of Bitcoin, a couple of weeks to move up a bunch is pretty slow.)

But, it is that time again.  You know it.  You love it.  Its the long pole warning.  We’ve gotten ahead of ourselves again.  So, we are now four boxes over the breakout level.  That means that every box we go up without a small pull back, the more dangerous it is.

This does not mean its time to sell.  It means that you should be looking for the exit in the theater.  No one is shouting “fire.”  I am just thinking about what I would do if this turned on us.

Normally, the price has to reverse.  That would be a drop back to the 970 level.  Our column is 12 boxes high.  A long pole usually drops about half way down the pole, back to the 940 range. 

And…the entire range has the ability to drop down to $880 without breaking down, and even further down into the $720 range to change the trend.  If that doesn’t make you sleep well at night, nothing will.

I am optimistic that we will get to the $1040/7155 range.  We are at the old resistance point, but getting through to the $1020/7107 range should be fairly easy.

We won't go in the details, but there are thousands of ways to make money by investing Bitcoin online.

Banks do the same: they invest your money, but make sure that every customer has full access to their funds anytime. That's how they make money, and that's how we make money.

By artificially limiting Bitcoin itself to scaling off-chain, Blockstream guarantees itself relevancy going forward, for enterprise use cases in addition to just plain *scaling Bitcoin*.

But with on-chain scaling, *any* existing software development firm with experience in designing high-scalability web services could render those key services for scaling Bitcoin.

On-chain scaling is [well-understood](https://wiki.hpc.wvu.edu), [in government](http://scs.lbl.gov/), in [academia](https://hpcc.stanford.edu/) and in industry. It is how Satoshi Nakamoto *wanted* to scale Bitcoin to mainstream success, and we already have [numerous](https://blockstack.com/) [examples](https://counterparty.io) of mainnet innovations which scale outside of the BC knowledge worker oligopoly.

dd9m5gx,nullc,40,"The best available research right now suggested an _upper_ bound of 4MB.  This figure was considering only a subset of concerns, in particular it ignored economic impacts, long term sustainability, and impacts on synchronization time.  That figure also left no safety margin for DOS attacks or attacks by powerful actors.

Segwith proposed 2MB worth of capacity-- making it broadly attractive to people by packing in scalablity improvements to significantly offset the costs and improve some of the externalities in the system (in particular UTXO bloat). It also gives basically the same capacity as the change the hardfork proponents were proposing.

And now the bar has been moved. 2MB was fine for classic and now it's 8MB-- the defenses against UTXO bloat totally flushed. Avoidance of a network split flushed. Broad support from technical folks flushed.  And for what-- are we any more ""moon"" ready with 14 tx/s than 7tx/s?  

No. The only thing gained it is that the it's extra sure to temporarily wreak the fee behavior, putting us back in a long term unsustainable mode of operation where the network is constantly flooded with spam and people get irritated when higher load periods cause them to pay fees again.

For many the purpose was _never_ to get more capacity, the purpose was only to divide Bitcoin: Nothing could make that more clear than their aggressive attacks on a proposal to achieve the capacity they asked for but also do it with objectively less risk.  If the concern were earnest then they'd be eager to take the increase we can all agree on, then we'd be in a better position to argue from its success that further increases wouldn't cause harm. (Here I am not speaking about you, to be clear)

If Bitcoin is going to have its rules liberally rewritten at the whim of politics and without regard to any attempt at science-- throwing out blocksizes _multiple times larger_ than we have any reason to believe is safe-- by whomever can stage the most aggressive disinformation campaign then it won't be worth anything in the long run.  That isn't something I'll stand for. Ultimately, this kind of recklessness is only having the effect of hardening people towards the view of no hardforks ever-- Bitcoin does, after all, work pretty darn well as it already is; something I think is regrettable but preferable to recklessly hardforking or doing so in response to coersive attacks. 

Continually harping on this stuff is terrible. It exhausts everyone who has worked so hard to keep the system going and growing, and retards the development of improvements (like signature aggregation) that will improve scalability without risking the system. If you want to argue for it or work towards that-- that is your choice-- but please don't harass other people to support such initiatives with their own efforts.

Bigger blocks first, and if the ecosystem decides to fix malleability with SegWit, FlexTrans or whatever - or alternatively decides against it (or, my preference: takes a longer, harder, more honest, less propagandized look at the proposed changes, such as 'fixing' malleability in terms of ecosystem impact, long-term miner income etc.) ... then that is completely separate from fixing the crippling on-chain bottleneck.

**Separate issues.**

Really. I don't even know what they want to talk about while keeping a straight face.

And it should also be noted that we're dealing with folks such as Luke, Theymos, Greg, Adam and a bunch of affiliated folks here who have not been at all able to compromise, be reasonable and some of them not even nice-mannered. You don't compromise with ill-intended people.

The idea of compromise is laughable in face of the bullshit that went on with rBitcoin, the ML, the IRC, and the absolute, unbearable arrogance of the folks involved.

Years ago, when obviously illegal activities that Bitcoin enabled were pointed out, these people would retort with claims that Bitcoin was invented to ""get around the system"", or to ""take down the system"", and it was bringing power back to the average Joe, letting everyone be responsible for their own finances. Yet then these same people, when they sniff something that might fall afoul of US Security regulations, aren't cheering on the average Joe who is ""getting around the system"" and being responsible for his/her own finances and who has become empowered to be a form of investor when otherwise they couldn't... these same people are yelling about how this illegal activity must be stopped.

3/ Hard forks are incredibly problematic unless they have *overwhelming* consensus. We don't have that on block size.

4/ The ETH case is different, qualitatively, in that ETH was always intended as a much more experimental network than BTC. They ditched immutability entirely on the main chain but while it was a big problem, it wasn't the end of their network. I think it might be close to death for bitcoin, whose value is entirely predicated on immutability and safety of transfers.

Recently BU encountered a bug, which was quickly fixed and a patch/upgrade was released. You can read the incident report [here](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buir-2017-01-29-statement-regarding-excessive-block-by-bitcoin-unlimited-software-29-jan-2017.1790/)

Bitcoin ""core""  has also encountered a similar bug in the past, you can read about it [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2013-03-11-chain-fork) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki).  This one had much bigger consequences. The 0.8 client version chain was 13 blocks longer than 0.7 client version before miners switched back to running 0.7.

The result of this was that later that year in August, Bitcoin went through a ""Hard fork"". 

&gt; On 16 August, 2013 block 252,451 (0x0000000000000024b58eeb1134432f00497a6a860412996e7a260f47126eed07) was accepted by the main network, forking unpatched nodes off the network.

ddbpsl6,Cryptoconomy,48,"The combination of acceptance depth and nodes setting blocksize gates causes a huge orphaning problem every time there is any adjustment in blocksize.  If I set my gate with a large minority's (call it 30%) to say 5 blocks and someone mines a block bigger than my gate, then there are immediately two chains.  Then for the next 5 blocks the chains diverge and people receive confirmations that they don't realize aren't reliable.  Then if other nodes don't shift, or if miners agree on the opposite direction, those 5 blocks are dropped.  So suddenly a transaction with 5 confirmations is back in the mempool and we have a backlog for everything left on the smaller chain.  

Second, since miners broadcast their excessive blocksize and a split happens any time one is in dispute.  A miner with as little as 1% of the mining power can create a block based on the median excessive blocksize and force the network into this fork/orphan situation with ease.  Meaning an attacker can leave the entire network in a constant state of forking and confusion with barely any investment.  The only defense is for all nodes and miners to simply bend to the will of the majority so there is ""consensus"" to the largest miners.  Meaning the Acceptance Depth is a fake restriction on the blocksize, and powerful miners will have little o no problem kicking smaller nodes off the network by raising the blocksize.  The ""power"" given to smaller miners and nodes actually works *against* them not *for* them.  

Lastly, because these signaling and forking measures are built into the system. Let's say acceptance depth by 30% gets set to 2Mb for 100,000 blocks.  Then *another fork* happens as soon as there is a 2.1Mb block and now we have *two* BU chains

The BU system builds he blocksize debate into the core protocol and worsens the already bad consequences.  It will make the debate *more* contentious and solve absolutely nothing.  The state that we see these bitter, name calling, political debate over blocksize now, will recur *every* time someone tries to raise the blocksize.  It will be the new norm for bitcoin going forward.

It sounds very extreme but many of them believe this by the sounds of it.  So they as a group work together to train new people on how to search, and the process keeps cycling.

ddd9z9c,HodlDwon,30,"A minor note that this is a bit specific to bitcoin and its derived altcoins. Once it gets to the coinbase part it's describing the UTXO methodology where to spend coins you have to take those coins from a historical reciept of coins. This is a rather in efficient method.

Blockchains like r/Ethereum use an account mechanism where you it actually keeps track of your balance directly in the state database.  That way the software doesn't have to look back into history to prove you have the coins. It can just look at subtract them from your current balance. This is no more nor less secure than the UTXO architecture, as the chaining of hashes still provides the validity of account balances on Ethereum.

Also note, Bitcoin is rather crippled at the moment. Both in it's scripting language which is not turing complete as well as it's blocksize being arbitrarily capped at 1mb.  So currently transaction fees are over 50 cents with 10 minute confirmation times. Ethereum's are ~2 cents with 14 second confirmation times. Bitcoin hasn't had a code update (hard fork) in **2 years**! Whereas Ethereum continues to progress and iterate on upgrades regularly.

Looking forward to the Casper Proof of Stake upgrade in the next year or two that will reduce confirmation times down as low as 3 seconds.  Casper is a pre-requisite for sharding (parallelizing the state database / chain) which will allow transactions to scale from about 20 per second max on Ethereum up to 10,000 per second.  Further research hopes to scale that even further over the next 2-3 years up to 100,000 tps (basically more tps as more peers join the network and create more shards).

Again note that bitcoin is bottlenecked at 3 to 7 transactions per second right now and is politically deadlocked as developers are fighting idealogical wars about what how bitcoin should update or even if it should and how and yada yada yada. It's basically just r/btc and r/bitcoin flinging mud at each other while BitcoinCore runs a propaganda campaign and the *Centralized* Miners (like 2 or 3 people in China running SHA256 ASIC farms) refuse to take sides or provide a path forward.

Ethereum runs a virtual machine in the 'data' section of its blocks so you can actually run code there and the results of the code are saved to the state database (memory) for the next block.  This allows for complex interactions that are not possible on the bitcoin chain, such as true two-party escrow (never before possible in the history of humanity). And 9 times out of 10 when you read 'The Blockchain' in an article, they actually mean the public Ethereum chain or a private instance of it.

Also, very complex interactions like the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5ehpr7/ens_has_officially_launched_on_the_ropsten_testnet/), or the [Dai stablecoin](http://makerdao.com/docs/) governed by the [MakerDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/5nfcl0/getting_started_with_maker/). Even a [distributed social network called AKASHA](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/can-ethereum-based-akasha-revolutionize-social-networks/) is in alpha testing! [Even banks are using it](http://www.afr.com/technology/cba-puts-government-bonds-on-a-blockchain-20170123-gtx1ff).

All of these new Web3 technologies are considered to be 'spam' on the holy bitcoin blockchain. Thankfully with [over 100,000 developers joining attending ethereum MeetUps world wide](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ethereum/), we've fostered a community of technical innovation instead of cryptoeconomic zealotry.

dde78jp,theymos,27,"&gt; if a Monero-style fork was proposed to fix Bitcoin's fungibility problem, would you consider supporting it?

Definitely not. Monero's scheme is hideously unscalable. If Monero ever became popular, its scaling issues would make Bitcoin's scaling problem look like nothing, and it'd be basically certain to crash and burn.

If there was some magical fungibility fix that had no downsides other than the hardfork, and for some reason it couldn't be done as a softfork, then I would support it. But such a thing doesn't exist.

* Monero doesn't scale *at all*.
* zcash requires trusted setup, relies on immature crypto, and might also have scaling issues (not sure about the details of its scaling properties)
* MimbleWimble will be 100% wiped out by quantum computing, and can't support many types of contracts.

Also, nearly all hardforks can be done as softforks by creating a Bitcoin-security sidechain with the desired new rules. Though sometimes a hardfork would be cleaner than this in some ways.

&gt; More specifically, given the potentially complex change that would be needed to implement that fork by the entire ecosystem around Bitcoin, does what the miners think matter in any way?

No, there's no point in miner signalling for hardforks. I talked about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5jfgfk/the_only_way_hardforks_can_work/dbgeor4/).

ddd0pcx,lifeboatz,26,"There's not a lot of risk to you, as a passive owner.  Just have possession of your private keys, and if there's a fork, hold on (during the fork) until things settle.  I don't expect a fork before May.

What's going on is that there is (and has been for several years) a philosophical disagreement between two ""camps"" as to what's best for Bitcoin.

In one camp is the side that backs the ""Core Developers"".  Their argument is that it's a specially-talented team, they have coded an enhancement that gives a small bump in capacity which could be as big as 70% bigger within a year (or more - wildly optimistic 4x bigger), but it's implemented as a ""safe"" soft fork requiring 95% positive agreement.  They believe this will help reduce consolidation of mining and full nodes.  They also believe that any discussion to the contrary is unhealthy and should be squashed, as this is the only way to get the 95% agreement.

The other side has a lot of large holders of Bitcoin, who believe that capacity constrains usage and higher usage tends to contribute to higher price and less centralization.   (More users =&gt; more nodes and more interest in getting it right.)  They tend to believe that the core developers (many of whom were late to the game, sold off their bitcoins early, didn't recognize the true long-term value, and are now trying tying to ""establish themselves"" as the reputable, only-qualified software team, and many of whom took investment money from AXA (traditional bankers)) are centralizing development.  Indeed, the Bitcoin development team possesses likely the most toxic group of individuals of any open source project in history, and they repel talented individuals.  The second camp cleverly came up with a scaling solution which advances the blocksize limit on an ongoing basis by miner signaling.  It's not perfect, but rather than helping to take this idea and improve upon it, the first camp is taking pot shots at it, and sticking to their guns, and even suggesting that capacity should be cut by 70%!!

The second camp is gaining momentum, as the first team has had a mountain of PR disasters and broken promises.  Meanwhile, the second team has had a few hiccups as well, but has been quick to react.

Most recently, the second camp surpassed the first camp in mining endorsement.

In my opinion, what's likely to happen is that the second camp (BU) will continue to gain momentum, likely cross over 60% or 75% mining endorsement.  At that point, someone will mine a large block, and it'll be a period of uncertainty.  If those that ""signaled"" that they will accept it really do accept it, then we will advance to a newer architecture with blocks that can grow without this three-year fight.  (really, it's been 5+ years).

But several things can happen.  Maybe there are false signals, and then it's possible that more than half of the economy (miners, nodes, users) won't accept the large block.  Then the stronger chain may attack the weaker chain - which really could go either way.   Camp 1 or Camp 2 could win.  I would advise *not* moving your coins during that period of uncertainty.

Or, Both Camps might ""win"" with one winning bigger than the other.  In that case, if you owned coins, you probably own coins on both chains - like if you owned eBay stock, and they spun off PayPal, suddenly you own both eBay and PayPal.  At that point, watch carefully, because there may be a way to move to the side that you prefer (and ""double down"" on that side).  But your coins don't disappear.  The risk, though, is during that period of uncertainty, you could move your coins on one chain, and someone could repeat that move on the other chain, which gets weird.  I predict that services will help with that transition.

Bottom line:  make sure you have your Private Keys, and don't move during any period of uncertainty when there's a fork (which won't happen for at least a month, probably not for 4-8 months is my guess).  And then pay attention at that point to see what your options are.


I personally feel that unlocking the capacity constraint will increase the usage possibilities tremendously, making the system more valuable, and likely each Bitcoin more valuable.  And the uncertainty is constraining the price as well.  People are nervous, like you, and afraid to invest or hold.  As things become more certain, this is a good thing.  (Others say ""buy the rumor, sell the news"", meaning that certainty is bad.  I think you can apply that slogan now, and we're in the ""rumor"" period... As the rumor looks to be more factual, I expect the price to rise, and when it becomes 100% true, it's probably a selling opportunity, and then pick up some more after the inevitable dip.)

Greg Maxwell and his Blockstream business partner Adam Back never believed in bitcoin. They publicly mocked Satoshi's revolutionary invention for YEARS. Pretty much until the price hit 1200 and then they wanted in on it. First thing that they wanted was to essentially completely reengineer it into something it has never been, a settlement system, and completely abandon the P2P digital cash system Bitcoin is designed as. They want to take a 7 years proven system and completely change it. Segwit is a very important part of this process, is irreversible, and forever ties Bitcoin to the Core devs which has been trojan horsed by these long time anti bitcoiners. It really is an insane situation. 

This would have been a much easier issue to tackle had Theymos the controller of bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin not inexplicably chosen to for some damn reason CENSOR all debate on the subject. Mass bannings and deletions began... and it was turned into a complete warzone. 

Core has had YEARS at this point to show leadership and find a good compromise and solution just like they used to in the Gavin years. But over and over it has become extremely clear they will NEVER increase blocksize. It goes against everything they have ever demonstrated. And conspiracy theory or not... it seems obvious to many people that this 1mb crippling of bitcoin will provide an income source for Blockstream with the Lightning Network they are making.

Bitcoin Unlimited is bitcoin as it was always supposed to be. P2P digital cash/digital gold Bitcoin with a growing blocksize. Segwit or a similar functioning piece of code can easily be applied afterwards. This is the very heart of Bitcoin at stake, not just a matter of an upgrade.  Miners and a great many users not fooled by the censorship message control will no longer accept Core. ",2017-02-07 15:51:48

As someone who only occasionally visits /r/bitcoin, but very much likes the idea of Bitcoins. This response/subthread here completely puts me off Bitcoin.

I make transfers of £100s regularly through my bank account and they don't get any fees whatsoever as long as they are within the UK. Why the fuck would I use Bitcoin if it had a £10 fee for a £100 transaction? It's less supported, has no customer support, has no assurances/coverage and I'm far more likely to fuck up and lose them.

Even for foreign transfers the fees are tiny compared to that.

I think you are being the doofus, what possibility is there that people will use Bitcoin if transaction fees are this high?",2017-02-07 03:12:29

ddf9mqv,SirEDCaLot,35,"Remember the HK accord was never officially recognized by Core.  Let's not forget Greg Maxwell's [well meaning dipshits](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1330553.msg14835202#msg14835202) comment, and Adam Back changing his signature from CEO Blockstream to 'individual'.  

There were a couple of posts after the agreement where other Core devs said various things like 'Core is just a collection of individuals, we have no central position to negotiate so anyone who went was just negotiating as themselves'.  

So I've always assumed that the Core devs who went to HK either were only negotiating as individuals (not on behalf of Core), or thought they were negotiating on behalf of Core but actually had no authority to promise anything, or they just said whatever they had to to keep the miners from adopting Bitcoin Classic even though they knew they were promising things that weren't going to happen.  

Now while I'll admit I don't follow Core's operations too closely, I've not heard any chatter coming from the small block camp in the last ~year about any specific effort to comply with the HK accords or to apologize for the delays (SegWit not released on time, hard fork not released after SegWit as promised, etc).  

I don't see any evidence that Core (as a development group) considers the HK agreement to be binding on them as developers or on the Bitcoin-Core software project.  (If there is any such evidence, I invite anyone to send it to me, my mind as always remains open).  

For that matter, it seems to me like the miners have pretty much given up on it too.  The last translated bit I saw coming out of China barely mentioned the agreement, it was just some miners were willing to run BU and some were not willing to dump Core and some actively support SegWit scaling.  

So right now, the ones who actively support SegWit are signalling SegWit support, the ones who are willing to dump Core are doing so, and the ones who are not willing to dump Core are waiting it out.  ",2017-02-07 10:10:36

If there is actual timely development of fundamentals on BU/Core debate, then it deserves mention. Namely, if some milestone occurred with signalling, etc. BU overtaking (?) would be an event worth mentioning in that it certainly means something in grand scheme of things. On the other hand, the event in itself isn't really a gamechanger yet, nor was segwit reaching ~30% or so, since it's still pretty far off from an actual changeover. 

Beyond that, as I've said many times, the market generally doesn't seem to give a shit about actual governance issues, heck it barely even cares about actual network health. When we had spam attacks, backlogs of tx's, 'stress-tests', nodes crashing left and right, and tx's slowed to a crawl, there has hardly been a blip of price action in notable response. If you were cynical, you could say that apparently the money in speculation doesn't even [try to] use the bitcoin network to care, or you could say there is simply boundless and unshakable confidence that any and all problems will be solved. End result is same. I think it'd have to be an imminent hard fork before market responds and the conversation should really dominate this sub.

Multiple times in this thread you've mentioned that SegWit is ready now and we should all support it and adopt it. What you are missing is that many of us do not see SegWit in any way advancing Bitcoin as peer-to-peer cash - it's only a short term bump to allow more transactions and move towards Bitcoin being a ""digital gold"" that is too expensive to use without a 2nd layer on top.

I imagine you think everyone in support of a BU-style hard fork are a bunch of short-sighted plebeians that do not understand the great things that can be done once SegWit is activated if only we gave it a chance. But you are wrong - it is us that are looking to the future. We want the block size to be a non-issue for development teams to discuss ever again. The Bitcoin community should be bitching *only* to miners if we want a block size increase, not developers! Developers should focus on developing cool tech - SegWit, Schnorr signatures, lightning network, et al, instead of being the gate keepers to the economic rules of the system.

* Major businesses raise their enforced block size limit, and miners start producing bigger blocks. This is simple, easy and can be done in a very straightforward manner.

It would hardly be contentious anyway, anyone silly enough to push a continuation of a small-block chain would quickly find the value sold off in the market as the economic majority move to an un-hobbled Bitcoin that can handle waves of increased new adoption.

If the Bitcoin ecosystem proves itself to be capable of a market-based transition to bigger blocks, that it is not beholden to one group of developers, and that it can overcome the censorship of r/bitcoin, that would be a huge signal that it is anti-fragile and responsive to the desires of the market.

ddgmitg,Adrian-X,37,"I support moving the block limit for the flowing reasons before looking at Segwit:

* we know the mining reward drops over time. 

* we know transaction fees are need to pay for security.

* we know block fees go to miners.

*  if we move the fee paying transactions off the blockchain, security will be diminished - mining security will scale to the fee revenue. 

* the more people that use bitcoin the more valuable it becomes, this is a feedback loop that requires more block space for user transactions made by more users on the blockchain.  

* moving new fee paying transaction off the bitcoin blockchain onto other networks like LN - reduces miners revenue and security. 

* miners need scales of economy of transaction fees to pay for security. - Higher fees create demand for bitcoin competitors

* I believe off chain transactions should be allowed to compete with on chain transactions. (limiting block space to subsidies off chain demand will kill bitcoin)

* those businesses, lawyers, investment brokers, individuals, etc who have an incentive in the integrity of the money supply and being their own bank have an incentive to run a node. 

* more users = more people who need to run a node. we wont get more nodes without more users by lowering the cost to run a node. 

* when I ask people why they don't you run a node - they in turn ask me ""why should I?"" and when I tell them it's cheep they are not convinced -  people don't run nodes because they are cheep - users run nodes because they have a cost benefit relative to their dependence on bitcoin.  ( I don't see evidence that 2MB or 100MB blocks will result in an amazon and Google sized data center)

* A decentralized system = [a decentralized system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system) bitcoin must always remain a decentralized system - more nodes all running code controlled by a centralized authority does not enhance decentralization, while fewer nodes with competing interests can enhance centralization. 

* The consensus rules that prevents double spending or inflation are fundamental to bitcoin and the social contract.
The 1MB limit makes otherwise valid transactions, not valid as demand for block space exceeds capacity by denying them access to the blockchain so 1MB limit is not a fundamental rule of bitcoin. 

* my thought on consensus there is no percentage that triggers the fork there is just the majority network - obviously anything below 51% won't be the majority network it's important to realize that losing 49% of the network would affect the value and the rate at which a miner can mine bitcoin. So the incentive to split at a low threshold is low.

* The 1MB limit is a soft fork rule introduced in 2010. It was intended to prevent abuse of free transactions when writing a 30MB block to the bitcoin blockchain cost just a $1 or $2.
Today a block costs over $10,000 in opportunity costs and users pay a fee, the risk of abuse disappeared long ago.
There is no need for the soft fork limit any longer and it should now be removed.

* I find most of the technical reasons presented by small block proponents to be valid, I don't agree with how they weight there risk tolerance. the few technical risk that are valid can be managed with cooperation and communication.The risk of blocking growth will destroy bitcoin as we know it. 

* I fundamentally believe that those who resort to censorship to keep their story consistent have a poor argument that can not stand up to critical reasoning. 

TL;DR

small block proponents value a very limited block size over growth. (they use technical arguments to justify their position)

large block proponents value growth over the 1MB limit. (they use probability and economic incentives to assess technical risks)

***Edit*** Block size has had 3 years of censorship free discussion, and 5 years to iron out the bugs that resulted from the soft fork introduced in 2010 - we have no idea what the segwit soft fork will enable 7 year from now. 

knowing the issues with introducing soft forks like the 1MB limit we shroud take more time to consider all the implication segwit introduces with the change of the bitcoin incentive design as proposed.

High St., and the Nazi connection comes from his son, 32-year-old Andrew Anglin, a Worthington native who runs the world's most-visited white supremacist website, the Daily Stormer.

&gt; Until recently, the Daily Stormer accepted mailed donations through suite 121.

-

&gt; Others in the movement don't like his troll-heavy approach. In the days after Donald Trump won the presidential election, for example, Anglin called on his readers to attack liberals online, flooding them with emails and social-media messages encouraging them to kill themselves. ""'Mass Suicides After Trump Victory' would be a headline the media would play up, but all it do would demoralize the left even further,"" he wrote.

-

&gt; Racist online screeds sometimes cross over into the real world. Dylann Roof's killing of nine black people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, raised the Daily Stormer's profile when it came to light that parts of Roof's manifesto were found nearly verbatim in comments made on the Daily Stormer. That has led many to believe that Roof was a Daily Stormer commenter.

Heavily edited:

&gt; In the event a developer or group of developers proposes a modification to the Bitcoin Network that is not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible Blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a “hard fork.” In such a case, the “hard fork” in the Blockchain could materially and adversely affect the perceived value of bitcoin as reflected on one or both incompatible Blockchains, and thus the value of the Trust’s bitcoin.

more:

&gt; In the event of an upcoming modification to the Bitcoin Network that could potentially result in a hard fork with two separate and incompatible Bitcoin Networks, the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, will elect to support the Bitcoin Network that has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty for the forty-eight (48) hour period following a given hard fork, in order to engage in bitcoin transactions and the valuation of bitcoin. During this forty-eight (48) hour period and for the twenty-four (24) hour period prior to the anticipated fork, creation and redemption of baskets will be halted. The greatest cumulative computational difficulty is defined as the total threshold number of hash attempts required to mine all existing blocks in the respective Blockchain, accounting for potential differences in relative hash difficulty. If the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners. Under the terms of the Trust Custody Agreement, the Trust may be required to indemnify the Custodian for any losses arising in connection with its determination to elect the Bitcoin Network with the greatest computational difficulty in the event of a hard fork.

Also added:

&gt; In January 2017, the People’s Bank of China announced that it had found several violations, including margin financing and a failure to impose anti-money laundering controls, after on-site inspections of two China-based Bitcoin Exchanges. In response to the Chinese regulator’s oversight, the three largest China-based Bitcoin Exchanges, OKCoin, Huobi, and BTC China, started charging trading commission fees to suppress speculative trading and prevent price swings which resulted in a significant drop in volume on these exchanges.

ddhnhiv,phoenix128,53,"Been viewing this thread almost daily for 3+ years, posted a few times early on, not for a long while now.

Haven’t really thought I had anything good to add until last night.

So, the Winklevoss ETF.  I have been of the opinion that it was unlikely to be approved by the SEC for a variety of reasons which have been widely reported, and thus do not need to be rehashed here.  It is pretty clear, though, that many reasonable voices find it hard to believe that the SEC is going to approve this.
One thing that I have found to be strange though, has been the reduction in the GBTC premium over the last few months, to the point that it is now negligible.  I would think that the premium would remain high with so many voices saying that the ETF was unlikely to be approved.  If GBTC is the only way, and will remain the only way, to get bitcoin in your IRA or other retirement account, that premium, in my opinion, should remain substantial.

Still, there could be other reasons for premium decline, like many people selling GBTC because they think the ETF will be approved.  I personally believe that this would reduce, but not eliminate the premium, but at best this is just circumstantial evidence that someone may have inside information that the Winklevoss ETF will be approved.

Then yesterday I was listening to the podcast about the ETF with the Needham analyst and Daniel Masters as guests.  I think it was the Needham analyst that said that Grayscale Investments, LLC, (""Grayscale"") which filed with the SEC on January 20, 2017 to list the Bitcoin Investment Trust (“BIT”) on the NYSE as a true ETF, had ceased its ongoing private placement of BIT shares, and will no longer issue shares of same.  The following link confirms this:

http://www.cbs8.com/story/34306782/grayscale-investments-llc-ceases-private-placement-of-bitcoin-investment-trust

I think it is fair to assume that Grayscale makes money through their private placements when BIT shares are created,  and also fair to assume that, due to the timing of the suspension, it was required or at least advisable, before filing the S-1 with the SEC (the suspension occurred one day before filing the S-1).   So here are the big questions:

Why would Grayscale give up a money making operation so that they could be the third-in-line ETF application before the SEC? - and why would they do this now, just two months or so before the SEC must finally rule on the Winklevoss ETF?  At a minimum, wouldn’t it make more sense to wait on the SEC ruling before terminating your private placement business?

My speculative answer is that they are at least reasonably confident that the Winklevoss ETF is going to be approved – and might even know it will be.    In my view, it does not make sense otherwise for Grayscale to make that ETF filing when they did.  If they do know the Winklevoss ETF will be approved, then it makes perfect sense to file now, since an ETF application will take some time to be approved even with the Winklevoss ETF approval on the horizon.

My confidence in this theory is bolstered by the fact that Barry Silbert is the CEO of Grayscale, and is also the founder of Secondmarket.  In my opinion, you don’t create and operate Secondmarket unless you have an intimate knowledge of SEC rules - and over time he likely developed a large list of contacts at that agency.  Again, I am just speculating, but I think Barry Silbert may know something that most of the rest of us do not.   In my view, the recent actions of Grayscale just do not make sense otherwise.

3. Wait for the price of Bitcoin to fall (whilst paying a daily interest charge for everyday that you're still owing the exchange bitcoins)

4. When the price has fallen sufficiently, you use the fiat money that you are sitting on from selling the Bitcoin, to buy back the same amount of Bitcoin that you borrowed &amp; owe the exchange.

5. Give the exchange but the amount of Bitcoin that you borrowed. Profit from the difference.

You wait for the price to drop to $800 per Bitcoin. You now use the $10,000 in your Exchange account to buy 10 bitcoins. $800 x 10btc = $8,000.  Therefore you have  $2,000 left over. Pay the exchange back the 10 bitcoins that you borrowed &amp; keep $2,000 for you.

Instead, a less trust-minimized peripheral payment network (possibly Lightning ) will be needed to bear a larger number of lower-value bitcoin-denominated transactions than Bitcoin blockchain is capable of, using the Bitcoin blockchain to periodically settle with one high-value transaction batches of peripheral network transactions.

In the early days of Bitcoin, some of its most prominent evangelists had spread the message that Bitcoin was destined for Visa-scale, and that it would be a global payment system that could satisfy all use cases, including microtransactions. Not only that, the Bitcoin blockchain would serve as a general database for an endless variety of apps. 

Very little attention was given to how this could be possible while Bitcoin retained its core value proposition: censorship resistance arising from decentralization. But it didn't seem to matter because everyone was so excited that Bitcoin existed at all, and everything seemed possible.

Those early promises still echo through these and other message forums, long after they've been dismissed by people with technical insight as fundamentally in opposition to what Bitcoin excels at: being censorship-resistant money. And as Szabo points out very eloquently, censorship resistance is expensive. 

Bitcoin cannot be a cheap payments network at the base layer. It must first establish itself as a valuable, globally transferable digital asset that is **highly resistant** to censorship. If it doesn't do that, then there really isn't much of reason for Bitcoin to exist.

ddk6u7g,jonny1000,64,"This is a great essay and succinctly explains the core fundamental problem with Bitcoin Unlimited’s “Emergent Consensus” system.  Bitcoin Unlimited changes the security model, such that it requires human intervention to actively monitor and modify various software parameters (namely MG, EB and AD).  This human (or [bird](https://youtu.be/nAqos76JONw?t=33m7s) like) process has all the normal pitfalls and inefficiencies of traditional social scalability.  The key (and only) innovation of Bitcoin is “automated security”, that does not require this human intervention:

As Nick describes it:

&gt; An individual or group communicating under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” brought Bitcoin to the Internet in 2009. Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.

&gt; The characteristics most distinctively valuable in blockchain technology in general, and Bitcoin in particular — for example, independence from existing institutions for its basic operations and the ability to operate seamlessly across borders, come from the high levels of security and reliability a blockchain can maintain **without human intervention.**


&gt; When we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure. Cryptocurrencies, when implemented properly on public blockchains, can substitute an army of computers for a large number of traditional banking bureaucrats. “These block chain computers will allow us to put the most crucial parts of our online protocols on a far more reliable and secure footing, and make possible fiduciary interactions that we previously dared not do on a global network.”

ddjxjn5,DajZabrij,54,"**LADIES AND GENTELMAN, NICK SZABO HAS SPOKEN**

&gt; It is probable that no such big but integrity-preserving performance improvement is possible for the Bitcoin blockchain; this may be one of these unavoidable tradeoffs.  Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made radical tradeoffs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly wasteful process of mining is the most obvious of these tradeoffs, but Bitcoin also makes others.  Among them is that it requires high redundancy in its messaging.  Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcast between all nodes.  Bitcoin can’t achieve that but to even get anywhere close to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy.  So a 1 MB block consumes far more resources than a 1 MB web page, because it has to be transmitted, processed, and stored with high redundancy for Bitcoin to achieve its automated integrity.

&gt; These necessary tradeoffs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the security necessary for independent, seamlessly global, and automated integrity, mean that the Bitcoin blockchain itself cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated integrity that creates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional financial systems. **Instead, a less trust-minimized peripheral payment network (possibly Lightning ) will be needed to bear a larger number of lower-value bitcoin-denominated transactions than Bitcoin blockchain is capable of, using the Bitcoin blockchain to periodically settle with one high-value transaction batches of peripheral network transactions.**

&gt; Bitcoin supports a lower rate transactions than Visa or PayPal, but due to its stronger automated security these can be much more important transactions. Anybody with a decent Internet connection and a smart phone who can pay $0.20-$2 transaction fees – substantially lower than current remitance fees -- can access Bitcoin any where on the globe.  Lower value transactions with lower fees will need to be implemented on peripheral bitcoin networks.

&gt; When it comes to small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible about paying retail with bitcoin the way you’d pay with a fiat currency — bitcoin-denominated credit and debt cards, for example, with all the chargeback and transactions-per-second capabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are also clever ways to do peripheral bitcoin retail payments in which small value payments happen off-chain and are only periodically bulk-settled on the Capital-B Bitcoin blockchain. **That blockchain is going to evolve into a high-value settlement layer as bitcoin use grows, and we will see peripheral networks being used for small-b bitcoin retail transactions.**

&gt; **When I designed bitgold** I already knew consensus did not scale to large transaction throughputs securely, so I designed it with a two-tier architecture: (1) bit gold itself, the settlement layer, and (2) Chaumian digital cash, a peripheral payment network which would provide retail payments with high transactions-per-second performance and privacy (through Chaumian blinding), but would like Visa be a trusted third party and thus require a “human blockchain” of accountants, etc. to operate with integrity.  The peripheral payment network can involve only small value transactions, thereby requiring much less of a human army to avoid the fate of Mt. Gox.

TL;DR Nick Szabo is on Core side.

ddj7fmp,Yheymos,35,"Thanks for coming to this sub! =) Segwit isn't actually being blocked by this sub it simply hasn't been supported by the network. Segwit needs to hit 95% support and only has about 22% after three plus months. Currently Bitcoin Unlimited has about 21% of the network BU certainly hasn't blocked anything yet. If Segwit was at 80% and BU was at 20% then yes BU would be blocked off those last 15%. But that isn't the case. 

But also... it was the creators of Segwit who have been blocking process for about two years now. As you are already aware people on this sub support larger blocks since it was always Satoshi Nakamoto's plan from the start, and a rather mundane, expected, normal upgraded until a couple years ago.

What happened was Gavin Andresen stepped down from his leadership position and handed the keys to castle to programmers he thought would be a good replacement. Unfortunately these people, Greg Maxwell the most public (and his business parter Adam Back) publicly mocked and laughed at Bitcoin for years until 2013 when it hit $1200. It seemed that price along caused them to want to suddenly support and believe in Bitcoin, when others already understood why it was successful since the start. 

Greg and team decided the bitcoin needed to be massively changed (despite its success to that point). Satoshi's planned and mundane blocksize increases, that all the users, community, and miners were always expected suddenly needed to go. He was inventing sidechains and lightning networks, 2nd layer solutions, and pumped a lot of fear about how changing the 1mb blocksize would be bad for the network. Most people didn't buy this stuff. It received a strong backlash from Core devs and the community. Unfortunately Greg has an unfortunately bully like, gaslighting personality (there is years of this documented in Bitcoin and his Wikipedia years) there started turn Core against itself. Many of the brightest minds and biggest contributors in Core LEFT, leaving it a shadow of its former self, having been effectively trojan horsed by nonbelievers hellbent on proving that THEY were the geniuses, not Satoshi. 

Unfortunately, Greg and Adam Back started a private company called Blockstream that would specifically make profits off the Lightning Network. Now... no one can no for sure... and this is were the 'conspiracy talk' comes from. But crippling Bitcoin to 1mb blocks is so inexplicable many believe part of the push for this is to ensure people for FORCED onto the Lightning Networks which will give Blockstream fees and thus a revenue source to justify there VC capitcal funding. And the part that is proven fact is that capital funding coming from some of the biggest banks and financial firms in the 'old system' of money. AXA among them.

And unfortunately again on top of that... Theymos... owner of r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org... the two biggest bitcoin communication channels at the time... inexplicably sided with Greg's vision that would take Bitcoin rapidly away from what it had always been and always planned to be. And instead of just letting the users, devs, miners fight it out and finally solve the issue through compromise, vision, debate and discussion, he went full Big Brother, authoritarian nightmare, banned all discussion of big blocks, labelled all nonCore devs as altcoin devs, traitors, invaders. He banned and deleted anyone expressing support for the original long planned Bitcoin roadmap, and only ever allowed discussion of bigger blocks if it was to mock, laugh at, and destroy. Bitcoin XT, which was created by Core devs Gavin and Mike Hearn as a side project to continue Satoshi's vision without the trojan horse Gregdevs was stopped in its tracks. Then came classic, and now Bitcoin Unlimited which has received the widest success and momentum. Bitcoin Unlimited can eventually have segwit, or similar code, and can have 2nd layer solutions also.

ddkr9c3,Taek42,40,"This is a really crappy thing to do because people very seriously underestimate the scalability bottlenecks, including most programmers and even a lot of distributed systems people.

Let's ask, is 8MB too much? The average home has way more than 5Mbps internet, and 8MB per 10 minutes is only just over 1Mbps, so we should be okay right? We've seemingly even got enough space for 20 MB blocks, right?

NO, we don't. We don't because the math doesn't work that way. A popular research paper (https://www.google.com/url?q=http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE%2B16.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6x4f66YXSAhUqrVQKHXEPB58QFggQMAA&amp;sig2=6xdlQw83OX6ns17_QPmwMA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_Kk502Fvc7q43z9sp0voaEs7sZg) puts the upper bound at 4MB, and they don't even consider all the problems.

1. You have to upload the blocks too, you aren't just downloading them.
2. When you get started you need to download a decade of history. So the real time updates need to be little enough that you have reasonable hope of catching up
3. You need to store the whole utxo set. In Bitcoin this goes in ram and is currently something like 1GB. At 8MB blocks, it would go up by something like 4GB per year. If we put the utxo set on disk you have to do a ton of I/O, and already an HDD is basically too slow to handle that. An SSD would be mandatory, but even then I don't think it could keep up with 8MB blocks.
4. The blockchain itself is huge. 100GB already. 8MB blocks would have it growing by 30 GB per month. People already hate the 100GB, a year of 8MB blocks would put it at 500GB.
5. There's a shitload of cryptography that you need to do. Verifying elliptic curves is not fast. It's so slow that Bitcoin wrote its own hyper optimized library just to do it, because the standard libraries already couldn't keep up with 1MB blocks.
6. Selfish mining attacks and block propagation issues are a very serious concern. Miners have to be able to send blocks to eachother within a few seconds or big miners get massive advantages over little miners. Standard advice is already to have your miner on a 1Gbps connection, and that's just for 1MB blocks.

Bitcoin consumes a ton of ram, a ton of disk I/O, a ton of CPU power, a ton of disk space, and a ton of network bandwidth. It hammers pretty much every major resource of a computer even just at 1MB.

I'm sure I've missed a few things as well. Out of millions of users, Bitcoin only has 5,000 full nodes. That's a great demonstration that it's super expensive. If it wasn't, more people would do it. Before blocks really started filling up, it was a lot higher, even though there were fewer users.",2017-02-11 00:34:16

&gt; There seems to be a disconnect between what the devs are developing, and what business actually need and want, which is a bigger problem about how resources are directed.

A currency is *not* owned by businesses, and if is, guaranteed it will fail long term. This is the mistake they've made from the start (talking generally about a lot of SV VC funded companies I guess); they think the Bitcoin blockchain exists to serve their use cases and that somehow they can influence it. If transactions are ""too expensive"" for them right now, then that means their business model is unfortunately **entirely broken**; a global distributed ledger, in any kind of long-term successful equilibrium, will just not cost a few cents to transact on! How could they not have noticed this? It was obvious to *everyone* with half a clue as soon as they looked at Bitcoin's design.

The right solution was always going to be some kind of layering, exactly how to make that work and be attractive *is* the kind of problem businesses would want to solve, not throw a monkey wrench into the base layer to serve their short sighted needs.

&gt; We’ve never understood why it has to be one or the other — why can’t there be both?

This is an excellent example of just how low a level of understanding these people have. I hate to suggest it, but maybe they should dirty their hands and read sources like r/Bitcoin . One answer I remember giving recently is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5s0snu/why_didnt_we_just_hf_to_segwit_2mb_blocks_again/ddbl25s/) but I'm sure there are tons of others.

&gt;  too often it’s boiled down to segwit-lover or segwit-hater, which is not very professional or scientific

True, but it's a shame that the opinions expressed here are also woefully unprofessional and un-scientific, because you haven't bothered to educate yourself on the basics.

&gt; Testnet has been SegWit-active for a while now, but little testing has been done by major bitcoin network players. Several larger players are waiting for lib updates to go to production before beginning their own testing.

Segwit has been active on 4 different testnets over more than a year. What updates are being waited for? To the casual reader this suggests that ""Bitcoin software"" is not ready, but Bitcoin Core (the one that actually runs the nodes) is, and so are quite a few wallets and so on. If a few businesses haven't yet bothered to update, that's their problem, it's nothing to do with Bitcoin. They've had more than a year to get on it (I remember feeling embarrassed that I started to look at it in Apr 2016, ""late"") ...

&gt; Our understanding is its only been tested by core devs on testnet… the main worry would be that this testing may not match what enterprises actually need on a production level

What kind of nonsense is this? You think *nobody apart from core devs* has tested segwit? Just how out of touch are you?!

&gt; Some of us feel that SegWit and Lightning are both in the “exciting, but still in the lab” category — and that nuance is often lost in the SegWit / Lightning excitement

ddl3h87,_chewtoy_,22,"Hi All!

Did you miss me? I certainly missed all of you. 

True story, I really did miss ya'll. 

In any event, it's been an interesting month to say the least. And I've been blissfully on the sidelines since unloading all of my trading/cold storage coins at around $760 at the very bottom of the first PBOC dump. 

Do I regret it? Not in the slightest! (Although we'll talk again if/when bitcoin is trading at $2,000 - $10,000 per coin). 

This has quite honestly been one of the most relaxing and enjoyable months I've had in two years. 

Unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot to contribute as far as TA or general opinions go. Although there is a gnarly bear flag forming on the 1H that I'd advise keeping an eye on:

http://imgur.com/a/gG6p9

Here's what I will say though:

1. Don't underestimate the PBOC nonsense. When the mere announcement of a meeting can tank the price 10%, it's safe to say we may be in a period where bitcoin is too unpredictable to trade ""safely."" I'm not saying everyone should take my lead and abandon ship, but if you are someone who normally makes trading decisions based on TA...this is not the best climate for you. 
2. OKcoin bearwhale/absurd backwardation: This is very strange, and I've never seen anything even remotely like this before. I wouldn't feel comfortable trading there, as it's complete anarchy. Fluctuating premiums have always been a rollercoaster on futures, but this is absolutely obscene. 
3. Where are we headed: Up, up, and away, most likely. But it's going to take awhile longer than most expected if China doesn't lay off the FUD. Trend is still up, and remains up as long as the long-term support line holds. And if it doesn't? Well, there's no reason the market can't find major support at $470, $300, or back at $200 (but I don't think it will fail).

* Basic: Hello World 

* Type casting: return int with reversed digits of int input

* Map: return a dict of letter counts in a string

* Recursion: Fibonacci

* Pattern matching: extract phone numbers from a text file

* DB: parse CSV and store in (no)SQL db

* Net: API endpoint that returns aggregate results from multiple external API request (use some sort of concurrency for requests and/or aggs?)

* Data structures, text input: tic tac toe, battleship, or some similar game

ddn8j50,Xekyo,89,"Since nobody can say how Bitcoin will fare in 28 years, I think this is a bit of a gamble. If Bitcoin appreciates as much in value as some hope, you'll make your kid extremely wealthy over night.

You say ""a couple"" hundred, so that would mean that you lock up most of your bitcoins. If Bitcoin peaks long before that, you might miss out on a huge opportunity. 

I think I'd set aside a smaller sum, e.g. 21 bitcoins as a fixed stash for him when he turns thirty, and treat the remainder as a source to diversify in a few different things, to liquidate at opportune moments, or to enable your son to gain experiences to help broaden his horizon, e.g. school exchange abroad, traveling, or a little capital to help a project off the ground that he's really passionate about in his curious years. Also, you'll have some more left, if you decide to have more kids. ;)

You could also give him smaller amounts of money at earlier stages in his life to see how he deals with that and to let him make some mistakes to learn from.

I think giving such a wealth to him later in his life, i.e. at 30 is a good idea, as he'll have time to form his character and will perhaps not build his adult identity around it as he perhaps would be tempted to, if he got it at 18 or 21.",2017-02-12 19:24:13

ddn3i26,itty53,40,"No one really knows. The official story is that Oswald was a disturbed communist sympathizer that had beef with America, and JFK was the leader of the most anti-communist state in history: America. Therefore he killed him.

Other varied theories that have again, varying groups of people who believe them:

- the mob killed him, because he was cracking down on them. Pretty simple logic. Usually associated with the grassy knoll.

- the CIA killed him, because he was outspoken against them and was widely known to have issues with them. They wanted war, he wanted negotiation. Again, grassy knoll, but also other alleged shooting positions.

- LBJ had him killed, because he wanted to be president. Same story, different puppet master.

In my favorite and more recent iteration (favorite for entertainment, not accuracy): all of the above conspired together, led by a young, then-future president George HW Bush, plus a team of world class assassins in every shooting position imaginable except the grassy knoll and the school book depository, all because of secret societies, blood oaths, greed and world domination, somehow trying to get America in a war with Russia or, to merge with Russia peacefully. And oh, ""they"" also pulled a body switch, and they're behind 9/11 and ISIS.

If you have no savings, you should probably save that into a standard cash bank account. Not sexy, but safer. The thing with rainy day funds is that you don't know when you'll need the money. What if you need $300 for car/medical repairs, but bitcoin just took a 10% dive? 

Remember that savings are for a lot of life events. College, books for school, vacation, weddings, house down payments, etc. Bitcoin can be a part of your plan, but diversification is key. No one asset class (be it bitcoin, stocks, bonds, real estate, gold) should make up all of a portfolio. 

Talking in other terms, this is like asking if you should keep your savings in the stock market. It's always gone up in the long term, right? Well, with emergency funds you typically don't have the luxury waiting until your investments have done well to withdrawal. Bitcoin is even more volatile than that. 

Look at last year. What if someone had all their savings in bitcoin and bought at $800. Then, bitcoin went down to $400/coin, and they needed the money for an emergency. It doesn't matter that today they'd have a 25% increase in their investment. They needed to cash out when it was down at $400. They had to eat a 50% loss instead. 

If you want to get some bitcoin, I would recommend starting with only $10/week, and put the rest in a savings account. Get used to the technical aspects and volatility. I know it's not sexy or exciting, but bitcoin is still a speculative investment. Make sure you understand the risks. Knowing what I know, I'd never want more than 5%-10% of my wealth in bitcoin. With bitcoin, there's always the possibility you'll wake up with less cash value than what you had the night before.

ddm5rzf,5tu,25,"Segwit is a new type of transaction that solves a lot of issues and allows for a lot of new features to be added more easily/safely.  

To name a few things it does... segwit transactions reduce the amount of space needed by the main blockchain as the witness data that can later be discarded is put in a separate data structure.  

Segwit transactions also solve malleability issues which is a serious headache for developers building ontop of bitcoin.  It also allows for future expansion of new features such as making bitcoin truly fungible which needs to happen at some point.  It also makes the Lightning Network that is in development are much cleaner solution.


What they are saying is the number of computers running the full bitcoind client that is capable of understanding and issuing segwit style transactions is over 50%.

The marker for it actually being usable however is the number of the mining nodes supporting segwit (i.e. bitcoind clients but they are actually running mining hardware), this needs to be &gt; 95% before segwit transactions can be activated to be safe but this is still stuck at 23%.

ddm99sq,ydtm,23,"**It's insane to think that _less_ users will make Bitcoin _more_ decentralized.**

In other words, if blocks were actually 8MB (I'm not talking about 8MB max - I'm talking about _actually_ 8MB in size)... then:

- Maybe 10% of _current_ nodes could not longer ""keep up"" with the technological requirements (bandwidth, memory, storage) of 8MB blocks - but then maybe 8x more people would _want_ to run a node, **so net-net we'd have _many more nodes_**

- Number of transactions and number of users would be much higher - so price would be much higher (which feeds back into the above point). Of course, it's hard to provide exact estimates of _how much_ higher - but I think we should at least make the effort to provide some rough quantitative projections, and I actually have:

&gt; 1 BTC = 64 000 USD would be &gt; $1 trillion market cap - versus $7 trillion market cap for gold, and $82 trillion of ""money"" in the world. Could ""pure"" Bitcoin get there without SegWit, Lightning, or Bitcoin Unlimited? Metcalfe's Law suggests that 8MB blocks could support a price of 1 BTC = 64 000 USD

ddmnvvm,AstarJoe,19,"I don't see increasing the blocksize as a relevant means of even beginning to address scalability for a number of very salient reasons:

1.) Bigger blocks immediately incentivizes businesses to start filling them with data. A provable, neutral digital notary is a monumental achievement, and many would like to get their information onto such a platform. This would inundate bitcoin almost certainly, and lead to strain for even bigger blocks, ad infinitum. Where does it end? At what point is decentralization utterly destroyed? Who makes that call? If anything, blocksize increases are a huge detriment to bitcoin and the blocksize should be *reduced* if anything. 

2.) People can still, and will always be able to settle or spend on the bitcoin blockchain directly, via a node, or whatever else. Fees might rise, but second layer solutions are our only hope to addressing global scalability. I don't see how it can be done any other way right now without risking decentralization, one of bitcoin's most important attributes. Let the fees rise and drive market forces to develop and rapidly implement scaling solutions that are provable and off chain, and use the blockchain to settle their balances. None of this impacts an individual's ability to buy a dumb cup of coffee.

3.) Buying a cup of coffee on chain isn't the point. People are ridiculously ignorant about the state of world affairs and the degree to which governments have absolute control over our digital and financial well being. Paypal and VIsa can arbitrarily shit down Wikileaks on any government's order? Hell, no. We must, we absolutely must, preserve bitcoin's security and decentralization in order to combat this growing trend of digital authoritarianism (just look at Britain with the ""snooper's charter"", and the Snowden revelations, or China's capital controls, or myriad other such developments. Yeah, I'll gladly sacrifice my on chain coffee for a 2nd layer solution in order to combat this trend and preserve the only, yes, the only digital exchangeable bearer asset that no gov controls or can inflate away. Look at prioroties, I say (this is more of a shout out to Ver and his people than you).

4.) Many on the other side are assuming that second layer solutions can't be done fairly or promptly. We musn't sacrifice bitcoin's small footprint and push it into big data centers and places of central control, because at that point bitcoin WILL be well and truly fucked beyond all hope, with no chance of getting it back, so perhaps we proceed slowly, cautiously, with steady research into other solutions before writing all options off and going with the ""easy way out"", which, obviously, is a simply blocksize increase.

To me the most significant statement he made was:  

&gt;If there was a way to increase [blockchain transaction] throughput I would surely say how if I knew ... [1]  

The only concession he made was to say:  

&gt;I actually did find and make such a proposal - to add schnorr signatures to Bitcoin which are aggregatable and so smaller - giving a 27-40% reduction in transaction size [1]  

Blockstream denies Bitcoin can work as peer-to-peer digital cash. This is used to justify turning Bitcoin into a vehicle for Blockstream's off-chain product offerings and LN, which is intended to offer a digital cash replacement to the Bitcoin version, based on trusted bank-like LN hubs, rather than the individually controlled direct and trustless peer-to-peer transactions of Bitcoin. So people who do not believe in the possibility of Bitcoin's success as originally conceived and who wish to profit from its lack of success, control the Bitcoin reference client. Of course, Adam vehemently denies any conflict of interest.  

You may be interested in the 2014[2] article referenced by u/jessquit early in the thread[3] written by Zavain Dar, a venture capital investor, which explained his understanding of the reasons for Blockstream's existence.  

I did ask Adam u/adam3us to show us Blockstream's business plan, but he has not done so and Dar's article is the closest I have yet seen.

Something not happening doesn't mean it wasn't necessary to warn against it. So yes, a slow death is less exciting, and it is easier to pretend nothing bad is happening. Doesn't mean everything is hunky dory.

SegWit on the other hand is **still** not an immediate increase comparable to a HF. 

&gt; It is a fully fledged blocksize increase to up to 2MB+

Stop spreading misinformation please. Stop parroting lies. It just **NOT** a full fledged blocksize increase. Saying it is, is just as bad as saying it isn't a blocksize-limit increase at all.

No, it is also criticized because it is too way slow. Remember it was promised to be released in April 2016. Tell me I didn't already predicted it would take much more time. Who was wrong, and who was right? 

You can dismiss what we say all you want, because you think you (or Core devs) are smarter (which is a stupid non argument anyway). But the reality is that it was going to be slow, and still is going to be slow. 

You can't say SegWit is faster, and then at every step say ""Oops, never mind the past, but after the next step it really is going to faster"". Forgive and forget right? Focus on the future. 

&gt; Mainly by non-developers (or developers who want to push their own solution).

I'm a developer, I write medical software, what about you? Just look at the people who are against SegWit, count the number of developers, and notice you are lying again. I want a Bitcoin which works.

Bitcoin und Co sind eine massive Stromverschwendung und funktionieren nur, weil sich eine kleine Gruppe Unwissende zum Kauf von elektronischen ""Münzen"" überredet, damit sie selbst Gewinn machen können. Es gibt keine Erfolgsgeschichten über Bitcoin, außer den Preis, der immer weiter steigt. Es wurden keine Probleme gelöst, keine Wirtschaftswunder in irgendwelchen afrikanischen Staaten geschaffen und die Nutzer sind teilweise ideologisch absolut verblendet.

Wer da kein Oligopol und nahende Manipulation erkennt, ist doch einfach nur bekloppt. Schon jetzt manipulieren die größten Miner zusammen den Markt, indem sie ihre überlegene Hashpower nutzen, um gefundene Blöcke vor anderen kleineren Minern zu verstecken, damit diese unnötig auf veralteten Daten minen.

if you've been in Bitcoin since the early days, you'll recall that since the beginnings of Luke's, Greg's, or Peter's involvement, they've always given this twisted argument that the minority can never be ""dominated"" by the majority.  now that i think of it, this was probably one of the very first arguments they made that made my red flags go up.  at first, you get sucked into their thinking, what with these guys being cypherpunks/libertarians/savants and anointed virrtuous stewards of the code, right?  they couldn't possibly want to steer you wrong while being so embedded within the Bitcoin community?  then the arguments began to break out btwn Gavin/Mike and Luke/Peter/Greg.  that's when i knew coders could be greedy and dishonest just like the rest of us.  and that's when i really started to pay particular attention, as best i could, to every word and action taken by both sides with an intent to try and determine who was acting truly in Bitcoin's interest.

when you fundamentally dissect out what Bitcoin is, it is the majority (the masses whom these current core dev guys seem to hate in everything they say and action they do thru high fees and settlement layer concepts) taking back control of their finances (money) from the minority (&lt;0.1% financial elite, gvts, and central banks) that control most countries.  it's doing this thru the decentralization of the blockchain which in it's ultimate form will come from including *users* worldwide (not everyone can or has to run a full node) who will in aggregate find a way to run more full nodes.  it is also why Nakamoto Concensus (the majority) will ultimately be the way that the blocksize debate will be solved.  as more and more miners run BU in the future (as they realize SW is dead meaning they might as well run BU just in case they need to follow a longer chain fork) and as that gets to &gt;51%, some miner will release a 1.1MB block to grab extra fees and the rest of the BU miners will follow that chain.  and off we'll go.  it will be the *majority* of miners acting in Bitcoin's (and the *majority* user's) best interest.",2017-02-13 01:33:59

So he writes that.  This seems to immediately suggest that scalability through optimization and hardware is do-able.

Then he turns right around and writes:

&gt;  Nobody has discovered any way to greatly increase the computational scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain

""It hasn't yet been done, therefore it cannot be done,"" is a clear, obvious logical fallacy.

Meanwhile, since competing blockchains *already* easily offer order-of-magnitude-or-better performance, and since other options for many more orders-of-magnitude improvements (ie NG) are in the works, we should rate this statement not only as ""mostly false"" but moreover ""intentionally deceptive.""

&gt;  for example its transaction throughput, and demonstrated that this improvement does not compromise Bitcoin’s security.

See what he did there?  That was a rhetorical trick.  It is true that increased transactions-per-block perforce means less hashpower-per-transaction.  On this we can all agree.   The question Szabo intentionally does not answer is: 

*How much hashpower per transaction is optimal?""

Surely, Szabo wouldn't agree that one transaction per block - which would concentrate all of the world's hashpower on each transaction thus offering the most secure system possible - would be ""more optimal"" than our current situation.

&gt; It is probable that no such big but integrity-preserving performance improvement is possible for the Bitcoin blockchain; this may be one of these unavoidable tradeoffs.

ddormfw,seweso,20,"&gt; Absolutely not. A hardfork has unique properties and risks you can be very much opposed to. You inability to acknowledge those risks is alarming.

Yet other cryptocurrencies can pull them off without a hitch. 

The only reason a HF is dangerous, is because people make sure it will be dangerous, and the only reason people are against it is because it is dangerous, and the only reason it is dangerous, is because people make sure it will be dangerous etc. It's the same darn thing. 

Tell me what makes a HF dangerous except people explicitly making it dangerous, and loudly complaining that this ""danger"" which they will be causing will be costly? 

Core developers know perfectly well that if Bitcoin hardforks, they would need to create yet another Hardfork to make a minority chain viable. Which at that point will make absolutely no sense whatsoever. They can't create a HF because they are against HF's, that's insane. And they cannot create a HF because they are gainst a blocksize-increase if they released a full 4Mb soft-fork themselves. 

Sorry, doesn't compute. 

&gt; the only reason it is dangerous, is because people make sure it will be dangerous

That again depends mostly on the people blocking a HF. But that's not a sustainable argument. At a certain point all fear/cost of a HF will fade away compared to the cost of not forking. 

Do you really think that the community is going to Softfork when the shit hits the fan? Or that it would change one line of code, and run with that? When push comes to shove, SegWit will still be regarded as too slow. 

&gt; Please, read this.

Stop insulting me, I know how SegWit works. My point still stands: It just NOT a full fledged blocksize increase.

It just isn't. That is **only** the case if everyone upgrades. Which can take years. 

&gt; You predicted that a software project would take longer than initially estimated? Wow! Pitty they terminated the One Million Dollar Challenge, you might have had a shot!

It is pretty sad people assume software projects take longer than estimated. Because I certainly don't work like that. For something where the scope doesn't change, the time should not become longer. And for SegWit the scope became smaller, not bigger. Furthermore if you give an estimate for something where there are lots of unknowns, you don't only give the most optimistic estimate. You give a minimum/maximum time. Not doing that is unprofessional IMHO. And nobody should accept such practices.

It's incredibly frustrating to see arrogant developers full of hubris declare that economic forces no longer exist; that they know better; that only they hold some sort of monopoly on wisdom.

Without a doubt, bitcoin is a technical instrument. It has a code base, and engineers need to build it - that's their job. But we need economists *designing* and reviewing the incentive structure and P2P architecture. That is not the job of an engineer. 

The mistrust of economics on /r/Bitcoin is extraordinarily disheartening. I am an economist and went looking for an asset like bitcoin for all of the obvious reasons years ago. To date, I'm the only person  I know that went looking for something like bitcoin, yet I'm told that I don't understand it because I'm an economist (the irony rings in my ears). I'm told that I can't possibly understand the intricacies because I'm not a developer. Yet I have been a developer, I work in two languages (python/ruby), understand data structures, and am familiar with all the technical aspects. It's incredibly valuable to be literate on both sides of bitcoin architecture. 

So here we are - core devs gave completely neglected one side of bitcoin, and are facing the consequences for it. It's no surprise that they don't understand bitcoin unlimited, because they don't understand bitcoin - they only understand the code base and not the financial incentive structure that glues everything together. 

Thanks for all your work Peter. 

edit: word

Edit 2: I Forgot to mention. The ""fire the miners"" atmosphere in /r/bitcoin is the saddest / funniest in response to the miners not adopting segwit. There is absolutely no conception of the economic incentives that drive miners to mine in the first place. This isn't about ideology, or politics, or best interests - miners mine because it is a productive task, and the genius is that the code incentivizes them to do so. That's the whole point - we don't have to ask the miners to do anything because they already have incentives to do so.

First, it should be obviously clear that increasing the block reward value via price mechanisms is the biggest priority for miners, because it is 90% - 95% of their revenue. And they want that growth to continue through difficulty adjustments so that their revenue continues to grow. the point is, **miners primarily want price increases, not fee increases.**

Secondly, it should be obvious that arguing that fees have any significant impact on miner behavior is absolutely ridiculous. Miners don't want a marginal change to 5% of their revenue at the cost of 95% of their revenue.",2017-02-14 02:39:48

Today, we drop down into a column of Os.  Almost immediately (in PnF terms) the price reversed and came within a dollar of establishing a tentative reversal back up to 1020.

That is what happens in consolidation with Bitcoin.  We have usually done this after a significant change that held significant volume.  Now that volume has dropped to about half of what it was earlier in the week.

Remember, we need to go way, way down into the lower 900’s to break down, so the range is still significantly wide.  The good news is that a move up $10 from where we are right now will start a new formation.  One that is tight and one which should have more of an explosive move in the next direction.  And since the overall trend is up, I need to suggest that we will “pop” up.

But, as most consolidations go, this one could go longer.

I know there is a lot of talk about China and the ETF.  It is impossible to pick one or the other and suggest what is going to happen next.  Even educated guesses are just guesses.  The only wisdom I can pass on about either of these issues is that even in international politics and finance—people act in their own best interest.  Identify “who” is making the decisions and then it is possible to determine their interests.

Good luck during this consolidation period.  Remember, our boxes above $1,000 are $20 each now.  So for the chart to move up significantly, a lot of money is going to be made,

You won't find anything, because the ideas are new!

Actually, that isn't true. I buried the second idea in the appendix of my sidechain risks presentation (because it was already too long). You can find these slides beginning on [page 157 of this deck](http://www.drivechain.info/media/slides/psztorc-sidechain-risks.pdf). It isn't *that* new. Basically, it is a strong preconsensus, advising miners on how to earn more money by agreeing to a future block's hashMerkleRoot. Other benefits include safer lightning channels and a more-logical fee experience. The downside is vaguely slower confirmation. However the current 1st confirmation already takes 10-30 minutes, which is already slow, so the marginal inconvenience is very low. With LN it is a strict improvement with no downsides (that I can see). It allows miners to customize the blockspace they sell, so that it is a better fit for LN.

And the first idea I did [mention in a recent blog post](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/mining-threat-equilibrium/#income-smoothing)! I did refer to it as ""insurance"", though. It is a little hard to explain but basically miners can bet that they will *not* find a block. If they find a block, they lose the bet. If they don't find a block, they win the bet. With some hand-waving, miners can make the exact same amount of money every 10 minutes, whether they find a block or not. This is still very theoretical, but I was doing the math last week, and got some very encouraging results. It might very cheap if the idea is popular among many small miners, and the setup costs seem low. I searched for incentive-vulnerabilities but I haven't found any, yet. But it could still not work for a few reasons.

The efficiency that this combo would have over pools, is something that Ittay Eyal can explain to you, go bother him and not me.

I don't really see any reason to explain anything in more detail. If you prefer more practical stuff, with working code and unit tests, then I am also doing projects at that stage. I try to help at all stages of the R&amp;D process. These two ideas happen to be early ""in the pipeline"", as I say, and I will probably not have time to even work on them for a month or two.

Some people enjoy these posts, either to cheerlead, or to be aware of threats to their livelihood, or to avoid duplication of work or missed collaboration opportunities.

&gt; How does it remove the need for pools - rewards are per block, not per transaction. The reward can't be split up among miners without a pool to collect it and redistribute it.

Correct! *Something* must indeed collect some money and redistribute it. While in the past, people have tried to *defend* against the mining pool, I instead try to build a more efficient version, that has other properties that we like.",2017-02-14 03:50:21

So you can't even argue that rbtc is unmoderated (even if being unmoderated were technically possible on reddit).

A person or community being able to create a moderated forum is integral to their own personal freedom.  It isn't enough to be free to say what you want, you must be free to not say, or create platforms that say, what other people want.

Without this freedom someone who wants to silence you could simply flood any venue you try to use with noise-- abusive, incorrect, distracting, offensive, spam, etc.-- and bury your messages and drive away the readers. This is precisely what people tried to do in rbitcoin a couple years ago-- with hundreds of sock accounts flooding the subreddit with untruthful advocacy of bitcoinxt.

Much of the misinformation in rbtc isn't 'taking the good with the bad'-- it's intentionally promoting an agenda, dishonestly. The bad is the point.

ddqgda7,Dryja,30,"This is an oversimplification bordering on incorrect.  What does ""fine"" mean?  Nobody has, to my knowledge, programmed any LN code to work around the current malleability problems.  The funding process is much more complex without segwit, with various tradeoffs that it'd be best not to expose to users.

Also, what do you mean by ""Bitcoin node""?  Without 3rd party channel monitoring, you still don't need a full node, you can run a lite node, download the full blocks, search through the txids, and discard them.  This is what the 3rd party monitoring [code does now](https://github.com/mit-dci/lit/blob/master/watchtower/watchdb.go#L284)

Without fixing malleability, 3rd party monitoring doesn't work, but I'd say more importantly channel creation doesn't work well.  Either the channel has a fixed duration, or the recipient of the channel needs to put up an equal amount to the channel amount, which can then be recovered after the channel is confirmed.  

There's a bunch of other problems too.  One of the biggest is that everyone programmed LN code using segwit, because... segwit is a pretty clear improvement.  If it doesn't activate for a while, then sure, there are levels of lightning we are prepared to accept.

ddrnry8,ethacct,29,"I'm not exactly a newbie (ie: any of the ONE HUNDRED people who subscribed in the last 24 hours - wowzers!) but i'll tell my story anyways.

Early last summer, I saw a news article about the DAO hack.  I've been a computer nerd all my life and have always kept an ear to the ground when it came to tech news.  I remember reading about Bitcoin when it first came out, but never really following up on it.  Like everyone else, I kick myself for not investing when they were 10 cents a piece, but who could have known back then.  

Anyways, reading the article about the DAO hack got me interested in crypto-currency again and I decided to do some more research.  I looked into mining Bitcoin but quickly realized that unless you have access to the latest ASICs from China, mining BTC was out of the question.  I started to wonder if there was anything else profitable to mine and read more and more about Ethereum, this crypto in the article that had just been hacked.  The more I read, the more enthralled I was -- in the end, the only problem was whether it would survive this attack.  I resolved to wait and see how everything turned out, and figured if it survived, I would both build a mining rig, as well as purchase some outright.

I watched the debate go back and forth on the soft fork, hard fork and no fork on reddit for a MONTH, until eventually the hard fork was implemented.  Seeing the price rise the day after, I made the choice to throw a significant chunk of change at Ethereum.  My first purchase of ETH was around $16....ouch.  Not long after that came the ETC scandal, and then later that summer/fall, all the DoS attacks.  But my conviction never wavered.  The more I read, the more I was convinced that the devs were exceedingly competent, and that they were miles ahead of anyone else on a revolutionary idea (that is, an automated, programmable, trustless, digital currency).

Reading a little about trading (but realizing I'd never be great at it) I decided on a dollar cost averaging strategy, buying what I could, when I could.  My initial chunk of change -- that I thought was hefty at the time -- grew 15x bigger as I invested more over the next half year.  I got my cost basis down to around $11, so it's only in the last days that my investment has been keeping its head above water.  But it could drop to $7 again and I wouldn't be worried.  I'm a hodler in it for the long haul, or at least until I see someone more competent and capable come along.  Sure, I could put this money into an index fund that might gain 5% per year, but this is my swing for the fences.  Moon or bust.

Ryan right? Thank you so much. I'm the person in the picture. I've been playing dota ever since 6.4 and dota 2 from when brewmaster was just released. 

I've tried getting out but all fails when every organization or church or charity assumes you're a terrorist because you're still in Syria. 

I've gone to Jordan, lived there for a year or something. Had to leave because of the insane living standards that required all family members to work full time to stay slightly above the poverty line. The landlords are such assholes, too. We moved 7 times in a year, everything for me got ruined. Especially school, first day in school (I was in grade 9) the religion teacher comes to me and asks me to revise the Quran verse they learned last weekend. I told him I'm a Syrian student that just arrived and it's my first day here, he said ""Syrian, Indian, Indonesian, I don't care. You're gonna recite the verse"" I said ""I'm sorry, I can't."" And he broke the class mop (for some reason they kept a mop?) and beat me with it, fractured my left hand. Had to quit school afterwards, private schools cost anything from 6000 JOD and up (8400 USD) 


As for my name on here, I used to be a very famous scammer, don't give me shit about it, it was the only way I could support my family. The best job I could get would pay me $50 a month with 12 hours of work, scamming was easier. An arcana a week would support us fully. I stopped long ago, though. I got super famous, even the iG page posted about me, I was doing ewhoring, so profitable. Now I'm trading bitcoin and gift cards, sometimes items 😃

ddt628j,CryptoQuiet,40,"Hello everyone. 

Up until this past weekend I was part of a small trading Slack Chat Group with predominantly amateur traders, a few that I would call semi professional,  and 3 full time very successful traders. (one of our amateurs is a semi regular poster here, you know who you are Mr buy the top sell the bottom, j/k). Unfortunately, we are disbanding, and being as I've always loved reading the daily threads here I think I'll try to stick around/contribute when I have something beyond wild speculation to offer. I'll do my best not to overpost, only announcing substantial positions and any major updates to my sentiment. I hope to grow as a new member of the community. 

Typically, I simply announce my substantial positions and pre position strategies and justify my reasoning. I'm not one to post charts regularly, as I feel it doesn't take much effort to make a chart indicate whatever you want it to (though some here post amazing objective charts somewhat often) but I'm happy to backup my positions if anyone has questions. 

While I certainly classify as a permabull, I trade both ways, long and short, with USD and/or Euro as collateral. My bitcoins are only ever used for trading on Bitmex, and only ever a very small percentage with the rest safely in cold storage for long term holding. I try to keep my feelings about bitcoin as a whole out of my trading strategies. As a 'fan boy', it would blind me, and I'd constantly be long even when it wasn't wise. I try to trade it as any other commodity I trade.

Currently I'm 55 BTC short on Finex at an average price of $1027, and long on Mex March Quartelies @ 40,000 contracts averaged at 965. No current Kraken position. Neither is highly leveraged. My Mex position is a longer time lined trade in hopes of ETF approval. I've closed half of it already, so I've locked in enough profit incase we plummet. Will be exiting my Finex short within days come hell or high water, though I'd like to see us retest $1000 for the closure. If we surpass $1040, I'll start scaling the short down, and possibly re shorting higher (without realizing the loss) depending on if the upward volume is convincing as a legitimate breakout. If it is a strong enough leg up, Ill close and eat the loss. 

Glad to join you guys.

ddsfxjq,todu,28,"Your description of how the compromise attempts happened are incorrect.

You're quoting Peter Todd who is quoting Gregory Maxwell as making the original claim that Gavin Andresen made ""an arithmetic error"" when authoring his BIP101. If that would've been true, then Gavin would've lowered his 20 MB to 8 MB and quoted the arithmetic error as the cause for doing that. But the way I remember it, Gavin quoted ""The miners signed a document that they insist on 8 MB instead of 20 MB so I chose 8 MB for BIP101"" as the reason for choosing 8 MB. That ""arithmetic error"" is just Gregory Maxwell saying things.

Besides, the network does not need any blocksize limit at all because too big blocks will propagate so slowly that they'll be orphaned anyway. The original purpose of the blocksize limit was (intended) to protect from malicious miners creating so big blocks that they DDoS the network. But such an attempt never happened, so the limit was never actually necessary. Then a few years later, Blockstream started to pretend that the 1 MB limit was necessary *but for a different reason*. Their reasons are all kinds of reasons except the original reason.

The blocks were only 10 KB big when the blocksize limit was set to 1 MB. *No* miner even tried to ""abuse"" the network by creating 1 MB blocks filled with nonsense. At the time we did not *know* that, but with much history behind us we can see that miners have always created far smaller blocks than they were actually allowed to by the protocol. Because smaller blocks propagate faster which means the odds of winning the block reward increases the smaller the block is.

This is how I remember the many attempts at a compromise and how Blockstream / Bitcoin Core negotiators responded to our many offers:

&gt; This is how Blockstream negotiates with the community:  
&gt; Community: ""We want a bigger block limit. We think 20 MB is sufficient to start with.""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""We want to keep the limit at 1 MB.""  
&gt; Community: ""Ok, we would agree to 8 MB to start with as a compromise.""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""Ok, we would agree to 8 MB, but first 2 MB for two years and 4 MB for two years. So 2-4-8.""  
&gt; Community: ""We can't wait 6 years to get 8 MB. We must have a larger block size limit now!""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""Sorry, 2-4-8 is our final offer. Take it or leave it.""  
&gt; Community: ""Ok, everyone will accept a one time increase to a 2 MB limit.""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""Sorry, we offer only a 1.75 MB one time increase now. How about that?""  
&gt; Community: ""What? We accepted your offer on 2 MB starting immediately and now you're taking that offer back?""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""Oh, and the 1.75 MB limit will take effect little by little as users are implementing Segwit which will take a few years. No other increase.""  
&gt; Community: ""But your company President Adam Back promised 2-4-8?""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""Sorry, nope, that was not a promise. It was only a proposal. That offer is no longer on the table.""  
&gt; Community: ""You're impossible to negotiate with!""  
&gt; Blockstream: ""This is not a negotiation. We are merely stating technical facts. Anything but a slowly increasing max limit that ends with 1.75 MB is simply impossible for technical reasons. We are the Experts. Trust us.""

ddu49sr,_chewtoy_,42,"Another small win for longs today (let's not all start blowing each other just because price moved 3%). 

But below the surface this move is pretty significant. 

1. OKcoin quarterly futures is moving in a big way. From a 10% discount just a few days ago to just shy of a 4% discount against index. I wouldn't be surprised to see it back into a small premium again if spot can break past the $1040 hurdle. 
2. The triangle that most of us have been watching for the past few weeks has broken to the upside. Quite convincingly. 
3. The market is above $1,000 and has been comfortably trading above that key psychological level for about three days now (minus the occasional panic dump that was quickly retraced back above $1,000). The market is establishing a floor there for now, and that's great news. That said, I would not be at all surprised if we dump back below it one last time before testing the ATH. 

So what's in store for the future? As I said the other day, up, up, and away most likely. 

When we first started the move from $800 to $1160 I was debating with /u/jeanduluoz as to how the market would react when it hit the ATH. There were two schools of thought:

1. The market would breeze right past it, because that's what the market did historically when it was presented with breaking above a new ATH.
2. Flash crash of 100% of the move as the market did during the previous two blowups ($300 to $500 and then back to $300. Followed by $470 to $780 and back to $470). 

Well, we all know now which direction the market chose: 100% retrace. 

What's particularly phenomenal about that flash crash is it reinforces the ascending channel that other users have pointed out that becomes apparent when you view the bull trend in log scale:

http://imgur.com/a/5Gszx

That channel right there. It's fucking gorgeous. It's held through 3 cataclysmic dumps (with the exception of the Finex hack dump, which got a bit ahead of itself but was quite rapidly retraced back above the supporting line of the channel). It's an incredibly solid channel, and one anyone trading bitcoin would be wise to pay close attention to.

It's a parallel channel, so it can _technically_ hold indefinitely. But come on now, as if we'll be still watching that channel 10 years from now. Or even 5 years from now. It's likely going to break at some point, and my guess is on an upside break. 

And if it does break to the upside? Sweet mother of god, it's likely going to be a big move. 

What am I doing? Nothing still! But if you followed my last hypothetical trade recommendation, you'd still be long from around $1,000. 

In the short to medium term, I don't think the market is done consolidating. We may still touch the bottom of the channel again. We may bounce around between $1,000 and $1160 for a few weeks (hell, maybe even months). But once the ATH clears, we should bust through the top of the channel in my humble opinion. And if we do, hold onto your butts.

EDIT: It's unlikely I'll be posting again to make a recommendation to close my hypothetical long. But I'd probably get out at $1070 (at least 50% of the position, but probably 100%) and then wait for $1100 to clear. I'd imagine we'll see a dump from $1080 down to $1000 - or possibly lower. Like I said, we probably aren't done consolidating. ",2017-02-17 06:19:30

ddvarqh,_chewtoy_,23,"Not a whole lot to report on the current price movement, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to talk a little about what is arguably the worst trade of my career. 

After I posted yesterday, there were some comments about my 100x 1btc long from around $1000 on Bitmex quarterly. I wound up adding to it to bring the average to about 1.8 btc long (or 180 at 100x) from around $1063.

At the time, the market was breaking out from a short-term consolidation period which was confirmed with a break above $980 on spot. When I entered, the market was somewhere in the vicinity of $960 or something. 

It was a fantastic entry point, but here's where I went wrong and why. 

1. I was trading on a platform I didn't fully understand. I'd literally never used Bitmex before, and that was the very first (and subsequently last) position I entered there. 
2. Due to the abysmal liquidity on the platform, setting stops seemed like an exercise in futility. Volatility on the quarterly caused price to actually dip below my margin-call price twice (but not the mark price, so I wasn't actually margin-called) while I still had the position open. The third time though, the market just kept on falling and I actually was margin-called. In short, there were 2 times where a stop loss would have fucked me and 1 time where a stop loss would have saved me. 
3. The final move that rekt me started at like 5:00 a.m. my time, and I was blissfully unaware it was even happening. But at the time, it looked identical to the previous two moves that recovered and kept moving up. By the time I wiped the sleep crust out of my eyes and assessed the situation, I was already doomed. 
4. I had always asserted that 100x was essentially gambling no matter how you slice it, and I approached the position accordingly. It was a gamble in my eyes, and I didn't approach it as a normal trade. Huge mistake, btw. 

Mentally, I had a $1,800 gamble on the line that I was more than comfortable losing (I was routinely opening $20,000 to $40,000 positions on OKcoin at the time, so the disconnect isn't as farfetched as it might appear). 

Had I opened the position on OKcoin, I would have set stop losses as the price continued to climb, and I likely would have gotten out somewhere in the $1200 range (OKcoin quarterlies traded as high as $1300+ just before the crash). Instead, I put too much faith in the market to recover at least to form a double-top at $1160 on spot. But alas, it never did. 

I'm at peace with the loss (although I actually squeaked out 2 btc in profit from the whole ordeal, because I pocketed 3 btc on the way up). But here's what you can all learn from my mistake:

1. Always take profit on the way up. Always. Always. Always. Barring that, set stop losses to take profit on winning positions if critical support fails. Not everyone agrees with setting stop losses, but I've generally been a proponent for them.
2. Know the platform you are trading on. This one is a no brainer, but I used to field a lot of basic questions about exchange functionality from people who were taking positions first and asking questions later. You can trade on most exchanges with as little as .01 btc. If you can turn .01 into .02 in a month, then you might be ready to turn 1 btc into 2. If you get lucky and turn .01 into .02 in an hour...that doesn't mean you're ready to up the risk. Take the time to learn how stop losses/margin-calls work on each platform. Know the different between a market order and a limit order. If you are trading futures, take some time to watch the liquidity on various contract periods. 100x is appealing, but it can cost you A LOT of money in profits if you have 0 hope of escaping your position without ridiculous slippage. 
3. Money is money. Just because you are losing ""profit"" instead of ""account balance"" doesn't magically make a bad position less bad. 
4. Treat every position EXACTLY THE SAME regardless of the circumstances around the position. It takes discipline, but if you can't treat a position worth $100 the same as you would one that's worth $100,000, you shouldn't be trading either amount. 
5. Toss emotion and expectations out the window. In my above example, I made the cardinal sin of trading: I traded what I thought the market _should_ do, not what the market _was doing_. The market broke below an ascending channel (that it had previously broken above), then broke back above it, then broke back into it and below it. All in the span of like 5 hours. At the very least this should have been a sign to me that the market was uncertain and entering a state of turmoil...but I brushed it off as just bitcoin being bictoin. Instead, I should have gotten the fuck out until the market figured itself out.

Interesting to note he thinks the intrinsic value of Ethereum is a 12 billion cap, which if you apply the 1-3% inflation rate achieved after Casper you get a much higher price per coin than his $60

Also I don't think Ethereum has a single point of failure any more than Bitcoin. The Ethereum foundation is not a single point of failure, any more than Bitcoin core is a single point of failure for Bitcoin. And the Bitcoin mining cartels in China are perhaps a single point of failure for Bitcoin.

There are many more groups of DEVs behind Ethereum than Bitcoin. 

ETH does not have an 80% chance of failing. If it did the market would not be valuing it at 1 billion.

*You wrote a lot and did not answer any of my original questions:*

Can you define exactly what bitcoin decentralization is, and how many nodes we need?

Also can you provide any proof that bitcoin needs to be saved from itself[by your proposed solutions]?
",2017-02-18 07:47:46
ddwogn9,thezerg1,138,"&gt; For a start what you are proposing would split the blockchain in 2, with 2 different coins as a result, and with exchanges starting to trade BTC and BTU.

This is unlikely because the 1MB fork would be by definition a minority fork and would have significant negative pressures, the biggest being that it has a 1MB block size and &gt; 20 minute average blocks.  So tx fees would be terrible.

If there actually IS a niche for the slow 1MB minority chain, then its better for holders if Bitcoin splits into it, rather than an altcoin take it over.

&gt; And what about new adopters,

New adopters need to understand how Bitcoin actually works, not have its most fundamental consensus process hidden from them.  Also, without &gt; 1MB blocks, new adoption will dry up.  TX fees and confirmation delays are already terrible, what will they be like if just 2x more people start using Bitcoin?  And note that by definition, that would mean that the current users must start using Bitcoin HALF AS MUCH.  With the 1MB limit in place, every new adopter is pushing someone else's use out.

&gt; A 1.5x increase every 2 years will be utterly and completely insufficient. We really need the transactions to be processed on second layers, there's just no other way.

Yes, most BU people think that 1st layer and 2nd layer solutions should compete in the marketplace.  We are the free market choice.  But BTW, even with 2nd layer solutions, we STILL need a block size increase.  Lightning scales the number of transactions a particular individual can make, but does not scale the number of individuals.  It essentially is a great optimization for a use case that is unused today -- daily small purchases.

Also, to retain its lead, its important that Bitcoin be scalable onchain as far as technically possible, but no further.  This allows it to be the best, most widely adopted chain possible through today's physical internet.  No altcoin will be able to beat it.  Today, all major altcoins outscale Bitcoin.  This is a big problem.

&gt; The BU repository is branched off 0.12.1, when 0.14 is going to be released in a few days.

We have been pulling useful Core changes into our code base for months.

&gt; WRT segwit

The problem is that its about ""technical debt"", look it up if you don't know the term.  There are much simpler ways to achieve its aims, completely.  For example, do you understand that segwit fixes malleability, **for segwit transactions only**.  So if you are an attacker, just don't use segwit transactions...  It doesn't matter how perfectly or competently segwit is coded if its not a useful solution.

&gt; WRT LN

As I said previously we propose a market-based approach where technologies like LN can compete.  After the block size HF, the next thing we will do is ensure that issues blocking LN (and other technologies) are solved.

The ""segwit is here, lets try it argument"" is morally repugnant because larger blocks have been here for years and the segwit side did not try it.  Please do not parrot our own argument back in a much weaker form.

Post segwit, will the block size ever be increased?  Here are 2 arguments that hints at the true intentions of those in control at core:  
 
  1. Segwit would be MUCH simpler as a hard fork.  So why do segwit now and a hard fork later, it makes no sense.  If you ever intend to hard fork, better to do it with the segwit functionality.

  2. Segwit gives 1.7 MB of ""effective"" space, for a 4MB liability.  So post segwit, a HF that increases the block size to 4MB means that there's a 16MB liability... how does allowing 16MB blocks sound to you?

ddworvk,nolo_me,90,"&gt; So you admit that a second layer will be crucial and indispensable.

Absolutely. There are many use-cases for instant transactions where 0-conf is too risky and 10 minutes is too long.

Edit: I'm fine with the second layer fixing problems with the first. What I'm not ok with is deliberately crippling the first layer to create problems for the second layer to solve. 

&gt; I would also like to know why you think that the blockchain should process the payments directly rather than being a settlement layer given how bad it is at doing that, due to it being very slow.

Because it's trustless and irreversible.

&gt; I really don't get why do you think that it's so important to do a risky HF now to allow 1.5X scaling every 2 years rather than at least wait until second layer scaling solutions are in place.

ddxihws,Blocksteamer,30,"For all of Bitcoin history there was a plan to have the blocksize increase past 1mb. Satoshi originally put in the 1mb blocksize to stop spam back when very few people were using the network. The expected and mundane plan was to eventually increase this when real transactions started filling blocks. 

About two years ago, many of the Core devs decided it was time to do this. But a splinter group of the Core devs effectively led by a man name Greg Maxwell. Greg had long made fun of bitcoin and pretty much only got involved after the price got to 1000 in 2013. He teamed up with other Adam Back, another programmer who had done nothing but critizie and laugh at hte concept of Bitcoin. These two people who didn't really understand why it worked formed a company called Blockstream which was funded by some of the biggest banks and financial companies in the world. Being a Core dev this gave Greg a lot of money to work away and attempt to influence the Bitcoin from the inside out. 

Instead of increasing the blocksize, he pushed for keeping the blocksize at 1mb... and turning bitcoin into a settlement system in conjunction with a second network... the Lightning Network. While this would be an open network and anyone could collect fees by running LN hubs... it would also allow blockstream to make money by collecting fees. 

The thing is it isn't needed. Bitcoin can function just fine the way it always has by simply increasing the blocksize. 

Greg unfortunately is quite the bully and a generally toxic, gaslighter, and managed to push the original, reasonable Core devs further and further away. Gavin... a man appointed by Satoshi Nakamoto to lead development got frustrated as did Mike Hearn, another reasonable Core dev. Together they created Bitcoin XT in an attempt to increase the blocksize and keep development going as long planned.  Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited would follow.

Theymos... the top mod of r/bitcoin and the owner of the popular bitcointalk.org... decided to side with Greg and this new trojan horsed Core dev team along with its Blockstream VC funded by banks (the people who have the most to lose from bitcoin success) He decided that any new Bitcoin client like XT would be declared an altcoin, any discussion of increasing blocksize would be censored, and anything critical of Core or Blockstream would be censored. Mass bannings began. Until he removed visible voting, his posts would routinely get -100 thumbs down. He completely removed the option for open debate... and to allow the best ideas to win in the end. He has done everything possible to control the message to assist the trojan horsed Core dev team. He had previously bragged about being able to control entire communities via this type of censorship. His actions have caused massive damage to the bitcoin community.

2. If Core is no longer the reference client there is no chance he'll leave. He's not going anywhere.

3. Every time that he has said he will either stay or leave bitcoin development, G-Max has always insisted that it would not have any financial or personal impact on him or Blockstream. 

4. He always talks about how they plan to make no money off of the Lightning Network. 

5. It doesn't [matter] at all if SegWit never activates. 

6. He has plenty of other things to work on and whatever happens in the bitcoin client space is of absolutely zero consequence to Blockstream and their investors. 

You really can't make this stuff up. G-Max threatens to leave, and then he threatens that he'll never leave. His company invests millions of dollars in developing and promoting certain pieces of code to merge into Core, and then he claims that those millions of dollars are basically just a charity donation in the sense that if all of it goes to waste it will not be the least bit of a disappointment to him or any of his investors. Nothing he says has any consistency at all, and I do not thank him for his time coming here to communicate when all he does is attempt to deceive people. Honesty is worthy of appreciation.

ddy4wv5,Merlin560,41,"Point and Figure Chart

I thought I would come on with a quick update and reiterate what the chart is saying.

First of all, we are still in a column of Xs.  The peak so far was in the $1060 box when we hit $0173 the other day.  The drop that is going on right now is not even a move on the chart.  In order to reverse down to a column of Os (going down) we have to move down three boxes.  It would have to go below $1,020.  It doesn’t feel like a drop that far is at hand.

So any price from $1020 up to 1079 is noise.  Yes, a lot of people trade noise.  I could never get it to work on the long timeframe.  And being an old guy, I hate losing my money.

So—those are the boundaries of the “playground”.  If it goes over $1079…its probably going to continue.  If it bounces off, say $1,045 its probably going to stay in the noise range.

Over the past couple of weeks I’ve been mentioning the change in TA since the volumes in China have calmed down.  In my eye, since then this has behaved pretty well.

Here is my guess:

Over the next few days we approach another high on this column.  My guess is that we go up another two boxes or so, and then pull back to the 1040 range.  We consolidate in 1060-80 range for a few days and then we start moving up with with some more momentum going into the 3/11 date.

This is advice from an old guy (at least in this game) is that if you are holding trading stocks and you have a nice profit going into the 8th or 9th of March, take a little off the table.  That might be the best hedge out there.  Your remaining coins will go up in value or they are going to drop.  In these instances, where everyone KNOWS where it will go if “A” happens.  Then B happens and the market tanks.  Or, A happens and the market tanks too.  Think about what happened when Trump won or when Brexit won.  The markets tanked.  They were going to tank anyway.

My guess is the knee-jerk reaction will be a pop, followed by everyone who bought the rumor runs to the door.  Then when it starts going down, a panic ensues.  The portion of coins that you sold before will be there in fiat.  The coins you left will withstand the few days of the market.  And the money you have will be spent buying more for the swing up.

The last thing I would warn people is watch for a wicked swing in the alts.  I would not want to try to hedge or arbitrage this this with those.

Finally, if there are options/futures coming due that Friday, watch how the the big blocks go, and then where the most bets are made.  

The media missed Brexit because they did not pay attention to the number of bets—they paid attention to the average money per bet amount.  The rich brokers were sure it was going to go, and they were putting down fewer, but very large bets.  The regular guys was voting in larger numbers, but only ten pounds at a time.  

Bad news is always released on Friday afternoon because “the markets are closed and no one pays attention over the weekend.”  Not so with Bitcoin.

Good News is almost always released on Tuesday morning.  The are a few obvious exceptions…but in a general sense this is true.

Since the deadline is a Saturday, I have no idea if they will even do anything.  They could do a pocket veto and just do nothing and let it go.  Then the market will go apeshit.  (That is a technical term.)

ddxv076,petertodd,40,"&gt; Due primarily to RBF implementation

Nope. What Bitcoin Core implemented is opt-in RBF, which is clearly labeled as replaceable, so there's no double-spend risk for merchants above and beyond normal transactions. Opt-in RBF is just a DoS attack resistant version of the same transaction replacement that Satoshi had in the early days, and Mike Hearn himself wanted to add back to Bitcoin years ago.

The real reason why merchants have stopped accepting zeroconf is simply better education about the risks, risks that have always existed. For example, look at my own [doublespend vulnerability testing of wallets](https://petertodd.org/2016/are-wallets-ready-for-rbf), which showed most popular wallets were trivial to doublespend, and *wouldn't even warn you* that you have been ripped off. Similarly my famous Coinbase double-spend *did not* make use of Bitcoin Core's opt-in RBF (I've had Coinbase employees privately tell me they've lost tens of thousands of dollars in zeroconf doublespends, money lost *prior* to Bitcoin Core adding RBF).

On top of that, BU requires human input to calculate the final block size limit, which seems like a no-go for a system that self sustains on simple automated incentives.


Particularly, BU proposes a hard-fork to deal with the block size limit. Moreover, they will need to hard-fork AGAIN if they want to solve malleability, or otherwise, add Segwit to their code. If they choose Segwit, they will need to write it from scratch from the Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 codebase which BU is currently using. Until malleability is solved, off-chain scalability is a big pain, so the BU proposal may put Bitcoin in limbo for years to come before any significant scaling is put forward.

ddz6meu,FeedMeYourPrompts,31,"Journal,

Have you ever heard of the book *Looking For Alaska*? I've probably told you what it is. Well, one of the characters is quite the prankster. I don't wanna ruin anything for you, but I've gotta find a way to one-up her. I've basically got an unlimited budget here, too.

Yeah, that's right, journal. I won the lottery!

I don't think I've ever been happier. I talked with my retirement planner and I'm actually pretty much set for life. I don't have to work again unless I want to. And, of course, you know I hate my coworkers and my job, but I've already gone on and on and on about that. You have a great memory. I just wanna run some ideas by you about how to get fired in the best way possible.

The first thing I thought of was not being a jerk. I submitted my intent of retirement, which means I have two weeks. So, I have two weeks to plan this prank, but I don't wanna hurt anyone, or make anyone hate me. I just want to be remembered. Second, not too much money. I won 249 million, and there were no split winners, but the pool was originally 643 million, which is why I bought a ticket in the first place. After taxes and stuff, I'll have a quarter of a billion dollars. It's a lot, but life takes a lot of money, so I wanna be careful. And, third, I want people to know it was me. 

So, that's the criteria. Here are my ideas. 

- Set up a Bitcoin mine in the IT room, eat up the bandwidth and make money for it. Then, pay the IT guys to pretend there is some crazy server thing going on, basically send the whole company into a panic, and then they go into the server room and find my whole operation, the boss would know it was me. But, I'm basically immune anyways. That's implied on the rest of these, by the way.

- Stay late one night and put glitter in the fans of everyone's computer. Pretty self-explanatory, but I don't know how much damage that would do to a computer. It is just glitter, after all.

- Laxatives in the water coolers.

- Buying buckets of live ladybugs and unleashing them in the workspace.

- Alternatively, buying buckets of assorted animal feces off of the Internet and unleashing them in the workspace.

- Take all of the keyboards and hide them in the basement of the office, once they get down there I close and lock the door on the people who found the keyboards.

- Last one so far, buy multiple speakers and hook up an iPod, hide the speakers, and blast a playlist of hated songs, like Justin Bieber or something. 

I'll you if I think of anything else. Thanks for listening to my ideas, journal. You've always been there for me, even when my coworkers haven't. I don't have very many friends now that I'm all grown up. Maybe now it'll be a little easier to find someone on Tinder.

Talk to you soon, and I'll tell you how the prank goes.

GBMiners changed to BU and suddenly got a huge boost in hashrate the day after Jihan Wu visited them in India. Other Chinese pools/miners are scared to support Segwit because then Jihan will not provide them with mining equipment anymore.

de0hwuy,aquahol,50,"Interesting if legit, but my money's on Greggers trying to manufacture a scandal as he realizes he's being shown the door out of bitcoin.

**EDIT:** Ok, I enjoy a good internet mystery, and have been looking at the evidence that has been posted so far and trying to determine what may have transpired between Greg and Soupernerd. my thoughts:

1. I do not believe Greg would go so low as to photoshop a screenshot. He might, but as much as I dislike him I think even that seems too dishonorable (and there would be considerable backlash if discovered)
2. The email and signature on the email check out. This does not conclusively prove that /u/SouperNerd is the same person who emailed Greg from the outlook.com email address. What would conclusively verify this is if there are others in the community who have communicated with SouperNerd at that email address, and especially if he has signed messages from that key before.
3. One thing that sticks out to me is the email, which was sent on October 7th (or 8th.. timezones) has the subject line ""Leaving r/btc."" On October 14th, /u/SouperNerd posted a thread, ""[Thank you to the bitcoin community](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57eb4w/thank_you_to_the_bitcoin_community/)"", announcing his departure as moderator and expressing similar dismay that was expressed in the PMs and email sent to Greg. I think this point lends credibility to Greg's assertion that the SouperNerd reddit account may have changed hands.
4. **What does this mean?** Well, he's not a moderator anymore. And he voluntarily stepped down as moderator a week after he supposedly sent the PM and email. The only value the account seems to have is the little flair next to his name that says ""former moderator"". This thread is currently being used in /r/bitcoin as drama-bait to show what a shitty little sub /r/btc is. But if SouperNerd's account *did* change hands, which there is still no proof of, it has no ramifications for this sub. 
5. Perhaps SouperNerd's account changed hands. Perhaps he did try to sell it, was unsuccessful, and it did not change hands. If it did change hands, who bought it? I need to emphasize: **It looks like Greg is telling the truth about his communications w. SouperNerd, but there is no proof for the claim the account was actually sold. I am not concluding anything here, maybe more evidence will come out one way or the other.**
6. Greg, I apologize for my hasty assertions in this post pre-edit and for assuming the worst of you. You have shown yourself to be dishonest and manipulative many times before, so it should not be a surprise that the first instinct of many people in here when you come around making claims is one of distrust. This post does nothing to change my views on you, but I do apologize for assuming the worst. I think it is interesting that you (allegedly; still not conclusive) received a PM from a moderator of /r/btc trying to sell his account and have sat on that info until now.
7. To any North Corean refugees reading this (that's /r/bitcoin), please note that this is not an anti-Core subreddit, this is a free-speech subreddit. Sentiment tends to be overwhelmingly anti-Core, but I believe that the Bitcoin community is above blind faith in people. I am satisfied with what Greg has posted, and I do not regard SouperNerd, or Roger, or anyone else for that matter as holy figures who may not be spoken out against. If the account really did change hands, then this is important information to know. 

As long as you are here in this silly subreddit, maybe stick around a while and try to understand our point of view a little better, too. We believe in free speech. Yes, there are from time to time lies, FUD, personal attacks, and even conspiracy theories that get posted here and entertained. But this subreddit absolutely does not believe in deleting ""unfavorable"" posts like /r/bitcoin is obsessed with doing. We believe that the truth is important and misinformation can be dispelled through more communication, not through allowing our moderators to decide, opaquely, what information we are allowed to see or not. Use your own head. Just because you see something posted here doesn't mean everyone believes it.

Moverover larger blocksizes can actively hurt fungibility: They make it hard to use Bitcoin over tor and other anonymous communications methods, they especially make it harder to mine bitcoin with such tools. They create pressures to centralize mining, and centralized miners/pools are choke points which can be used to hurt fungibility. And to whatever extent fungibility improvements need more resources, those resources aren't available for their use if all the system can support is loaded up with transactions.

Fungibility and capacity are both key factors in being useful as money-- But Bitcoin will never win a capacity/low-fee fistfight against centeralized systems: they're simply better at those things.

de0tus0,TheSecretMe,33,"

That makes no sense though. Essentially what I’m saying is bitcoin will fail either way. Cryptocurrency needs mass acceptance if it is to grow beyond what it is right now. The proliferation of services that makes bitcoin easier to buy and easier to use for a fee demonstrates perfectly where it’s falling short.

The funny thing is that bitcoin is good at something that people don’t care about. It’s really bad at everything people do care about. Which is why there’s such a proliferation of exchanges and vendor services that try to make bitcoins easier to use for a fee. Ironically for mainstream users that destroys the promise that bitcoin will free you from banks and other institutions that levy fees in order to let you manage your finances. All it succeeded in is shifting the financial management from a reasonably well regulated industries to a wild west of pioneering services.

What Bitcoin needs for success is a centralised effort to provide a very tightly directed and simplified user experience as well as the entire personal support and accountability structure that people expect of any organisation that they trust with their financial transactions. Essentially exactly what bitcoin is intended not to be.

Blockchain technology has a strong future. Bitcoin does not. As soon as the investment is worth it, some or multiple entities will develop bitcoin-like currencies with none of the self sufficiency and privacy and all of the user friendliness and customer service that bitcoin lacks. Further more I predict that it will require a massive endorsement by an authority that doesn’t have to be liked, but does have to be trusted to be “too big to fall” simply because people can’t afford to have the system processing their livelihood to fall. And that means either governments or some kind of corporate construction.

Bitcoin itself won’t be more than a footnote for tech buffs and historians. The difference between bitcoin and whatever digital currency will succeed is the difference between Graham Bell’s telephone and a functional global telecommunication infrastructure. One is a proof of concept, the other is a functional product that people need.

Bitcoin is it’s own worst enemy in the sense that it shows the world and bitcoin’s competitors how to do it right by example of doing it wrong. It demonstrates all the potential without any of the qualities it needs to succeed in achieving mass acceptance.",2017-02-22 00:36:30

de132rx,seweso,29,"I'll try to create an unbiased description:

Bitcoin Core is three things:

1. A development process, with strict rules and guidelines
1. A group of developers adhering to those guidelines
1. A reference client, which defines the Bitcoin protocol

You can see it as a funnel, which takes input from developers, filters it, massages it, until it delivers a new version of the Core reference client. 

Where things go wrong is that this process isn't impartial, and Core as a whole has a huge influence on Bitcoin. 

1. Be it from people thinking it is impartial and the only way to professionally develop Bitcoin. 
1. Be it from people who attack anyone who tries to go around this process. 
1. Be it from people who censor all major forums to prevent anyone promoting alternatives
1. Be it from people who are lazy and think Core is Bitcoin. 
1. Be it from Core developers who threaten to leave Bitcoin if anyone else can change Bitcoin 
1. Be it from people who think Bitcoin has failed if Bitcoin can change without overwhelming consensus (which includes Core itself)
1. Be it from Core being mostly awesome in the things they develop
1. Be it from the collapse of the Bitcoin Foundation, putting the onus on developers instead. 
1. Be it from people being into Bitcoin yet still craving authority to tell them what to do

There is simply no denying that Bitcoin Core has a huge say in what Bitcoin does, or doesn't do. 

As a defence they say that Core cannot force anyone to run their software, and even they cannot change whatever they like. Which is correct. But at the moment we are not concerned about the changes they are making to Bitcoin, but mostly about the one they don't: Remove the temporary blocksize-limit Satoshi added to prevent DOS attacks via huge blocks. 

So the question you have to ask yourself is: Can you change Bitcoin by **not** changing something? To which I say: Yes! Of course! 

So there is where things go haywire. Core as a development process isn't impartial regarding the belief that Bitcoin should be very hard to change. And you might think ""How is that a bad thing?"".

Well, consider you sitting in a bus heading for a ravine, would you consider not steering a good thing? No, you understand that ""not doing something"" and blocking a certain action has very real consequences. 

And in a changing world is not changing really always the most conservative thing to do? Clearly if you are driving a bus, not going off a ravine is more conservative. You've never gone off a cliff before. So better keep steering! 

Same goes for the blocksize-limit. It has always been far above actual transaction volume. Fees were cheap, confirmations were predictable and relatively fast. Running into the limit would mean a HUGE change to Bitcoin. Surely something which needs consensus, or at least some kind of design. 

Maybe another good comparison is this: [Imaging you are in a classroom, and all the windows are closed, but it is getting really hot. The teacher now proposes a vote whether or not to open the windows. But he says, we need at leat 95% agreement to open them. Because he says, we don't want a tyranny of the majority telling the minority what to do.] You understand how that doesn't make any sense? You are effectively switching a tyranny of the majority for a tyranny of the minority(!). Clearly there is a reason why votes are usually counted 50/50. 

The question for you is, do you think Bitcoin needs to adapt to compete with alt-coins? Or do you think its intrinsic value comes from being hard to change? And that this is what provides confidence and security? 


Edit: For those coming in hot, the metaphor for a ravine is only meant to illustrate that doing nothing can obviously be bad.

http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent

Adam Back - the CEO of Blockstream responded with FUD and accused Gavin of doing a coup when he released BIP101 for review by the Core developers:


&gt;Adam Back: ""[Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/the-bitcoin-for-is-a-coup)""

**Contention is being manufactured where there is none** - people can choose to support or not. 

BIP101 which included the  following features which should make **it obvious it's not a coup**: 

* 1 year of preparation before it could be activated.

* it required 75% of miners to agree to the block size increase. before it could be activated.

* if activated a grace period would allowing the network to upgrade before a &gt;1MB block could be mined. 

* an additional implementations of bitcoin called XT - Effectively more distributed control over development - less centralization the opposite of a coup and centralized control takeover.

* if more than 25% of miners found it **contentious** - it would never have an opportunity to activate.  

* at the time Gavin held full control over Bitcoin repo on GitHub, and did not dictate what happens in bitcoin development


Ignorant small bock fundamentalists proclaiming this was contentious and would split the network.

u/adam3us could maybe give us a definition of what he meant when he says ""coup"" he sounds very aggressive as if his control of bitcoin was under threat: 

What followed was a closed door Hong Kong meeting where the CEO of Blockstream Adam Back meat with 80% of the bitcoin hashing power. After a 17 hour meeting an agreement, to block any hard fork proposals and wait until BS/Core releases segwit, was made. 

&gt;**what Adam said:**

&gt;Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

de2tanj,paperraincoat,80,"Apologies, here's a repost from six months ago for the newbies:


Seriously guys, avoid day-trading. There's a reason HODL is a meme here. You can agonize over if Ethereum is syphoning off market share, the DAO will impact prices, exchanges going offline, governments outlawing it, pending scaling upgrades, private blockchains, hacks, thefts, political forking and venture capital all you want, it's all just noise. The concept is solid, proven, but adoption takes time.


The way you make money is to wait for the next spike, i.e. years. We've had four major 10x (or higher) bubbles and crashes. I stressed and theorized like crazy watching things crash from $214 down to $88. I had friends call me up yelling/crying because they lost thousands of dollars, panicked and sold, and friends who thought they were geniuses making an extra $400 timing a dip... and it was an utter waste of time and effort. The two friends that don't handle stress well sold around $100 after chewing me out on the phone, and then watched in horror as Bitcoin went from $90 to $1150.


The friends that did a little research, bought what they could and just went on with their life, not checking the chart every day, assuming I'd let them know if something interesting happened made a lot of money. (Ok, to be fair here, one got Gox'd.)


Bitcoin is still in relatively few hands. These whales wait for anything resembling bad news and cause 20% crashes to buy in lower. Ignore it. Get off r/bitcoin and go play video games and drink and try new restaurants and stuff. The next spike is coming.


Carry on. :)

de2t01w,StormingJ,57,"Alright I can confidently say I've read every piece of feedback regarding the ETF, and I've reached my opinion on it.

While I still can't speak for the impact they may or may not have on the SECs decision, another user implied to me is was basically 0 but I don't quite believe that, I think the only conclusion that can be drawn from the feedback is almost overwhelming support.

I would say the majority of feedback was strictly in favor, probably at least 60% but I didn't tally an exact count. For the most part the main criticisms from the other feedback towards the ETF can be dismissed as either an emotional bias against bitcoin, a misunderstanding/misinformation about bitcoin/blockchain (some of which other feedback directly addressed to clear up), one potential corporate attempts to slow the ETF for a chance to launch their own (which was again called out in another letter), and potential flaws with the filing, including storage and security of coins, resolving conflicts of interest between the ETF and the exchange, what will happen in the result of a hard fork etc.

Of these, the ones that really matter are the last section relating to the filing itself and as of the latest amendments, I believe they have been resolved.

I've seen it said that the SEC's goal is first and foremost to protect perspective investors and one of the interesting thing from the feedback was the common argument that allowing the ETF to go forward would bring a large amount of security to potential investors who are already, and going to continue, investing in bitcoin anyway. I've also been told that the SEC works on the basis of ""everything is okay unless there's a problem"" as opposed to ""nothing is allowed unless approved"". I've never taken any interest in the SEC or its activities before so I'm not familiar with their history so if there's something relevant I should know please let me. 

One other final note worth mentioning is that the SEC has never approved a filing by no comment, so while we shouldn't say it's impossible it's highly improbably and we shouldn't consider it, we should instead try to justify why they may or may not approve it. 

On a personal level, I have bias towards wanting to see it succeed so I'm likely suffering from a bit of confirmation bias here. I'd really appreciate any conflicting opinions of bits of information if you disagree with my analysis or conclusion, but unless someone can direct me to a strong reasoning for why the SEC may still want to reject the proposal my outlook is very positive.",2017-02-23 04:15:57

I feel like the fundamentals are bad. Or lacking. Ever check out the r/BitcoinMarkets Fundamental Fridays sticky post? It's been months since there's been more than 5 comments on it.

Let's go down my quick list.

* Non-productive asset, like gold. Not a disqualifier, but a mark against any investment in my book. Sometimes people point at the potential for this or that killer app, but then you should invest in bitcoin companies, not bitcoin. The currency itself seems fairly zero-sum.
* Prone to hackery, theft, counterparty risk. People should account for this. So many exchanges hacked and customer funds stolen. Sure, keep it on a paper wallet.. but that's not very useful yeah?
* High fees everywhere. Putting money into the system and taking it out again for under 2% loss is pretty good. Trades are a percentage, not flat fee.
* Poor regulation. Safe to assume all the exchanges are trading against you.
* Fanatic crowd. Everyone yelling about bubbles all the time. Waiting for bubbles. Predicting bubbles. Wanting bubbles. Going into unrelated subs and writing what a great opportunity it is to buy at record highs. Feels bad. 
* Lack of scaling. 7 transactions a second?
* 10%ish annual inflation via 'hidden fees' that go to the miners to run the system. Billed to the system as a whole, BTC transactions probably cost around $8 each.
* I'm skeptical about the long term ability of the system to work on a transaction-fee basis once the mining reward shrinks too much.
* A dysfunctional and combative developer community to fix above  issues.
* Merchant adoption continues to be poor. Almost no one spends it.
* Potential for early adopters to disrupt via huge amounts of ""dark"" coins.
* I think a bank-supported blockchain with customer friendly features and UI has a lot of potential to displace BTC from most mainstream applications.
* I think a truly anonymous crypto has the potential to displace BTC from a lot of the shadier stuff.
* Ethically, I dislike how it's tied up with hackers, ransomware, child porn, money laundering, etc. etc. 
* I also dislike the huge energy cost and carbon footprint of mining.

That tipping point will be when major payment processors (specifically Coinbase and/or BitPay) decide to become somewhat currency-agnostic, and 'Pay with BitPay' will let you pay in more currencies than Bitcoin.  

I don't know which coin that would be, but if Coinbase and BitPay threw their support behind the same one, I think it would become the *de facto* successor to Bitcoin (or at least companion to Bitcoin).  

Whatever coin this is, it would have to be one of the '3rd gen' coins (Bitcoin being 1st Gen, Bitcoin-fork altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin being 2nd gen, totally new concepts like Ethereum being 3rd gen).  It would have to be a coin that encourages use both for transactions and longer term value store.  It would have to have a robust development team and be subject to security audits.  And it would need exchanges running trading pairs to all other major currencies (BTC, USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY, CHF).  There are a couple of coins that come pretty close to this requirement today.  

Amusingly, if this happened, I suspect a handful of small-block Bitcoin users would actually say it's a good thing.  They'd willingly move daily transaction volume onto the new coin, and argue that Bitcoin is a better store of long term value.

de5ju3v,Merlin560,54,"Point and Figure Chart

This is one of those days when you look at the TA and it does not make any sense.  Two months from now you will be talking about the day it dropped off the ATH (again) and reversed quickly.  And when you look at the chart…it doesn’t show up.

What happened is that after the close on Thursday (7PM EST) the price continued to rise until it broke through the $1,220 level.  That was a move in the direction or the column, so we mark the X and “Its Official”…we are still in an uptrend.

When this happens (a move in the direction of the column) you stop unless it moves up again.  The decline would not be measured until the next day if the low is below the reversal point.  At this point in the day it is not because the recovery was strong and swift.

This is what I mean when I say that these charts “take out the noise.”  The movements last night appear to be noise.  In fact, the price was higher this morning than it was when I left the office yesterday.  Had I not looked at the daily chart this morning I never would have seen the drop.

My 95 year old mother in law was a little miffed when I looked at the chart this morning and said, “Fuck me…”  I reminded her that my name was on the mortgage and she can move into a nursing home any time she wants. 

Moving to other TA for a second, there IS something concerning about that drop.  The candlestick chart shows a red candle that fully engulfs the green candle before it.  If todays price action stays within that candle it could become a fully engulfing pattern—which can be an indicator of a sudden change in direction.

So, here are the points to look for today:

1.  The chart is in a column of Xs topping out in the $1220 box.  A move into the $1240 range will add another box to the chart.
2. We are still in a long pole warning.  Last nights action would have fulfilled that warning and we would be forming a new pattern right now.  My guess is that if we were on an EST chart, we would be in a new formation now.  
3. The reversal point is now at 1160.  
4. The Long Pole Warning would take us about six boxes down—to about $1,100.
5. A negative breakdown happens under $1,000.  Not a big fear today.
6. The price target is STILL $1,260.
7. It is, of course, “Anything Can Happen” Friday.  (Its a Mickey Mouse Club reference.  And I am too young to have watched the MMC.)

I like when we are over $1,000 a bitcoin.  We can drop $160 and STILL be over $1,000.  I can live with consolidation at this level for a while.

de45b3i,Barkey_McButtstain,49,"Yesterday I posted [news that the 876 Bitcoins of 120,000 Bitcoins stolen from Bitfinex that started moving last month](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vkunk/5_of_876_btc_up_for_grabs_after_some_shuffling/)  were currently being shuffled around and accumulating at address  [14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D) , after which they were being moved to various sites, one of which I identified as being the [Ponzi site btc2x](https://btc2x.me/) , and what appeared to be other Ponzi/gambling sites and exchanges.

 For those unacquainted with Bitcoin Blockchain tracing, simply copy any of the [confirmed addresses from the hack](https://gist.github.com/MrChrisJ/4a959a51a0d2be356cc2e89566fc1d87) that started moving last month and paste them into an explorer. I find the [bitinfocharts explorer](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/explorer/) to work well for this, although it lacks some details (such as identifying named outputs like exchanges), but any explorer should work to trace the path of these coins. Once you paste the address in, just start following the outputs forward. In some cases the criminal has been cleaving off portions of each group at some addresses (later recombined with the rest), in which case I followed the larger group. I tried maybe ten groups of 4 btc from the hack, and ALL of them ended up in address 14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D after 12-15 in/out shuffles. I think that there is at least one more address being used to accumulate the coins after the initial shuffle. 

u/fmlnoidea420 identified the wallet that the aforementioned accumulator address was associated with, and was able to see on a different explorer than I was using that one of the outputs was in [fact 10.9 BTC to OKcoin.](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0995712688f79d0b?from_address=14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D). Wallet Explorer seems to only list confirmed transactions, however. This morning I was trying the BTC.com explorer to poke around and saw that there is another [20 BTC from the Bitfinex Hack accumulator wallet awaiting confirmation at OKcoin](https://btc.com/14We1bbHqPhT1iFrJAoEw772GraB8XKN9D).
I have not checked to see if any coins other than the 876/120,000 Bitfinex hack coins that began moving last month are on the move. 876 of BTC being dumped into the market = &gt;$1,000,000 of value taken forom the Bitcoin Market and put into the pocket of the hacker(s). What will wiping $130,000,000 worth of Buy Orders off of the books do? Something to consider during this price spike euphoria, gentlemen.

Here's how it works:

0. Bitcoin exchange rate crashes and burns. ""Real economists"" scuttle out of the woodwork to blather about how they were right all along and money only comes from the government. This period can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months.
1. Bitcoin exchange rate flatlines as volatility disappears. Bitcoin disappears as a topic in the financial press.
2. Bitcoin exchange rate begins to rally for no apparent reason, or a misread of some situation (e.g., Greece).
3. One or two niche networks do a segment on Bitcoin's zombie-like powers of reanimation. Chuckles all around, and onto the next story.
4. A few viewers say ""oh, what the hell"" and plunk down some mad money on bitcoin.
5. The exchange rate doesn't collapse, but keeps rallying.
6. Continued advances causes more media outlets to run segments on Bitcoin (""It's not just for drugs anymore?"").
7. Bitcoin coverage starts to appear on mainstream shows.
8. Exchange rate reaches levels even permabulls consider unsustainable.
9. There are 2-3 /r/bitcoin posts per day by someone intent on putting their life savings/inheritance/home equity into bitcoin.
10. Something pulls the rug out from under the market. Government crackdown in China or Russia. Management incompetence at an exchange. Failure of the Bitcoin ETF. Take your pick - the result is the same...

de43ka2,Yorn2,33,"No one stole anything yet. This is an example of responsible disclosure. Also, while this is huge for the field of cryptography, it isn't explicitly related to Bitcoin. In cryptography, collisions are just a way to mathematically signal that a particular hash function is no longer safe to use.

Imagine you have a picture of a dog that you can save as variable $dog within your code. You also have a picture of a cat with variable name $cat

You could then run through a SHA1($dog) to get something like this:

e49512524f47b4138d850c9d9d85972927281da0

You could also get SHA1($cat) to get this:

9d989e8d27dc9e0ec3389fc855f142c3d40f0c50

Astute observers will see the hashes are different, so they can deduce that the contents of $dog and $cat are NOT the same without even having to view the pictures. This is important, because this is how a lot of computer programs determine if something is what it says it is.

So let's say someone comes up with a way to create a collision in SHA1 such that the picture of the dog, $dog, could be added with junk data, $junk, which they call [collision blocks in their example](https://shattered.io/static/pdf_format.png). This combined data, which hashed with SHA1 then equals the hash of the SHA1 of the picture of the cat, $cat.

So essentially it would look like this:
SHA1($dog + $junk) = SHA1($cat)

In this example, they embedded the $junk in as metadata in the PDF header. This basically lets them create any PDF file they want that matches the SHA1 hash of any other PDF document.

EDIT: See what hvidgaard says below, it looks like it's an attack that has to be prepped instead, which means if you can fool someone into accepting SHA1($cat + $junk1), you can then give them SHA1($dog + $junk2) to completely match the first hash.

The purchase of pizza for bitcoin was important (not some bad investment mistake) because it was the first thing to give bitcoin any kind of value at all in the real world.

There simply was no BTC/USD exchange rate then. Like how now there is no, say, upvote/USD exchange rate. There was no way of saying 1 bitcoin is worth x in dollars, or euro, or pizzas. It was just 1 bitcoin existing on it's own.

This transaction was literally the first exchange rate for bitcoin. Before it, bitcoin had no value. After it, 1 BTC was worth (1 pizza / 10,000). 

OP calls this infamous as if it was a dumb move, as if the buyer should be kicking himself now. In reality, he started the whole idea that BTC might actually be worth something in the real world. (before this exchange for pizza, it was worth nothing. Or worth something maybe akin to a quantity that people don't really know the value of, and one that doesn't really matter. Maybe like an upvote, or less).

My biggest complaint about this subreddit is all the anti-rbitcoin hate. I get it. rbitcoin is doing shitty things. Constantly complaining that your post got removed and yelling 'censorship' isn't helping anything.

I'm not sure how long you guys have been on reddit. But that's *how Reddit works*. Mods have absolute power and can do whatever they want within Reddit's rules. Deleting posts they don't like is certainly within Reddit's rules. Mods can do what they want in their subreddit. End of story. Reddit isn't some free open platform where you're guaranteed free speech. Mods do what they want. 

The biggest effect /r/btc can have is to be more successful than rbitcoin. In my opinion, this sub should be less anti-rbitcoin and *talk more about bitcoin*.

This is our 'alternative' place to discuss bitcoin. What is this sub about? What kinds of discussions are taking place? We can make this place whatever we want. But right now, half of the posts are about bitcoin and the other half half are complaints about rbitcoin. I thought this sub was going to be about bitcoin? I think the rbitcoin complaining detracts from discussion about the real reason we are here.

I think we can gain more traction if we became a subreddit focused on Bitcoin. That's what brings us together. The rbitcoin complaining is justified, but not beneficial to this sub. The fear is that this sub becomes *too* anti-rbitcoin and that becomes a main focus. I don't think that will grow this sub in the long term. I think being the best place to discuss *Bitcoin* will grow our sub in the long run. And achieving that goal will have a much greater effect than pointing out rbitcoin's flaws.

**tl;dr:** More Bitcoin talk, less anti-rbitcoin complaining.

de6rljh,FractalGlitch,57,"This comment IS IMPORTANT and can't be upvoted enough.

Few people was there before pizza guy/when was Satoshi was around and I find that people have a HARD TIME understanding what was going on back in the day and what the bitcoin community was.

Bitcoin WAS NOT a financial product... AT ALL. In their most wildest dream, people saw bitcoin as a 1 BTC = 1 USD thing with SUPER limited payment application revolving around micropayment (don't let the actual Bitcoin Core developers fool you; micropayment WAS the #1 use case for Bitcoin back in the days, and no, nobody talked about sidechains or said that bitcoin ""was not ready yet"" for micros).

Pizza guy literally kick started the Bitcoin ecosystem as payment and he might be the #1 reason, beyond Satoshi, why it is successful today. There was a clear demarcation in peoples mind between the pre and post-pizza era.

Pre-pizza, people would send thousands of BTC to total strangers that asked for them to play with on the internet. Post-pizza is where people started to understand and hold.

Also, pre-pizza, bitcoin was a fun project revolving around cryptography but nobody believe in it. Few people had hundreds of thousands of bitcoin. For them, ANY value was awesome as it was pretty much infinite financial performance. Most sold at 10$ for hundreds of thousands, some sold at 100$ and a few select still have them.

You know why I still have most of my early bitcoin? I totally forgot about Bitcoin while it was exploding between nothingness to 100$. I woke up one day and on some tech news show they were talking about that new thing bitcoin was being traded for 100$. The hard drive that contained the wallet broke a while back and I had to send the hard drive to a recovery service (it was well worth it even at 100$). I was highly considering selling it all at 100$ but during the recovery process it mooned from about 100$ to about 600$. That's when I realized I wasn't selling shit until at least then next 4 generation of my children can live off the revenue.

de5vb74,BellyButtholeItch,46,"I don't expect anyone to care but I thought I'd share my ""war story"" from last night...nobody in my real life would understand what I'm talking about so I guess you can be my diary for a sec, just feel like sharing with someone.

For some reason I decided to go longer than I've ever longed yesterday even though I knew it was risky - I had over 350k contracts on BitMEX and was glued to the charts literally all day.  Was being responsible and locking in profits, selling bit by bit on the way up, buying more on the dip, trading like a goddamn superstar.  My best single day of active trading ever, and I've had some good ones in the past few months.  Started off with about 31btc in my account, and by midnight I was up to 61btc.  I locked in most of it but still had a good sized position open with unrealized profits of about 6 BTC, and liquidation price of around $1030.  It seemed to be forming a bull pennant so I decided to leave it open for one more spike.  

I figured I was way safe, if there was a big dip I'd probably just lose those unrealized profits at most, and I had all my alarms set, charts open on my iPad - so I took a little break and watched a show.  I usually don't leave big positions open unless I'm sitting there staring at the charts but I felt cozy enough with my profits that I was willing to lose some of those unrealized gains from slippage if I needed to close quickly.

Anyway, one of my alarms went off so I looked at the charts and saw the very first second of that dip, before it even looked like it was going to be big, and instantly hit the market close button.  Nothing happened for a few seconds so I started panicking and I refreshed the page...while watching the dump start to go insane on cryptowat.ch.  I prayed that the position actually closed...

When BitMEX finally refreshed I breathed a sigh of relief because I saw my position had been closed - so I looked at my balance to see how much damage I had from slippage.  Balance was....31 BTC.  I thought maybe there was some weird cache thing with my browser that was showing me my balance from the start of the day.  Nope, 31 BTC.  Almost threw my iPad out the window.  I was so pissed that I had spent all day being a trading superstar, had my best day ever, was 30 BTC richer 30 seconds ago, and now the whole day was wasted.

But I calmed down and started looking at the charts again - and I realized that the dip had crashed BitMEX futures down to about $930, which was $100 below my liquidation price - and I wasn't using isolated margin.  So it's very possible that if I had pressed the close button a half second later I could have lost my WHOLE ACCOUNT.

Now instead of angry I'm so relieved to have broken even, instead of losing a major chunk of my stash.  It would have been a really shitty feeling to gain 30btc only to lose 61btc at the end of the day.  I feel like I wrecked my car but narrowly avoided totaling it.

So I'm trying to figure out what the lesson is here, because letting $35,000+ slip through my fingers should teach me SOMETHING right?  But what is it?  Should I have set a stop loss?  Would that even have changed anything considering the speed of the crash?  Should I have closed earlier and waited for the breakout to buy back in again?  Should I have used isolated margin, and where should I have set my liquidation price? I figured keeping my eye constantly on the charts and doing everything manually would be the safest of all, but as fast as I pressed that close button, I still wasn't safe.

I guess the real lesson is that you're never totally safe, bitcoin is CRAZY.  But the other lesson is not to get too greedy.  Gaining 30btc was beyond my moonshot scenario for the whole bull run let alone for one day - and despite feeling like it was getting dangerous and I should close, I kept holding on for one more spike.  Got too greedy and didn't listen to my gut.

I'm thankful for experiences like this because they keep you in check and make you a better trader - big losses change your instincts from ""I just want to see if it'll go a little higher"" to ""this profit can disappear at any time - I need to lock it in before I get F'd in the A.""

The only reason I'm still trading at all is because I almost lost everything last year (I had 50btc saved since 2013, got lucky and bought a major altcoin right before it took off, got up to around 120btc and prematurely deemed myself a master trader, and then lost all but 8btc over the next month because I didn't know wtf I was doing).  Instead of giving up or becoming an emotional degenerate trader I decided to learn everything I could, studied, kept a journal, and traded as safely as possible (no FOMO trades, sticking to your plans, knowing when to sell, not getting greedy).  I never expected to make all that money back but in the past 3 months I was able to turn that 8btc into around 120btc.  If I had followed my usual plan and played it safe, it would have been 150btc, but at least I've gotten another reality check booster shot.

Guys, make sure you keep your heads on straight if you're margin trading, if you get caught up in it all and lose your head even just a little bit, it's so easy to get taken out.  Play it safe and don't break your own rules.

K back to the war room!

de6x1av,ruybropez,37,"I'm not an expert on Bitcoin but here it goes. You 'mine' bitcoins by running a program on your computer that calculates the answer to mathematical puzzles. Only a set amount of bitcoins are given out every 10 minutes, and the puzzles get increasingly more complex the more people are doing them. Mining costs money since you're paying for electricity and computer parts. People have entire clusters of computers that only exist to crunch numbers for bitcoins, so your average Joe doesn't have much chance of actually making money doing this anymore. That explains why they're now hard to get, but not why anyone actually wants them.

Put simply, they are only actually worth anything because other people are willing to trade things for them. Because a small group of people assigned a small value to them in the beginning, it attracted more people to the currency, and because they became harder to get the more people joined in, the value of Bitcoin went up.

You can buy stuff with them mostly like you would any other digital transaction. You can make transfers using an app on your phone and they even have Bitcoin ATMs now. It also has the advantage of pretty much anonymous transactions, which I will leave to you to think the potential applications of. But it's not just a weird internet currency people use to buy pizza and drugs. It has value because people think it has value, and it goes up in value because people invest in it, speculating that it will continue to go up in value. It's not a stock either, though, because it's value isn't tied to any company or, actually, anything tangible at all really.

There's also the crappy logic of the 'hard vs soft fork'- because SegWit is technically a soft fork it's 'good' and can be done without overwhelming consensus, even though it has a 95% activation threshold because doing it with less would be dangerous.

Please don't do this, this is such bad Reddit form.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy and it deserves to be.  Claiming ""I'm going to be downvoted for this but..."" is just hedging so that if what you think isn't interesting or important you can claim ""See! I was right! Groupthink!"" but in reality people see through this and down vote you as a result...

In future, either post or don't post if you're so worried about ""groupthink"" but leave any predictions about the voting out of it and see what happens. That's all anyone can ever do on Reddit anyway.

&gt; A cold hard look at the numbers shows this sub is a lot less popular than /r/bitcoin[1] . There's 25% of the active user count (many of whom people like me who read both subs), and just over 10% of the subscription count.

1.  /r/btc is a lot newer, so its obviously starting from a less popular position.
2. Mentioning /r/btc gets you banned in /r/Bitcoin, but not the reverse.  This makes the barrier to entry much higher out of /r/Bitcoin than into it.  Despite this, /r/btc is growing which is a testament to the need for it.
3.  /r/Bitcoin does have the monopoly on the better name and branding, because it came first. New users are going to go straight to /r/Bitcoin under the assumption that is the most informative subreddit. Unfortunately Reddit admins don't see any need to help us out with this despite massive moderator abuse so we have to deal with it.
4.  Despite the numbers, my anecdotal impression as a very long time /r/Bitcoin and now /r/btc subscriber is that the discussion quality and quantity is going through the roof here and declining massively there.  Like I said this is anecdotal, but take a look through a few of the posts on the top of each sub.  /r/btc often has long, informative, nuanced posts and healthy back and forth debate, much like /r/Bitcoin used to.  Check out some of the older threads on /r/Bitcoin and compare them to now, for example [the one where Theymos implemented his censorship policy](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/?limit=500) demonstrates my point well.  /r/Bitcoin now is devolving to one line circle jerking and posts about the price.  Despite their ""huge"" lead in ""subscribers"", there's not actually that many more comments in average in each thread.  The numbers really don't tell the whole story.

&gt; You're still way behind on the numbers, any realistic assessment shows Bitcoin Unlimited activation is pure fantasy, it simply doesn't have the popularity and isn't going to get it.

We're still behind ""on the numbers"", but consider that those numbers started at literally 100% to 0% - so from that perspective the increase has been substantial.  This is the first and only time a new client has significantly challenged the default of Bitcoin Core in Bitcoin's history, of course it isn't going to be instantly and overwhelmingly successful.  It is paving the way for future client competition though and decentralising control of the discussion in the Bitcoin community which are both very healthy things.

&gt; Aren't you guys worried that you're not succeeding in terms of real actual progress at achieving your aims? Many small blockers are quite happy with the status quo.

No, I'm not worried.  The fact that small blockers are happy with the status quo is going to be their downfall. Fees have been rising and users complaining at a faster and faster rate.  Continuing to ignore these complaints and saying ""pay a higher fee idiot"" all the time will eventually create a tipping point at which the situation becomes so untenable that either an altcoin starts gaining massive market share or enough Bitcoin users absolutely can't stand it anymore - encouraging the miners and the community to switch to Bitcoin Unlimited despite whatever other objections they might have.

de8ddio,-Hayo-,71,"/r/btc does indeed have less censorship (aka moderation) in comparison to /r/bitcoin. And although this might sound great initially, in the real world this means that without moderation you will be confronted with constant lies, conspiracy theories and altcoin pumpers on /r/btc all trying to divide the Bitcoin community.


Personally I prefer /r/Bitcoin, but everyone is free to make their own decision. The internet doesn’t dictate you to stick to one forum.


But it’s pretty absurd to hold the Bitcoin developers accountable for the moderation on 1 forum that is completely out of their control. /r/btc for example supports BU, but that doesn’t mean of-course that BU is responsible for the moderation on /r/btc


-


Hard forking towards new consensus rules developed by BU is incredibly dangerous and would even if it was successful only give us a very limited amount of scaling. But in the end it’s up to the Bitcoin community, the miners, the exchanges, the darknet markets and wallets like Electrum, Mycelium etc. to decide what consensus rules we agree on. The Core developers have no control over that.


The only goal of the Bitcoin developers is to write software which they think is best for Bitcoin. And if the Bitcoin community no longer agrees with the Core developers we are completely free to run software that is written by one of the other teams.


Therefore you can never blame developers for not doing what you think they should do. If you want something different in Bitcoin, you can contribute to the project yourself, you can also choose a different type of software and use that. And if you can’t find that software you can write it yourself.


Bitcoin is completely open-source.


The Core developers simply believe increasing the blocklimit trough a hard fork will give us too little scaling and too much risk.

What would you do if someone is trying to force you to do something that you think will impose great risks on Bitcoin and could heavily centralize Bitcoin? Would you stick to your own believes? Or would you gave in to the pressure of the miners and implement this change in the software even though you think it is dangerous?

Greg was doing what should have been done long ago, and if you dont think its neccessary then you have to ask yourself ..... Why is SW not activated?

The obvious answer is because of a political divide. One that was created by theymos and massively expanded by a Streisand effect that was fallout from his decision. No, it was not 100% his fault but he was the biggest part of it and the most major catalyst of the divide.

Without reputable educated people to counter the misinformation, what do you think happens?

That misinformation propagates until there is an equilibrium. That is *not* good for a network like bitcoin that relies on consensus of the userbase to progress forward.

The problem is the system is complex and there are not easy answers.

&gt; and what do those who funded Blockstream will get out of that deal.


It doesn’t matter, Bitcoin is open-source you can check the code they make. If they write something that is malicious to Bitcoin it won’t be adopted.

What do you want to do about this? We can currently process 3 transactions per second, which is almost nothing. If we want to serve the world we need to be able to process tens of thousands of transactions per second.


The only proposal you guys come up with is increasing the blocklimit, although this is surely something we might need to do in the future. It isn’t really a scaling solution. Because even with 8MB blocks we will still not be able to sufficiently scale Bitcoin. But it will put huge stress on nodes, centralize mining even more, and it will require a hardfork which could split the chain. Which is a huge risk to take if you take into account how insanely big Bitcoin has become.


That’s why the Core developers developed Segregated Witness, SW can increase the blocksize without a hardfork. It does all sort of cool things for hardware wallets, and it will make it much more user friendly to use the Lightning network. It will also make it possible to implement Schnorr signatures which could give us another 100% increase in on-chain capacity.


&gt; and it is ridiculous, since we still have 1 MB blocks in 2017, when we can handle a lot more due to improved modern technology.

1MB might sound like a very tiny amount of data, but it actually isn’t. With 1MB blocks my full node is currently consuming 1500 GB of upload bandwidth every month, 2GB of RAM, some CPU power when it needs to calculate a large transaction and a lot of storage. Altough storage is the least of the problems.

No. I've already explained this.

&gt; The pressure is far closer to boiling here... 

No it isn't.  /r/Bitcoin is constantly flooded with ""so my transaction is stuck even though I paid a high fee, what now?"" posts in /new and /rising that get constantly deleted by the moderators.  Everyone here is calmly waiting for this situation to become the status quo rather than an increasing minority.  There's no time clock on how long a hard fork needs to take.

&gt; and you're powerless to force a hard fork. Small blockers are a lot more relaxed... why do we have to budge? Fees can be solved within 14 days by SegWit is how the vast vast majority of observers see things outside here.

Well if the vast vast majority see it that way, why hasn't it already happened?  Because the fact is the decision isn't so ""unanimous"" as the narrative in /r/Bitcoin would tell you.

&gt; you guys already lost with XT, Classic, etc. What makes you think Bitcoin Unlimited is going to succeed?

I don't know if it's going to succeed, but it's pretty irrelevant.  There's no limit on the number of times a hard fork can be advocated.  The first 100 attempts to build a plane all failed, but eventually with enough persistence through failure someone got it right - that's how all innovation in history has happened and this is no different.  XTs problem was that it was the first attempt, Classic's problem was that Theymos went full authoritarian once it started gaining momentum but he can't do that again, now with Bitcoin Unlimited we'll see.

Every iteration is getting a little bit better, a true example of the market development principles that Bitcoin is supposed to embody.  If it isn't Bitcoin Unlimited, then the next attempt will work.  Or the one after that.  Or the one after that.  Or maybe Core will even respond to the pressure and lift the block size limit who knows.

It doesn't really matter which one, just that eventually Bitcoin's cap gets lifted because it can't stay at 1MB forever.

&gt; When fees get too high, transactions will move off chain, probably between exchanges. It's a short term solution, but it is a solution.

Exactly.  We're in this for the long term.  And as things increasingly move off chain, Bitcoin will become just another PayPal and if that goes on too long then an altcoin will start gaining huge market share for holding true to cryptocurrency's original promise.  I'll either sell out of Bitcoin and buy that altcoin, or the Bitcoin users/devs/miners will respond by raising the blocksize like they should have long ago.",2017-02-26 22:21:34

de8fqdv,BeYourOwnBank,36,"Here's a post from a year ago which shows how bad things have gotten in r\bitcoin:

&gt; The moderators of r\bitcoin have now removed a post which was just quotes by Satoshi Nakamoto.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/49l4uh/the_moderators_of_rbitcoin_have_now_removed_a/

So, r\bitcoin is ok to read for very simple, basic threads: pricing going up, some new company started using Bitcoin, memes, etc.

But for any thread where people are actually attempting to discuss and debate how Bitcoin works, and how to improve it, it's pretty pointless to read r\bitcoin, because most of the interesting and important comments get censored - and most of the important and interesting people were banned from r\bitcoin years ago - and everyone who's left is either too afraid to say anything interesting - or simply too uninformed to say anything interesting. 

The subreddit r\bitcoin has become an echo-chamber of yes-men and clueless newbies who follow them - led by ignorant mods who have a profound misunderstanding of how [Nakamoto Consensus](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5j9wmz/the_fatal_misunderstanding_of_nakamoto_consensus/) - and Bitcoin's [upgrade process](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vtwaf/bu_reflects_a_stance_not_on_controversial/) - actually works.

The real discussion and debate about Bitcoin happens on r/btc now - not on r\bitcoin.

---

Decentralized, market-based governance is a subtle and revolutionary concept. It is based on the notion that the economic majority (of users, of Bitcoin full nodes &amp; miners) will always do the right thing to ensure the value of our currency - and we will do this in a _decentralized, market-based_ fashion, with no need for central authority - whether it's censors or C++ coders.

The people on r\bitcoin simply do not understand this. 

- They actually _like_ having a ""centralized, trusted authority"" (Theymos) _dictate_ to them what they can read and say about Bitcoin on-line

- They actually _like_ having a ""centralized, trusted authority"" (Core devs) tell them what the blocksize should be - and they are so ignorant about the true nature of Bitcoin, that the totally fail to see that they themselves are actually anti-Bitcoin.

&gt; The mental hurdle that Core supporters currently cannot get over is fundamentally the same hurdle that the founding fathers of the Bitcoin community had to get over in 2009: understanding and accepting the feasibility of decentralized, market-based governance of a money

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5reb65/the_mental_hurdle_that_core_supporters_currently/

Basically everyone on r\bitcoin is saying:

- I'm too stupid to decide the blocksize for myself - I want the Core devs to decide for me.

- I'm too stupid to decide what to upvote and downvote on r\bitcoin - I want Theymos to decide for me.

&gt; It's my understanding that both SegWit and BU both have bitcoin's best interests at heart..?

Definitely not.  BU adds a consensus breaking rule called 'emergent consensus' that allows miners to group together and force nodes and miners not connected to them off of the network.  It is a proposal for miners to take ownership of bitcoin.  Only the people who don't have the technical understanding of what it entails, and the miners wanting it of course, support it.",2017-02-26 21:37:38

de8doe0,singularity87,31,"While this was all going on, Blockstream and it's employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and nothing complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a ""lets wait and see what comes from the conferences"" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin). 

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February this year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effect form of psychological attack.

de8dnx9,singularity87,30,"People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.",2017-02-26 20:25:57

It seems to me very likely that a large portion of the fresh hashrate is for one of the pro-SegWit pools. Evidence supporting this theory: [Bitfury mined the most blocks in the past 24 hours of any pool (14.5%)](https://blockchain.info/pools?timespan=24hours), which is notably anomalous (generally, AntPool and F2Pool are #1 and #2).

If nothing else, it would aid a narrative of ""Bitcoin makes progress, scaling debate finally solved for good?"" and other things along these lines.

de8k9e8,RommelTJ,30,"&gt; This is fixable with SegWit. In a propaganda war your position has to be sympathetic. ""Your transaction got stuck because Segwit is being blocked"" is the reality of how this plays out to the majority of the community.

I call myself a ""regular"" Bitcoin user. I read the white paper and think Bitcoin could be the future of money. I just want Bitcoin to work and would prefer to see some sort of compromise (so like Segwit + 4MB blocks). Let me explain why I'm sympathetic to BU with a real life example:

1. Try to buy a video game on Steam using the Electrum wallet and default settings like I had done many times before.
2. 4 hours later, my transaction is still stuck in the mempool.
3. Google for information on /r/Bitcoin about it. I'm told I'm an idiot for using too low of a fee. I'm insulted and decide not to go back. Side note: Now you don't event get to comment as posts are just being deleted and users accused of being /r/btc trolls.
4. Go on StackOverflow for solutions. Find an answer that explains things without insulting me and a reply that suggests to use the ViaBTC transaction accelerator.
5. Go to the ViaBTC transaction accelerator, the only thing that was able to help me get my transaction unstuck, and read about BU.
6. I'm now more sympathetic to BU than I am to the Segwit team because BU supporters helped me, whereas Segwit supporters just insulted me.

Hope that clears it up.

de9qele,todu,30,"Feedback to Roger Ver specific to this particular debate, and suggestions for the next debate.

Both you (Roger) and Tony Vays were talking about how much capacity Segwit would possibly give. That depends on the ""transaction mix"" at any given point in time. With the current transaction mix, Segwit would give an effective blocksize limit of about 2.1 MB. It would *never* reach the theoretical 3-4 MB as Tony Vays claimed and you Roger did not contest. 

The 2.1 MB effective blocksize limit would only be reached if every transaction in the block has been sent from a Segwit address (they start with a 3, and the most common address start with a 1). If half of the transactions in a block have been sent from a Segwit address and half have been sent from the older types of transactions, then Segwit's increase to the effective blocksize limit will also be only half. That would be calculated like this:

Every transaction if sent from a Segwit (address starts with a 3) address gives the effective limit 2.1 MB.  
The ""Segwit benefit"" from that is ""2.1 - 1 = 1.1 MB"".  
If only half of the transactions in a block are sent from a Segwit address, then you also divide that 1.1 MB benefit in half as well, and get the benefit ""1.1 / 2 = 0.55 MB"".  
Then you add that smaller benefit to the max blocksize of 1 MB like this: ""1 + 0.55 = 1.55 MB"" (The actual effective blocksize limit in this case of only 50 % of users sending from Segwit addresses).

You can't have more than 100 % of all transactions being sent from a Segwit address so you'll never get a higher effective blocksize limit than 2.1 MB (provided that we keep the current ""transaction mix"").

(Please correct me if I'm wrong about this or the math.)

The trick is how to explain this in an easy to understand and quick way in a debate with a debate opponent that is likely to try to interrupt you while you're talking. But I'll leave that problem to you Roger to solve in time for your next debate.

You referred to Satoshi Nakamoto several times by both his name (good) and immediately after as being ""the creator of Bitcoin"". I think it would be more accurate and impactful if you would refer to Satoshi as the ""inventor and creator"" because he didn't merely create Bitcoin.

Tony Vay kept using the argument that the Blockstream / Bitcoin Core software is more trustworthy because they have about 15-20 full time ""computer scientists"" working on the Bitcoin Core software, but Bitcoin Unlimited has only about 3 full time ""people"" working on the Bitcoin Unlimited software. I think a good counter-argument to this could be that Bitcoin worked very well between 2009-2014 before the Blockstream company was even founded in November 2014. Bitcoin survived and prospered with practically 100 % uptime even though Satoshi Nakamoto was just *one person*. It matters much less what *quantity* of developers a project has and much more what *quality* developers it has. Another question that could be asked is why Blockstream / Bitcoin Core *even need* 15-20 full time developers and ""over 100 [source code] contributors"" just to maintain and scale a project that has already been invented (scaling roadmap included from the very beginning) and created. 

Often times when you have low quality developers, you need to add more developers because the first developers are incapable of accomplishing what they were tasked to do. The few Bitcoin Unlimited developers solved the Xtreme Thinblocks / Compact Blocks problem 3 month before the Blockstream / Bitcoin Core team did. Developing source code that solves issues that the users and miners want to be developed and solved should be what gives a development team its value (reliability and trustworthyness), and not simply the high number of developers. Satoshi Nakamoto *invented* Bitcoin and was *ignored* by Adam Back (despite directly contacting him in regard to Hashcash) until the bubble of November 2013. What good is a group of developers who don't even recognize Bitcoin as being a good invention even when it's shown running to them live right before their eyes?

Tony Vays said that Segwit should be done now and a hard fork could always be done later if deemed needed before LN. You could've contested this by saying that protocols such as IPv4 and Bitcoin tend to ""ossify"" over time so that future changes simply become less and less possible because eventually no change will be agreed on because to many older hardware uses the old protocol and so on. The IPv4 protocol has too few public IP addresses that everyone has to share, and the next version IPv6 that offers many more IP addresses has still not been accepted by the internet users because of ""protocol ossification"". Andreas Antonopoulos explained ""protocol ossification"" very pedagogically and convincingly in one of his videos on youtube a few years ago. Maybe someone has a link to that video and timestamp and can share that with Roger?

If Compact Blocks is better or worse than Xtreme Thinblocks is debatable and any difference in what capacity increase they deliver is minor. They are effectively as good. It's just that Blockstream / Bitcoin Core run into a problem when developing Compact Blocks and gave up on it because the problem made Compact Blocks ""not a priority anymore"" as they said. But then as soon as Bitcoin Unlimited released a live and running version of Xtreme Thinblocks, Compact Blocks suddenly ""became a priority"". But because of the ""not invented here syndrome"" they chose to spend an additional 3 months to complete their suddenly prioritized Compact Blocks technology instead of being ""collaborative"" (as Adam Back likes to keep calling for) and simply copying and adopting the Xtreme Thinblocks directly. They copied the solution to the problem they encountered but refused to copy the actual source code because that would be admitting that Bitcoin Unlimited developers are competent and competitive.

At 45:50 Tony insulted you by saying that ""you're not as liked [as before]"". That is not true and a counter-argument would be to link to the first thread where Theymos announced his sudden and extreme censorship policy.

I archived that Reddit post just in case the /r/bitcoin moderators would ever decide to remove it sometimes in the future:  
Post title: ""It's time for a break: About the recent mess &amp; temporary new rules"".  
Archive link: https://archive.is/L6k4n  
Direct Reddit link: https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/?limit=500

In that link you can see just how many up votes all big blocker comments were getting and how many down votes all small blocker comments were getting. Those are not sock puppet account votes but real people because no one knew beforehand that Theymos would go censorship-insane right before their eyes in real time. Creating sock puppet Reddit accounts takes time and these were real-time voters with no time for any preparation. You're one of us big blockers Roger Ver, never forget that, and we're all very thankful for you debating on our behalf. You represent our view on the Bitcoin scaling, Bitcoin protocol governance and censorship issues very well. Please keep doing what you do and keep being you.

de9fbhw,slowmoon,28,"The internet in general is definitely a psychedelic phenomenon in that it dissolves boundaries, which is the main thing that psychedelic substances do. The internet dissolves national, political, gender, age, and socio-economic boundaries. Dissolves communication boundaries. Allows people to create, sell, and share their own content with anyone without permission from anyone. Bitcoin is just a continuation of that. It's expanding our ability to communicate with others.  

One of the things that Terence McKenna said was how the mushroom once told him to ""find the others"": how it was important for people to be able to find like-minded psychedelic people. That is what we're doing with bitcoin. (At least some of us.) We're annoyed with these government bailouts and bail-ins. Mismanaged currencies. Abusive banks. And we're now participating in our own economic community that encompasses our values.

What did Tim Leary say? ""Turn on, tune in, drop out.""

That's it exactly. We've turned on and gained awareness of the corrupt global financial system. We want no part of it. We're tuning in to something else. And we're dropping out. I get paid in debt-based slave-money and I immediately drop out and change it to real money.

deajd6f,yolotrades,60,"This is kind of buried down there now, but /u/xanderbelly brought up a good point. The rally after the 14th? The one after the meeting when all the authorized participants in the ETF were present in the flesh? Likely the AP's (KCG, Convergex, and Susquehanna) attaining their bitcoin so they can participate in creation and redemption of baskets of shares. It's highly unlikely that these groups had acquired bitcoin *before* they knew whether the ETF was going live. Their motive isn't speculation, it's market making and HFT participation in the basket creation / redemption process. However, participating *requires* a lot of bitcoin, as a basket is 1,000 bitcoin (The equivalent of 100,000 shares). If the AP's didn't have any bitcoin because they weren't speculators, but the SEC came along and either said the ETF would be approved or that they're waiting on the AP's to acquire enough bitcoin to participate, that would *certainly* explain the rally after the 14th. As I mentioned in my follow up to the comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5wem22/daily_discussion_monday_february_27_2017/deai3hh/), I'd assume about ~30k BTC will be needed for the three AP's to participate meaningfully. Could be off, but either way, there's no way it's only 20 baskets (20k btc) between the three participants. Likewise, it will need to be spread out - some ready to exchange for shares, some ready to sell for fiat, which means they'll need at least a basket per exchange (no partial baskets). 

Further, IF the market buying activity after the meeting on the 14th *is indeed* from the AP's loading up so they can begin participating in the basket system, it would lean me *heavily* to believe the ETF has been approved. As I mentioned, those firms don't want to buy bitcoin for exposure to the asset itself, only as a tool to participate in the basket process and reap some arbitrage in the process. They don't care what BTC itself does, so the only reason they'd be buying is IF they'd gotten some sort of signal from the SEC that they need to begin preparing. I've mentioned before I believe the SEC *really* wants this ETF to trade in lock-step with the underlying, as nothing would show their process is broken more than a premium or a discount on an open-redemption ETF. I suspect in the meeting the SEC either ordered the AP's to begin their accumulation of the underlying, or stressed that the approval was contingent on the AP's proving the ability to participate and keep the market liquid and stable (relative to the underlying) to protect investors.

Again, nothing here is 100%. But VERY fishy in hindsight that the rally began one day after all three AP's were in a room together - in person - with the SEC and Gemini guys. If the AP's need their bitcoin, bet your ass they're gonna get it before approval is announced publicly. Possibly a requirement, but they'd definitely wait until the last minute to avoid unnecessary exposure before they began MM activities (not to mention, I'm sure they as well as us would expect the price to go up if approved, so that's another reason to begin accumulating now rather than post-decision (if that's even an option)).

Thoughts on this? I'm VERY bullish on the ETF after considering this. I'd say 95% sure. Who knows what happens between now and the 11th, but I do believe on the 10th or 11th we will get an approval, and the rally on the 15th will start to make perfect sense.",2017-02-28 06:17:09
