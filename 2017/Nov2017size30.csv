dp5g1u1,BearBong,1075,"Damn, $399 for a phone would be such an unbelievable bargain now days. I remember being in grad school and not being able to afford it. Now I'm dropping $1k for a goddamn Pixel 2 XL.

Edit: for those who point out that I have options, you're right. But I travel enough for work that Project Fi is a necessity, I enjoy pure Android / updates / a top camera, and my current Pixel XL was a second-hand one whose screen is broken and battery is miserable. Last phone I bought was the 6P, which I'm returning for $200 via trade in policy, and I made enough money on Bitcoin that I saved for this. ",2017-11-01 02:25:19

The best thing you can hope for is an improvement to the way we use BTC today - e.g. lightning network and the like. BTC dying would in fact be terrible for the cryptoverse - where else would all the funds go? Back to fiat? Why would people want to continue trading in crypto if they would have to start filing tax returns every year, and having to note down every transaction they make back and forth from fiat? &amp;nbsp;


BTC has given us a degree of freedom from the ridiculous bureaucracy that the world has developed over time. It is a leap forward for humanity. &amp;nbsp;

Then it will push back up to around 10k before it happens again. Its getting pretty predictable at this point. The reason I say this is because its happened over and over and over again.

What will be interesting is what will cause the dip that will happen. We already did the big bank guy calling bitcoin a fraud. China is getting fucking old, they are irrelevant as far as I can tell. My guess is the plot this time will be a potential US government might pass super spooky legislation!!

Keep them safe in a wallet. 

Also, buy from GDAX. It is owned by the same people who own Coinbase. You don’t need to make a new account with them, just reconfirm your login when going to the GDAX website. There your fees are lower, so low that you pay 0% fees to purchase and sell bitcoin and 0% fee to transfer those bitcoins to your wallet of choice.

dp6rhp6,emergent_reasons,71,"&gt; Core will be gone ...

I hope s2x will defeat s1x but I think this common assertion is not a given.

&gt; how can Bitcoin Cash differentiate itself

technical differentiation:

- no segwit complications or risks on the blockchain
- no segwit complications or risks in the protocol (don't believe anyone that says it will be easy to remove)
- easier to update a wallet to fully support Bitcoin Cash than to fully support any Segwit Bitcoin
- already 4x space for transactions compared to s2x. Who knows how long it will take for s2x to upgrade more. 2MB is completely inadequate for a coin that aims to be cash for the world.


economic differentiation:

- 0conf (zero confirmations) for low risk transfers. I.e. no RBF (Replace By Fee)
- proven ability to upgrade when necessary (let's say the difficulty adjustment fork goes smoothly)
- very predictable, low fees now and in the future (due to larger blocks + ability to fork and improve)
- (/u/Ant-n) no segwit signature discount: with segwit, large tx pay much less per kB leading to degraded onchain scaling
- verifiable large investment by players in the market who are known to be highly invested in the success of Bitcoin (I am not totally sure about this one but from what I have read I think it is the case).

political:

- (/u/Felixjp) Bitcoin Cash will avoid the political implications of [forced] 2nd layer off-chain transaction where again 3rd parties, which you need to trust, will be put in control.

Certainly I have missed some.

**4)** No comparison chart with older version. Now I understand why, because above mentioned features would make it look quite awkward.

**5)** Price. Yes, it's rather high, but that's not my problem. My problem is how exactly can you justify it or how competitive is your product. Ledger Nano S costs 58 EUR. Your product costs 139 EUR on pre-order. Ok - why? Is it safer? Because THAT is **THE** selling point for HW wallet, not a *vibrant color touch screen*... Ledger even supports more currencies AND they actively add new ones for already sold products.

**6)** Bitcoin hodlers (i.e. target group) are right now getting rather rich. So surely you can market a ""premium"" HW wallet, why not. Is it what you are doing? Than why not metal case, as lot people ask for and what actually reminds a ""safe""? Why a lot cheaper Ledger actually feels like a more premium product that yours? (I own both, Nano S and Trezor 1). Make a leather one, make silver and gold one. Bitcoin millionaires are coming. But do **something** to justify that price.

**7)** Have you **finally** streamlined GUI and made it the same for all currencies? Because if not, then premium price is definitely not suitable for such lousy user experience. And if you DID do that,  WHY don't you advertise it properly instead of the speed of your wonderful processor?

**8)** That's all really. My point is not that you are doing a bad job making HW wallet - but that you are doing simply **worse** job than your competition. Now that's a problem.

PS: I am Czech and I **really** want you to succeed. Please try harder.

**EDIT 1:** I actually **do** believe Trezor is good product. I'm just not sure if it's better than Ledger and the company really isn't doing a great job convincing me(/us) about it - things I listed are stated by the company (both in e-mail I received and on their site preorder.trezor.io) as a **main** selling points of new version. That's just absurd.

**EDIT 2:** Case in point of shitty marketing and PR - I tried to post this [on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/7a2wtg/preorder_trezor_t_the_nextgeneration_hardware/) and I was directed to blogpost, with *""some answers to my questions""*. **Gaah!** Nope guys, these are not questions...

**EDIT 3:** Fellow redditor pointed out (thanks!) that *""under the hood there is a micropython subsystem, meaning the device is much more programmable - there are therefore significant changes to the ecosystem possible to third party developers.""* Great. But first - this isn't even *mentioned* on the preorder site and second - such feature **really should** come with some pretty good examples of real life possibilities and uses. Why isn't it advertised as such instead the BS features mentioned above??

dp707jr,bobbert182,81,"So, I know everyone here is of the mindset that you should buy and never sell. And for the most part I agree. I'm going to hold some bitcoin until I die. But I just sold 15% of my cold storage. And I'm feeling pretty good about it. 

Three years ago I could only dream of what is happening to Bitcoin right now. I feel like we're finally living through what we all knew would happen one day. I still feel like Bitcoin has a ton of potential to the upside, possibly even in this bull run. But I'm at the point where I need to diversify a bit. Bitcoin is now worth 4x what all my other assets are combined. It's no longer just ""money I don't care about"".

I still have the majority of my coins in cold storage, and I plan on holding most of them for another 5+ years. But Right now, I think taking 15% and moving it into low risk index funds and taking a little vacation is the right move. And hey, if we drop 50% some time in the coming months, maybe I'll buy back part of what I sold ;)

Not really any point to this post related to the market, but maybe just a reminder to people to take profits once in a while. As this thing grows, it's going to go from ""don't invest more than you're willing to lose"" to ""holy shit, if I lose this all I'm going to be devastated"". And no one wants that to happen.

# 1. Import the public key used to sign the Electrum downloads

**I want to acquire the PGP key used to sign the electrum downloads.**

I imported the PGP key linked from the [electrum.org downloage page](https://electrum.org/#download) into gnuPG (a.k.a. ""GPG"", version 2.2.1 installed as part of [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/); Windows users use [gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/)).

I get a summary of information of this key by running the `gpg --fingerprint 0x7F9470E6` command prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS or Linux).

    pub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [SC]
          6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6

    uid           [ unknown] Thomas Voegtlin &lt;thomasv1@gmx.de&gt;
    sub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [E]

From this summary I see that the key fingerprint is `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`.

I want to determine this key's relationship to the key of a person I trust.

**I want to determine this key's relationship to Gregory Maxwell's key.**

# 2. Verify authenticity of the public key

I know Gregory Maxwell's key is `DE47 BC9E 6D2D A6B0 2DC6 10B1 AC85 9362 B041 3BFA` because the fingerprint is included in [a video presentation which I am assuming is not spoofed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSRoEeqYtJA&amp;t=24s).

I enter both fingerprints into a ""[PGP pathfinder &amp; key statistics](https://pgp.cs.uu.nl/paths/ac859362b0413bfa/to/2bd5824b7f9470e6.html)"" website to find if they are part of the [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). I get these results:

I can see that at least 8 trust paths exist between the two PGP keys. A trust path is a chain of PGP key signatures where A certifies that B's identity is true, B certifies C'd identity is true, C certifies D's identity is true, etcetera. According to these results, 8 such paths exist between Gregory Maxwell's PGP key and a PGP key controlled by a person named `Thomas Voegtlin` who associates himself with the `electrum.org` website. Therefore, I conclude that the PGP key downloaded from the https://www.electrum.org/ website is controlled by the real Thomas Voegtlin (who recently had [a talk at the Breaking Bitcoin conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCE2OzKIab8&amp;t=5h9m48s)).

You can also import Gregory Maxwell's PGP key into your GPG software and then manually download all the keys whose signatures and fingerprints are attached to Maxwell's public key. If you tell your software to trust Maxwell's key (such as by using your own PGP key to sign his) then your software will provide the same information as above. The https://pgp.cs.uu.nl website simply does this data gathering busywork for you.

**You have now verified the authenticity of Thomas Voegtlin's PGP key.**

# 3. Use GPG to verify the downloaded files

Now that we have determined that the PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6` is Thomas Voegtlin's key, **we can verify that the files available for download at https://electrum.org/#download have been signed by Thomas**.

Download the installer of your choice and the associated `.asc` signature file into the same folder. For windows, choose the `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe` and `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe.asc` files. For macOS, choose `electrum-3.0.0.dmg` and `electrum-3.0.0.dmg.asc`.

Use GPG to verify the `.asc` file. In gpg4win (Windows users), this means right-clicking the `.asc` file and selecting `More GpgEX options` &gt; `Verify`. In GPGTools (macOS users) this means rightclicking the `.asc` file and selecting `Services` &gt; `OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File`.

In Windows, the Kleopatra app should open a dialogue stating:

    Signature created on 2017-11-01 23:36:08
    With certificate:
    6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
    The used key is not certified by you or any trusted person.

What matters here is that Kleopatra identified that the file was signed by a PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`, the same fingerprint as the one we verified was owned by the real Thomas Voegtlin. I didn't use my own PGP key to sign Thomas' key which I think Kleopatra requires to change this dialogue to say the key is certified. This fingerprint is extremely difficult to fake.

In macOS, a window should appear stating:

    electrum-3.0.0.dmg        Signed by: Thomas Voegtlin (https://electrum.org) &lt;thomasv@electrum.org&gt; (7F9470E6) - undefined trust

What matters is that GPG identified that the key was associated with the one I imported earlier (`Thomas Voegtlin`) and that had the correct fingerprint (full fingerprint visible in GPG Keychain, not in this popup, unfortunately). Again, I haven't signed Thomas' key (fingerprint ending in `7F9470E6`) with my own PGP key so the GPG software refuses to explicitly declare that the key is trusted. 

**You have now verified the files downloaded from https://electrum.org have been signed by Thomas Voegtlin, the Electrum developer.** The assumptions made were:

1. The PGP key fingerprint in that Gregory Maxwell video is correct. 

2. The https://pgp.cs.uu.nl website yielded correct trust path information. 

3. Your GPG software correctly verified the signature.

# 4. Afterthoughts

Ideally I would attend a [key-signing party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrciSbHhpBo) attended by several developers in the bitcoin community (including Gregory Maxwell, Luke Dashjr, Thomas Voegtlin, Wladimir J. van der Laan, Peter Todd, etcetera). Then I could have high confidence in the authenticity of bitcoin software I download. For now, though, the simplest best-effort verification method I can imagine requires the primary assumption that the PGP key fingerprint in the Gregory Maxwell video I linked is the real Gregory Maxwell's real key.

The first thing I see is a big button that says ""Start Mining Bitcoin!"", so I clicked that. It let me to a page to sign up for a cloud mining contract, which itself seems pretty scammy, but it's clear that there was a difference between ""Bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin Cash"".

Holding in our national currency is really risky too as inflation eats your money, just on october 1USD went from 20'000 to 42'000VEF.

Then you have paypal and related processors that can freeze your funds for ever as we wouldn't be able to withdraw them afterwards since they only let us attach US bank accounts which of course we do not have unless we travel to the US.

So yeah, a lot of people, those who can save and those who sell their cars and other assets are saving in bitcoin, it is really easy through localbitcoins and we just lose about 10% in exchange comissions (compared to exchanging paypal dollar - VEF which takes over 20%)

I am a freelancer web developer and i got all of my money in bitcoin, usually i'll charge on amazon giftcards or paypal and then exchange that to bitcoin though, since a lot of clients have no idea how to purchase bitcoin and they won't do it no matter how hard i try to get them to...

That's a question that already has an answer.

No.

Bitcoin price has more than quintupled in the last 6 months, whilst daily transactions have seen no overall growth.

Meaning people are dumping more and more money into bitcoin despite no corresponding growth in the amount of people using it as a currency.

i.e. all the increase in price has come from people looking to speculate.

Speculation and price rises do not help adoption of a currency, they inhibit it by creating too much volatility. No one wants to get paid in a currency that might be worth half next month what it was worth this month.

Only $1000 was injected, but the market changed from $100 to $100,000...

I try not to be an asshole about it but sometimes I really don't care and I haven't really done much to keep my job but they need me more than I'm being difficult. I do actually work really hard when it's needed and I'm good at my job.

I'm not at the private yachts and lambos level of wealthy but within a year (unless we have another 2013 level crash) I think I'm going to buy a house for cash. I think another recessions coming and credit is going to dry up so there will be a good dip in house prices here.

Up until April-2014, Gavin Andresen maintained control of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository and was considered Bitcoin’s lead developer.

The cost of a transaction at this point was about $0.04




 Gavin started talking about larger blocks (September 2014?) mere months after stepping down as maintainer,  though talk of removal or increase of the 1 Mb limit was widespread even before this point. 

In 2014 Blockstream Core was founded.

At the beginning of 2015 is when Hearn &amp; Gavin started to discuss pushing for bigger blocks.

This was part of the reason he had repo commit access removed. Some individuals started pushing for that removal  in 2015 for various reasons and finally succeeded early 2016.

The excuse for his repo access being removed was initially that they believed he had been hacked. 

The truth is some individuals had been talking about removing his commit access earlier in the mailing lists and they had been [trying other excuses](https://imgur.com/xFUVbJz)(check the date). They wanted full control of Bitcoins direction. The Craig Write thing  was just politically palatable.

Look at the [graph just after Gavin left.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*22ix0l4oBDJ3agoLzVtUgQ.gif)

Its as if the community, users and investors lost confidence. 

This was when a few central and outspoken developers in core stopped listening to the community. This was when core started pushing and merging contentious code like RBF. This was when core started preparations to artificially accelerate the adoption of an expensive fee market. 


You can clearly see where many of the underlying ideas and ideals of the bitcoin ecosystem began to erode in favour of a centralized decision making committee.

I do not like your reference to the dot com bubble. How is the ""dot com"" bubble doing? It's dream was to change everything. I don't think anyone could make a valid argument that it hasn't. Of course there were losers along the way. There always is with new technologies. But in the long term the technology has been proven and is growing even more into our lives. There are patchy start ups and pyramid scheme'ish looking companies being introduced for an example check out bitconnect. These ""quick buck"" companies will without a doubt come crashing down if they don't act with integrity. But in what world are there no losers when a new technology comes into play? We need losers just as much as winners. It makes the system stronger and weeds out all the fluff. 

Payment technologies are a huge business sector. After all payments need to be safe. What if the system we set up is backwards? Anyone with my piece of plastic that represents my bank account can use it if they have it, that doesn't seem right. Identity theft is also a major industry, do our names and personal information really need to be connected to our money? Fraud is huge, so is counter fitting, now people are creating fake gold, credit card skimmers, the list goes on and on. We pay a ton of money to keep our money ""safe"" just look how many financial institutions there are. How about the almost monthly massive data breaches we here about? Where everyone's informations is compromised, To me it seems the way money is transferred needs a major overhaul. It is inefficient, expensive, unsafe, and people are getting burned. 

In steps blockchain, a global currency that is easily transferable between peers or businesses. Open ledgers that are verified between many networks and cannot be tampered with, counterfeited, or changed in any way. Money is transferred with pennies in fees, anywhere in the world. For the argument in huge national tragedies it would be worthless I guess I don't understand? What if the world burns down they will be worth nothing? We could play what if all day long. But the global value stays the same. I could trade bitcoin to an area not phased by natural disaster for goods or services. Could you do that with fiat money? It would be a lot harder to do. For example if I have a relative in Singapore that needs money pronto. I could send any amount in seconds. How would your relative fare? You would go to western union or something and pay huge fees with some transfer rate and wait for international money transfer verification for idk days and then they would have to find an open western union in a national disaster?? I think I like my situation more. 

I'll leave it at that for now as this is getting long. But I would encourage anyone to have an open mind to new technologies rather than shutting it down right away as a fraud just because it is too successful. I think the future could be bright here. The U.S. is usually pretty open to new technologies I don't think they'll ever try to shut this down just because it's new.

This is because our banks only operate nationally due to economic regulations we're not allowed to do transactions internationally. So there's no way to legally get dollars to save our money to, and our national currency halved their value last month, if we had $1000 in our national currency, now we have about $450 in that same amount.

A lot of people save in bitcoin, those who can at least, localbitcoins makes it easy as cake and we only lose about 10% in transaction fees (compared to 25% by exchaning to paypal and to national currency back and forward, not to mention payment processors like paypal require us to have US bank accounts if we wanted to withdraw, so if they froze our funds we wouldn't ever access them again).

So yeah, those who can are saving in bitcoin, those who get a big chunk of money are saving in bitcoin, keep in mind that it is a small percentage though as most people here aren't even eating at all well because minimum monthly wage is $8 or 350'000 for 5 days a week 8 hours a day of work, and 1kg of meat is worth 70'000VEF, so about 5kgs of meat is all you can buy in a whole month. Now imagine what people have to go through to get personal hygiene products, to try and get a balanced diet, to get the minimum necessity products, it is impossible for them, lots of people are starving, hungry asking for help and food on the streets, kids and old men and women.

It's saddening, and to think this all happened in such a short amount of time, back in 1996 i remember my month was able to sustain me and my sister, buy ourselves a home, a car, she kept the fridge filled up with food at all times with many different types of food, she could pay for our private school, there would be gifts for us under the tree for christmas or any other date like birthdays, the most amazing thing is that she worked at a bakery and earned minimum wage, going from that to todays $8.3 monthly which doesn't even allow you to feed yourself alone =(

dpepl13,ChronosCrypto,51,"Text transcript:

Hi, I'm Chronos, and today we're going to talk about a potential security issue in Bitcoin. Back in August of 2017, we added a new feature called Segregated Witness, or ""Segwit"" for short, and this fundamentally changed bitcoin's security.

To understand this, we need to take a step back and talk about bitcoin mining. Basically, every time a new block is mined, it's sent over the network to the other miners, and each one runs a quick validation on it to make sure it's legal and correct, and then they add it to their copy of the blockchain, and they start mining on top of it.

At least, that's what is supposed to happen. But blocks are almost always correct anyway, because it takes so much effort to make one that it would be a huge waste to make an invalid one. And every moment spent validating a new block, instead of mining on it immediately, is lost income to the miner, because their equipment doesn't have anything to do during that time. So there's a natural incentive to just mine first, and validate later.

But this can go terribly wrong. On July 4th, 2015, a mining pool called BTC Nuggets mined a block with an old version number, which is something that all miners had already agreed would be invalid. Another group, F2Pool, didn't check the version number. They just mined on top of it, to save time. Then they got lucky, or unlucky, as you might say, because they did successfully mine a block on top of it. Other miners followed their lead, and soon 6 blocks had been mined on an invalid chain. Oops.

We were actually lucky in that case, because those extra illegal blocks didn't contain any transactions, so no actual bitcoin payments were reversed, but we might not get so lucky next time. If this happens again, it could be a huge disaster.

So what does this have to do with Segwit? Well, the power of Segwit is to separate the witness data from the rest of the block. What is the witness data? Basically, this data proves that each transaction is being spent by the person who actually owns the coins. Without the witnesses, you can't tell if somebody is spending someone else's money.

But now that the witnesses are separated, they can easily be sent to miners after the rest of the block, to save time. I'm sure you're starting to see the problem here:

First, miners can start mining on a new block before they even receive the witness data. All they need is the block header. And they'll make more money if they do this, because they don't have to wait. Worse, nobody can tell who, if anyone, is actually doing any validation, because almost all blocks are valid anyway.

So the equilibrium state is that miners mine on new blocks before even receiving the signatures. And once over half of the miners are doing this, the network becomes unstable and vulnerable to attack. Any miner could then add a transaction that steals YOUR bitcoin, if it's in a Segwit address, and the other miners might not even notice. It remains to be seen just how serious this might become, but I think it's only a matter of time, as more and more users switch to Segwit transactions. It looks to me like we're eventually going to have a nasty, unexpected fork. 

Because of this, I personally wouldn't recommend using Segwit on the bitcoin network.",2017-11-06 11:56:31

dpfkfog,bluefirecorp,347,"&gt;So lets say my computer is mining. 

So, when you mine, you calculate hashes with Bitcoin (SHA256). You take some old data from the previous block and some data from newly submitted transactions and then a random bit of data. When you create a hash of all that data, you get a random output. You can't really predict the outcome of the hash. For example:

sha256(""Hello World"") produces a hash of a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b57b277d9ad9f146e

sha256(""Hello World!"") produces as a hash of 7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069

See? Just adding an ""!"" changed the hash entirely.

Now, the goal is producing a hash with a ton of 0s infront of it (at least for bitcoin). The network actually adjusts every few blocks to make it more or less difficult by adjusting how many zeros your hash starts off with. For example, generating 00000* is a lot easier than generating 000000000000000*.

Once you do get that hash, you submit it to the world. You already wrote your reward in the block itself while generating the hash. So, the reward is posted and the ledger is updated with your coins. The reward is a set amount that constantly halves every so many blocks (to prevent infinite coins from being issues [only ~21 million will ever exist]). People see that the previous block was solved and they work on solving the next block.

People need to worry.  It is probably the biggest threat from S2X, that people's funds can be misappropriated because of lack of replay protection.  It's been highlighted here and elsewhere a gazillion times.

Trying to scrape S2X coins off your Bitcoins is somewhere between impossible and (difficult, risky and unreliable).

If you can hodl and wait, time is on your side, but if you try to move any coins (either coin) after the split, then you could find yourself with unintended consequences.

This lack of replay protection is not an accident, it's a feature.  With replay protection, S2X would join the market as a new coin, and would have to try to convince people that it was worth adopting.  Without replay protection, S2X seeks to redefine ""Bitcoin"", replacing the current one under the same name.

That's why €120 billion of user funds are being put at risk, because S2X wants the name Bitcoin instead of calling their fork something else.",2017-11-07 20:49:42

dpfpkpm,solomute,150,"Nobody explains Bitcoin very well.

The first thing to understand is that there's no such thing as ""a bitcoin,"" any more than there are individual physical dollars stored in your bank account. Your bank account is a series of deposits and withdrawals that, when you add them all up, result in your balance. Bitcoin is the same way, everybody has an ""address"" (aka account) and the ledger stores all of the deposits and transfers of value in and out of that address, and when you add them all up you get the total amount of Bitcoin that you ""own."" This ledger is stored on what's called the ""blockchain.""

The blockchain is a solution to the problem of, how do I decentralize the ledger, so that it doesn't have to be controlled by any individual authority? One ""block"" is a set of transactions that have been added to the ledger. Each block has a unique identifier, and a pointer to the unique identifier of the previous block in the chain. You can follow blocks backward in the chain to the beginning, so that you can verify the balance of any Bitcoin address by having access to the entire transaction history.

Now the fun part, *adding* blocks to the chain. If everybody were honest, we could just let anybody add a block and trust them not to spend more than they have. But because we don't trust people, our solution to prevent fraud is to make it very computationally difficult to generate a valid block. So computationally difficult that it takes the computing power of many, many different people working together in order to generate that block. And because many people have to work together, they all have to agree on the rules of what constitutes a valid block, including rules like ""nobody can spend more than they have,"" exactly how computationally difficult it is to generate a valid block (the network adjusts the difficulty of the math problem so that a new block is found every 10 minutes on average), the reward for successfully generating a valid block, the maximum size of a valid block (this is a big fight in the Bitcoin community right now), etc.

Remember that every block has a pointer to the previous block in the chain. If people think your block is valid, they will point the blocks they generate to your block and you become part of the chain. If your block is invalid, they will point their blocks to what they consider to be the last valid block, and you won't become part of the chain. Transactions are ""solidified"" by the fact that they get ""buried"" in the chain by a heap of blocks, each representing 10 minutes of computational effort of the entire network. You would need to control vastly more computational power than the entire network in order to undo even a recent transaction, and it gets worse the farther back you go.

So you see, the computational effort of ""mining"" Bitcoin is where the network gets its security. The results of that computational effort are not significant apart from the fact that they were hard to compute.",2017-11-07 03:39:03

Node count is also used as an unofficial way to show community buy-in for various splits. It isn't completely free to run an open node so those who do have some miniscule skin in the game so to speak.

dpin3hs,killerstorm,108,"Oh, I can answer this question.

I'm a CTO of a startup which develops consortium database software which is based on blockchain and SQL.

The thing about normal distributed databases is that it's optimized for speed, not security. If you run it in a secure environment, then it's good.

But you cannot distribute it between multiple entities. E.g. suppose there are four companies which want to run a common consortium database. They might each run, say, 2 servers. The problem with is that if just one server is hijacked, the whole system goes down, because distributed databases are not designed to handle such scenarios -- they trust their peer nodes instead of verifying everything. This is why they are fast.

So, typically, in a consortium one of companies (e.g. UPS) will run the database and will offer API access to other members. This is a viable approach, and this is how it was done for decades. But still, there are problems with it:

1. One member becomes ""more equal than other"" because he hosts the database. He has some leverage and some preferences, such as ability to see information before others, having access to a more complete dataset, ability to restrict others, and so on.
2. Consortium members can create a new company to host the database, but it costs a lot of money because it's a whole new company, you know. And this 
3. Members who do not host the database are not motivated to contribute to its development because they feel they don't have complete access (they only can use an API) and they feel it's just a product provided by their elder member.

So, in other words, while it might be more efficient, it has some governance asymmetry, and it creates a single point of failure. Even if you have a distributed database, it's still managed by a single company, which can shut it down -- or fall victim of an attack.

The solution to this is to give each member of consortium his own copy of a database, and implement an algorithm which synchronizes changes while also validating their authenticity.

And this is, basically, what people call ""blockchain"" or ""distributed ledger technology"". Whatever you invent in this sphere, it will roughly be isomorphic to ""permissioned blockchains"" if you do it right.

But ""blockchain"" does not mean that you need to ditch relational database technology (SQL). Bitcoin uses low-level key-value store, and many other blockchain implementations (Ethereum, Fabric, Exonum) copied that feature.

But underlying data store has nothing to do with blockchain. My company (ChromaWay) developed a blockchain implementation which uses ordinary SQL database (such as PostgreSQL) to store blockchain-managed data. We do not instrument the database itself, you can run vanilla server -- we simply control how data is added to the database. Specifically, data is added only if (1) it is properly authorized according to pre-defined policies; (2) it is approved by supermajority of consortium members. As simple as that...

Moreover, our platform allows to define blockchain logic in SQL. So you can develop applications as normal, except you need to submit write transactions (INSERT, UPDATE...) using special client software which signs them.

I.e. you can still use proven server database technologies, but your database will be automatically replicated to all consortium members so they all get equal access to it.

Back to UPS. Do they needed?

I can't say they really need a blockchain, because UPS is big enough to host this database in a central location and give access through API.

But, as I mentioned above, other members of consortium might not feel fully involved -- they will feel it's a service provided by UPS which they pay for, which can be shut down, etc. So they might not want to contribute to it. Then UPS will have to bear all the development costs.

Another thing is that blockchain products usually come with means of cryptographic authentication/authorization. That is, you get not just a database, but also client SDK, which when used as described will give good results.

In principle, using cryptographic signatures is easy -- it's just few library calls. But the problem is that application developers usually have very poor understanding how to do security properly. So while you can use cryptographic authentication together with normal databases and app servers chances are that either your developers will screw it up.

On the other hand, if you use blockchain product, it comes with a certain architecture which is already battle-tested and makes sense.

Well, at least, in theory. There's a plenty of misguided blockchain projects and platforms. In many cases blockchain is used as a cargo cult, basically people just add blockchain features without really thinking.

But, on the other hand, if you do it right, blockchain might have value in the long term -- it can make applications more resilient, future-proof and provide more sustainable governance structure. (You know, a product from a single company can just disappear one day, but blockchain has some degree of autonomy -- if some members want to keep it working, it will keep working, so it can survive many individual companies.)

Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether

Do not daytrade

Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts

**FULL TEXT HERE**

The Segwit2x effort began in May with a simple purpose:  to increase the
blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.

Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin.  Although we
strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.

As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become
obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x,
whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

Guys, seriously, this is great news for both BTC and BCH. Leave behind the childish ""winner/loser"" mentality and enjoy the ride.

We now have a healthy competition for the two ""opposite"" scaling solutions: on-chain/off-chain. Without the absurd disruption that was about to be caused by S2X a completely political move that didn't really have any consensus whatsoever (as demonstrated by this announcement).

If you believe in big blocks, very good for you, bet for the big blocks platform and you may win big. If you believe in off-chain scaling, very good for you too and the same applies.

This also brings you the opportunity to hedge your bets holding both in the proportion that is more confortable with your inclination.

dpiyb5c,yolotrades,95,"**The End of an Era**

Last evening, for an average combined price (BTC+BCH) of ~$7,950, I scaled out of 45% of my long-term position.

Backstory: I've been 100% exposed to bitcoin for about three years. Had all my eggs in one basket for *far* too long. I am still *very* bullish in the long-term, but the price just got so close to my sell ""target"" that I couldn't justify the risk of the exposure for the minimal remaining gains.

Over a year ago I pegged $10k as the spot where I was going to sell ~80% of my stash and take out a large chunk. Then I started thinking that 80% was too much to sell, and that I'd be chopping down the tree rather than harvesting the fruits. When the combined BTC+BCH price got to about $8,000, my logic started working like this. ""$8k -&gt; $10k is only an additional 25%. Why am I risking everything I have in a volatile and risky market for something I can pretty easily get without all that risk?"". I started to develop selling schemes and model them out - if I sold x% right now, what would I have *now*, and what would my remaining BTC and cash (and the opportunity cost of what I'd given up) be worth in the future?

I quickly realized that keeping 50% from $8,000 would have my net worth higher than the ""sell 80% at $10k"" scheme somewhere very quickly. It seemed an adjustment to my plan was necessary, for the sake of my long-term *and* short-term financial success.

Ever since $7,000 broke, the price has felt so close to my ""target"" that I couldn't sleep. I was eating a ton. I was drinking a ton. I was starting to get majorly stressed out. I was actually asking myself *why* I couldn't bring myself to take some profits, even though I had it all laying naked on the line. It felt like it was the right thing to do... but I felt like greed was getting in the way.

As for the fork: I am agnostic towards the merits of the upcoming fork. The fork itself wasn't really a reason for me to sell or a reason for me to hang on. But the potential for network disruption (inability to send coins), the potential for a long wait while wallet providers upgrade their software (inability to quickly and safely split and then transact coins, i.e. being stuck in your position) and the uncertainty concerning when and where I could actually *sell* my S2X, led me to believe that selling my BTC and BCH today - given how close to my target I am - would be better than potentially being forced to wait months to transact again. I don't know and/or think the fork will be a good or bad thing in and of itself. But adding another fork would make it more complicated (theoretically) for me to cash out the same dollar amount (if, indeed, the price was ""split"" between the coins). It wasn't a reason for anything alone, but it did inform my decisions with respect to how easily and seamlessly I could access my capital after the fork... which perhaps made me prefer a partial exit *beforehand* rather than after the fork.

In any case, I tried to ignore the fork and focus on the price. If it was at my number, it was at my number, and a looming fork shouldn't matter. I'm not going to hold on for ""a few more weeks"" just to get something I don't care about... especially when I can get what I *do* care about *right now*. It it wasn't a reason to ""sell"", but it certainly wasn't a reason to ""hold on for now"" either. The biggest thing informing this decision was the combined price of BTC and BCH, and my level of exposure.

**Moving Forward**

Outlook: I'm still bullish. I wouldn't have ~$3m still exposed to Bitcoin if I didn't think it's got some huge *long term* potential. But I only have one life. Only one real chance to ""get it right"". When you're dealing with once-in-a-lifetime events, it's impossible for the actual outcome to approach the expected value. If I thought it was a 5% chance I'd get my coins stolen or hacked or BTC would break or something, then I can't just say ""The EV of that event is 0.05 times my exposure"". There just aren't enough trials. It's going to be a binary event unless you *make it* a non-binary one. Either you make it or you don't. That didn't sit well with me to be honest. When you've only got one chance to get it right, I think erring on the side of caution can be a smart play.

I am going to enact some sort of sell scheme in an attempt to re-balance and take profits more often. For now, I think it's going to look something like selling 1% each month moving forward, and giving myself a 15% one-time bonus every time the price doubles. I modeled it out, and selling 1% per month would still leave me with over 100 BTC come 2026 (more than 8 years from now). I never felt comfortable taking money out *slowly* when I didn't have a big enough cushion to fall back on, but now that I have that cushion, I think using my remaining BTC to slowly generate cash-flow is a smart way to keep it growing (I will never take out MORE than it's grown by) and keep some income flowing. In other words, I didn't want to sell *anything* until I could take out a big chunk AND have a large enough chunk that the appreciation on that chunk can provide me with a *very* good life (and, I'm comfortable ""relying"" on that income because I have a ""chunk"" to fall back on).

**Conclusion**

If Nakamoto started dumping his bitcoin back into the market, the value would plummet. He's thought to be sitting on over a million bitcoin in multiple wallets. With stocks, someone who dumps stock in amounts to crash the value becomes under scutiny very quickly. Nakamoto can sink the value of bitcoin at his leisure if he wants to flood the market with them.

dpmki12,MadamBeramode,183,"In the very early days of bitcoin around 2009-2011 (early 2011), you could just mine them by downloading a client and leaving it running. This client would use your computer's CPU to run a mathematical algorithm (which serves no purpose aside from validating transactions really). You would then be rewarded with bitcoins. 
Once 2011 came, mining switched over to GPUs since they were far faster and more efficient than CPUs. A few years later in 2013-2014 time period, ASIC machines (Application Specific Intergrated Circuit) machines took over and mining became far more centralized.

Nowadays most BTC is mined in enormous data centers filled with ASIC machines (which cost about 4000-5000 each and take about 6 months to pay off their value). The issue with this is that it centralizes the wealth and power of BTC in the hands of a few people, which is the complete opposite of a ""decentralized"" currency. The problem with this? When people don't agree, they just leave and take their processing power with them (which is being used to validate transactions and ensure the book is legitimate). Hence why there are so many ""forks"", though segwit 2x was cancelled.

Early users would get 50 bitcoins very quickly to reward early adopters and you could mine literally hundreds/thousands of bitcoins in a week (Bitcoin is around $7000 at the moment). In 2009, 1000-1500 bitcoins were worth about $1. Today they would be worth between $7-10.5 million. If you left your computer running the client for a month in 2009 or early 2010 and never touched those coins until today, you'd probably easily clear $50 million.

Hindsight is 20/20. BTC was a brand new and no one knew back then would turn into a revolutionary technology. The vast majority of BTC mined back then was sold at far lower prices ($1, 5, 10, 100, etc etc). Several million BTC were also lost

dpnyt4i,BitcoinReminder_com,122,"&gt; Notable changes
&gt; ===============
&gt; 
&gt; Network fork safety enhancements
&gt; --------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; A number of changes to the way Bitcoin Core deals with peer connections and invalid blocks
&gt; have been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.
&gt; 
&gt; - Unrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even
&gt; if they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).
&gt; This prevents peers wasting the resources of a node.
&gt; 
&gt; - Peers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; - For a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip. If it
&gt; doesn't, and if we still haven't heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send
&gt; a single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient
&gt; work, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent
&gt; excessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable
&gt; number of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.
&gt; 
&gt; - Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact
&gt; block announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)
&gt; will now be disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; - If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect
&gt; to an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect
&gt; the peer that least recently announced a new block.
&gt; 
&gt; - The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be
&gt; invalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that
&gt; descends from an invalid block is marked as such.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Miner block size limiting deprecated
&gt; ------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Though blockmaxweight has been preferred for limiting the size of blocks returned by
&gt; getblocktemplate since 0.13.0, blockmaxsize remained as an option for those who wished
&gt; to limit their block size directly. Using this option resulted in a few UI issues as
&gt; well as non-optimal fee selection and ever-so-slightly worse performance, and has thus
&gt; now been deprecated. Further, the blockmaxsize option is now used only to calculate an
&gt; implied blockmaxweight, instead of limiting block size directly. Any miners who wish
&gt; to limit their blocks by size, instead of by weight, will have to do so manually by
&gt; removing transactions from their block template directly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; GUI settings backed up on reset
&gt; -------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; The GUI settings will now be written to `guisettings.ini.bak` in the data directory before wiping them when
&gt; the `-resetguisettings` argument is used. This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the
&gt; GUI settings.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Duplicate wallets disallowed
&gt; ----------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Previously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing
&gt; issues when both were opened simultaneously. It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Debug `-minimumchainwork` argument added
&gt; ----------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; A hidden debug argument `-minimumchainwork` has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used
&gt; when validating a chain.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Low-level RPC changes
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; 
&gt; - The ""currentblocksize"" value in getmininginfo has been removed.
&gt; 
&gt; - `dumpwallet` no longer allows overwriting files. This is a security measure
  &gt; as well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.
&gt; 
&gt; - `backupwallet` will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than
  &gt; destroying the wallet.
&gt; 
&gt; - `listsinceblock` will now throw an error if an unknown `blockhash` argument
  &gt; value is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since
  &gt; the genesis block. The behaviour is unchanged when an empty string is provided.

dpp1iy2,SirEDCaLot,321,"I think Mr. Charles is right.  

I got excited about BTC years ago because it finally offered the possibility of fully decentralized finance- no need for Wells Fargo or JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs.  Normal people and businesses could transact without needing anyone else's help or approval.  

For me, an American with a good job and credit, that is mildly interesting.  For someone in a country with shitty economic policy / corrupt financial system, or who cannot get a bank account for whatever reason, it's *revolutionary*.  Just as the Internet took away the borders of communication, Bitcoin can take away the borders of money.  

So I bought and I started HODLing.  I told my favorite companies to please start accepting BTC.  I told others to get into Bitcoin because it's the future.  I laughed with everybody as we said 'TO THE MOON!!1' because we all knew that's where we were going.  I looked at companies like Visa and laughed, because they were the past and we were the future.  We were *excited*.  

Then the bubble popped.  I was told I can't use 0-conf to pay for coffee because nobody should use 0-conf (including the people who were using it).  I was told I shouldn't send microtransactions on Bitcoin.  I was told that gambling on Bitcoin is spam and should be filtered out.  I was told that I shouldn't use Bitcoin for small day to day transactions because I'm wasting block space and I should use Visa instead.  I was told that paying $5 per transaction is a good thing and the network is working as designed.  The companies I told to start accepting Bitcoin mostly stopped accepting Bitcoin.  

Right now, this is not the rocket I wanted to be on.  I wanted the rocket that goes TO THE MOON!!1, not the rocket that's too small to even make orbit let alone hit the moon.  

I want the old days back- the days when we'd tackle problems together with enthusiasm rather than defeatism.  The days where we'd boldly innovate rather than being paralyzed for months/years by fear of technical problems.  The days when we boasted we were impossible to stop or censor, rather than fear [getting banned for promoting the 'wrong' proposal](https://i.imgur.com/B1WlwOM.jpg).  The days when voting for proposals was called decentralized democracy in action, not a hostile attack.  

I don't think those days are returning to Bitcoin, not anytime soon, not with the history they've created in the last few years (especially /r/Bitcoin).  And at minimum, it would require a change in moderation policy.  Don't get me wrong- I hope Bitcoin succeeds, I hope Lightning works as well as promised, and I hope the Core devs can build something really cool.  

But I only see that *excited* attitude in altcoins.  Go talk to an Ethereum fan and you'll hear all about innovation, smart contracts, ICOs and new tokens, and the future of investing.  While we fight each other, those guys are innovating.  I want to do that again.  I want to stop fighting enemies within the walls, and worse people who think I'm the enemy because I want my coffee paid in Bitcoin, and get back to innovating.  

Maybe, hopefully, Bitcoin Cash will hold the future I'm looking for.  I really hope it does.  But for now, I'm losing excitement for Bitcoin.  I see the mempool filling up and the price dropping and I don't see anyone doing anything about it.

I'm not a tinfoil hat kinda guy, but that has to be it.  1) Obscure trading volume for bitcoin cash began when the price was around $300 for what reason?  For any reason, maybe a hedge against S2x.  But the big players in crypto could totally pull off this manipulation. They can trade BTC/BCH in a silo to themselves on those Korean exchanges and make it look like there's a real interest in BCH.  2) At the same time Jihan Wu and Bitmain (China) who seems to be the only company who can make ASIC miners just flips their hashing power to BCH and basically strangles the BTC network leading to a backlog of unconfirmed transactions and higher transaction fees ($10+); I'm in the process of transferring coins and it cost me $10 and my move is syill stuck.  Last I checked there was 160K transactions stuck, coincidentally occurring at the same time as the BCH pump.

Complete power move to take control of Bitcoin.  For a number of people it may not matter as they probably never sold their lot of BCH after the 8/1 fork.

dpp5lox,Chris_Pacia,159,"&gt; I didn't like the burden that increased blocks would put on nodes. I believed this would push bitcoin towards centralization, that nodes would be forced to drop out from the increased storage burden.

Look none of us want that to happen. We should always be able to run the software on normal consumer grade computers (maybe not 5 year old computers, but current hardware). 

But the main point of contention that has existed between this group and Core is we know that 2x, 4x, 8x, will not prevent that from being possible. If it remains feasible to run a node on a standard laptop you can get at bust buy, with a normal home internet connection, how much centralization pressure can there really be?

That will buy us at least several years, if not longer, at which point other optimizations will be mature enough to scale beyond that.

Personally I find this to be a very reasonable scaling strategy. ",2017-11-12 15:12:42

So the miners wind up with most all the BCH and pump it to high prices while BTC gets slaughtered. Then what? Are we all going to become slaves and lackeys of Fake Satoshi, Jihan Wu and Bitcoin Judas? Not likely.

Investors will be running scared from the crypto space. With additional BCH entering the market (either held in reserve in case it rose, or from Xapo/GBTC/Coinbase/etc.) their price will start sliding. Core will finally do a PoW change, and no need to wait since there's no longer any qualms about bricking malicious miners' equipment. 

Bitcoin slowly gets a rebirth - I won't pretend it will be easy. But it will have development that we can relentlessly point to, while the relatively small band of Bitcoin Cash users runs out of buyers for overpriced BCH and the coin begins retracing. It won't be long before they are panic selling. If Jihan Wu wants to wind up owning 100% of it, he can be my guest. Let him find buyers for his crap coin then while he goes bankrupt mining it.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin Cash is objectively the worst coin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin has it beat on fees and speed after all.

1. Segwit has already been activated and will give Bitcoin ~3x capacity increase as adoption for this new type of wallet and addresses grows. You can track the adoption rate here: http://segwit.party/charts/ Once we reach 50+% we would have an effective doubling of transaction capacity.

2. Shnorr signatures. This basically combines multiple signatures into one, compressing the transaction sizes potentially by a large degree, especially if you lots of smaller ones coming in. Capacity increase is roughly ~25%+, in addition this will increase privacy. This can be implemented via soft fork.

3. Lightning Network is a second layer solution that will basically create an 'internet of payments'. It will allow organizations and individuals create payment hubs and channels which will find a route between sender and receiver like an email. This will increase transaction capacity 1000x, but it will require people to lock up their bitcoins in channels. On the plus side it will allow instant and virtually free transactions (no miner fees). This will free up on-chain capacity a lot because there are certain users who use the blockchain heavily with dozens of hundreds of transactions a day. These would all be moved to this second layer for speed and efficiency. This will come out later this year, but likely will take another year to materialize for a significant portion of users.

4. Rootstock is another second layer solution. It's basically a clone of Ethereum, that will be pegged to bitcoin. Rootstock will be able to have Ethereum level scaling (and smart contracts) promised to be ~2000 tx/second. This could second level chain could serve as a checking or debit account for Bitcoin users, while the regular bitcoin will serve as their savings account.

dpqnskp,Ilogy,109,"What you have to understand is that is that Bitcoin Cash is the result of a split in the Bitcoin community -- a divorce at the end of the long scaling debate that failed to come to compromise -- and consequently a divvying up of Bitcoin's capital. It isn't really a new coin as much as it is a fracturing of Bitcoin, Bitcoin broke in two. Naturally, then, it has managed to take a portion of the total capital in Bitcoin with it, and even a portion of Bitcoin's capital prior to the split was going to dwarf Litecoin. 

Bitcoin cash wasn't free money for bitcoin holders. It wasn't a kind of dividend as so many people seem to suggest. It simply splintered off a percentage of bitcoin's value that would otherwise have belonged to a unified bitcoin. That is to say, the combined marketcap of the two coins is roughly where Bitcoin would have been had it had been able to retain both communities in its fold.

When the Bitcoin Cash fork initially occurred, the broad community was not yet aware that it represented a final divorce between the big and small blocker communities because a compromise, Segwit2x, was still on the table. Bitcoin Cash was felt to be an annoying distraction by excessively ideological big blockers. Because of that, Bitcoin Cash did not immediately capture its real value at first as long as people thought Bitcoin would still remain unified. 

That is to say, the illusion of Segwit2x -- which continued to promise unity and gave some big blockers the false hope that Bitcoin would remain unified and satisfy their needs -- prevented the fracture from Bitcoin Cash from being very large. Meanwhile insiders, who in retrospect could very well have known they intended to cancel S2X, had the opportunity to buy up BCH cheap. Once S2X failed, big blockers had nowhere else to go except BCH, and BCH immediately began to realize a value actually commensurate with the capital of the big blocker community. We had some whales like Roger Ver kick off the stampede, but really Bitcoin Cash is becoming the big blocker's Bitcoin. 

Despite it being a minority community among bitcoiners, the big blocker community's capital completely dwarfs that of the Litecoin community. Furthermore, there is a large amount of capital in BCH from less ideological bitcoiners who actually would have preferred some kind of compromise all along and see merits to both sides, and therefore haven't sold their coins on either chain. 

This is why Bitcoin Cash has a dramatically higher marketcap than Litecoin. It has very little to do with the technology, it has to do with the fact that it simply capture a huge chunk of the capital that was already in Bitcoin. If Jupiter split in two, both sides would still be bigger than Earth. That's what happened here with Bitcoin.

dppmkm7,troyjan_man,99,"Bitcoin has been in something of a civil war for a while now over the issue of scaling. Bitcoin used to have low transaction fees and quick transaction times but as more and more people started adopting it the network got more strained leading to ridiculous fees and a back log of transactions that take forever to go through.

Part of the community wanted to simply increase the size of the ""blocks"" from 1MB to 8 MB (big-blockers as mentioned above) 

Part of the community wanted to introduce ""segregated witness"" (segwit) a sort of settlement layer.

And the rest of the community wanted compromise: introduce segwit and increase block size to 2 MB. (segwit2x)

None of them could agree so a few months ago there was a ""hard fork"" where bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) became 2 different coins with BCH adopting the big blocks and BTC introducing segwit.

Another fork was scheduled for this month to split BTC again for the segwit2x crowd. There then would have been 3 coins: BTC, BCH, BTC2x. However at the last minute the 2x fork was cancelled by some powerful players in the BTC community. This pissed off alot of the userbase.

For transparency I should note that I believe BCH to be the superior coin. It has the lowest fees and the quickest transactions of the two and I think it has more prospect for wider adoption because of this. In short BCH is more in line with the original vision of what Bitcoin was supposed to be.

Then again, sidechains are a great solution but they too open the door to a myriad of problems.

dprlxn2,_BreakYoFace_,185,"A significant chunk of this talk:

""It's not on your ISP bill-- it doesn't say 49.99 (but 10.00 discount -- the death of democracy discount -- 10 dollars off!!).  It doesn't say that.  You don't know that.  So you make the choice and gradually things change.  And you look back 10 years later and say, 'how the hell did we get here? How did our institutions die?'

We are not going to make the same mistake -- i hope -- with this system.  So we have a choice:

How do we scale while preserving the principles of decentralization, independence, privacy, security, autonomy, liberty in the base layer of these cryptocurrencies? 

The only way to do that is to move to additional layers.  We're going to move off-chain. Many of our transaction will not be settled on the base Bitcoin chain, or the base Ethereum chain.  They will happen in additional networks.  In engineering terms, you may have heard the terms Sidechain, or Lightning Network, or Drive Chain.  

These are all things that are going to allow us to do thousands, and then tens of thousands, and then millions, and then tens of millions, and then hundreds of billions of transactions a second-- Without all of them getting settled on the primary chain.

BUT.

Only if we do it right.  Only if we preserve the principles of privacy, security, liberty, autonomy on the primary chain.  We have to get it right.  And that means making the primary chain slightly more expensive, slightly less scale-able.""

dpsp6cn,DisReddits,70,"**A few observations from the past few days that I've grown tired off:** 

1. Post quality here and on other bitcoin subreddits has dropped substantially this past year and this sub is increasingly more bi-polar creating an echo chamber that is showing the same properties of /r/Bitcoin. According to most users here, we're either going to millions or to 0, with no oscillations in-between. Those users that continue writing quality posts get buried in a sea of memes, personal attacks and ignorant poopthrowing between most blocksize debate participants.
2. Apparently lots of maximalists have gone full retard and even the mention of any other coin is now considered shilling or a sign of being moron. We're here to make money and hopefully be a part of a revolutionary decentralized monetary system, right? So remove emotions from your trades and trade on merit/future prospects. Jumping on Core, Bitcoin Cash, ETH, ETC or whatever bandwagon and throwing poop in any other direction looks like the tantrums of a 3 year old.
3. Roger Ver is this months main antagonist/anti-christ/devil/Sauron, who's holding hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and will destroy it by allegedly exiting at a higher price then he bought in, thus should be reported to SEC or whatever other institution for doing so. Right? RIGHT? Grow up and stop it with these unsubstantiated character assassination. Every couple of months there's a new boogeyman, that's out to single-handedly destroy bitcoin even though their previous record has been 100% pro-bitcoin (just to name a few - Mike Hearn, Gaving Andresen, Jihan Wu, Peter Rizun, Craig ""claims to be Satoshi"" Wright and yesterday Kim Dotcom joined the gang, for daring to say that he has to use a system with sub 0.10$ transactions fees, not a system with 10-15$ fees).

**Personal update:** Was stopped out from my knife-catching 6400$ long at ~6200$, with a small loss, bought back in lower during the double bottom confirmation at 5600$, but only at 50% trade size as I was expecting the price to drop around 5100$ or a fakeout below 5k$. Anyway up 1000$ within 24h even with 50% trade size is good trade. BCH rally caught me off guard with the size of that rally (not the rally itself as BCH sole existence was a hedge against HF cancellation), but I still managed to play those BCH shockwaves, even furthermore increasing my net worth. This kind of volatility is traders dream, only if exchanges would work properly...  I've reduced my long size to just 25% (taking profits) as we're hovering at 61.8% bounce and we could see pullback here, though another attempt at 7k is also probable.

In short, most of the core devs are now employed by a big company backed by an insurance giant, and they are refusing to increase block sizes, thus limiting the number of transactions per sec on the blockchain.

This effectively forces bitcoin into becoming a settlement layer (only a ""store of value""/""digital gold"", not a currency), so that they can sell their upper layer solutions, which will involve introducing entities similar to banks (yay).

The original bitcoin was intended to be a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash"". In other words, no banks/intermediaries. Bitcoin Cash is a bit closer to the original bitcoin, but there's conspiracies on both sides.

* CT does not on itself provide anything you could call ""full privacy"". It hides the amounts involved in inputs and outputs to third parties. Together with CoinJoin it gives a much bigger advantage, however, and these new aggregateable rangeproofs would also give a strong financial incentive to do so (it's great when the more private solution is also the cheaper one!).
* While Bulletproofs massively reduce the size of the rangeproofs in CT transactions, the CPU overhead is effectively unchanged. This results in CT transactions still being 1-2 orders of magnitude slower to validate than transactions in Bitcoin right now. 
* Bulletproofs and the Petersen commitments they operate on are perfectly hiding, but not perfectly blinding. This roughly means that if they're adopted inside Bitcoin, and elliptic curve crypto is (completely) broken, new money can be printed. On the flip side, it does mean that the privacy of anyone who used CT in the past is unaffected. Alternative formulations of CT exist for which this is the other way around (perfectly binding but not perfectly hiding), where money can never be printed (even if the cryptography is broken), but privacy can be retroactively lost. There is currently a discussion on the mailinglist which of these is the better tradeoff (it is mathematically impossible to have both perfect hiding and blinding).

dpwpt1g,almkglor,245,"This is some low-level stuff that Vitalik does not understand well.

The Lightning Network is based on so-called Poon-Dryja payment channels.  Poon-Dryja channels have no lifetime and have no maximum number of payments before being forced to close, and are also bidirectional.  Poon-Dryja channels use transaction invalidation to ensure correct operation of the channel; in simpler terms, it's possible to attempt to cheat by playing old state on the blockchain, but old state will have a judgment window, during which the other party can provide a proof-of-fraud and claim the entire channel contents as damages.

For example, suppose we have a channel that starts out with state (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC).  I pay you 0.5 BTC in exchange for service or product, so the new state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC).  However I then turn around and replay the old (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC) state on the blockchain.  You have a few days to show everyone that the old state was obsolete by presenting a proof-of-fraud.  When you do, the entire 2.0BTC of the channel is awarded to you instead as damages, so I not only fail to steal the 0.5BTC I paid you, but I also lose the 0.5BTC that would have been rightfully mine as damages paid to you.

However, presenting the fraud proof to the blockchain is basically posting a transaction to the blockchain; even the ""replay old state"" is, in the end, posting a transaction to the blockchain.

What Vitalik is proposing is this:

1.  An attacker lays out an attack by setting up one or more Lightning nodes, and waiting until the nodes have 10 million channels connected directly to other nodes.
2.  The attacker waits until there is old state that is in the attacker's favor on all channels, and the current state is not in the attacker's favor.
3.  The attacker posts the old state of all the channels on the blockchain at once.
4.  Now there is a rush to post justice transactions on the blockchain, which won't fit because Bitcoin has a blocksize limit.  Oops!  We should have done sharding!!!  OH NOSE!

What Vitalik fails at here are below:

1.  The attacker can't post old state of all the channels quickly, either, because of the very same blocksize limit.  If it takes N days to process 10m justice transactions, it will take more than N days to process the old state transactions (the old state transactions are slightly larger than the justice transactions).  So if processing 10 million justice transactions will be a problem, the first problem will be for the attacker, which would need to post ***all*** the old-state transactions ***first***.
2.  Old-state transactions need to be signed out on by both counterparties, and have to allocate some fixed fee.  However a justice transaction only requires the signature of the one who is being cheated, and given a fraud proof, the cheated party can generate multiple versions of the justice transaction.  The upshot is that while the attacker is trying to push the 10 million old-state transactions, they have some fee rate, and the attacker can't RBF it to a higher fee rate (would require a signature from the cheated parties, which of course the cheated parties won't provide) and can't CPFP it faster (for technical reasons the attacker's outputs are timelocked so they can't CPFP the old-state transactions).  However, justice transactions can be rewritten (RBF'ed) to have higher fee in case of blockchain spam; only the cheated party needs to sign it.  For example if the current state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC) but I pushed the old (almkglor=1.0BTC, changes727=1.0BTC) state, you'd be willing to pay up to 0.5BTC in fees for the justice transaction (with the remaining 1.5BTC being rightfully yours) to push the justice transaction on the blockchain.  More justice transactions on the blockchain, fewer attacking old-state transactions, slowing down the attack and costing the attacker precious, precious money.

Thus, the blocksize limit actually hits the attacker in this situation harder than the defender, and is the correct solution to the problem.",2017-11-16 23:34:27

The Ethereum Casper technical specification **V2** is actually finished, the **V2** came out as of October 25th, *but today literally just now the latest version spec came out*. 

I'm not sure how much this has fallen under the radar, but as somebody who works in the space full time for the tech, I'm pretty up with all the latest and I'm excited.

Casper coming out will be like when broadband first came out on the internet after everyone was only used to knowing and putting up with the struggles of Dial-up. 

We all know what happened next, everyone moved over to broadband (duh).

Because it is the only logical next step, progression. There is a lot of similarities here with Bitcoin and Ethereum in the blockchain world.

Sorry for not joining this earlier but first we wanted to make sure it’s not an issue on our side.

First, I am extremely sorry this happened, it’s gut-wrenching. Thank you for posting this, and thanks to the community for the upvotes. Security is extremely important, and it should be discussed.

I am not sure what happened in your case, but you are not the only one. Our support team just got four requests from users asking about how to reset their 12-words seed, and we have one case where we were able to reconstruct step-by-step what has happened.

In that case, the user tried to check his Bitcoin Gold balance on the site https://mybtgwallet.com/. The site now looks innocent, but it looked very different yesterday. It was asking users for their 12-word recovery seed, as seen here:
https://wayback.archive.org/web/20171114235844/http://mybtgwallet.com/

It’s an open source site, but you can see that the code is brand new, all the files have been uploaded to GitHub 20 hours ago: https://github.com/John-Dass/btcgpuwallet

We suspect this site has been hacked.

This Exodus user gave his 12-words seed to this site, and saw his funds stolen. First his ETH, then his BTC, just like in your case. Technically speaking, it happened at the same time, but the ETH balance is updated continuously, while the BTC balance needed a manual refresh.

This type of theft is ONLY possible if someone has access to your recovery seed.

Another user in this thread commented the same thing happened via the same phishing attack: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpw5fmx/

We have an in-app warning system we normally use to notify our users if a feature is not working as expected (e.g., if ShapeShift temporarily disables an exchange pair) or if the network is unreasonably slow (like the BTC network last weekend). We’ve just issued a warning about phishing sites asking for the recovery seed.

Again, I am terribly sorry about what happened. Please email us at support [AT] exodus.io if you’d like our team to help investigate your case personally.

Thanks,
JP

This is about to get very interesting. The EDA has just kicked in and should continue lowering the difficulty over the next few days.

Eventually the difficulty could be walked very far down; unless some miners decide to mine it for the purpose of preventing the EDA from continuing.

Anyways if the difficulty is walked down to say 0.01% of current difficulty over the course of a few weeks; it would then be quite possible for Bitcoin Clashic block height to overtake BCH.

The EDA limits the adjustment to a maximum of 4x at every 2016 block interval.

So 0.01% even if 2016 blocks are mined in 10minutes would only adjust to 0.04%; then 0.16% ; 0.64% ; 2.5% ; 10%.

So they could mine 10,000 Blocks in a short amount of time before the difficulty gets close to the current BCH difficulty.

&gt;I try to assume good intentions in people. Unfortunately, I can no longer do so for @jgarzik. My judgement is that he is acting to disrupt the bitcoin network to advance his own interests.

&gt;Segwit2x was announced abandoned last week, but there are still some residual nodes in the network. This morning, those nodes froze at block 494,782. That's two blocks before the intended hard fork at 494,784.

&gt;Block 494,784 was announced an discussed as the forking block many times over the last few months. Here https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/888270313502330880 … and here https://segwit2x.github.io/segwit2x-announce.html … and here https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-October/000520.html … for example.

https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/888270313502330880

&gt;Looking at the code, it appears that Jeff made an off-by-one error. That's not entirely surprising. The VersionBitsState() code is confusing, and the commit where Jeff added the hard fork code had no review-
https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/pull/50

&gt;I then took a look at the miner activation code. There's another bug there. In the BlockAssembler constructor code, fWitnessSeasoned is being accessed before initialization. The result: no large block can be mined to trigger the fork.

&gt;This is a simple bug. Any reasonably competent coder would have spotted this (not least because a compiler or static analysis could have warned that a member was being accessed before initialization). Any reasonable review process would have caught this. Sadly btc1 had neither.

&gt;When I pointed this out to Jeff, he immediately created a patch and pushed it out.

&gt;In case it's not clear: SegWit2x only makes sense if it has consensus and can bring the network with it. That's what we were told again and again: 2x is an upgrade and will become the one true chain.

&gt;Trying to create a SegWit2x fork at this point, when it's clear that it doesn't have consensus, is simply sowing discord and confusion.

&gt;There are more bugs in the btc1 code. I can't in good conscience reveal what those are, since I have no intention of helping create a disruptive hard fork.

&gt;In case it's not clear: no-one should run btc1 code. It is untested, unreviewed, buggy and can only serve to disrupt and confuse the Bitcoin network.

dpzyqy3,DCinvestor,159,"**What can the earlier days of Bitcoin teach us about holding Ethereum?**

Recently, I was thinking back to my first exposure to crypto, after [talking with a couple of my coworkers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7daic7/daily_general_discussion_november_16_2017/dpxhrnn/) who shared their own, more recent experience with me.  It was late 2013 when I first bought BTC, but I had heard about Bitcoin a couple of years earlier.  I thought the idea of internet money that nobody controlled sounded like a scam, so I stayed clear.  I couldn't really understand the value proposition and didn't take the time to understand how it works (hindsight is 20/20).

That started to change in early 2013.  I learned much more about Bitcoin, which at the time was the only blockchain of any consequence, and began to understand the trustless nature of this revolutionary technology and how it would change the world.  But what drew me in was the price.  For those of you who weren't around then, [it's worth taking a minute to open up that chart on Coinbase and see what that bump was in the grand scheme of things](https://imgur.com/a/Wmjg1).

See what now looks like a relatively little blip there in late 2013?  That was when Bitcoin went roughly 10x in a month- from a $100 valuation to a $1000 valuation.  I signed up for a Coinbase account shortly before Thanksgiving.  Over that Thanksgiving, I spent the whole holiday / weekend talking to my family about how revolutionary this technology was- and *wow*, were they confused and unable to fathom it.  To me, it seemed so obvious.  Price increases have a way of ""revealing"" unassailable logic in situations like these.  It took weeks for Coinbase to approve my account, but I could hardly wait for that.  I was on eBay, seeing if I could buy [Casascius Coins](https://www.coindesk.com/whats-a-casascius-coin/).  They were appealing to me at the time, because they merged an asset that was completely virtual with something that was tangible.  My brain had still not fully accepted paying so much money for something that ""didnt' exist"" in real life.  But the speculation was soaring so high on those coins (double the BTC value or more) that I decided to pass.

A couple of weeks later, I finally got access to Coinbase and bought my first Bitcoin for around $900.  And then the price dropped, and it kept dropping.  But I kept on buying, knowing that this is how asset markets worked.  The price was going down, but for something this revolutionary, it would have to eventually go back up...at least that's what I was hoping.  I bought all the way down to prices in the low $400s.

And then in June 2014, I abruptly sold them all, at a sizable net loss.  Why did I do that?  What was going through my mind to make such a rash decision?  Well, [open that chart back up](https://imgur.com/a/Wmjg1).  The price had cratered down into the $230s and seemed to be stuck at these new lows- it was a winter that started earlier in that year and never ended.  And the [Mt Gox debacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) was completely soul crushing and I really felt that my hopes for the success of a decentralized currency were completely dashed.  And back then, there were no other alt coins to FOMO into.  It was Bitcoin or (mostly) nothing.

Besides, I had a major home purchase underway and decided that my money was better going into that rather than holding Bitcoin.  **In hindsight, I sold at what turned out to be the close to the bottom of Bitcoin.**  And then just look at that chart.  A slow and steady increase over years, with $1000 only being reached again in March of this year.

And as we enter Thanksgiving 4 years later, some of you are going to have these same conversations with your own families about Ethereum.  I can tell you what some of them are going to say: 

*""Internet money?  I wouldn't invest in something like that.  Who controls it?  Isn't this just for criminals?""*

*""Smart contracts?  Even if they do work, what's the point of having them when you have regular contracts?  And why does XYZ service even need to be decentralized?""*

*""This whole thing sounds like a bubble.  I hope you don't have much money in this...""*

**So what does all of this teach us about holding Ethereum?**

1. For many of your friends and family next week, it will be the first time they've heard of concepts like smart contracts or even cryptocurrency in any depth, but if Bitcoin is our teacher, it won't be the last.  Take the time to explain it, but don't be pushy about it.  Plant the seed, walk away, and send articles to them over the course of the next year.

2. Bitcoin's $1000 moment reminds me of ETH's $420 moment.  Many new buyers FOMO'ed in and are still waiting for their returns, with many likely abandoning the path along the way. Most of the actual buyers of Bitcoin in 2013 then were ""nerds"" who were fascinated by the technology because they were among the few who took the time to understand it and felt comfortable putting large amounts of money into something on the internet.  I would suggest that most recent ETH buyers are still in this ""nerd"" territory, without real mainstream understanding of what it is.

3. We are in what seems like a ""long winter,"" with ETH stagnant at around $300.  But it is unlikely our next big run will take 4 years to develop.  I'm thinking a period of 3 to 12 months.  The space isn't what it used to be, with massive institutional money coming and a very vibrant and mainstream-accepted development community.  Those among you who were smart bought every token they could during the July depression.  If that happens again, you know what to do.

4. Even if we had another Mt Gox style event (I won't name any exchanges or pegged tokens), it would probably not have the same impact as Mt Gox had.  The system is much more diverse and resilient against such events now.  There would be a drop, but it would be (hopefully) short lived.

5. **If you just hold long enough, the price is very likely to go up.  Substantially up.  Life changing amounts up.**  You understand the technology and the potential.  Don't doubt yourself on your original thesis, like I did with Bitcoin a few years ago.  The future picture for ETH has only gotten better in recent months.

*So learn from Bitcoin, and don't screw this up for yourselves by taking rash actions- driven by impatience or outsized greed.  I am not always one for hyperbole, but I am not exaggerating when I say that you may honestly regret it for the rest of your life.*",2017-11-18 19:19:15

dpz78ji,throwaway929892988,150,"this gets asked a lot - it's either responded to with helpful, broad, and / or informative advice about investing in general, dollar cost averaging, not investing what you can't afford to lose, holding longterm eliminating the need to time the market, etc. or it's met with curt, impatient, and sometimes hostile replies that don't help much. 

I guess that could be said for any question that is asked often, to a group of people who can't provide a definitive answer, because one does not exist. 

Whether you should invest depends on your financial situation, your goals, how long you want to hold, etc. There will likely be a time, perhaps not in the immediate future (1-3 months) where bitcoin drops to half its current value for a short period, assuming the unlikely event that so much institutional interest and public support arrives so as to secure the price at a stable level for a long time. even then, trends change and burn out, technology improves or re-focuses, and competitors squeeze out old-time ""first to market"" products. 

In other words, no one knows. IM*Opinion* You're better of getting your foot in the door with small amounts now (yesterday / last week / month / year in an ideal world - "" best time to invest was 2013, second best time to invest is today, blah blah"") and then learning the *general* trends and dip / boom cycles and just general practices surrounding trading. 

Your course of action depends on how much you want to spend. But say you want to put 10 K in, I would (at a minimum) watch for a day or so and try to understand the ""normal"" price fluctuations when BTC *Isn't* either rising or dropping by thousands of dollars a day - this has been frequent in the past months. 

Then maybe wait for a small dip, or wait for the next shit to stir and get in when it drops for a bit before (hopefully - it always has so far) shooting up again. That said, trying to time a dip to buy the bottom almost never works out perfectly. At the same time, it feels icky to buy at an ATH, which we're near right now (a couple hundred down from, so maybe there's your dip - who knows). My limited knowledge of how trading works would suggest that there's a sort of resistance at 8K where people aren't willing to pay above that yet - but a nudge in the news / big business / wallstreet, etc. could change that in just a few hours. 

This isn't really getting anywhere but maybe it was helpful. I've only been trading since early August, in BTC, ETC, and LTC. I've made about 3K in unrealized gains and which I had just gone in to buy a whole bitcoin (or 10) when they were still 2.5 K - but I was anxious to pull the trigger in that way, instead spacing it out over time. Sure, my decision was more responsible, but it stings to miss out.

dq0zqs8,Questions3000,195,"The article by anonymous on the cryptocurrency blog (lol doesn't sound too legit does it) does actually bring up some good points, so i'm going to try to counter argue this anonymous blog with my trusty reddit post.  (also notice the author takes tips in qtum and ether, is there a possible bias in the post? not saying there is, he makes valid points, but it is worth noting)

1. Neo is centralized:
Most definitely, the fact that there's only 13 nodes in the system is alarming, especially for a multibillion dollar blockchain tech company (worth noting, before investing). However, the Neo voting mechanism hasn't been put in place yet, so holders of Neo can't vote on nodes yet (perhaps this will be the coming announcement). The 13 current nodes are the starting nodes for the project, which is supposed to expand that number, but for the time being having 13 could be a strategic move (I wouldn't know, you'd have to ask the development team).

2. Neo blockchain disappeared for a couple of hours in October: Another valid argument. However, for an early blockchain tech, this is a common occurence (IOTA, Ehtereum etc), thus this argument can be used as an umbrella for all other blockchain companies. For instance, the IOTA wallet, the bitcoin cash attack, ethereum doa attack, etc.

3. Neo github has sparse activity. 
Would be nice to have hundreds of developers (though a good amount of developers do attend the various Neo meetups) chatting on github. However, what is the correlation between a project's success and github activity? Are there other sources of communication between developers in china and around the world besides github? Are there other sources of communication between programmers in china? Have you seen the COZ community's github? Why does the COZ community even exist (with continued updates) if Neo is a dead project?

4. Neo has 6 contracts operating on the blockchain.
If you look on the transactions tab in the neoexplorer every time somebody claims gas it shows up as a contract. Now I don't check every single contract that shows up on the transactions tab (thousands of them), but it is possible that there could be some actual contracts in that pile. Also, there's 5 more contracts on the way, and the Neo platform isn't even completed yet.  I too would personally, like to see actual businesses (alibaba) on the that contract list, but when you're throwing your money into startup techs it's always going to be a gamble.

5. The east has no interest in Neo.
Then why are Neo and Qtum both having several meetings with the chinese government? Last I checked the Chinese government banned a good amount of Chinese exchanges and ICO's. Perhaps when they go back up, we'll see what kind of volume comes in from China itself? The only other eastern exchanges that pump coins and that I can think of off the top of my head is Bithumb. 

6. Neo attracts scamming ICO's and Dapps
The only one that was brought up in the article is Aphelion, which most of the people in the Neo community have been extremely skeptical about. Check out the coming ICO's; Loopring, TheKEY, Qlink, which are all solid projects, some with corporate backing. Also, as I understand Neo isn't just about creating a shit ton of ICO's (a la Ethereum, which is also a great platform), but also about creating smart contracts for businesses and municipalities perhaps.

7. Neo makes announcements of announcements. 
This (the 3 day announcement) is the first time they've done this. This isn't even a point.

Also, some side points to give people a different perspective on Neo. 

According to KPMG China (On-Chain is in their top 50 fintech report0
""Onchain was founded in April 2015 following the launch of its Antshares blockchain system. The company conducts research on blockchain technology, particularly in relation to its application to the financial services sector.
It provides enterprises with customised blockchain solutions and has formed strategic partnerships with many major Chinese financial services organisations."" - Da Hong Fei founded On-Chain

The Fosun Group ( large asian conglomerate), which worked with Da Hong Fei previously on On-chain, is invested in the Neo platform. I don't think they'd invest a good amount of money into a scam platform as the author suggests (that's just common sense). 

Neo/On-Chain has helped Alibaba with their blockchain based e-mail evidence repository. Sure it's nothing huge, but it's still something.

So no random blogger guy, though there are valid points made in this article I don't think this multibillion fintech company got to where it is, through sleights of hand and scam tricks.

dq1me83,jessquit,83,"there are two answers to your question.

answer one is that 3.5B people @ 3 tpd using today's technology would require 121527 tps or approximately 30GB blocks or 4 TB per day which might seem pretty large to a hobbyist but in point of fact can be stored today for a cost of only $100 so honestly even today $100 per day is a completely trivial cost for at least a million businesses currently operating in the world.

the other answer is that **the question is bogus**, because 

1. nobody in crypto can solve that problem today or in the near future, not even the Unicorn Network, without significant centralization risks

2. more importantly, nobody in crypto **has** that problem today or in the near future.  it is a red herring question.  you might as well ask Alexander Graham Bell how many human operators will be needed to packet-route the modern Internet.

your question is an example of the [Nirvana fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy), a tactic that has been used to disrupt debate on this topic since at least 2014 if not 2010.

There is no demand for 121ktps on the blockchain.  There's currently approximately 0.002% of that demand for the blockchain.  **We should be so fucking lucky** that 1/2 of the world actually cares about using Bitcoin 3 times a day.  **That's** a problem worth solving right there.",2017-11-19 23:20:37

Actually, the non-forked bitcoin network would have continued operating just fine.

Why this was done has become blatantly obvious. The mods of /r/bitcoin are clearly are working with Blockstream employees/Core Devs to manipulate the market in their favor. We've seen this time and time again now for at least two years; but now there is evidence and facts to prove it and back it up. How Blockstream/Bitcoin Core devs were able to get /r/bitcoin mods in their back pocket, isn't yet known, but seems also painfully obvious being that Greg Maxwell and theymos have a long standing relationship going back to BitcoinTalk, Greg being a paid staffer there, theymos working with Warren Togami (Blockstream exec) on the Slickage forum embezzlement, and more.

What the fuck is going on in this thread? It's full of the exact opposite of what I expected to see from you guys.

Internet is a utility. All websites and internet should be equal. I don't want some corporation telling me what I can do online, just like we all don't want a few miners telling us what to do with our Bitcoin.

The current Net Neutrality regulations keep everything an even playing field. The electric company doesn't tell me what appliances I can buy. My ISP shouldn't tell me what sites I can visit.

Imagine you've only got one ISP choice (a real issue in many places). Now imagine your bank automatically closes any account that has Bitcoin-related activity.

Now imagine your bank has partnered with your ISP to block your access to all other banks, so you can't make a new account at a more Bitcoin-friendly bank.

Or maybe this...Imagine your ISP partners with an online retailer that doesn't accept Bitcoin, and blocks your access to places that do accept it.

Net Neutrality is the difference between:

2.	the teacher giving the snacks to the fat kid (who already got caught stealing his classmates food) and trusting him to share with everyone else after she leaves the room.",2017-11-22 07:11:55

dq871ba,bitcoinbabeau,239,"mid 2013 (I was 20 yrs old at the time), I fell into a pretty bad pit of depression. The sporting season finished so I had sort of lost my hobby, I was in a job I wasnt overly confident in, nor enjoying, my mother had kicked me out of the house because I wasnt getting along with her boyfriend, so I was shacked up with my grandmother who cant speak English well. I was trying to pay off a $12,000 car loan at around 18%pa interest that was breaking twice a week, and this guy I thought I was madly in love with, was seeing other girls behind my back.

I pretty much felt like I had nothing more to offer this world anymore, so figured I would call it quits on my life.

A few months prior I had heard about Bitcoin through a news outlet (they had been reporting on silk road), so figured I would give overdosing a whirl, by buying some pharmaceuticals.

I bought about 10 BTC for around $50 each (I bought a little extra as I wasn't too sure how to accommodate price swings or mining fees), and used it to buy a pack of Stillnox (a sleeping pill) and a few tablets of Oxycontin - I'm allergic to opiates so I knew it didn't take much to put me over the edge. 

Sure enough a few weeks later, the packages arrived. I hopped in my shitty car with a bottle of bourbon, and drove to a national park about 40 minutes out of town, walked into the bush and cried while I downed my pills.

Just as I had finished, my phone manages to find reception and its the ""boyfriend"" calling. by this point I'm a bit wasted, so start blubbering off at him about god knows what.. probably something a long the lines of how much of a fuck up I was and he'd be glad to know I'll be out of his life for good.. by this point I was going in and out of consciousnesses, and didn't realize he terminated the call a while ago, called emergency services, who managed to track me down and get me out of the bush and rush me to the local hospital.

From what I understand, they pumped my stomach as much as they could, and were about to start trying to flush the opiates out of my system. Until they found out that the ""Oxycontin"" I had taken was actually aspirin (fucking ripped off), and I wasn't having an allergic reaction, but rather just reacting to the sleeping pills, so I ended up sleeping it off for a few days in the hospital while they monitored me.

Once I was a little more coherent, I was admitted for an emergency psych evaluation, and spent a few more days puttering around the hospital. By this point, they didn't see my mental state as ""life threatening"" anymore and released me with out-patient care.

When I got out, the ""boyfriend"" decides we should take a break (I was too much baggage/drama for him) and my employer fired me for not showing up to work. I start seeing the hospital outpatient shrink, who was as useful as a sack of potatoes on a sinking ship, and was struggling to find new employment.

A few months go by, and With minimal money and even less self esteem, I figured hell, at least I know where I fucked up last time, may as well learn from my mistakes. I log back into my account to buy more bitcoin to try again, and sure enough, I had a little under 4 btc left in there.. which were now worth ~$1200 each.

I was so shocked by seeing the number, that I forgot all about why I logged on in the first place, and just sat there for hours and hours, reading about how this happened, why this happened, and figuring out how nearly $5000 had appeared in a broke, depressed girls bitcoin wallet.

From that point my life changed forever.

Shortly after, on my 21st birthday I asked all my family members to give me cash to buy myself more bitcoin. I invested it all into a bitcoin Ponzi/HYIP that was promising ""2% daily returns"" I got lucky and managed to cash out enough bitcoin to pay off my shitty car loan before it went under. From there I did some day trading (still do here and there), but found my calling in P2P trading.

I managed to trade myself a tidy stockpile of Bitcoin, which I have been hodling for the past few years. 

Looking back on it now, its weird to think that I'm kinda using the same bitcoin I was going to kill myself with, to buy a house with..

I mean no disrespect to bitcoin, and I love bitcoin, but let's follow the logic here.

Bitcoin is disrupting banks, because of the possibility of being your own bank, and the security that the network provides. Currently bitcoins biggest strengths are that it has the largest network effect, and first mover advantage.

Iota is disrupting bitcoin, because (theoretically, and this is the gamble) it will be able to do everything bitcoin does, but without any fees, and is designed from the ground up to scale with adoption.

I get that it's a gamble, and coordinator runs it, and it's centralized, and if they can't remove that then it's just like VISA. But that's the gamble we are all taking as investors any any crypto currency. 

I will not say with 100% certainty that iota will replace bitcoin, but laughing at iota is no different from Jamie Dimon calling bitcoin a fraud. ",2017-11-23 11:01:58

Browser cache was shit back then (because our computers were shit, it's nobody's fault) and server side assets were poorly coded in comparison too. Even the lightest sites had redundant code that meant we pulled down data we didn't need *frequently*. This was the norm, not the exception.

Searching for something you needed to know? Downright *hard*. Trawling the web for data back then was a legitimate ordeal you could spend time on. I'm not talking about the kind of data Wikipedia solved, I mean stuff like ""apache htaccess configuration default"". A search like that today? I get 5,000 other idiots who also don't know what we're doing and asked the same question on every forum in the world and Google can translate the guys in Japan automatically. Literally anyone in the world who has this answer is at my fingertips. Then? My first 200 results were whomever crammed the word ""apache"" into their webpage the most. Keep in mind every page takes about 25 seconds to pull up, if you're lucky, so there's no ""maybe this is it""- you've gotta commit to a page before you click. Nobody else remembers when you used to automatically skip the first page or two of search results because they were auto-generated crap built to get click throughs?

Everyone thinks message boards were the 'Reddit of their time' filled with helpful passionate people dedicated to a certain topic. Lol, no. If I'm new to woodworking, I can post a dumbass thread in /r/woodworking right now saying 'hay guise halp plz' and I'll get 50 people telling me what to buy, where to get it, what sales are going on, what to read, and how to get going. The dudes (and chicks) on the boards? Nah. I'll get 10 variations of 'rtfm noob' and maybe 2 people posting a link to an obscure post from a year ago that's woefully out of date. The kids who post on 4chan now are just the shitty kids of the shitty people who posted on boards back then.

Porn? Lol. Today I can stream 4-fucking-k *video* of a chick getting railed that was recorded yesterday morning and postprocessed on a render rig that afternoon: and when I say stream I mean *stream*- my browser literally can take the file and download it as I watch it and zip around the file client side to pull down the best parts, all for a *5 gigabyte file* on a server in another country with audio so good I can hear the queefs. Back then you waited 5 minutes for a 'high def' 400x400px jpeg with shitty compression to download and that's all you got! She doesn't move.

Speaking of girls or dudes (whatever you're into), dial up meant you had to be *online* to do any of this, including talk to people. Everyone forgets what it's like to actually *check your email* because today IMAP and always on connections mean my email on the local devices matches the server all the time. You had to connect, log in, and wait for the data to be pulled down- everything since the last time you checked it- and then fire off responses.

I don't wanna make it seem like these new issues with the internet aren't a big deal- net neutrality is important and websites doing bitcoin mining in the background using your resources and logging keystrokes or your TV Webcam watching you while it's 'off' mining data for the NSA are definitely super not cool; but looking back on the past like it was in any way better than today is a fool's errand: these things weren't an issue because they literally couldn't be. We didn't have the technology much less the resources or bandwidth for them to be possible. Moreover, these days the ability to fight these invasions and restrictions is literally a keystroke and a split second away. Comcast filtering data streams? $10 a month and you can set up a remote server in Lichtenstein serving as your VPN and tunnel your traffic.

dqaciba,brettor,101,"This should have been called The Ben Bashing instead of Euro rumble...

**Duncan: (A-)** Duncan already had three cities down at the start of the episode - the free rein he's had in western Europe has allowed him to expand much more quickly than the squabblers of the east. He's actually getting to focus on such things as religion and city management. Speaking of religion, Duncan forgetting to rename his is a tradition that goes back [nearly 4 years](https://youtu.be/1R3MOiK5POA?list=PLcHXCoaLlBY4UMzuIeTlluo0QGLmphffH&amp;t=275). At least he was able to add the extra reformation belief to it thanks to going Piety, however. he's beating the Byzantines and the Celts in the faith game so far. 

**Tom: (B+)** Tom has almost as much of an advantage as Duncan when it comes to space. However, the deserts of North Africa seem much more hostile than the grasslands on the other side of the Mediterranean, and Rome is best by barbarians. Fortunately, he's got a lot of units out, but his expansion has been severely stifled. When Tom finally did break out, he settled his first expansion of Entierm (and has 2 other settlers out shortly after). Meanwhile, he is building Petra in Rerm, meaning he did understand the importance of that wonder for his desert start. Of course, Petra would benefit even more amazing desert hills if he hadn't inexplicably moved one tile away from the river at the start of the game...

**Daltos: (B+)** Daltos has still managed to get 4 cities out in a reasonable amount of time, despite being started in the same clusterfuck as Pyrion, Lewis and Ben. He's got some space to the north to expand to, but he better like Tundra, since it seems like that's all his cities will have to work with. If he can stay huddled up in the northern wastes far from the Balkan fray, Daltos could play a dark horse role in this game. He's the only one to offer to come to Ben's aid, but he seems hesitant to directly involve his own troops right now. Thoughts and prayers can only do so much when the Greek civilization is on the brink of extermination.

**Lewis: (B)** Cocky Lewis has entered the game. He only has two cities, but is already throwing his weight around - I suppose he expects Athens will be his third. Passive expansion and city management have taken a back seat to the quest for a Greek ethnic cleansing. Lewis has his Dromons out and is planning to bathe Athens in (ironically) Greek fire. Even once Ben is taken out, there will still be 3 civs vying to be emperor of the east, and it's easy to see how he and Pyrion could end up at war given the proximity of the borders (not to mention shared history). It will be interesting to see who comes out on top and whether Daltos will ever pick a side.

**Pyrion: (B)** Pyrion has also now expanded to three cities and is claiming to be Yugoslavia, a country that hasn't existed since before the majority of the Yogscast viewers were born. He's also got places to expand to on the Greece-like peninsulas branching off from his starting location, that he really didn't need to crowd Ben in order to get a decent amount of cities in. Now, Pyrion is engaged in a seemingly pointless game of Whac-A-Mole with Ben at the Hot Gates. Any unit that steps on the swampy one-tile land bridge connecting the two empires is immediately killed by ranged units waiting on either side. The only hope for a breakthrough is a coordinated naval attack or the involvement of Lewis.

**Ben: (D-)** Ben's game was over before it really began. To make matters worse, the three neighbours who seriously cucked him over are now rubbing salt in to the wound by mocking his lack of expansion. It's like Lewis, Daltos and Pyrion are all beating him down with baseball bats yelling ""Stand up, you pussy!"". Ben isn't under any illusions as to his situation. When Lewis said he was going to focus on building his civ and didn't have time for war, [he immediately bought another archer](https://youtu.be/p73vrhE5ohE?t=217). Still, it's hard to see him ever owning more than one city in this game, and he'll likely own less in the near future judging by the Dromons on the horizon.

**Notes:** To clarify, *Pyrion* is paying for the road Ben built in his territory. And yes, you can ruin someone's economy you have open borders with by sending your workers into their lands and spamming roads. If the road was still in neutral territory, Ben would be paying for it. Pyrion was talking about the [Winklevoss twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winklevoss_twins) in regards to Facebook.

dqb4cbq,imaginary_username,84,"&gt;Bitcoin transacts in a way that no other widespread currency can, and to willfully ignore that in favor of a generic store-of-value -- which is already accomplished by a billion other things -- is to say ""fuck you"" to Satoshi, his vision, and all of his code. 

People often give that bewildered look when I tell them Bitcoin should not - and in fact cannot - become the next Picasso painting; so many just want it to ""moon"" so they can cash out to something they want, oblivious to the fact that for something to go up in price, _someone else_ needs to be pouring money into it; and if the thing isn't generating any fresh economic value (no transactions, no business), then it's a classic Ponzi scheme. It's destined to collapse at the expensive of the last - and most numerous - layer. 

If people want Picasso paintings, they can go have their Picasso paintings. Me? I'm gonna stay, spend (to support merchants) and rebuy, and help foster a Bitcoin (Cash) economy that'll one day take over the world. ",2017-11-25 15:28:53

I'm not really bothered about how I make the bitcoin(usually against the USD pair but weeks like this can be a bit slow) or what pair I trade as long as it's a BTC pair. Sometimes I lose more by looking for a BTC/USD trade than taking a trade on another pair. It would clean up this daily and give others a place to discuss other opportunities with other pairs if they want. Not sure how it would go because there's a ridiculous amount of ALTs so maybe just try and contain the discussion to the top 10 or something.",2017-11-25 13:39:53
dqa1dqs,BootyPoppinPanda,60,"Bitcoin is a great experiment and it is fantastically fun to see it play out, especially if you have skin in the game. 

It is also a tremendous social experiment. It started with the super nerds speculating on the new tech and the soundness of the protocol. Then came the regular nerds who didn't hear about it at first but thought it was neat and wanted to learn. Then came early adopters and visionaries who understood bitcoin in layman's terms and saw some serious potential. To this point, discussions were technical and hopeful for crypto. 

Enter this new era: very early wild west mass adoption. The itty bitty snowball is gaining some momentum. Market cap is going up up up. This begins a marked transition in the general attitude and knowledge of the adopter. These new adopters are a different group of people. Due diligence before diving in is going down. Profit seeking is the main drive for buying in (bubble time.)

Bubbles, or heavy mainstream adoption if you want to argue against it being called that, is a perfect social recipe for greed, deceit and confusion. The stakes are getting higher and predators are coming out in full force. It's only natural to see in this environment. 

Sadly, it seems to be working. All these ICOs, shitcoin forks and shady exchanges are making MASSIVE profits off scared or greedy idiots who don't know any better.

I own ETH, and I build apps with ethereum, and i'm even a contributor to some of the core Ethereum related projects, so anyone can say I'm an ETH fan.  But bullshit is bullshit.

Objectively speaking the interest in Bitcoin is growing at an order of magnitude larger scale than Ethereum. Ethereum had its moment this year when it got to where it is right now and it will probably continue to grow but right now at this point in time, Bitcoin is undoubtably the main character in the spotlight. Saying otherwise just tells either how clueless you are about the landscape, or that you're just trying to manipulate others.

I say this because I'm sick of people posting this kind of circle jerking narratives that don't do anyone any good. Maybe your goal is to get the hype up just enough so that you can exit.

dqe1ove,fuck_reddit_suxx,239,"Then you better call your fucking doctor! 

Because all trendlines say it's going to 90k by summer. It moved up $117 since I started writing this. If you understand the fundamental situation we are in right now as holders of any of the cryptocurrencies, then the following is no surprise:

&gt;less than ***.1%*** of the general population are using bitcoin in one capacity or another.

The growth you've seen was that number coming from .00000001% (nearly a billionth) of first-worlders to the present .1%. Remember, 10,000 bitcoins would have hardly bought you a pizza when the adoption rate was so low.  

The reason is simple: supply and demand. There are a limited supply of the bitcoins, and even less available in liquidity available to buy, and therefore with an increasing adoption rate, there must be skyrocketing prices until it reaches it's true value, somewhere around $100M USD estimated to be about 2023-2025 by the current growth charts extrapolations by trends. This assumes 25% of westerners use the coin, with average holdings of $1000. This is a several trillion dollar market cap increase projection from current $250 billion market cap in a short time. It's a literal digital gold rush, and right now, you are in the first .11% of people to get on board. 

Tomorrow, it will be a .12% saturation. That's already another 8-10% growth in your portfolio, just from holding, as your coin gets rarer. 10k in the morning. Imagine another year of adoption rate. Go to your favorite exchange and look at what a million people with a thousand dollars ( a billion dollars) would do to the price.

Then times it by ten. 

Bitcoin isn't going to 9k. Bitcoin is going to 90k now through spring. It will probably break the $400k barrier by August or September 2018 as the adoption rate reaches the .2%-.4% saturation. The market cap should surge from $250 billion to $2.2-2.5 trillion by then. This is about a 1/4th of the global gold market cap. Which performs at a few percent a year, eaten mostly by fees and brokers. Bitcoin's growth is very attractive, and the Fear of Missing Out may be powerful enough to accelerate these projections, but there is no doubt they are steps along the way to something like PayPal's adoption rate, which is around what, 35% saturation? Could you imagine if bitcoin reached an adoption rate of 35%, over the .1% current? That's 350 times growth, 350000%. Probably a 3-5 year plan for a bitcoin holder. 

That's what's happening: the adoption rate is growing everyday, as well as the market cap, versus a limited number of coins.

dqeh01g,Bootrear,167,"By the time we reach that, if it is technically feasable, certainly.

Small blockers often use the argument that _ultimately_ big blocks will not be sufficient to solve the problem. So, a larger block size now - even though it would solve most short-term issues(!) - would be the wrong move, because it's not the right move _forever_.

Let's turn that around on them. The current algorithm used by Bitcoin (and derivatives) is expected to be insecure by 2027 due to advanced in quantum computing. So long-term, using it is wrong, because it will not be the right move_forever_. Shall we just cancel Bitcoin then?

This argument is a combination of perfectionism, over-engineering, and pre-mature optimization. These are the opposites of pragmatism. These are also common traits that make software projects overbudget and underdeliver.

These are common traps for engineers to fall into, because they speak to the _feeling_ of _doing things right_, but there is often a disconnect with real-world usefulness, and it easy to get _lost_ in perfectionism. That same _feeling_ is also a common base for inability to compromise. Had Core been willing to compromise a year or so ago and simply upped the blocksize to 2 or even 4 MB (and not SegWit), the community would have not been divided, and the price and acceptance of BTC might have been double what it is today.

dqd6xnn,DboVilakati,130,"In times of economic uncertainty (recession, crash, depression) people typically flock towards safe haven assets, sacrificing higher percentage returns for security. Holdings will flow towards safe haven assets like gold, silver to a lesser extent, the swiss franc, bonds, and treasury notes and away from riskier assets like stocks and uninsured deposits (like money market accounts).

Will people see crypto currencies as safe haven assets or risky assets?

So often, I see people treating crypto like a binary investment, ""*It'll go to $1000 or $0*"", which is an incredibly risky attitude towards investment. At the same time, there are cases where people suffering from hyper inflation ([Zimbabwe](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/31/africa/zimbabwe-bitcoin-surge/index.html), [Venezuela](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/03/why-venezuelas-currency-crisis-is-a-case-study-for-bitcoin/)) or government haircuts ([Greece](https://www.ft.com/content/9963b74c-219c-11e5-aa5a-398b2169cf79)) have turned to Bitcoin and to a lesser extent Ethereum (at least in Venezuela) as safe haven assets and mediums of exchange less likely to drop in value from day to day.

But not all cryptos are created equal. Bitcoin has been around for about a decade now and it has a brand name that people accept and trust. It isn't going anywhere and isn't at high risk of an exit scam like some tokens and shitcoins are. Putting Bitcoin in the same basket as a shitcoin like Bitconnect isn't a useful comparison - one is an accepted store of value and medium of exchange and one is an in-the-know coin that only a fraction of its holders know is a ponzi.

How will Ethereum react? I personally think that the erc20 economy would suffer a massive pruning of dead projects, exit scams, and other consolidation out of risky erc20 tokens and into 'safer' assets like ETH, BTC/BCH, and fiat. This outward flow from the erc20 economy could drag the ETH price down if that money moves into assets other than ETH, which seems more likely when people are trading on fear than a consolidation *into* ETH.

I'm not sure how I'll be trading when shit hits the fan, but I think after a crash shakes short term profit seekers, scam ICOs, and dead projects out that if development continues, the crypto-economy will be more resilient and stable in the long term.",2017-11-27 02:46:10

I'm in Venezuela and i am so happy that bitcoin exists, without it i would probably have lost all my hair by now due to stress... 

Just these past 30 days our currency VEF has gone from 22'000 per 1USD to 84'000 per 1USD. Our minimum monthly wage a month ago was 350'000VEF, now just a few days ago it was increased to 450'000VEF further ruining the economy... So 1 month ago minimum monthly wage was 350000/22000 = $15, now it is 450000/84000 = $5.3, that is a whole month worth, 5 days a week 8 hours a day...

Now i'm a web developer so i earn quite a lot more than that minimum wage, not because i am a web developer because web developers that work here in the country earn more or less that same amount, but i earn a lot more because i work online for clients in other countries, and i charge according to international markets, but because this country is so centralized and you can not send nor receive money to other countries, neither with your bank account or credit/debit cards, because of that reason i can't receive payments from clients in other countries, my options and what i used to use were payment processors such a paypal which i could only use to receive/send to other paypal accounts, i could not withdraw because its only option is to add US bank accounts which i do not have since i live in Venezuela... If paypal froze my funds which they did often and kept doing to re-verify me for security reasons, but if they ever decided to froze my account for ever i wouldn't be able to see my money anymore, now they did freeze my account because one of my friends once opened his paypal account on my network, and paypal linked both accounts and thought it was just one person using both accounts...

I had to deal with using payment processors, or awkwardly asking clients to pay me in amazon giftcards, and by the way whenever i wanted to spend money on food or anything i had to pay an exchanger about 20% in fees for him to convert my paypal/payza/amazon giftcards to my currency.

Now with bitcoin it is totally different, i can use localbitcoins to sell and the exchange fee is just about 4%, so i have most of my money when i convert it, i also keep total control over my money because i have my private keys so no third entity could fuck me over just because they wanted to. If i wanted to travel to another country i wouldn't have to worry about moving my money, or opening paypal/payza/etc in an ip from another country, i would just need to restore my private keys wherever i am at and i immediately have access to my money again!

dqjo0or,taranaki,353,"I understand where you are coming from, but my argument is that to some degree, the greater fool theory is irrelevent and not particularly uncommon even in the accepted stock markets of the world. 

Most stocks right now that you buy in companies off things like the New York Stock Exchange do not pay dividends, ie there are not quarterly or annual payouts of profits to stockholding investors. Furthermore, there is nothing necessarily linking stock value to profits. For instance it is entirely possible that a company loses money, but its stock value still goes up anyway.

So why the heck can say Tesla's stock value go up like [this over the past year](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/chart?p=TSLA#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), when during that same time period they have posted losses &gt;$200 million each time!? Now you might say, /r/taranaki, its because people think in 10 years Tesla might be making large profits. And  to that I say sure. Except in either scenario all a stockholder has in either scenario is a piece of (now electronic) paper that essentially just sits there and doesnt pay you any money. In fact its only value is that other people will want to buy  the stock, and then sell it to someone else on the thought they will expect SOMEONE ELSE to want it especially if quarterly reports  look good. But implicitly if someone declared tomorrow stocks can no longer be traded,  then you have a worthless piece of paper (because it doesnt pay dividends).

Do you kind of get the shell game that goes on in real stocks? Its the exact same speculation that goes on w/ bitcoin. People want bitcoin, because they believe that other people will want it based on the thought it will keep going  up. People want Tesla stock on the thought that OTHER people will want it due to the thought that  if earnings go up a 3rd person will want it for even more (even though increased earnings in a vacuum doesnt help or hurt the owner of the stock if he cant  trade it to a 3rd party)",2017-11-30 14:33:32
dqjby98,RedactedEngineer,344,"I don't get this. Bitcoin has value because it is a currency that can decentralized and uses public ledgers to keep track of transactions. So the inherent value of bitcoin is that it is a currency and it has an inflationary limit of 21 million units. Sounds good. But how does money work, if people don't use it as money but as investment. If I thought the value of my dollars was going to increase 25%, I would hoard all of my money. And at a sign of trouble, I would freak out and buy hard goods. I know my money depreciates with time, but at a constant and low rate - so the dollar is useful as a currency. If BTC is so wild, then why would anyone want to use it as money? And if it isn't effective as money, what is its value?",2017-11-30 10:22:48
dqjps5b,awoeoc,342,"&gt; That's only a ~2 Trillion Market Cap

Right now for $100k I can change bitcoin's market cap by over $100 million dollars (although briefly).

Market cap is useless as a number for bitcoin when trying to compare it to its impact on the larger economy. The market cap right now is over $100billion and I can assure you no where near that amount of money has gone into bitcoin. And **that** should worry everyone.

Think about it, where did that ""wealth"" come from? What former billionaire is now flat broke since everyone who invested in bitcoin took his money? When bcash split off, who put in $23billion into it? Why is it ""worth"" $23billion?

Everyone seems to hate fractional reserve banking, but not realizing that bitcoin as of right now is almost the same thing. We're all pooling our ""wealth"" into bitcoin and as long as only some of us takes it out at a time it works. But if we all took it out at once? It'd collapse the system completely.

The only way Bitcoin survives in the long run is if people can use bitcoin directly for goods and services. Right now that just isn't true as very few people accept bitcoin as payment. (Processors that just take bitcoin and deliver fiat to businesses don't count).

Until it's a usable currency in a real sense Bitcoin's value depends on people not actually claiming their ""wealth tickets"". ",2017-11-30 15:22:43

dqj3m2l,gertjaap,238,"Thanks for outlining your doubts so clearly and expressing them in such a clear cut fashion. I try to respond to them from my best knowledge, and feel free to come back with follow up questions if you feel the need to.

&gt; Proof of Work: Large energy consumption, which is not only bad for the environment and increased electricity costs in the long term, but also inherent problems that come with PoW. Such as...

This is a debate that is fully igniting now that people post articles about ""Bitcoin mining using more energy than 159 countries"" and such alike. What people forget to mention, is that it would also mean that it takes a similar amount of energy to break the system (perform a 51% attack on the network). A network being secured by hardware taking such amounts of energy can be seen as a value. The source of the energy would be more important. If you would do all this with clean energy, i don't see the harm. Plus, imagine the amount of energy in use by banks all over the world, including their personell driving in and out of work every day just to perform the same function that Bitcoin and its derivated altcoins have been doing without any need for a central authority for their existence.

&gt; Scaling: Due to PoW, as Vertcoin (and LTC) and other PoW coins become increasingly more popular, they will face the same problems as Bitcoin with scaling, high transaction fees, and of course long transaction times.

There's a big difference between Bitcoin and altcoins like Vertcoin. First, we already have 4 times the capacity of Bitcoin since we produce blocks four times quicker. Second, the scaling solution is being worked on (Lightning Network) and will most likely be ready before we run into the scaling issues that Bitcoin currently has. By running into these limits while the solution was being frustrated by the miners in the whole Segwit debacle, the scaling solution was too late for a smooth transition in Bitcoin - and is now overdue on a clogged up network. That's why people have been taking weird swings at alternate solutions like making bigger blocks (BCash), which is a poor solution that will face the same problems, just postponed by a few years at best.

&gt; Competition: To think that Vertcoin doesn't have many real competitors is incredibly naive

It is. I don't think we're free of competition. We would have a much higher investors interest and market capitalization if that would be the case (and if more than a handful of people would believe that). We need some serious work in having a more stable ecosystem, ability to pay both on- and offline, have a frictionless wallet experience including the Atomic Swap and Lightning Network capabilities. We need to invest in original work, and keep to our word about seeing the true value of decentralization and trying to uphold that as the core of our currency and network. I think that would allow us to gain a position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that will eventually emerge. But you have to see it in a multi-year horizon, and we're just getting started in terms of adoption. That goes for all cryptocurrencies.

&gt; Quantum Computing is a danger to all cryptocurrencies in existence

This is a true fact for all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. It stands to reason that a solution to this problem will be found by the cryptocurrency community or we'll be dead in the water. It makes absolutely no sense to me to invest Vertcoin (or any altcoin's) engineering capacity in solving a non-existent problem. But rest assured that any problem that threats the very future of any project is something that will not be ignored. 

&gt; Proof of Stake

While i'm not an expert on this subject, i do think that there's reasons for both systems to co-exist. Proof of Stake coins have essentially an uncapped supply and are by nature inflationary (because,you need to pay the stakers from currency being brought into circulation). This makes it essentially an inflationary currency whereas Vertcoin and Bitcoin are deflationary. There's ups and downs to both. The energy argument from your first point might be used as a marketing instrument to support the proof-of-stake case. But nevertheless, there's a reason for Proof of Stake not being implemented yet, despite it being planned for somewhere about now. There's still problems to iron out, and there's no high-volume cryptocurrency that has a long-standing track record with Proof-of-Stake afaik. There might be a reason for all the top coins to be Proof-of-Work, because it's proven tech that withstood the test of time.

dqjprpl,AnotherMasterMind,232,"The value of bitcoin is dependent on it's relative dominance over other crypto-currencies.  So you're right in a shallow sense, that many people obviously believe others will trade it and increase the value, but the deeper truth is that blockchain decentralized programs have huge potential and people want to use them somehow, and the more credible version happens to be bitcoin.  Crypto-currencies more broadly have value in that the technology in innovative and useful, and the nature of their relationship to the users is unique in that it is a hybrid of the anonymity of cash and the ease of credit cards.   These currencies will become more and more popular over time, as the applications built for them become easier to use.  The fluctuation of value is huge, but normal for any ""currency"" as young as this with no banking support.  Most of the issues you bring up are attributable to its age and the lack of understanding surrounding its nature.  Ther is no single reason bicoin has value, the explanation, much like the coin, is decentralized.  There's a cheap sense in which you could say any investment is made because people think the demand for it will continue, the deeper reason for bitcoin's success are not specific to it, but more for it's elevated legitimacy in an exciting young field that may become a worldwide essential feature of the 21st century's economy.",2017-11-30 15:22:22

dqjbuju,Mirrory,175,"&gt; As someone with limited technical knowledge of ETH.

As high level and as layman like as I can make it: 

You are buying ""work units"" in a **massive** super computer and cloud network spanning the entire globe. ETH, although it can be exchanged for currency or used as currency, is actually used to incentivize nodes on the Etherum network to process information and data for you. This is called gas, paid in fractions of an ETH 'coin' (like 0.00000010 ETH). This is unlike with bitcoin, which is intended to be used purely for financial transactions. Ethereum can do that too, but it can also say, run javascript-like code on a webpage - or host static content like image files. Now instead of paying Amazon or Google Cloud Services hundreds of dollars per month in hosting a virtual machine (basically a server within a server), you can host entire websites for PENNIES per month. Storing or changing the data costs money, but it's a one time cost. Retrieving the data is free. This is where smart contracts come in. If you need to store ""memory"" on the blockchain, contracts do that. It only costs money to write in or change that data - or to *do something* with that data. Not to retrieve it. So say if you host an image on the Ethereum blockchain through the SWARM protocol, users can retrieve that data by pointing to it's hash. Really the website administrator would do this, and you'd have no idea. You'd load images from the Ethereum network in your browser without realizing it. 

Now say if your code used memory, like having a number field in the web page and then displaying double that number, you would have to send data to that **smart contract** and it would *store the data in memory*, then *do work with it* and finally *output the result*. The parts that cost gas are the storing and doing. Now say if the user wants to recall the calculation they made a minute ago. They can do this without needing to resubmit to the contract, all history is stored within the blockchain. That previous transaction will be recorded there forever. So as more things are done on the blockchain, the more efficient computing becomes. You only have to calculate or *do the thing* **once**. And *never have to waste precious CPU time again*. You can simply recall that previous transaction.

dqjrsbb,A_Soporific,156,"Some stocks are anomalies. The textbook (literally, it's in textbooks) example is the curious case of Royal Dutch and Shell. I bet you know what Shell is, they have gas stations globally. They're a major player in gas. It's no wonder that Shell's stock price has consistently been higher than that of Royal Dutch...

Except Royal Dutch created Shell in 1907. They've always owned a 60% stake in Shell. So, whenever a dividend was paid out a share of Shell only paid out 2/3 what the share of Royal Dutch got. They were both listed on the same stock exchange, too. The 'rational' expectation is that the Shell stock should be about 2/3 the price of the Royal Dutch stock.

That never happened. The Royal Dutch reabsorbed Shell in 2004, with a market capitalization of much less than its subsidiary.

Stock prices are a bad measure of anything. Tesla (like Shell) gets and irrational boost to its stock price because they are recognized in the news and there's a lot of information about it. People don't like to invest in companies they've never heard of. People don't like to invest in companies they can't get information about.

People shouldn't buy Tesla stock. It's a bad idea and will crash sooner or later when the news stops being promising. Pointing out that it takes time for the fact that these things can take a decade or more to finally come apart at the seems isn't an argument in favor of putting money into a system that fails to achieve its stated aims.

Bitcoin is a horrible currency. Currencies have three jobs: 1) Being a Means of Exchange, 2) Storing Value, and 3) Being a unit of account. Bitcoin doesn't do any one of them better than other currencies.

The Unit of Account concept is simple. If you have to look up how many bitcoins are required to buy a pizza or convert it in your head to dollars then it's not a unit of account. In fact, the value of a bitcoin is never talked about in relation to goods and services, it's always in terms of dollars or another currency. The US is the Unit of Account in this sense, so Bitcoin hasn't yet developed this use.

The next use is as a Store of Value. This is the one that a lot of people hang their hats on, because the technology itself puts a cap on how many bitcoins can exist and therefore inflation is difficult to accomplish... only that's not really right. In order for something to be a useful Store of Value then the price of it has to be at least a little predictable. You know so that I can pay you today for a hamburger on Tuesday. Business depends upon paying when you have money to get what you need when you need it (usually when you don't have money). If the value of the currency varies wildly over a short period of time then these deals fall apart as one person or the other is invariably screwed by overpaying or underpaying as the value of the unit of exchange is about as constant as a drunk stumbling home from the bar. On November 7th a Bitcoin was worth something like $6,973 on the 12th it was worth $5,845 and on the 17th it was worth $7,843. Good luck trying to figure out the future value of the currency or trying to figure out how much you can spend now and still cover groceries next week.

People aren't buying Bitcoin to *store* value, they're buying to *speculate*. Think about it, if you sold bitcoin on the 7th, bought that same bitcoin back on the 12th and then sold it again on the 17th then you would have made money. *THAT* action is a major driving force in the value of the currency, and that is also a problem.

That brings us to the final function of a currency and the one that the Bitcoin has made the most headway, as a medium of exchange. Bitcoins are used to buy and sell goods. It is often used as an alternative method of converting currencies to the big banks that tend to charge fees to change currencies. It's also used in a variety of transactions that require some degree of secrecy. These are good uses.

So, one of the reasons why Bitcoin is a problem is because there are two uses. The first are the standard currency uses that will keep Bitcoin going as long as it is useful for those purposes. The second is the speculative bubble, people who buy a coin for the purpose of selling it at a later date to make a profit (as opposed to a purchase). It's really hard to separate the two because often the people who make the trades themselves don't know.

But, as a general rule, look for a crash whenever the value of the Bitcoin rises rapidly without a corresponding increase in adoption of velocity of transaction. Just know that some crashes (like Shell's) can be delayed for years or decades by consistent decent press.",2017-11-30 16:28:40
