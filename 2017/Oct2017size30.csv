dnr6fpg,BlacknOrangeZ,58,"&gt;segwit plus no block size increase seems like the absolute worst option

Most people here will agree.

It's important to understand it from the perspective of small-blockers, though. To them, you're looking at this the completely wrong way. Their number one priority is limiting the resources necessary to independently verify, validate, propagate, store and otherwise participate directly with the blockchain. They strive to cram as many transactions into as few bytes as possible. The idea of simply increasing the blocksize is irresponsibly simplistic as it increases the resources required for people to run their own node: bandwidth, bandwidth cap, processing power, storage capacity, etc. They rack their brains thinking of imaginative ways to squeeze more transactions into the same/less space, resulting in controversial changes like Segwit and the even more controversial plans to process transactions *off* the blockchain itself!

That is the first fundamental disagreement between the two 'sides': How important is it to maintain the ability to run a full node with very limited resources? 

The second regards the diminishing mining reward: How best to maintain long-term incentives for miners to continue mining transactions and contributing to the security of the economy, as rewards decrease and eventually disappear? With respect to this, small-blockers consider themselves something of benevolent central planners. They consider the imposition of an artificial cap - the blocksize limit - essential to restrict supply such that, ideally, it maintains an awkward equilibrium (the 'fee market') whereby transaction fees are high enough to adequately compensate miners for their contribution and to discourage people from creating too many transactions, while being just barely low enough that people continue to want to use Bitcoin at all. I've abandoned any attempt to be unbiased in this paragraph because I consider that concept to be absurd. The 1MB limit is completely arbitrary, and no person or small committee no matter how good their intentions can ever know exactly what this limit should be, at least not better than the free market is able to determine. And this very idea is so fundamentally incompatible with the philosophy of Bitcoin that I refuse to consider it even if their logic were sound, which it's not; this authoritarian central planning has absolutely no place in Bitcoin. 

You're probably aware of the views of big-blockers and I've written enough here so just quickly: They consider the ability to make cheap and fast transactions more important than running a full node (no point having a full node if you can't afford to use it); consider that technological advances more than account for the increased requirements of a blocksize increase (if it ever gets to the point where this isn't true, certainly more imaginative solutions can and should be explored, but we're not there yet); and the principles of free market capitalism are sufficient to incentivise all players in the Bitcoin economy to adapt and participate in the most efficient and beneficial way possible (Bitcoin's success thus far is evidence), while efforts by central planning authoritarians only undermine this.

dnqzf01,edoera,58,"I don't think something like ""X prize"" would work. If someone built something so significant for Ethereum, I think that someone deserves much much more than some ""X prize"". Of course this is my subjective opinion, but my point is that Ethereum is risky because a lot of people who may potentially add value to the protocol will think the same way.

Actually this is one thing I've been really thinking a lot about and still have no answer to. Let's say I built something on top of Ethereum that improves Ethereum by ten-fold. Why would I build it as some small module on top of Ethereum and let all the Ethereum early adopters and founders make all the money, when I can fork it and build my own blockchain?

Why would people contribute to a project that will make most money to the founders when I'm putting in a lot of work? This feels like the ""struggle of the classes"" right out of Marx's theory.

The more I think about this the more I think Bitcoin worked only because nobody knew it would work when they were working on it, for almost a decade. And then boom, people realized it works on a scale. People were more motivated to make it work than trying to extract value, because nobody knew what they were working on will eventually have as much value as they have nowadays. They worked on the protocol purely out of passion, and it made more sense to centralize the effort since not enough people were working on it due to the fact that most people didn't think it would succeed.

Now that we DO know the model works on a good enough scale, people are more motivated to build their own blockchains because they hear things like ""Fat protocol"" which is supposed to capture most of the value of the entire network. When you hear things like that, as an entrepreneur I don't feel like becoming the fool who creates all the value and let the ""Fat protocol"" capture all the value i created. I'll be honest. That ""fat protocol"" blog post was the first article where I learned about the power of blockchain and it did more harm than good for me to seriously dig into it because at first it didn't make sense for me. I already can build a lot of cool things that create tons of value which I can control. Why would I build something on top of someone else's platform where ""most of the values are captured on the lowest level"" which means it wouldn't be me who's capturing the value I add.

To be clear, I am working on a couple of solidity contracts I plan on deploying to Ethereum, but I'm just ranting because I always can't get rid of this feeling that if I ever build something valuable enough, I'm doing more good for the Ethereum founders and early adopters than myself. Call me selfish, but I think this is why we see organizations like Raiden issuing their own tokens. It sucks but I can sympathize with them.

I actually really want to be wrong about this assessment and hope there's a way to make the current model work and everyone can just build on top of the existing blockchain instead of re-inventing the wheel, but I just don't feel good about being the Proletariat who does all the work for the Bourgeoisie.

Note that this is not just a rant, but I feel like my ""subjective opinion"" is shared by a lot of developers in the community who WANT to provide value to the Ethereum protocol, and this phenomenon is the problem I'm trying to point out.

dns52nh,Erumara,96,"The more important question is how does transaction kiting work, as this is the major reason *not* to accept zero-conf.

Transaction kiting involves broadcasting a transaction to someone (a merchant), recieving your goods, and then immediately broadcasting a new transaction containing *the same inputs* back into your own wallet. If successful only the second transaction will confirm, excluding the first one from the mempool and allowing the fraudster to walk away with both the goods and the funds in his possession.

In reality the actual circumstances required to successfully kite in this way are **extremely rare** as any web merchant or other web business has no reason to be authorizing your purchase in under 10 minutes. Likewise with many service industries if someone has to pay up front, they have no opportunity to leave without a confirmed transaction.

It is up to individual businesses to ascertain their own risk tolerance. When compared to something like chargeback fraud, which can be done weeks after the purchase, zero-conf is much safer and more reliable than credit cards as the opportunity to kite a transaction is tied to how quickly the original transaction gets confirmed.

Bitcoin Core's policy of full blocks makes transaction kiting much easier, as confirmations are completely unreliable taking from 5 minutes into days, they then doubled down on making zero-conf unreliable by including ""replace by fee"" in the Core wallet software: prior to this fraudsters typically needed special wallet software set up to do this more easily. 

Bitcoin Cash intends to make zero-conf as safe and reliable as it used to be before the backlogs.
When transactions are virtually guanteed to be included in the next block it makes in nearly impossible for the fraud to occur. As far as I'm concerned zero-conf on Bitcoin Cash is safer than credit cards already, and the improved EDA will make it even safer. There is already talk of fraud-proofs or first-in first-confirmed systems which will make transaction kiting nearly impossible.",2017-10-02 10:03:30

&gt;95% miner support required for consensus

We currently see *less* than 95% support for S2X/NYA and if F2Pool does indeed stop signaling (as Wang Chun has indicated they intend to) this will likely drop to ~80% or so. Does this mean that consensus for the NYA no longer exists? If not, what if (hypothetically speaking) the miner support dropped even further... to below 50%? Would you still argue that ""miner consensus for the NYA exists because at one point in the past the signaling was 95%+"" even though thay signaling figure is now outdated?

&gt;Status Quo: A State of Atrophy Nobody Wants

I think the status quo now (with SegWit activated on Bitcoin and Bcash available for anyone who wants 8MB blocks instead) is not really ""a state of atrophy nobody wants"" and it seems to be somewhat disingenuous to pretend that it is such. Would you mind explaining how the *current* situation in Bitcoin (the status quo *now*) qualifies as such a state? 

&gt;Further, the unfortunate context in which this is occurring is one of diminishing utility on the platform: transactions are getting more expensive and less reliable. The user experience of sending a Bitcoin transaction today is worse than it was two years ago. While the price has risen, fundamental utility has actually declined. This is unsustainable, and will be inevitably resolved by utility once again rising, or price declining to meet it.


Ever since SegWit activated and Bcash splintered off, transaction confirmations and average fee rates have been improving dramatically from users' perspectives. The trend appears to have successfully reversed.


&gt;If measurements matter, Bitcoin is at an all time lowin market dominance relative to altcoins. 

This is a very gameable metric, unfortunately. I can launch an ERC-20 token in a few minutes with an arbitrarily large token supply, sell one for $1 to my daughter, and *technically* subsume 99.999% of the Total Crypto Market Cap single-handedly and overnight.

Granted, this would be taking it very much *to the extreme* and would not maximize my chances to profit off of this token, but the principle is important to understand (and it is important to understand that creators of altcoins and crypto-tokens continually take advantage of this effect in subtle and not-so-subtle ways).

In other words, the ""If measurements matter"" in this section is quite suspect, because the specific measurements you are citing are significantly gameable and there are meaningful incentives to do exactly that.


&gt;There is clearly a problem, and we need to fix it.  A number of technical solutions have been proposed, but fundamentally while they may fix ills on the technical level, they ignore, dismiss, or worsen ills on the social level. They thus cannot be considered solutions… especially if they aren’t happening.

SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Solutions have *happened*.


&gt;This current impasse is similarly both technical and social, and it continues at great cost.

SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. There is no impasse any more.


&gt;And while this is endured, the gears of Bitcoin’s true enemies turn slowly, yet they do turn. Bitcoin cannot afford to sit idle in this morass. 

SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Bitcoin is not ""sitting idle"" in any sense.

&gt;A truth many are not appreciating is that stagnation and replacement are as much threats to Bitcoin’s security model as are software glitches and coordinated attackers. Bitcoin has no monopoly on its core virtues: that of storing value without interference, and that of moving value across distance. That it is the best for these today is irrefutable, that it is the best for these tomorrow is assumption.

One of the *most important* core virtues of Bitcoin is that the consensus rules of the protocol are not subject to arbitrary changes by powerful entities. If they were, things like the 21-million-coin-cap would be much less ""set in stone"" and many of the underlying fundamental assumptions that go into Bitcoin would be invalidated. The consensus protocol is deliberately structured to be *very hard* to modify. This is a strength of Bitcoin's, and perhaps even its most important one.


&gt;This assumption cannot be made by prudent caretakers.

I believe that this is a powerful sentence and statement, but I think it applies much better to the assumption that S2X will be accepted *as* Bitcoin by the market at large. This particular assumption seems to be the *only* offered rationale behind the omission of strong replay protection in the S2X codebase, which is the largest source of technical controversy around the initiative. 

I think you are right: prudent caretakers *cannot* make massive assumptions and then plow forward as if these assumptions are inviolate truths. Strong replay protection should therefore be included in *any* hard fork proposal that doesn't have near-100% support from *all stakeholders* in the community (developers and individual users included). 

I have yet to hear an argument to the contrary, other than ""Just assume S2X wins."" Is this not a huge cause for concern?



&gt;As the contentious split in the community (Bitcoin’s social layer) grows, the risk of a contentious split in its blockchain (Bitcoin’s technical layer) grows too. Ignoring or dismissing the former invites the latter.

A contentious split in the blockchain already occurred with Bcash. Nothing can be done about that now.

&gt;Indeed, we have seen each successive social rebellion (XT, then Classic, then BU) get closer to technical rebellion: a contentious hard fork.


A contentious hard fork already occurred with Bcash. You were correct, and now such a technical rebellion has occurred.


&gt;All technical efforts are diminished if they exist in a vacuum from the social, and dismissing the social interests of others as “merely political” is itself a political impulse.

Yes, so if there is a large *social* pushback against S2X (which it would be very difficult to deny that there is), then shouldn't that factor in to whether or not you continue to support it?


&gt;Finding Unity

&gt;At the risk of oversimplification, there are two sides debating two paths. The one side desires the SegWit path. The other desires the hard fork path. 

Yes, and now that SegWit is active on Bitcoin and Bcash has split off via a hard fork, both paths are available and both sides can take the path they favor.


&gt;It must be said that any plan, by either side, that discounts the desires and opinions of the other, is destined to, at best, split the community. At worst, the project itself is jeopardized in the increasingly threat of contentious hard fork… and blaming the other side for this threat only increases it. 

**Yes, wholly agreed.**

S2X *is* the threat of a contentious hard fork now. Please do not discount the opinions of the users who do not support this hard fork, because like you say: by doing so, you only serve to increase the threat and the damage that it could do to the community.

&gt;To solve this, we should take it upon ourselves to find unity, not only among those with whom perfect agreement exists, but among those with whom any common ground can be attained at all. Bitcoiners have very much common ground, though they have forgotten it.

Yes, we should work on finding unity. S2X (and the supporters thereof) doesn't seem interested in doing so. We should work on finding common ground, and this should *necessarily* include common ground with the developers who have been steadily (and voluntarily) improving Bitcoin for the past 5 years.

&gt;Sergio Lerner’s proposal is not unique in its technical suggestions, but it is unique in its potential to unify. It has the potential to unify not only disparate technical beliefs, but the social fabric of this community, which is as important. 

How does a contentious (and by your own admission technically unnecessary) 2MB hard fork on a network with SegWit already active, *especially in a context where an alternative 8MB chain already exists*, have any ""potential to unify""?

I think that if you take a step back and honestly assess the situation *as it stands now*, the only valid conclusion that you could possibly reach is that the 2MB fork *only* has the potential to split the community even worse than it currently is. It is clear that many people oppose the fork, but support SegWit (and others oppose SegWit, but like the 8MB fork idea and already support Bcash as a result), so combining ""the worst of both worlds"" stands no real chance of facilitating unity.

dnrlih6,thieflar,73,"
&gt;If SegWit2MB can reach 95% support, it cannot be said to be contentious. 

If you restrict your definition of ""support"" to only include ""miner support"" then perhaps (though it still might be arguable, to be frank). But, if you would allow me another hypothetical: if all the miners hypothetically reached 95% support to redistribute the first million bitcoins amongst themselves, and non-mining users unanimously rejected this plan, could you really say that it ""cannot be considered contentious""? 

Returning from the realm of the hypothetical to that of reality: if *no* current Bitcoin developers support a given fork, can you honestly claim that it ""cannot be considered contentious""? 

Do you believe that non-mining users and stakeholders should have *absolutely no say* in the future of Bitcoin? 


&gt;It would also countdown to a conservative block limit increase, which alleviates further scaling pains and, importantly, will invite the rebellious factions to support it. Such a proposal would, I believe, take the very wind from the sails of subversion.


SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. Finally, neither userbase seems to consider S2X an improvement over the coin of their choice. I don't believe that your argument here can reasonably be considered to still hold, in light of these facts.

&gt;By enabling social unification, SegWit2MB has a greater chance of actual activation, and importantly, of preventing further schism and infighting. The risk implicit in this proposal’s hard fork must be said to be necessarily lower than today’s present danger of a contentious hard fork. 

SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. S2X is really the *only* catalyst for further schism and infighting that remains. 

The risk implicit in this proposal’s hard fork must be said to be necessarily *equal to* the danger of *another* contentious hard fork. 

&gt;The proposal grants to each side that which it desires most, and grants to both a path forward.

Again, SegWit has activated. Bcash has launched. S2X does not deliver to *either* side ""what it desires most"" and both sides already *have* paths forward.


&gt;We should not let this project linger in its current state. SegWit2MB is the first reasonable compromise, considering the impasse’s technical and social aspects, actually put forth in code, based on well-known and studied fundamental components from Bitcoin’s best engineers. 


SegWit has activated successfully. Bitcoin's best engineers almost unanimously oppose S2X. If you want to invoke their legacy, name, and work, it must necessarily be *in opposition* to the NYA.


&gt;It is a good path forward, and one I hope others will rally around: to activate SegWit, to avoid a contentious hard fork, to enable greater transaction capacity, and to bring Bitcoiners back from their trenches to the great hall we share.


SegWit is active. A contentious hard fork has already occurred. Greater transaction capacity has already been achieved for both sides. S2X can *only* serve to divide further, it fundamentally *cannot* unite the community given today's context.


I have gone through and thoroughly explained why the reasoning in this blog post (which may once have been valid) is no longer relevant nor valid. In fact, almost every argument you made in the article can now be said to apply equally well *in opposition to S2X*. 

I understand that you have another argument in favor of supporting S2X, which ultimately represents ""keeping your word"" and I do not want to argue that for now. I am simply trying to address the reasoning *in this article*, because I have seen you link to it many times as a form of ""defense"" of S2X but I believe that in all honesty, it no longer can reasonably be termed as such.

I believe that you are an honest and sincere man, and I hope very much that you acknowledge and reflect on what I have said here. If you assess this situation maturely and honorably, I believe that you will reach the same conclusions that I have laid out above (and if not, I would be very interested to hear your exact reasoning). 

Please take the time to address this response adequately and civilly, and please do your best to acknowledge it in full.

Then BCH did it, because they wanted to avoid SegWit.  This satisfied the big block hard-liners who are now focused on BCH.  

The moderates (both SegWit leaning and hard fork leaning) said 'SegWit looks okay, but it will take time to create a real enlarging effect, and we'll have to increase the block size anyway eventually, so let's do a compromise- we do SegWit AND we hard fork, so we can get the benefit of both at once.'  The idea is neither side considers SegWit or a hard fork to be seriously damaging to BTC, rather, they don't trust the 'other' to be the ONLY scaling plan.  So they compromise and agree to trust each other- do both a small block size increase and SegWit, neither of which would cause serious harm, and work together to make both a success.  Because SegWit was ready then and blocks were full, the idea was to implement SegWit first and then take a bit of time to put the finishing touches on the 2X hard fork part.  

The small block hard-liners are now against 2x and want SegWit only.  They believe that a hard fork which doesn't go through Core's BIP approval process is invalid and should not be allowed to happen.  

------

Now we have the question of SegWit2x vs no 2x.  Both sides claim to have the majority on their side.  
Truly measuring how many people want what is extremely difficult.  The vast majority of Bitcoin users don't use Reddit or the dev mailing lists or GitHub.  Satoshi had not intended for mining to centralize to a small handful of Chinese people like it has, he'd wanted mining to be far more distributed so per Nakamoto Consensus, the chain with the most work wins.  Unfortunately the CPU-&gt;GPU-&gt;FPGA-&gt;ASIC arms race killed that and now most mining is done by 10 or so Chinese guys, so one could debate how much mining represents the overall community.  

SegWit2x does have a lot of signatory companies, among them they represent 90+% of hash power and a large majority of the Bitcoin financial ecosystem.  Whether they are doing so representing the interests of their users or themselves is open to debate.  

-------

**For my personal opinion-** I think SegWit2x was a great compromise and that sort of thing should be encouraged- two sides coming together to mutually benefit Bitcoin.  I also think nobody 'owns' Bitcoin or can claim exclusive rights to modifying it, the hash power is what keeps us secure not any one group of developers.  I think we're going to have to raise the block size pretty soon anyway, so unless some serious problem with 2x's plan is revealed I see no reason not to do it now (especially as Lightning won't be ready for months).  And speaking of Lightning- I think if it works as well as promised people will use it because they WANT to, I don't think we should be forced to use it because blocks are full.  

I've also yet to see a good reason why it's so important to avoid 2x.  I see people calling it an attack, saying it will damage things, but I have yet to see any actual explanation of what damage it will cause or why it will be harmful.  

And as for replay protection- if it activates with 90% of the hash power, there's no need because there won't be a viable Bitcoin1x anymore.  At 10% of the hash power that'll be 1x 1MB block every 100 minutes for the 1x chain, until the next difficulty adjustment (which at that rate will likely be months away).  In short- stick a fork in it, it's done.  And I think that would be the best path for everybody- if this ends up being an 'upgrade' rather than a 'fork' (so there's only one viable chain after the hard fork, rather than two).

-------

That's just my 2c though.  As always my mind remains open and I'm interested to hear other points of view or anything that would challenge my positions.  ",2017-10-02 18:15:23
dnrgyjq,evoorhees,67,"1) To be accurate, BnkToTheFuture members are not investors in ShapeShift. They are investors in a BnkToTheFuture fund (which, in turn, is an investor in ShapeShift). 

2) If any investors in ShapeShift, or in the BnkToTheFuture fund, would like to sell their shares, I will personally pay 2x what they invested, no questions asked. Pls contact me directly if so.

3) SegWit2x isn't ""rammed down anyone's throat."" It is open source software. People can run it, or not. If anyone would like to know why I support it, I posted thoughts back in April which hold true today: http://moneyandstate.com/thoughts-on-segwit2mb/


EDIT: Responding to questions in the OP

&gt; I urge to reconsider your decision and to publicly announce your withdrawal of support for this highly contentious fork for the following reasons:
1) It is not required at this point in time. With the activation of Segwit and upcoming Layer II solutions together with scaling optimizations over the next couple of years there is no need for a blocksize increase at this time. Far more critica for Bitcoin is to stay more decentralized, censorship resistant and lean in order to survive the ever increasing attacks and restrictions placed upon it by governments. An unneeded blocksize increase at this time threatens Bitcoin's ability to survive these challenges.

SegWit2x was organized to do two things: Activate SegWit, and activate a 2MB base block HF. SegWit was activated by the miners; they upheld their side of the deal. Now, it is up to us, the businesses and other signers of NYA, to support the planned HF to 2MB blocks in November. It was a package deal that many of us agreed to. Personally, I would not renege on a deal halfway through.  You say it's ""not needed."" Well, you're welcome to believe that, but in my opinion SegWit2x was needed to break the standoff. 


&gt;2) The lack of proper Replay Protection will cause chaos in the Bitcoin ecosystem. People will lose funds and confusion will reign with the possibility of permanently damaging the credibility of Bitcoin.

I understand this is very controversial. I can sympathize with arguments on all sides of it, frankly. Adding reply protection, however, helps the minority chain survive, and that itself may increase the ""chaos in the Bitcoin ecosystem.""  If 95% of miners follow through with the SegWit2x upgrade, and the largest wallets (CoinBase, Xapo, Blockchain, BitGo) do the same, then what will likely happen is simply Bitcoin will have 2MB blocks. Anyone who wants to break with that consensus and stick with the minority 1x chain, is free to do so, but the SegWit2x devs are not going to assist them in helping a minority chain. 

&gt;3) Outside of the mining community, there is not substantial community consensus on proceeding with the hard fork.

This is debatable. The major wallets all support SegWit2x. Users are hard to know... I think the honest answer is that nobody really knows what ""the community wants"" until the fork happens and the market is allowed to act. SegWit2x might fail in the market, or it might succeed. Whichever chain becomes the clear winner, I will call it Bitcoin, even if it's not the chain I would've preferred. 

&gt;4) The thinly veiled goal of the hard fork has little to do with an actual blocksize increase, but rather an attempt to replace the Bitcoin Core group of developers. There is no other group that has the critical mass and technical skills to lead Bitcoin development.

As a supporter of SegWit2x, my goal is not at all to replace any developers. My goal is to get miners to activate SegWit, which was successful, and then to activate a 2MB hardfork, such that Bitcoin will have twice the capacity for transactions while layer 2 solutions continue to be built. And indeed, the Core devs can't be ""replaced.""  They can choose to leave, or they can choose to merge the 2MB code and follow majority consensus. That's up to them as individuals.


&gt;5) The rationale of the New York Agreement, of which you may be a signatory, was to avoid multiple forks, but it has in fact already been broken by miner signatories who created and supported the Bitcoin Cash hard fork of this past August.

The rationale was in part to avoid forks, yes, but was primarily an attempt to a) activate SegWit and b) upgrade to a 2MB blocksize for additional on chain capacity. ~94% of miners continue to signal for it, so unless that changes, the agreement stands. It does suck that ViaBTC broke its agreement, and went ahead to create BCH. I think they betrayed the agreement, clearly, but they are a minority.

&gt;There is far too much at stake here to allow politics to determine the future of Bitcoin. I urge you to withdraw your support for this un-needed and technically dangerous hard fork of Bitcoin.

I don't withdraw from agreements that I make. And people - users, businesses, miners, devs, and markets will always determine the future of Bitcoin. My hope, and indeed I could be wrong, is that the HF happens, has overwhelming miner, business, and market support, and people can get back to work building Bitcoin, now having the benefits of a 2MB block, and SegWit, with which Bitcoin will be superior to the Bitcoin that existed prior to the NYA.

I do think it's important to distinguish between authoritarian government intervention and civil cases which would be perfectly reasonable in a free society where the government currently performs the role as arbiter. 

For example, it's wrong to leverage government force to prevent anyone exercising their right to hard fork and run whatever software they prefer. 

I do not agree, however, that using Bitcoin in any sense means you forfeit all rights not to be defrauded. I saw someone else suggest that if an exchange spontaneously decides to keep all your assets held with them then you're shit out of luck, which is wrong, and they ought to be sued to recover that property. Just as if I buy a bike with Bitcoin but the seller takes my satoshis and rides away while giving me the finger then he has committed a wrong against me and I'm right to seek compensation. 

What this boils down to then, as I see it, is the particular exchange's policy regarding hard forks. This ought to be a prominent part of the user agreement, and it may even be that they have no set action to take. Maybe their policy is to always follow the chain with the most work, or to always stick to the current chain, etc. Their policy may even be something along the lines of publicly announcing and emailing all users x days in advance of their intent to 'switch' chain, so that users have time to withdraw if they choose. Whatever the policy, users should be aware and in agreement, and then it removes all confusion in times like this. Absolutely, if the exchange then does anything that contradicts this policy, users are entitled to and should sue for damages. ",2017-10-02 02:43:15

I'm sure people are getting impatient.  Let me just share something with you.

I first got into crypto in the Spring of 2014, buying Bitcoin around $600 per.  Yes, I watched it fall over the next year to $200-250.  

Later in 2014, i started accumulating XMR at around $1.50 per.  Over the next year, I accumulated all the way down to where I was paying about $0.40 per XMR.  

In May of 2016, I'd been in crypto for 2 full years.  I was doing very well in the regular stock market over that period, using levered ETF's of qqq and seeing gains well in excess of 20% annually.  Some of my early crypto buys were underwater, so I sold off a substantial majority (80 ish%) of my crypto assets in order to take a capital loss so I could pay less in taxes on my profitable ETF's.

Crypto had gone DOWN my first year, then over the next year basically returned to the point where I was in profit overall (mostly because I bought more throughout a terrible 2015), but I had plenty of non-profitable positions to sell.  

I sold about 10 BTC  for $535 each, and 4126 XMR for $1.50 each.  This was in May of 2016.  Keep in mind, this was after TWO YEARS of a relatively flat market.  That put about $12,000 of cash in my pocket. 

If I had hodled, those assets would be worth about $410,000 right now.  After two YEARS of sideways, virtually all of that growth from $12,000 to $410,000 happened in about 9 months.  

Fortunately, I bought my first ETH in August of that year.  I bought a whopping 20 ETH, but at least I only paid about $12 per ETH.  I don't have anywhere near $410,000 in crypto right now.

This formation is interesting.

We broke out the other day with a price peak at $4,470.  Its reversed today and so far this morning its fallen to $4,225.

This movement simply extended the “old” formation to four columns.  In this past several swings, the movements have been textbook—moving higher, and going down the full length of the column, stopping just above the previous low.  Normally when a new formation is started, it is pretty rare for the price to reverse into the previous formation.  

Looking at other charts people have been saying we are having lower highs and lower lows.  Based on the recent swings in this charting method you can see higher highs and higher lows—moving almost completely up and down the chart.

Based on this activity we could revisit the $4,100-$4,000 range—and still say safely above the breakdown range of $4,000.  This would be a trader’s paradise.

We are currently 4 columns wide—with this positive trend now reaching 87 Columns in width.  So, the trend tells us to remain optimistic.

Here are the numbers:

We reverse with a price moving back above $4,350.  We break out at $4,500 and break down under $4,000.  

My guess is that we should not go lower than $4,100.  The price has already reversed down 50% from the recent highs, which barely missed going into a long pole warning.  I would expect it to act similarly.

So, today we dither.  I think we dither for the net few days—unless we get some wacky news from somewhere.  Once Goldman Sachs gets their teeth into Bitcoin, we can expect a nicely manipulated market just like gold and silver,.

dntdd75,nullc,54,"[parts of the text here are copied from the other dozen times Wright has tried this particular con]

The whole discussion is phenomenally dumb.  Satoshi has a [well known public key](https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054007/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/Satoshi_Nakamoto.asc).  The key craig presented is not that key and not signed by that key.

Anyone can create a PGP key with any name and date they want on it.  Craig's key key is not the right key: there is no relation the key from Craig and Satoshi beyond it having Satoshi's name written on it, which anyone could do.  This alone is dispositive, the discussion should have ended there.

Some people online (not me, in fact, in spite the claims in this article); noticed that not only was it not the right key-- it was a low quality forgery: the key's metadata is perfectly consistent with a key authored with current software, and entirely inconsistent with a key authored at the time it claimed to be authored.

The page repeats the prior claim that the key could have been edited when it was created, to override the settings and match a future key. It gives an example doing that with a few of the fields (but not all of them). This is a fact I *specifically* pointed out on reddit when commenting on the subject:   https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3w027x/dr_craig_steven_wright_alleged_satoshi_by_wired/cxsm1yo/?context=3  (""It's possible that the settings could have been locally overridden to coincidentally the same defaults as now."")

It is an absurd leap and it fails Occam's razor.

We're being asked to believe: That Satoshi generated two PGP public keys on the same day, one of which he used and published. The first (published) one created like normal, the other created overriding every default then further manually editing the key to adjust the setting to a highly complex string of values which, by some phenomenal chance, happen to exactly reflect the unmodified default settings that were established in GPG later.  This other key he kept secret and only revealed via Wrights ""leaked"" documents long after these new settings behave the default.

Or perhaps the 'other key' is just very low-quality contemporary forgery. ... after all, it's already definitively proven to be a forgery because the keys don't match!

All this wanking about metadata is irrelevant because it's simply not the correct key. That is the one and only definitive test and it fails it. All the rest of the discussion (that the metadata is all wrong, that the key was never in any public archive before wright put it out, etc.) is simply making fun of how technically inept the scammer is that he didn't even get any element of his forgery right...  I think it's amusing and fantastic that Wright continues to pay people to bolster his fraudulent claims.

Basically, Wright appears to be trying to exploit a cognitive bias. People have pointed out fact A: The key is obviously not satoshi's key, because the key fingerprints do not match and anyone can create a key with whatever name and date they want; and fact B: his metadata forgery is laughably bad.  Wright keeps paying people write pieces claiming that it would have been possible to create a key with that metadata if back at that time, a very unlikely sequence of events is followed (pointless manual key editing that just happened to guess the future values).  Then he expects that because he can show doubt that B alone isn't completely dispositive, which it was never claimed to be, that you should ignore the fact that A already proved the case.

dnt0ngs,mikeyvegas17,46,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is weighing a new trading operation dedicated to bitcoin and other digital currencies, the first blue-chip Wall Street firm preparing to deal directly in this burgeoning yet controversial market, according to people familiar with the matter.

Goldman’s effort is in its early stages and may not proceed, the people said. The firm’s interest, though, could boost bitcoin’s standing among investors and fuel the debate around digital currencies, which were initially viewed as havens for illicit activity but are pushing further into the mainstream investment world.

China in recent weeks has banned exchanges that trade bitcoin, fearing the virtual currency could provide an avenue for capital flight.  J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon, whose bank is the largest dealer in global currencies, last month called bitcoin a “fraud” and said he would fire any employee who traded it.

Yet Japan’s government has embraced bitcoin, creating regulations to legitimize its trading. India and Sweden have mused about creating their own virtual currencies, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has studied both bitcoin and the technology underpinning it.

“In response to client interest in digital currencies we are exploring how best to serve them in this space,” a Goldman spokeswoman said.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that runs on a decentralized network of computers, rather than a centralized ledger under the control of a central bank or government. Users can exchange value directly, without a middleman such as a bank.

Big banks, including J.P. Morgan and Goldman, have dabbled in the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain, and opined on its potential to reshape industries. But they have been wary of venturing directly into a market whose early enthusiasts included anarchists and drug dealers.

As digital coins proliferate and draw interest from professional investors, though, they become harder for Wall Street trading desks to ignore.

Bitcoin’s price has soared this year, from $969 to more than $5,000 last month before pulling back. Ethereum, a rival, traded as high as $400 after ending 2016 at $8. In all, nearly $150 billion worth of digital currencies are in circulation.

Goldman’s seeks to serve a growing cadre of institutional investors wagering on bitcoin. Its effort could eventually entail a team of traders and salespeople making markets in bitcoins much as they do Japanese yen or shares of Apple Inc.

Keeping abreast of the day-to-day cryptocurrency market could also position Goldman to capitalize on further development of this market. Digital-currency proponents envision a world where coins will be widely accepted by online retailers and companies will use the tokens for cross-border commerce.

Already, cryptocurrencies are infringing on some traditional banking activities. Some startup companies that historically might have hired banks to take them public are bypassing Wall Street by selling digital tokens, rather than shares, to the public. Such “initial coin offerings” raised $1.3 billion over the past three months without paying fees to underwriting banks.

Goldman’s effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank’s strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin’s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold.

Launched in 2009, bitcoin grew as a communal software project championed by cypherpunks, who embraced its technological promise, and libertarians, who cheered its independence from government influence. In recent years, more sophisticated exchanges have cropped up to host trading, attracting professional investors.

Some 70 hedge funds now invest in cryptocurrencies, according to Autonomous NEXT.

Exchange-traded funds meant to track digital currencies have so far faced pushback from regulators, but they could one day give a wider base of investors a way to indirectly own bitcoin and create new opportunities for savvy traders.

Such interest from institutional investors has propelled the bitcoin market to a size that merits banks’ attention. About $750 million worth of bitcoin trades on exchanges every day, on par with the daily trading volume of shares of Caterpillar Inc., the equipment maker.

Already, a handful of nonbank finance firms, such as DRW Holdings LLC’s Cumberland Mining and Genesis Global Trading Inc., broker bitcoin trades for institutional investors that want to buy or sell larger amounts than exchanges could handle.

That is a role that banks could easily step into. Wall Street firms also offer leverage to juice trading returns, and hold assets on clients’ behalf. So far, though, none of the big banks has dealt directly in bitcoin.

For starters, bitcoin is highly volatile. After doubling in price between July and early September, bitcoin lost 35% of its value in two weeks. That exposes dealers to the risk of big, quick losses.

But it also offers an opportunity for quick-footed traders to profit by anticipating price moves and facilitating panicked trading. Volatility has been sorely missing lately in traditional markets, leading to a slump in banks’ trading revenues.

Goldman, once known as the nimblest trader on Wall Street, has struggled more than peers. Revenue in its fixed-income division fell 21% from last year through June, dragged down by poor performance in commodities and currencies.

Already, some of the infrastructure for trading bitcoin is cropping up. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission this summer approved the first derivatives exchange for cryptocurrencies. LedgerX, founded by two former Goldman traders, will clear options and futures that would allow dealers to protect themselves from dramatic price swings and lock in profits.

Many prominent financiers, including Mr. Dimon, believe central banks such as the Federal Reserve will move to shut down digital currencies before they go mainstream enough to rival government-backed notes.

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman recently took a nuanced view. He said bitcoin is “obviously highly speculative, but it’s not inherently bad.”",2017-10-03 01:18:55

dnw2djt,nullc,85,"&gt;  it will be banned anyway, because it is sending invalid blocks according to Bitcoin protocol. 

it's not that simple. They will eventually be banned, maybe.  But for example, lets say your Bitcoin node connects only to 2x peers (e.g. because a sybil attack starts in the weeks before).  Then 2x activates but miners don't go along with it.

Your node will be isolated and no longer getting blocks from the honest network, but also not banning the 2x peers because they're not accepting any blocks.

Even when they do, you'll only ban one 2x peer for each new 2x block at most, and you might just replace that banned peer with another 2x peer.

There are many similar partitioning scenarios.  This is why it was important to disconnect them preemptively.

There is ongoing research for more aggressive automated mechanisms-- but it takes time to do it right and not introduce new vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, s2x chose to intentionally bypass the one simple and safe protection that we could deploy without delay.

So the only ""point"" I see in this change is that it undermines a protection and maximizes the risk of disruption. Ironically, given the node distribution the negative effects will be far worse for s2x than for Bitcoin nodes (something we also saw with Bcash).",2017-10-04 20:48:58

Of course some users (and some non-users), just heard that Internet money exists and therefore it must be the next big thing. But the deeper in the community you get, the crazier they are.        ",2017-10-04 01:09:40

dnuotdh,1mystical,60,"I see no reason that any coin should 'take bitcoin's reign' - Charlie's position that Litecoin should be used as complementary to bitcoin is the most pragmatic. 

I will continue to use Bitcoin as a store of wealth - however due to politics, it is highly unlikely it will ever be feasible as a day-to-day 'currency' (fast, affordable transactions, etc). 

Therefore, the litecoin network's sensible doctrine should continue to be complementary to bitcoin as an indefatigable merchant companion, an inverse parity to bitcoin's 'store of wealth'; as we approach the epoch of Atomic Swaps &amp; Lightning network this reality will begin to unfold. 

Will it reach 25% of Bitcoin's value? Probably not, but I see no reason it shouldn't be at least 10% - Which even instamined/premined coins like Dash &amp; Ethereum have achieved. 

I believe the goal here is to be a 'long-term' companion to Bitcoin; which is why I can appreciate the slow, organic growth of Litecoin, as opposed to being another flash in the pan premined coin with all hype, no substance - which the 2017 market may temporarily accommodate for speculative purposes, yet are nonviable for any long-term efficacy.

Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a currency.  It is a commodity.

In places (like Venezuela) where there is hyper-inflation, hard currency fetches a premium because there is a shortage of it.

There is a much greater demand for a ""stable"" crypto-currency in the world.  Much, much more demand than we see now.  If people have FAITH that it won't crash, you'll see billions more pour in.  As organized crime figures out how to use it more effectively to move billions around the world, you'll see billions more pour in.

Apple's price grew based on its massive profits.  The profits are a result of selling millions of iPhones.  Before the iPhone, there was no demand.  The profit was CREATED by creating the product.

There is a NEED and a desire for this bitcion currency/commodity.  People will pay a premium for what it can do (hide money, move money, safeguard money).  Until we reach a saturation point, the price will continue to grow and grow, as it has done.

The notion that a majority-supported upgrade should add ""strong"" (i.e., *wallet-breaking*) ""replay protection"" to accommodate those who are attempting to create a minority hash rate spinoff by refusing to follow the most-PoW chain is *insane*.  That is obviously and absurdly out of the question. If it is anyone's responsibility to add ""strong replay protection,"" it is obviously those supporting a minority chain. And for an entirely practical reason. A minority chain that doesn't facilitate a smooth split by changing its transaction format (if not also its PoW) may (and in my view, should) be viewed as hostile and destroyed via 51% attack. (This might sound harsh, but it's really just a way to level the playing field when you consider the fact that a ""soft fork""-style network upgrade includes a *built-in* 51% attack against anyone attempting to remain behind on the old rule set.) Making sure that a 1-MB chain dies (or is forced to hard fork itself) will also render any bogus argument that the 1-MB chain represents the ""real"" / ""original"" Bitcoin (and is thus somehow entitled to the ""Bitcoin"" / ""BTC"" name and ticker) even more untenable than it would already be.

Dear all,

Sergio, Diego and myself have been discussing the potential implications of
the November 2xHF and its lack of replay protection upon all the recent
information from Bcash and the reaction of the ecosystem. Below you will
find a summary of our thoughts.


New info:

   - The Bcash fork was successful and not contentious
   - It was received as ""free money"" by Bitcoiners and the users seem to be
   cool with ViaBTC
   - All exchanges/wallets are working to make the coins available
   - No major attacks have been registered and now both chains seem to be
   working without permanent contentious attacks from the competing miners
   - Bcash plans to launch an aggressive pipeline of innovation Schors,
   Drivechain, Emergent consensus, LN and merge-mining to promote its use/price
   - The ecosystem has now more development diversification/decentralization
   - Price of BTC + BCash &gt; Original BTC
   - *REPLAY PROTECTION (RP) was key for all the points addressed before.*
   - Bcash proved that is fairly easy and quick to add RP
   - Past evidence shows that the name seems to stay with Devs/Repo
   (happened with ETH and Bcash)

Why are we worried:

   - The current version of the NYA does not include RP
   - Without RP, at the HF there will be a lot of uncertainty and
   confusion. Users &amp; exchanges will be forced to halt their
   transactions/trading until there is a clear outcome of the fork which we
   think may take up to 2 weeks.
   - Users willing to transact will be loosing their tokens in some of the
   chains
      - The NYA will probably be perceived as an attack on the users
      - Users will be disappointed for not having their tokens duplicated
      - An endless war will be started between both groups, minimizing the
      chances of independent Core developers contributing to the btc1 repo
   - Even without RP it is hard to predict how the ecosystem will call the
   2x token
   - *It is unclear how many of the original signatories of the NYA still
   support it today given the new info and the no RP*

Why btc1 should include RP:

   - Having RP on the NYA would bring the following benefits:
      - Trading will not be stopped (reducing the ETH flippening risk or
      BTC price collapse)
      - Bitcoiners will love it for duplicating their tokens
         - Market will expect Price of BTC + BTC2x &gt; Original BTC
      - Both teams will compete in terms of innovation, security, services
      to users and lower fees
      - There will not be a significant incentive for miners/holders to
      attack the competitive chain.
      - It will be easier for devs to contribute to both teams/repos
      - Eventually the most successful blockchain will be called Bitcoin in
      the long term
   - Potential liabilities (?): All exchanges (specially those publicly
   signing the NYA) should discuss with their technical and legal teams how
   they are going to make the Core tokens available once their users claim them


Given that very few details has been discussed with the NYA signatories
back in May, it is very important to clarify whether having REPLAY
PROTECTION is open to discussion or not, so all signatories can
confirm/reject their support to the NYA.


Our goal has always been to try to keep the ecosystem together protecting
the network effect, however if a separation is inevitable, at least it
should be done in a way that protects users interests at all costs.

If the btc1 group agrees to include REPLAY PROTECTION, we would be happy to
allocate resources to collaborate in the development or testing of it.

***Is segwit2x the REAL Banker takeover?***

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/743qb8/is_segwit2x_the_real_banker_takeover/

&gt; DCG (digital Currency Group) is the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement. The CEO of DCG is Barry Silbert, a former investment banker, and Mastercard is an investor in DCG. 
&gt; 
&gt; Let's have a look at the people that control DCG:
&gt; 
&gt; http://dcg.co/who-we-are/
&gt; 
&gt; Three board members are listed, and one Board ""Advisor."" Three of the four Members/advisors are particularly interesting: 
&gt; 
&gt; **Glenn Hutchins**: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018. Yes, you read that correctly, **currently sitting board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Barry Silbert**: CEO of DCG (Digital Currency Group, funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at (Houlihan Lokey)
&gt; 
&gt; And then there's the ""Board Advisor,"" 
&gt; 
&gt; **Lawrence H. Summers:** 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously....The segwit2x deal is being pushed through by a Company funded by Mastercard, Whose CEO Barry Silbert is ex investment banker, and the Board Members of DCG include a currently sitting member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Ex chief Economist for the World Bank and a guy responsible for the removal of Glass Steagall.  
&gt; 
&gt; **It's fair to call these guys ""bankers"" right?** 
&gt; 
&gt; So that's the Board of DCG. They're spearheading the Segwit2x movement. As far as who is responsible for development, my research led me to ""Bitgo"". I checked the ""Money Map"" https://i.redd.it/15auzwkq3hiz.png And sure enough, DCG is an investor in Bitgo. 
&gt; 
&gt; (BTW, make sure you take a good look take a look at the money map and bookmark it for reference later, ^ it is really helpful.) 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-miners-offer-optimistic-outlook/
&gt; 
&gt; So Bitgo is overseeing development of Segwit2x with Jeff Garzick. Bitgo has a product/service that basically facilitates transactions and supposedly prevents double spending. It seems like their main selling point is that they insert themselves as middlemen to ensure Double spending doesn't happen, and if it does, they take the hit, of course for a fee, so it sounds sort of like the buyer protection paypal gives you:
&gt; 
&gt; **""Using the above multi-signature security model, BitGo can guarantee that transactions cannot be double spent. When BitGo co-signs a BitGo Instant transaction, BitGo takes on a financial obligation and issues a cryptographically signed guarantee on the transaction. The recipient of a BitGo Instant transaction can rest assured that in any event where the transaction is not ultimately confirmed in the blockchain, and loses money as a result, they can file a claim and will be compensated in full by BitGo.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Source: https://www.bitgo.com/solutions
&gt; 
&gt; So basically, they insert themselves as middlemen, guarantee your transaction gets confirmed and take a fee. **What do we need this for though when we have a working blockchain that confirms payments in the next block already?** 0-conf is safe when blocks aren't full and one confirmation should really be good enough for almost anyone on the most POW chain. So if we have a fully functional blockchain, there isn't much of a need for this service is there? They're selling protection against ""The transaction not being confirmed in the Blockchain"" but why wouldn't the transaction be getting confirmed in the blockchain? Every transaction should be getting confirmed, that's how Bitcoin works. So in what situation does ""protection against the transaction not being confirmed in the blockchain"" have value? 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible that the Central Bankers that control development of Segwit2x plan to restrict block size to benefit their business model just like our good friends over at Blockstream attempted to do, although unsuccessfully as they were not able to deliver a working L2 in time? 
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like Blockstream was an attempted corporate takeover to restrict block size and push people onto their L2, essentially stealing business away from miners. They seem to have failed, but now it almost seems like the Segwit2x might be a culmination of a very similar problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; **So segwit2x takes power away from core, but then gives it to guess who...Mastercard and central bankers.** 
&gt;  
&gt; So, to recap:
&gt; 
&gt; - DCG's Board of Directors and Advisors is almost entirely made up of Central Bankers including one currently sitting Member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and another who was Chief Economist at the World Bank. 
&gt; 
&gt; - The CEO of the company spearheading the Segwit2x movement (Barry Silbert) is an ex investment banker at Houlihan Lokey. Also, Mastercard is an investor in the company DCG, which Barry Silbert is the CEO of.
&gt; 
&gt; - The company overseeing development on Segwit2x, Bitgo, has a product/service that seems to only have utility if transacting on chain and using 0-Conf is inefficient or unreliable. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Segwit2x takes power over Bitcoin development from core, but then **literally** gives it to central bankers and Mastercard. If segwit2x goes through, BTC development will quite literally be controlled by central bankers and a currently serving member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Did we just spend so much time fighting and bickering with core that we totally missed the REAL takeover of Bitcoin, happening right before our eyes, by the likes of currently serving Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board Members?**

Why? **Because Bitcoin and Segwit2X cannot both survive**.

I used to think that both coins would survive and that both communities would divorce and live happily ever after.

The problem is that both coins share the same PoW algorithm.

If both coins survive the hashing power will fluctuate dramatically from one coin to the other depending on short term price fluctuations, making both coins unusable. We'll have periods where Segwit2X works and Bitcoin doesn't, and periods where Bitcoin works and Segwit2X doesn't. The situation is untenable on the long-term.

The only reason why Bitcoin cash is able to survive the extreme hashrate volatility is because of EDA, which Bitcoin and S2X do not implement.

dnzhklq,smeggletoot,59,"People forget that **bitcoin's success is solely down to the people involved**.  A fork is, first and foremost, the divergence of weak and average minds who aren't visionary enough to understand the longer project arc.  And because they lack this vision they get frustrated and impatient with a perceived lack of progress, failing to understand that whilst we [""have built castles in the air""](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid105332.html) they are no use without further solidifying the foundations.

On one hand we have the greatest scientists on the planet in this space thinking a decade down the line about solar powered mining rigs hooked up to satellites in space, whilst on the other side we have coteries of businessmen and women fixated on short term goals who see the world as nothing but a paper-money playground, wasting talent and energy on ICO's, middleware payment gateways, loan companies and coffee purchases that do nothing but try to hammer the round peg of bitcoin into the square hole that is the broken (and oh so boring) system it was built to transcend...  

Whilst still others are trying to use bitcoin to push their subjective, myopic worldviews into people's minds, in the exact same way our ancestors tried to use the technology of money to force their subjective cultural biases on others around the world... without having experienced first-hand or understood any of those cultures they sought to disrupt and impose those views upon.

Such is the huge disconnect of minds and voices in this space.    

And it is something we all knew would be coming, as soon as bitcoin began garnering interest from the very speculative VC's and predatory big businesses bitcoin will ultimately transcend.  

In short, you have a bunch of (mostly) white businessmen and women, newly endowed with money and 'power' who have never really built anything of worth on the internet; and they are being egged on by dinosaurs of the old world, unwittingly fighting against the ideas of thousands of the smartest coders on the planet who have been quietly working for decades keeping the internet free from the predatory practices of the very dinosaurs (think SOPA and PIPA) now attempting to move into this space.  

They forget that those old internet neckbeards are now middle-aged and are no longer the naive kids that gave their ideas and inventions to their parents for nothing, only to see those ideas borne of ""information wants to be free"" used as a battering ram to try to subvert the internet into a grotesque corporate play thing, a pale shadow of what Tim Berners-Lee imagined it one day could become...  Do we think it a coincidence that one of those middle-aged internet architects - Bram Cohen (the inventor of Bittorrent - the most disruptive p2p protocol on the planet) is now working alongside core on all this?    

Those greying internet denizens of this ilk are experienced enough now to not fall for the same trick and are quickly bringing up to speed a new generation of coders capable of carrying the torch forward with new energy.  They will not allow themselves to be corrupted by money, power, greed or 'twitter fame', since their primary interest is the same as it always has been at the beginning of the internet: to free the world's information and get this little family of crazy misfits and rebels into the starships we're all capable of building when we pool intellectual and economic energy alongside the grander ontological awakening all this leads to.

Eventually those completely different worldviews and longterm aspirations for this technology come head-to-head and the friction eventually reaches an impasse (as we're seeing with the latest hard fork).  Those who do not understand technology or see bitcoin in this transformative light begin to kick up dust storms.  And those weak and average (but mostly well-meaning) minds who would have been on the side of ""but... but... heavier than air objects will never fly!"" back in pre-aviation days, get to go their own way as they shake themselves out of an ecosystem of [cosmic revolutionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTccWT2YOC8) that sound as crazy (to them) as the Wright Brothers did to their contemporaries.  

**In the end, it's about a 'side' that lacks imagination due to their in-built fears of what real, positive change means for their subjective view of 'reality'.**  Most are more comfortable with destruction than they are change, since destruction is something we have spent millennia as a species building coping strategies for, whereas change means embracing the unknown and daring to imagine a world without war, poverty or greed.  Such lofty goals are too transformative for many people to even conceptualise, let alone embrace.

*""The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.” — Buckminster Fuller*

An economics or business degree is about as useful in this space as a degree in glass blowing would have been to those drafting the original world wide web specs.  As such, the cleverest economists and businessmen and women in this space are accepting there is little utility in trying to shape the future of this space and are happily taking a step back and going back to school... Something I'm sure [Buckminster Fuller would highly approve of](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/133403-we-should-do-away-with-the-absolutely-specious-notion-that) were he around today.

I say all this as a Computer Scientist who has been programming for 33 years and even I know I cannot keep up with the rapid pace of changes happening here, so God knows how someone with a completely unrelated non-technical background not versed in the scientific method must feel; but at least I speak *the language* needed to understand what is happening.

That's literally the crux of the issue here: if we were to go back to the days of the Grimoire it would be comparable to the few people in the world who had learnt how to master the art of the written word attempting to communicate the future of this new technology called ""language"" through the written word itself... to cavemen and women still speaking in grunts.  As such the only 'experts' you should be listening to are those that speak the language of computer science and those with the experience to know how all this needs to be structured if we are to avoid the same mistakes we all made in building the internet.  

You will notice those 'experts' will be the first to exercise great humility in telling you that even they don't know yet how this will all unfold, since there are too many moving parts to be folded into this.  The hardfork, in that respect, is arguably, a very simple engineering challenge in comparison to the many that lie ahead. 

I am well aware that having said all this will create an emotive response in the minds of those cavemen and women I just took a small dig at, which will fire cognitive dissonance to such a degree that they will leave this thread in a state of fight or flight.

Which is a shame, because we each have a very important role to play in this new world, regardless of background, such is the inter-disciplinary nature of this grand project build.  People just need to have the humility to step back and think deeply about what that their part might be and the role they are most passionate about playing and, crucially, be prepared to go back to school and start learning all over again... The most important introductory lesson in all of this is to understand that there is no future in this space for those who see themselves as glorious leaders...

**Bitcoin developers are not - and never can be - stooges that will lead your personal corporate army.**  That is a tough lesson for those who are used to being chieftains to learn, but it is a process that can begin right now by understanding just what we mean when we say [control is an illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control).

TL;DR: The fork going ahead actually strengthens bitcoin (the idea) by providing a nice little bubble wrapped space for people to go have fun in whilst the actual architects of all this are able to continue 'Plan B' in an environment relieved of the toxicity of nefarious (but no doubt well-meaning) actors in this space who have failed to grok the truly transformative potential of this technology.

i.e. ""to the Moon!"" ;)

Let's also make another assumption that in the US weed legalization is on the near horizon. 

You think for a second that organizations looking to exploit money in exchange for illegal goods won't immediately shift to add firearms or parts to their flow of contraband in order to make up for the deficit losing weed will leave? Realistically, all they'd really have to provide are a small number of parts as you can make a lot of them with either a 3D printer or a block of wood. 

Ban them, and they'd evolve to be even more easily producible in the home. Barrels would still be available as every bolt action firearm still uses barrels - it'd be pretty trivial to modify the AR design to take say... a Remington 700 barrel. Springs and such are pretty universal, as are roll pins, chunks of metal to use a recoil weights, and sights/scopes. 

So what's left? Handgun barrels and frames, trigger parts, AR bolt assemblies, firing pins, and other small easily cast and mailed parts. 

Honestly, if you look at the middle east, there are shops dedicated to producing firearms. 

I have no reason to doubt that there are elements out in the world that would find ways to pick up some of the massive amounts of cash flow that current goes into the US firearms industry and no small amount of Americans willing to pay them for their services.

My serious qualms with IOTA, as follows, since we're being asked.

Investors, try not to downvote based on your portfolio.

- Needs a central coordinator to withstand adversarial network conditions still. Fine, as a speculative future tech... For a $1.5 billion cap network? Yikes. Bitcoin was far smaller when it became a Honey Badger. What if we remove the coordinator and the entire market tanks, IOTA transactions slowing, less spam to keep the protection up? Do we wait for IOTA to reinstitute their closed source program?

- The central coordinator is closed source. We are surrounded by pure open source projects which can be easily analyzed and judged, and are far more deserving of investment. As someone who has been in the Free Software / OSS community for many years, their reasons against opening this up ring hollow.

- They rolled their own cryptographic algorithms. People outside of serious security circles don't understand how bad this is. I saw people saying this is what Bitcoin did - no. Bitcoin uses SHA-256. The SHA algorithms received years and years of intensive study and attack before they were considered resistant enough for widespread adoption. Existing systems like Ethereum are hash algorithm agnostic, and can easily be changed to quantum-resistant algorithms if need be. We don't need to sacrifice peer review to have quantum resistance, and running an (again) $1.5 billion dollar system on top of a homegrown and already colliding hash algorithm is insanity. It might be that collisions don't directly impact IOTA - they're still a sign of weakness, attacks will only get better. Forcing collisions in MD5 and SHA-1 were the warning signs that gave us years to switch away from those designs.

- They claim to have deliberately hid a bug in their open source code, to harm competitors? Run. Just run. They're either lying through their teeth to protect Curl,  or guilty of seriously malicious behavior.

Now, my favorite thing about IOTA, is this far, I've seen less hive-mindedness on their subreddit as others. Less downvoting contrary opinions, more openness to technical discussion. I hope that continues, and as long as it does, I'll reserve total judgement, and continue to watch what happens with a mind towards investment one day.

do08z28,thisiswhereilive,106,"Scenarios:

* Scenario 1. Core concedes and upgrades their software to 2X. 

Consequences: None - no split occurs. Are both implementations 
of bitcoin nodes compatible, at minimum I believe it is possible that they can become compatible if core decides to make it so? If so, then the network is coherent. Potentially minimum bitcoin price volatility

Probability: Low &lt; 10% ? It appears there is very low chance that core will modify their software to accept 2MB blocks.



* Scenario 2. NYA agreement calls off their insistence of 2MB.

Consequences: No network split, no changes whatsoever - the battle is postponed for another day? Potentially minimum bitcoin price volatility

Probability: Low &lt;10% ? Similar to Scenario 1.


* Scenario 3. 2X nodes currently signaling stick together, and companies currently supporting 2X follow through entirely on their pledge.

Consequences: Network and coins are at risk of replay attacks without proper precautions. Core chain loses vast majority of miners working on chain, while difficulty remains extremely high. Blocks will no longer have an average of 10 minutes, but instead ~ 100-200 minutes each (high uncertainty here) It will take 100-200 days for the next difficulty change to help alleviate this issue, or an emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA) via a software rollout will be required. Without an EDA, this will kill the chain almost assuredly, and thus I think it would be likely an EDA will be used if this scenario comes about, but it does not have to. Mining this chain will also be EXTREMELY unprofitable, so miners will have an incentive to switch to 2X to prevent large financial losses, this can lead to a further decerease in the hash rate on the chain. This cascade may be a terminal scenario for the chain. Consequences for bitcoin as a whole will be extremely difficult to predict. This scenario is the most likely way that core loses control of de facto bitcoin, and BT1(bitfinex nomenclature) coins lose most of their value. Again, consequences here are extremely uncertain. Core can still survive, but this is the least likely scenario of its survival. Extremely large bitcoin(BT1/BT2) price volatility likely.

Probability Medium 10 &lt; x &lt; 50% ?

* Scenario 4. 2x node currently signaling do not follow through with 2X (percentage of follow through will be critical on subsequent effects.)


Consequences: Network and coins are at risk of replay attacks without proper precautions. Core chain loses some hash power, block times increase, but not to extent as above. Consequences are significantly harder to predict without a clear victor in hash rate. Both chain will suffer from increased block times without EDAs. Uncertainty will reign for some time, and it is possible that both turn into clean splits if one or both sides implement replay protection. Uncertainty will be at a maximum point here. Extremely large bitcoin(BT1/BT2) price volatility likely - most volatile situation potentially.

Probability: Medium 10 &lt; x &lt; 50% ?


Subjective opinion:
My best estimate is that 3 or 4 are the most likely scenarios, and as far a I can tell this bodes extremely poorly for the market action of bitcoin. Based on this type of analysis I have moved to the sidelines in 100% cash. I am not an ideologue and I have no horse in this race and I prefer to sleep soundly at night. I want bitcoin to succeed, whatever/whomever controls it. Most importantly, though, I don't intend to be poorer than when I started this, except for my increasing maintenance needed on the the popcorn machine. In both 3 and 4, depending on which companies support which coin, this will cause serious chaos and serious disruption to the ecosystem. This seems to be extremely nightmarishly bearish for the price of bitcoin. This is a sort of de facto hostile takeover, in the stock market analogy - I don't mean it pejoratively, each group is running their own version of software, and as far as I am concerned that's exactly what is intended with crypto - instead of a split like BCH, so I am very concerned with the ramifications if this is not resolved very shortly.

But the blocks kept filling up (regardless by who). Bitcoin couldnt handle it.  What the hell is happening?  I have been a software engineer for 25 years and if my live system was performing this poorly I would do absolutely everything in my power to fix it. We have hard forked before successfully for bug fixes and there was absolutely no reason NOT to put together a plan for a hard fork to ease the congestion ESPECIALLY since developers have been warning us about this as early as 2012.

In my mind, it is absolutely CLEAR that Blockstream are not good faith actors in this space.  I have been a Bitcoin evangelist since 2013. Some of the people who have carried the entire Bitcoin load bringing us to a $5000 BTC is Erik Voorhees, Roger Ver, Barry Silbert, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.

For ANYONE who understands ANYTHING about Bitcoin a red flag immedietely goes up in your head seeing this statement as a false dichotomy.  Adam Back is a lot of things but he is not stupid. HE KNOWS THIS.  Bitcoin OF COURSE can be both because IT HAS BEEN BOTH FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS.  Experiment. Quantify results. Thats called science!.. It CAN be also a ledger for a million other uses that is not JUST cheap payments.

My perspective is that bitcoin is a messy, ungoverned group of cypherpunks, users, and crazy talented devs. 

There are also a few businesses with marketing departments. This means they can attempt to push bitcoin into a direction that favours them, and they can *appear to be doing so successfully* as that is how corporate communication is always perceived - they come across as heavy, collected and as having a lot of weight behind them, while bitcoin itself being just a protocol has no marketing department. So perception becomes warped.

But it means nothing in this space and businesses are just as stupid as governments when they think they can gain control over the software we all use. Even if their whole business model actually relies upon bitcoin's resilience to their hijack attempts, this doesn't mean they are capable of recognizing that fact - then throw in a couple of inflated egos such as Roger with his whole Jesus complex and anyone else with an axe to grind and those that want to pump alts and you have a community of sorts with aligned goals. But this has nothing to do with bitcoin which remains the ever nonchalant honey badger.

I am currently in love with this community. The amazing response and public acknowledgement of the emporer's nakedness has been so well articulated by so many in this sub, on slack, on twitter along with the future price of bt2 on finex being currently only a quarter of bitcoin's is hugely encouraging.

do1vv4c,dhork,52,"It all starts with the Bitcoin Scaling debate. Big blockers want to increase the size of bitcoin blocks to scale all transaction on-chain, small blockers want to keep the Bitcoin blockchain small and move minor transactions offchain. Segregated Witness (SegWit) is the offchain scaling solution put forth by the Core developers.

As a compromise, the overwhelming majority of bitcoin-related companies (including miners with over 80% of the total Bitcoin hashrate) signed onto the New York agreement, which called for SegWit to be introduced first, followed by a hard fork to 2 MB block size (2x the current 1MB)

So SegWit was introduced over the summer. But now that the 2x hard fork is scheduled, Core developers do not want to go along with it. If they do not, and 2x gets implemented on schedule, then there will be another Bitcoin fork. However, over 90% of the mined blocks are currently ""signaling"" that their miners intend to implement Segwit 2x as planned. If that happens, and Core does not follow the change to 2X, then all the hashpower will be on the 2x side of the fork, and Core's side of the fork might shrivel up and die. 

However, there are several people who are saying that those miners who are signaling 2x won't follow through if Core does not implement 2MB blocks. If that's the case, then the 2X fork will be the one that shrivels up and dies.

(There's also the whole replay protection thing, but this post is getting long enough as it is.)

On the Bitcoin Gold thing: that comes from the idea that the biggest problem with Bitcoin right now are the ASIC miners, making it so that ordinary users can't participate in mining anymore without a significant investment. The Bitcoin Gold people want to fork off Bitcoin with a new PoW algorithm that is ""ASIC resistant"", so people can mine bitcoin with their GPU's again. But a new PoW algorithm means none of the current miners can mine it. In my opinion, if it survives at all, it will end up being treated like an Altcoin where every Bitcoin hodler ""premined"" it, if that makes any sense....",2017-10-08 07:17:02
do1ovmw,smeggletoot,49,"I'm going to post this again so that we can avoid spreading knee-jerk, reactionary panic...

P.S. This game has never been about who has the most 'money'; it's always been about who has access to the best information.

DCG is a lot more complicated than you might realise.  Think of Barry as more of a classic VC that has hedged his bets in all this and invested in loads of companies in the space, even those with different visions of where Bitcoin should go, in the hope some of his 'bets' will eventually pay off.

Further, just because companies have received investment from DCG does not mean they are contractually obliged to follow any visions DCG have in balancing the different needs of those companies with regard to their input over the bitcoin protocol.  

Case-in-point: both Ben Davenport and Adam Back (Bitgo and Blockstream respectively) have come out massively against 2X. 

My biggest concern with DCG are with companies they've *acquired* as opposed to invested in.  

Specifically coindesk, given that they have the ability to lead the narrative by virtue of being a publisher.  But even coindesk are set to be disrupted (as are all media properties of the future) via crowd-led news outlets like Wikitribune and, of course, by Reddit itself via the scrutiny of the crowd.

Not a lot can be done behind closed doors in this space without there being a leak somewhere, since so much of the *real* work *has to happen* in the open (IRC, mailing lists, BIP's etc.).

If you want to join the dots, I would say look to the actual companies in this space and the kind of friends they have (and belief structures those friends subscribe to).

If Nathaniel Popper's account is correct, then there's an interesting group of people here that met and discussed bitcoin a number of years ago, which perhaps explains why companies like Xapo are pro-segwit 2x.

https://chhaylinlim.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/how-bill-gates-was-attracted-to-bitcoin/

In particular, pay close attention to those in this space who are of the ""Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws"" persuasion. A lot of this comes down to ideology, ignorance of the open vision of this technology, and a 'business as usual' attitude.  

And, worse still, a failure of newly endowed businessmen and women who have never built anything on the internet before who have no idea about the mistakes made by corporations of the past who tried to take control of the world wide web in the exact same way they are.

The difference this time around is those who did make those mistakes during the world wide web revolution, and fought for net neutrality so you might enjoy sites like Reddit, are now all grown up.  A lot of the people involved in bitcoin from the beginning have been running successful internet startups for the last few decades, and are slowly figuring out how all this can fit around what they've already built.

Bear in mind **it's possible for these two competing visions to exist side by side**; there is no reason 2X and coinbase et al couldn't provide a nice little safe Paypal 2.0 esque walled garden akin to Apple's App Store in the interim... just as right now Paypal and Bitcoin are co-existing nicely (Stripe, Braintree for instance).  

It's imperative both 'sides' stay calm and don't threaten each others different visions by doing **egregious stuff like forcing a contentious hard fork that doesn't offer strong replay protection**, or **mixing up tickers which will confuse ordinary everyday people** which we all have a duty of care to look after.  Clearly 2X can attract the more cautious institutional investor side and ""App Store"" grannies, whilst 1X can be the big, bold ""Android"" innovator with crazy visions of space stations and decentralised mining which the more tech savvy and younger generations can get involved with without needing to be wet nursed.  

Atomic swaps mean those grannies and their grandkids can still interact regardless of which side of the fork either party bought into.  So the future is bright for both 'sides' if **B2X do the right thing and make sure they do a responsible fork we can all get behind and champion.**  

Failure to do so will end up riling up both 'sides' continuously and open us all up to silly DAO style hacks as each 'side' gets prodded (instead of constantly peer-reviewed), which only makes alts like ethereum more attractive for people entering this space and further sets back innovation.  Better we all look after each other and focus on the security and future of both blockchains (and yes, the future of DCG companies building cool stuff on them).  

**We all need to take a step back and recognise the more important role we are all playing here in helping solve much bigger socio-economic issues like the environment, war and poverty.**  Everyone in this space gets to create solutions for tackling those problems in really exciting ways through this technology when it's ready, but only if we're all playing nicely with one another and pushing our energy in the same direction.  We all want to create a better world for future generations, we all want to be proud that we played a positive role in helping shape that world during a period in history when the masses were crying out for people to step up.  Time then, to start building (and mending) bridges and focus on those much bigger socio-economic objectives we can all agree on, no matter what side of the fork we stand on.

Don't forget too, there's been zero announcements from Y-Combinator, Google, Facebook, Reddit or any of the websites that most shape the internet landscape... so, in the long-run, DCG and all the companies they have in their portfolio (and the tiny userbase they all command in comparison) have little say in where all this ultimately leads... It takes just one announcement from Google to say they've integrated Layer two ready 1X bitcoin into Android pay and Gmail to completely change the rules of the game... 

It's perhaps up to DCG companies then to think about pivoting away from their focus on commission and payment gateways since the current internet giants surely already have Layer 2 solutions up their sleeves (Blockstack alone changes everything in terms of decentralised identity and data storage - which is another Barry Silbert portfolio investment btw).

I'll leave you with Facebook executive Chamath, talking about bitcoin back in 2013... A guy who, I believe - along with many in silicon valley - actually *gets* bitcoin, why it was invented and where this open source technology is truly heading if we move our attention away from 1st world coffee problems when this in-fighting finally draws to a close in November...

do2ek6c,SamsungGalaxyPlayer,45,"Overall, this is a very good presentation. Nevertheless, I sent an email to the organizers containing the following clarifications along with other stuff:

1. For Dash, VPS providers could maintain logs of many masternodes, possibly at low cost. There are several services that specialize in hosting these masternodes, which means they will have access to a very large amount of data. [Here is an example](https://masternode.me/). They do not need to amass the capital to have a successful attack.

2. Researchers mostly from Princeton tested several attacks on the Dash PrivateSend network and found that for transactions with 12 or more inputs (the median), there was a 100% tested certainty that the transactions could be linked with the default of 2 rounds of mixing. [Link to the published paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02489.pdf).

3. Not many people mix. The total anonymity set is pretty small if only a fraction of users actually mix.

4. Monero also uses stealth addresses. As such, people do not know which addresses these outputs belong to. They are not known to belong to any single address. Thus, even if an output is spent 4 times in one day, people do not know how the money is being moved between accounts, or if it is being used at all, since they could all be decoys in the constructed ring signatures.

5. Monero does not have a UTXO set, since no one actually knows when outputs are spent. Even though they appear in a block, they could just be decoys. It instead has a TXO set. This is similar, but there are very important differences in how this impacts blockchain analysis.

6. There has been a network-mandated minimum ringsize of 3 since March 2016 ([link](https://getmonero.org/resources/roadmap/)). Thus, it has not been possible since this time for people to send transactions where the real input is clearly the real one. Thus, people can no longer realistically undermine the privacy of other users with their spending habits.

7. In September 2017, the minimum ringsize was increased to 5 (4 other decoy inputs) and RingCT was made mandatory. However, though not mandatory, over 99% of transactions used RingCT by March of this year ([this is the best reference I can find in April](http://web.archive.org/web/20170429144606/moneroblocks.info/stats)). Thus, the presenter completely misunderstood that ring signatures worked aside from RingCT.

8. The MoneroLink paper by Miller, et al showed some past weaknesses of ring signatures, but this still did not compromise the stealth address features. So while Monero did not work as well as it should have, its transactions were not ""traceable"" in the way that Bitcoin transactions are traceable. [You can see the response that I authored here](https://getmonero.org/2017/04/19/an-unofficial-response-to-an-empirical-analysis-of-linkability.html).

9. Implementation has a huge impact on the anonymity set. For Monero, all transactions always hide the sender, amount, and receiver. In the past month, this totaled [120,414 transactions](http://moneroblocks.info/stats/transaction-stats). For a similar Zcash transaction where all these three items are hidden, there were [only 314](https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/usage). So while zero-knowledge is obviously better on a theoretical level, the anonymity set is actually significantly larger for Monero, since the other Zcash transactions are completely transparent. The interaction between these private and public transactions leaves a lot of room for data leakage.

10. Monero has improved its input selection algorithm following the advice of the MoneroLink, which was the best research in the paper. Finding the appropriate input selection algorithm is very difficult. This addresses the newest-input-is-usually-the-real-one issue.

11. Double-spend protection is done with the key image, which is created without compromising which private key was actually used. Thus, attempting a doublespend doesn't break anonymity.

12. I just want to make especially clear that Monero is not a mixer.

13. I believe it is important to mention that zk-SNARKs require a trusted setup. [Here is Peter Todd's great writeup about his participation in the ceremony](https://petertodd.org/2016/cypherpunk-desert-bus-zcash-trusted-setup-ceremony).",2017-10-08 14:27:36

do1f2fb,Koooooj,36,"The only relatively modern algorithm I can think of that actually uses prime numbers like that is RSA.  The primes are a couple thousand bits long.  That's on the order of a few hundred decimal digits long.  Their size varies a little.

Finding prime numbers that large is actually remarkably fast and easy; prime numbers aren't as rare as many people would lead you to believe.  You can just start at some random high number and start checking with a fast probable primality test (most often Fermat's Little Theorem, which requires one modpow operation to prove a number composite or probably prime).  Once you have a probable prime you can do a more expensive test to prove that you've found an actually prime number.

Taking the primes from a list would defeat the primes' purpose in RSA:  the algorithm gets its strength from the difficulty in figuring out which prime numbers were used.  If someone could just run down a list then it would be fast to check all the options.

There are a few other applications of large prime numbers in cryptography in contexts where each user doesn't need their own prime.  For example, in the secp256k1 Koblitz Curve used for some ECC applications (notably Bitcoin; most use secp256r1 instead) one of the curve parameters is 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 2^(0).  This is a prime number very close to the max value a 256-bit integer can store, which gives it some nice properties for the math done on elliptic curves.  This prime was presumably chosen by looking for a prime close to but less than 2^256 with as many 1s in the binary representation as possible. Everyone using secp256k1 will use that same prime; it is not a secret. ",2017-10-08 01:13:31

However, the rate of donations and BTC price increases outpaced the rate of spending, so the ad fund ended up with an unexpected surplus which has to this day not been fully exhausted.

So far, the ad fund has been used to pay for:

do4avil,SrPeixinho,84,"No!! The internet is not a decentralized computer, you can't upload some code ""to the internet"" in such a manner that anyone can call it and it runs without alterations (and forever). For a simple concrete example, suppose you created a dumb JavaScript counter that just counts how many times it has been used:

```
var counter = 0;

function update() {
    counter += 1;
}

function read() {
    return counter;
}
```

Now you want to publish it ""to the internet"" in a way that anyone can call `update()`, and anyone can call `read()`, and it stays up forever without being altered. There's no means to do that on the internet without Ethereum (or similar). You could, of course, upload that program on your own private server and serve a HTTP API with Node.js, but then everyone needs to trust you not to alter the database (say, manually changing the `counter` to `99999999999`), or plugging off the power - which is exactly what we're trying to solve, we want programs that run globally without an particular party being able to alter them.

That is simply what Ethereum is, and no more than that. Again: 1. It is a network of computers. 2. You can upload programs to it. 3. Those programs run forever without being altered. 

Of course, Bitcoin is just a special case of Ethereum (and a very boring one). Specifically, Bitcoin can be seen as an Ethereum program with functions `send()` (transfers money) and `mine()` (generates money given PoW), and a map of balances as its internal state. Pretty boring, no? There are much more interesting things.

If it's the former, the Grid+ whitepaper actually has a very lucid introduction on ETH. Not everything is covered though like DAOs or the dynamics of gas but it's a good as place as any to start. I'm sure there are other more technical resources abound too. You might have more luck in r/Ethereum for this kind of discussion.

Here's the one from Grid, probably going to overdue it with a wall of text, but sharing it anyway because it's pretty darn good for what it is:

&gt;""2.5.1 Ethereum
&gt;&gt;Ethereum is a readable, writable, and programmable ledger accessible to any individual with an Internet connection. Thousands of users all over the world run software (each of these users is running a “node”) that maintain the ledger and these users are financially incentivized by the system itself to do so. Any user (even ones not running a node) may write a program and upload it to Ethereum. To do so requires some amount of ether, Ethereum’s underlying currency, be paid to the owner of the node which appends the program to the ledger.
&gt;&gt;The program, now uploaded to the Ethereum “blockchain” (a specific kind of ledger), will live on for as long as at least one person continues to run an Ethereum node. The program cannot be changed and anyone may interact with it. A program on the ledger is called a “smart contract”, a term coined in 1994 by Nick Szabo to describe a piece of code capable of executing some function within a decentralized ledger. Smart contracts can be trusted by anyone to execute exactly as-specified in their code, and the code itself is publically visible on the ledger. Once deployed to Ethereum, these pieces of logic cannot be tampered with, destroyed, or restricted by any party in any way.

&gt;2.5.2 Tokens
&gt;&gt;In the context of Ethereum, smart contracts colloquially referred to as “tokens” include a minimum set of functionality defined by a community standard called ERC-20. This standard exists to ensure all tokens have the same minimal functionality (e.g. ability to be transferred) and facilitates token interoperability.
&gt;&gt;Tokens can represent anything. For example, Alex could issue Alex Coin, redeemable (only by Alex) for 1 hour of his labor. Nick Johnson , one of Ethereum’s core developers, created BeerCoin, stating “a person's BeerCoin is only as valuable as the recipient's belief that they're good for the beer, should it ever be redeemed”. Tokens can also be issued and backed by fiat money deposits from a trusted organization or government. Such tokens might then be redeemable for the issued fiat currency (e.g. US dollars) by the issuing institution. Grid+ believes that fiat backed stable tokens will enable far more commerce to be conducted using Ethereum’s rails in lieu of traditional payment processors.

&gt;2.5.3 Stable Tokens
&gt;&gt;A problem that has plagued digital currencies since their inception is price volatility. Cryptocurrencies (e.g. ether, bitcoin) underlying decentralized protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin) are not issued by central institutions. Thus, they are not backed by anything but trust that there will be future demand both for the protocol and its native token. This leads to rampant speculation which, in immature markets, leads to huge slips in liquidity and large price volatility.
&gt;&gt;The future of money cannot depend on volatile assets, which is why stable tokens have remained a popular topic of conversation. Although difficult to implement on the Bitcoin blockchain, stable tokens are simple to issue on Ethereum since all that is needed is an institution to back them. If a trusted counterparty has a large reserve of U.S. dollars, it can mint USD tokens and sell them for $1 on a currency exchange. Those minted tokens can now move through the Ethereum ecosystem freely until some user chooses to redeem her tokens in exchange for a bank wire.

&gt;2.5.4 Payment Channels
&gt;&gt;Although tokens can move from user to user (and also from user to smart contract), each one of these transfers (called “transactions”) require that the global Ethereum ledger be updated. A transaction requires the requester pay ether to the node making the ledger update. Before seeing the updated token balances, all users must wait for the next ledger update, which takes about 15 seconds in Ethereum.
&gt;&gt;It is not feasible for mainstream users to create a transaction every time they want to buy something. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen massive network congestion as a result of increasing popularity, but much of that traffic can be ameliorated using technology called payment channels.
&gt;&gt;As an analogy, imagine you are at a bar and plan to stay there all night. If you open a new tab and close it out after paying for each round, you must sign multiple receipts and the bar incurs multiple transaction fees from their payment processor (this is why they always ask if you want to leave a tab open). If you instead keep your tab open across several rounds, you need only sign one receipt at the end and you save the bar some amount in transaction fees.
&gt;&gt;The concept is similar in Ethereum. Instead of creating 1,000 ledger updates, one can open a payment channel and instead pass 1,000 mathematical proofs that prove the sender can pay some number of tokens to the receiver. These can be verified outside of Ethereum (“off-chain”) and only one proof (typically the last one) is needed to close the channel. Thus, one thousand transactions can be reduced to two: one to open the channel and one to close it. Simple payment channels like the ones Grid+ uses are easy to design today, but more complicated state channels are an ongoing topic of research and experimentation. (Appendix)

&gt;2.5.5 Proof of Stake and Casper
&gt;&gt;Readers familiar with Ethereum will be well aware of the coming Casper implementation of “Proof-of-Stake”. Casper (and more broadly Proof-of-Stake) is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum protocol expected to be deployed around Q1 2018. At a high level, Casper allows users who own ether to deposit it to a smart contract and then become permissioned to update the ledger. If one or more of these bonded validators act out of turn or attempts to update the ledger in a way which violates state transition rules, those changes will be rejected by the broader set of stakers and those fraudulent validators will lose their entire ether deposit. If instead these validators act honestly, they earn some amount of ether commensurate with the fees in the transactions they have processed.
&gt;&gt;Note that this process of “validating” transactions in Casper requires that users cryptographically “sign” data stating that they believe the data is factual and will induce a valid update of the ledger. This has some security implications which will be discussed later.
&gt;&gt;Although the transition to Casper will not affect how Grid+ operates (in that it will not change Ethereum’s usability), this protocol upgrade will be referenced later for other purposes. For more information, see Vitalik Buterin’s article [Ft. 41] on proof of stake as well as his other writings on Casper (in the same blog).

I'd vote to change the name of this sub to whatever you want as soon as:

Bitcoin kills (or really even competes with) )western union / visa / mastercard / paypal.
Or, if Bitcoin toppled and replaced a major world currency.
Or, if Bitcoin brought the end to statist governments.
Or, if Bitcoin brought the end to the military industrial complex.
Or, maybe even if Bitcoin had any widespread use other than illegal activity and speculation. (seems unlikely but sometimes if you get enough people pushing one direction you end up headed that way even if it's a bad idea)

First invest it in bitcoin back in March 2010 when 1 bitcoin was 0.003 $ on the BitcoinMarket.com exchange. YAY ! Now you have 3.333 BTC. Invest those in the Ethereum ICO at a 1/2000 rate. YAY !

",2017-10-09 22:01:45
do3g78b,binarygold,40,"Many reasons:

1. Larger community. More people hold and accept Bitcoin by at least a factor or more.

2. More robust network: Bitcoin is harder to attack because of high hashrate that can't be easily bought or created in any way, and because there are so many nodes validating transactions.

3. More liquid. Higher market cap gives a bigger variety of use cases, especially when you need to move large value, in the millions of dollars. You can sell and buy this much bitcoin on exchanges without moving the price significantly, thus losing much on the spread. More people can hold bigger value making the price more stable, and sort of the base currency all other alts are measured / traded against, even more so than USD.

4. Biggest and best developer community among all cryptos, which allows the development to be conservative (which is a value when it comes to money), creative (more people provide ideas and solutions), and steady (doesn't depend on one or two key personalities, like in Ethereum).

5. Good brand. When people refer to cryptocurrencies, they think Bitcoin first. Bitcoin is what is shown in most cases when cryptos are visualized (think magazine covers). Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has top of mind awareness. This is something that takes years to build, and very hard to overcome. For example, it doesn't matter if a better Cola came about Coca-Cola wouldn't be overthroned.

6. Lean and efficient architecture. Inspite of the huge number of transactions bitcoin processes for many years, the blockchain is still manageable compared to some other cryptos. At the same time Bitcoin allows for second layer solutions, that allow it to compete with more advanced cryptos adopting the best and proven ideas. For example segwit was tested on Litecoin first. RSK will allow determentistic contracts on Bitcoin like Ethereum has. Lightning Network will allow instantaneous, and confidential transactions, atomic swaps, etc., which will make it better than any other competing crypto at the moment.

7. Advanced infrastrcture. Bitcoin has a huge number of wallets, libraries, third party services, hardware solutions supporting the network. Other cryptos have some of it, but not all like Bitcoin. For example most BTMs only do Bitcoin. There are like a dozen BTC wallets for iOS in the App Store serviing various user needs, compared to ~2 LTC wallet including the multi-currency wallet (Jaxx).

8. The primary player will create even more acceptance and advantage over time, because when a company needs to integrate a crypto currency, they will choose the most important one to start with before moving on to other cryptos. On the other hand it also lays down the path for easier adoption for other cryptos.",2017-10-09 07:27:36

do5vtp3,mmmmurphy,70,"Amateur and brief, but answered a newer guy’s question on another sub about the forks the market was reacting to, and thought the some of the info might be useful to some here (at least some of the bitcoin gold info):

Two ""forks"" coming up. One (Bitcoin Gold) currently scheduled for 10/25 and second (Segwit 2x) in November.  There is much drama over both of these forks and I'll leave it to you to search the appropriate subs should you want to learn more.  But currently most of the drama and how it's relating to demand for bitcoin currently comes down to a few things:
* As much drama as there is about the both of these forks, the FOMO seems to be far greater
* There was hesitancy about the ramifications, both immediate and longer term, with the bitcoin cash fork.  This went far better than many planned and therefore there is a confidence this time that free money is free money and the actual bitcoin price will continue up as before.  This is one of the primary FOMO contributors.
*The drama around both forks is very different, but due to the timing and other factors, both will have a combined effect on the market--as we are already seeing, as no one believes the FOMO is for the November fork that has been announced/planned/seeks consensus from the community, but also no one believes that anyone cares enough about bitcoin gold (the first fork) to be causing the spike in demand and selling of alts.  
* Most of this latter sentiment comes from some very shady looking business dealings-i.e. their old, now taken down website stated they were going to start premining 200k coin on x block.  X block took place days/weeks ago, so everyone thinks that not only do they already have mining underway, but that the ""snapshot"" that's taken place for the airdrop of bitcoin gold has already happened.
* The drama for the second fork is much more political and difficult to explain, but unlike bitcoin gold, is already being future traded at at least one exchange, effectively allowing people to ""split"" their coins now. 
* In short, the second fork has much more acceptance but also far more possible affects to bitcoin itself than the first fork for a coin that people are already calling a scam.  But both sound like free money, hence a lot of FOMO

FWIW-I spent some time on bitcoin gold's slack channel this evening and h4x3rotab, who is their main spokesperson and I'm told one of the founders, did field direct questions about the main concerns. He said the website is down because they are updating and have ran into technical issues.  When the site is back up it will have their updated plan and roadmap.  He says Oct. 25 is still the day that they will snapshot your bitcoin address to find out how much you own in order to airdrop at 1:1.  He said they bumped out the block to start mining and as of now have yet to start, and that this is provable by downloading their software and trying to mine with it-it won't work yet.  It sounded like they plan on premining a yet to be determined amount of coins (supposedly to be released on said website) to be made available via some type of time release mechanism for development.  He also insisted that reply protection (not in the current build) was necessary even if it meant bumping the live date to make sure it was stable.

My personal take is, how the f do you launch a bitcoin fork in two weeks and you're having ""technical"" issues with your website?!? I mean that sounds like what we used to say to angel investors while grinding startups in the 90s--and that was when putting up a website actually took some work.  And a vague system of time releasing coins for development sounds like the definition of owner controlled capital...  

It will be very interesting to see how it all pans out, but with the seemingly ironic timing of hitting a new ATH, Chinese FUD mostly over (atm), the general mass appeal of bitcoin getting higher each day, more bigger players entering, and two forks coming up--I think that's &gt;50% of the market moves over the last few days.

So I'm going to address some of his points about Bitcoin Cash, the history of this idea and how it got implemented.

Yes, I'm anonymous, but the vast majority of the rest of Bitcoin Cash developers are not. It's success certainly did not and does not stand or fall by my anonymity.

I would still encourage more developers to participate, anonymously if they want, in Bitcoin development.

&gt; fttrader (sic), who is probably the first person to push for a unilateral large block fork of bitcoin

Ok, good that he used 'probably', because I'm certainly not the first, I just got involved due to my own frustration following the scaling debate.

I guess 'unilateral' is a bit strong, as that was not the original intention.
By the time it got to the point where a fork seemed desirable with or without miner support, I was certainly not alone anymore.

&gt; refused to operate under his real name, which significantly hindered the perception and support of his project

Perhaps. But I think most people understood why I had that need, seeing how Core operated (and still do) against those they deem their 'enemies'.
Of course trying to fork away from them immediately constitutes an 'attack' in their eyes. That is simply how they roll(ed?).

The proposition of the 'unilateral' fork, as Steve calls it, was never to deviate from Bitcoin's principles of open source and open development during its construction and deployment. And we got that right. BTCfork was an open effort that attracted a lot of minds, hashed out good ideas, dismissed some bad ones and got people thinking deeper about the real issues around forking. This was all before ""spoonnet"", but you won't find any of it mentioned in Core's silly attempts to rewrite history.

Anyhow, from early on we knew a spinoff would need the support of existing miners. Unless we changed the POW which most people didn't want to do as a first resort, because it's not broken.

Sadly, the hashpower support was simply not there 2 years ago. Miners hated the thought of splitting the currency, and they still had faith in Core.

Enough faith to railroad Classic, the best change until then, through the HK agreement and subsequent ""sticking to it"" despite the fact that Core plainly violated it, in multiple ways, and it was never recognized as much of a binding agreement by most of the community.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Unlimited arose organically from long time bitcoiners and big blockers, and stood a very reasonable chance at a majority fork. I shifted my development effort to contribute to it, and said so publicly.

It is true that this delayed BTCfork's further attempts at a minority fork.
The reasoning was plain though - why push for a more difficult and disruptive minority fork when it looks like miner support may be finally shifting towards a more sensible solution.

Unfortunately, BU failed to cross the threshold to becoming a viable majority fork. There was some of its own doing in that, and plenty of nasty help from its detractors.

Ultimately I think it prepared us (Bitcoin Cash) to face the realities of a fork away from Core. It also led to recognizing the important of client diversity, and the need to strengthen the 'big block network' with an implementation based closely on Core.

That's how Adjustable Blocksize Cap (ABC) came about through the efforts of Amaury, who had the good foresight to get rid of SegWit and RBF.
At that point, there wasn't really any intention of turning ABC into a minority fork client.

UASF triggered that reaction. UASF was conceived as a hail-mary attempt to push SegWit onto the miners and the rest of the network.
Big blockers (incl. miners) had enough, and decided to do a minority fork to eliminate the risk of wipeout posed by UASF. 
That's how the UAHF concept was born, and Bitcoin ABC turned from a majority fork client into a minority fork client.

The criticism that Bitcoin Cash has its blocks limited to 8MB is mistaken.

In reality, miners and their nodes could upgrade the network to 16MB, and most nodes would have no problem adapting rapidly (BUcash nodes already support 16MB by default, ABC nodes would need to adjust thei 8MB defaults to  16MB through user config parameter).

Somehow, I think Steve got the impression we're stuck at 8MB. We're not.

Concerns around the EDA are valid, and I wasn't extremely comfortable with the late decision, but arguing for a more complex algorithm at that stage would have been fruitless and caused Bitcoin Cash to miss the hard Aug 1 deadline.

As far as I'm concerned, EDA did it's job, but has outlived most of its usefulness by now, and I'm glad that replacements are being discussed and investigated. I urge everyone to get involved more by participating on the bitcoin-ml mailing list.

The decisions on the name 'Bitcoin Cash' were made by those who participated in full recognition that it would be a minority fork (altcoin) at least for the immediate future.

I think the community that supported big blocks realized that the outcome would be decided economically, and that this was not a short-term proposition.

I still believe it's a great name that expresses both its heritage and purpose, and can be worn proudly by all who decide to stand behind it.

Sometimes tough choices need to be made, and there will be those who disagree, even after you debate pros and cons and tried to find the path that most support. That's Bitcoin. We're all free to run what we want, or create it, or use other coins we think are better.

Tim smiled at his father, who beamed with pride at his artistic son.
"" I'll frame this masterpiece, and then we can hang it in your bedroom!""

Tim smiled still, because that is all he could do. You see, Tim, his mother Sara, and his sister Caroline were all a smiley bunch; just how their father Jack had ordered them to be. Jack was 43 when he decided to give up looking for a suitable wife at the local strip joint. He was a tired of being single, lonely, and unable to contribute his share of  family drama at work. He downloaded tor and went on a search for the perfect family, one that was everything he dreamed of. After poking around on forums and spending many a day chatting with other frustrated singles who shared dreams like his, he was directed to an Egyptian man who was said to fulfill such wishes. Jack and the man spent several weeks talking  when they finally reached a deal. For 6.5 bitcoin, the Egyptian man would make Jack's fantasy a reality. 
 
2 months and 3 days later, Jack received his family. He removed them from their boxes and stood back in awe. They were more beautiful than he had imagined.He ran his fingers over their glassy eyes, caressed their soft hair, and gave them each a gentle kiss. His presented his wife with a ring he designed just for her. 
Finally, he had a family. 
He sat them all on the couch and then proceeded to make popcorn and drinks.
""Family movie night!"" Jack hollered in excitement. 
He rested his wife next him and sat his boy on his other side. Caroline sat by her mother, popcorn bowl on her lap. And the movie began. 
Jack would go on to tell his coworkers all about his new family. They were happy for him, and very supportive at first. But it all changed the day their company held a family day. Jack piled them into his sedan and sped off to work in excitement. He ran with his family through the doors of his workplace, ready to introduce them for the first time. He saw his friend Marcus and headed over to greet him. Marcus turned around, smiled and then let out an audible gasp. The whole room stared at Jack and his family in horror. 
Jack stood proudly with his family; three life-sized figures with human hands, faces, and hair sewed onto their cotton-stuffed bodies.

do7ejyh,WorldPeaceIsSoMetta,48,"Hey guys I just wanted to say it's been an interesting time for the Litecoin community. We're fresh off an all time high that already seems like it was years ago. We've been going through a really interesting time where, though we have yet to achieve mass adoption, we're gaining traction and attention. (When I say we I mean crypto in general)

Flash back a few months, everyone had visions of consistent 10%+ daily gains, and we had grown accustomed to several pieces of major positive news coming out per week. Times were so prosperous, that people were taking out loans against their home to buy more crypto.

That kind of behavior is what scares me. I work hard for my money. I understand that the money that ends up in my pocket is the end result of an infinitely complicated equation that factors in everything from my birth country, to my race, to my parents' education, and geopolitics past and present. 

In all my time, there has never been such thing as free money. If it existed, it would already be sucked up by now. Don't underestimate forces of human interest- most of us are lucky if even one person thinks about us during their daily decision making process. 

My point here being that the free ride was an illusion. It was the culmination of years of sideways movement, and countless hours of behind the scenes work and chance. The future growth of litecoin, and crypto in general, will continue to be just that- it will be plateaus and peaks- there will be growth and setbacks along the way.

If you believed in litecoin, or bitcoin, or any other coin for that matter, one month ago, and you no longer believe in it- I have one question. What changed to make you no longer believe in it? Did something occur in the real world to make it happen? Or did you just expect it would be easier and faster than this? I have a feeling we've gained a tolerance to profits, and that we've lacked appreciation for our gains. 

As investors, greed is our worst quality. Patience and vision serves us now more than ever.

The truth of the matter is that at least *some* miners would have supported the UASF, which means that without S2X, the other miners would have had to eventually capitulate as well.

You can fully expect that there are at least 3 mining pools who will be mining Core coin come this November. It is NOT in their financial best interests to do anything other than let the other signatories think they are still playing along, however.

One of their brilliant ideas was their masterplan to kill off Bitcoin by making sure all hashpower was being removed so that no new blocks would be produced and people would be forced to surrender and switch to their altcoin.

Many posts were actively trying to intimidate redditors by claiming that the Bitcoin chain would die as a result of 95% of miners switching to mine B2X.

These unsavory and hostile intimidation tactics showed their true colors. Apparently there were some people in their camp that were convinced trying to bully and scare Bitcoin users into switching to B2X would be a working alternative to consensual changes.

This conviction is both sad and laughable. To believe that bullying tactics would create any sustainable support is insane.

But the insanity doesn't stop there. Miners mine for a profit. They have huge bills to pay and mining an altcoin with less than half the value of Bitcoin will bankrupt them quickly. So it is not really a surprise to see that miners are starting to defect. Bitfinex shows that the market values B2X at only 20% of BTC. Given the lack of community support for B2X this is also hardly any surprise except perhaps for NYA signatories living in their reality distortion field.

This is the ***biggest*** misconception about crypto-currencies.

There is no barrier.

1 ""millibit"" (mBTC) is worth $5.

1 ""bit"" (uBTC) is worth $0.**00**5

You can buy any denomination and enjoy gains because profit is determined by ***percentage*** increase, no matter how much you put in.

Imagine 1 millibit going from $5 to $100? $1000?

Do you really think you're late to this?

**ELI5**: Bitcoin is internet money.  Bitcoin is made by special computers that solve hard math problems.  Anyone can use Bitcoin as long as they have a computer or a smartphone.  Bitcoin is stored on ""wallets"" which are just apps that store, send, and receive Bitcoin.  You can send Bitcoin to anyone in the world.  Bitcoin's price is determined by how many Bitcoin people have available to buy, and how much people are willing to pay for it.

**ELI15**: Bitcoin usually refers to both the store of value, a Bitcoin (which is like digital gold), and the network on which to spend it, the Bitcoin network (which is like the VISA payment network).  Bitcoin is ""mined"" by computers, and by ""mining"" bitcoin, they help make the network more secure.  Anyone can use Bitcoin, as long as they have a computer or a smartphone.  Bitcoin is stored in ""wallets"", usually a smartphone app.  In order to send bitcoin, you need to have Bitcoin to send.  There are a few ways to get Bitcoin: 

* go to an exchange and give them your local currency (dollars, euros, yuan, yen, rubles), they will then send you Bitcoin
* find someone locally that is willing to trade local currency for Bitcoin
* sell goods or provide a service for Bitcoin
* be a miner who has invested millions of dollars into mining and find a ""block"". (see ELI25)

Bitcoin uses technology similar to the technology you use to browse the Web to make sure it's secure.  Bitcoin's price is based on supply and demand, but Bitcoin is unique in that it's a **deflationary** currency.  There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, and right now, only about 16.5 million have been ""mined"".  Miners will also ""mine"" bitcoin at a predetermined rate for the next hundred years or so, then no new Bitcoin will be ""mined"".

**ELI25**: Bitcoin was the first mainstream cryptocurrency, which means ""a digitally secure store of value"".  Bitcoin introduced the concept of the Blockchain, which is like a public checkbook that includes a record of **everyone's** transactions.  If it isn't included ""on-chain"", then it never happened.  Bitcoin is also peer-to-peer (like BitTorrent), so anyone can use the network and you don't need a central server or authority to run it.  It runs itself.

Bitcoin is stored in ""wallets"", and is sent to ""addresses"".  Bitcoin uses Public Key Cryptography (just like the Web does) to secure itself.  You send bitcoin to someone's **public key** (which is usually just referred to as their address, which looks something like `13L7ffKU1ZbXqyUsunvV29PziVNKdtDAJY`), and they spend it by **signing** a transaction with their **private key**.  Not to fully explain Public Key Infrastructure, but with a **signed transaction** and the **public key**, both of which are very public on Bitcoin, anyone can verify that the transaction is valid and was signed with the **private key**, which is never revealed.  In order for a transaction to be included on the blockchain, it has to be valid which means: it was sent from an address with a balance, it is properly signed, and miners include it into a block.  Miners decide to include it in a block or not based on how big of a transaction fee you include in your transaction.  If you include a fee much higher than what everyone else is paying, miners have an incentive to prioritize your transaction.  If you include a low fee, miners might prioritize higher fee transactions over yours.

Bitcoin's **public ledger** (public checkbook) is called the blockchain.  It's called the blockchain because about every 10 minutes, a new ""block"" should be found by bitcoin miners, and added to the end of the longest chain.  The miners (which are usually thousands of expensive machines located near cheap sources of power and internet) are basically simple computers that perform a certain type of operation billions or trillions of times per second called ""hashing"".  When you ""hash"" data, it comes out completely changed, but in a repeatable way (if both you and your friend hash the same data, you should get the same output).  This is mostly used in the computer world to make sure files didn't get corrupted when being transferred on the internet, since if you run your copy of a file through a hashing function and compare it to your friend's, if it's the same you know that the files are identical.  Bitcoin miners take part of the previous block and try to find some data to add to it so the hash ends up looking special (like this: 00000000000000000008f720407416ee62c051e2dab8bc5b170343653e8479b9, which is the ""winning hash"" from the last block as of this writing).  Everyone who participates in Bitcoin agrees, if you find a unique enough hash, you get to make a new block to add to the chain.  Since the hash includes data from the last block, once you find a new block everyone starts the whole process over again.  When miners find a block, they get to claim a ""block reward"" (which is 12.5 BTC right now), plus they get to keep all of the ""transaction fees"" of each transaction they include in a block.  Once all of the Bitcoin is mined, miners will have an incentive to keep mining solely on transaction fees alone, but that won't happen for more than a hundred years.

Bitcoin's price fluctuates because supply and demand fluctuate.  Bitcoin's often compared to gold in this respect since there's a finite amount of it.  If I own 1 out of 21 million bitcoin, that means at most you could own 20,999,999 bitcoin, if everyone else wanted to sell you theirs.  But the truth is most Bitcoiners want to ""HODL"" (hold) their bitcoin, and only spend it as rarely as possible, since there will only ever be but so many.  Since a lot of people don't want to sell, the price goes up.  It keeps on going up because more and more bitcoin keep getting bought by people who won't want to sell.

(If you're still reading)
The most important part about Bitcoin, the thing that's most revolutionary is that with Bitcoin, you don't have to trust anyone to send money.  If you want to send money by the banking system today, all you need is an account number and a routing number and you can wire money in or out, but you need to *trust* the banks to do so.  An account with a Bank is also just an IOU from the bank for your money, whereas with Bitcoin you **own** your money.  **You don't need a bank to send it, and no one but you can spend it.**

Note, link below goes to cryptoart.com (commercial):

[21 Million Bitcoin Club](https://cryptoart.com/product/21-million-bitcoin-club/)

Inspiration:

The 21 Million Bitcoin Club-- the new class of wealthy elite that becomes increasingly more difficult to join.  By design, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. If you hold the private key to a whole bitcoin, you control something scarce. 

The basic purpose of money is to serve as a measuring tool (unit of account) that can be exchanged to keep track of stored value.   It seems strange to inflate its supply to disincentivize saving and even stranger for the supply to be set by the whims of a few individuals. Yet, modern fiat currencies are issued in this manner.  They push an agenda that conflates real consumer wants with macro economic needs.  In this context, Bitcoin's hard cap challenges the notion that a currency can't be deflationary and that issuance requires policy set by monetary authorities.

Two things are certain: if you hold wealth in fiat, you will grow poorer over time.  If you hodl wealth in cryptocurrencies, you have opted into financial self-sovereignty.

These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).

The one thing folks seem to think about the coin world, is that they're all private. They're all untraceable, and I think they say this because they in their mindset can't quite understand how it works. Things like blockexplorers, linking metadata, hacked apps, bloatware, websites, open wifi, etc. are even more of a stretch. Privacy? To most, it just means getting a  new credit/debit card every couple of months.

Recently I've even casually met bigtime/big-money attorneys, political advisors, criminal justice law folk, and had the chance to inquire gently about Bitcoin specifically. ALL of whom said they ""couldn't understand it,"" ""wiki'd it a few times, seems techy"" ""it's private, isn't it?."" Frankly they didn't seem interested in the potential benefits, seeing as their lives are held up by what they conceive of as a perfectly functional system. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" kinda thinking.

""Misinformation"" is information lensed / filtered through meme's. Right now, Bitcoin is a meme for advanced financial interactions.

It's because it's the most powerful meme! Also, it's quite well named.

doe6nz2,Chimpledus,130,"I first noticed my powers when I should have died from a fatal car crash. A stray steel shaft impaled me and crushed my innards. I needed a transplant of at least four organs. The doctors said I was beyond hope and was left in the ICU on life support for mercy’s sake because my heart wouldn’t stop beating yet.
Three days later, I woke up and looked around. I remembered dying, but now I felt fine. The doctors couldn’t believe it and declared my case a miracle. They stitched me up and performed tests on me. They took samples of my skin and muscle, and did a full x-ray on me. They found that my muscles would regenerate and my skin would not. Also I had somehow managed to grow an extra kidney from the fatal accident.
They told me I would be transferred to a more secure facility. I have seen enough X-Men to know the fate of a mutant. I would become a lab rat for the rest of my life, being tested on everyday ‘for the future of humanity’. Such a vague goal for a life of suffering and isolation.
I planned my escape. As I was transported into the hospital’s car park to go into an armored van, I made a run for it. They opened fire at me. First as warning shots, then disabling ones. But strangely enough, the pain I felt wasn’t as bad as I had imagined. I willed myself to keep on running and my body obeyed, even if it was shot in the thigh and shoulder. A bullet went into my back, but I managed to feel it clearly though uncomfortably. I kept running and I didn’t slow down. What was happening to me?
I went into hiding in the sewers, to lick my wounds. The wounds remained where they were, but they stopped hurting and the damage was gone except for the ruptures in my skin. My nervous system seemed to have deadened after the accident. My emotions also became stunted which made my mind very clear. These were convenient for what I planned to do next.
First things first, I created a home for myself in the sewers. The filth didn’t bother me as I seemed to be immune to infections. Then I stole all the medical supplies I could find. I tried to salvage my laptop computer at home but it was already confiscated by the government, and my roommate had also cleared out all of my belongings. This was when I decided to cut myself away from society. 
I performed experiments on myself. I removed bullets from my wounds and my organs would regenerate as soon as the knife exited it. In fact, I learned that I could influence its recovery. If I forced my mind to eliminate the pain, the wound would close more quickly. If I paid no attention to it, it would close in a day or two.
Next, I visited seedy internet cafes in disguise. I went into the dark web and searched for all the organ harvesting organizations I could find. I started by selling my extra kidney, self-operating with a scalpel I have stolen. Strangely enough, it regenerated. So I guess I had three kidneys now. Being a medical student, I examined the blood vessels and nervous system connected to it and found that it was still tangentially connected to the original one. The third kidney must have been created when it was sliced in two during. So I could technically create new organs with my powers.
Within 3 months, I made a fortune. I dropped off my organs in foam boxes covered in ice at the designated areas, and the organizations sent me hundreds of bitcoin. Untraceable. Convenient. Heart was the most expensive organ, but it was also the most risky. I had to force myself to create a new heart before losing consciousness.
I grew to like the pain. Hidden underground, surfing in the rotten underbelly of the web, scurrying around dingy neighborhoods to drop off my ‘shipments’, I have…changed. How long had it been? A year? My old life was a memory; weak and fearful. Now I am strangely free, and rich. I began to question why I still sold my organs. I had millions of dollars in my bitcoin wallet. The next question was what I should do with it?
I began to perform more extreme experimentation on myself and found out the following. If my organ was injured, I could regenerate *more* cells into it to enlarge the organ. If I cut my lung cleanly in half, I could create an extra one that increased my ability to hold my breath. I became intrigued.
Deep in the dark web, I contacted the transhumanist doctors who had lost their medical licenses. I contacted geneticists who had performed unethical experimentation on gene splicing. I contacted underground dealers of medical equipment who shipped prototypes to billionaire dictators in Africa. Finally, I hired mercenaries to keep them all in line.
We moved to an abandoned warehouse and turned it into a laboratory. I let the amoral geniuses run wild with curiosity as I obliged to their every request. Once insatiable in their intellectual pursuit, I gave them only one goal: Improve me. They named the project ‘Humanity 2.0’. After all the planning was done, we raised funds for the project. The doctors managed to harvest my organs more quickly than ever before and we made a million dollars every month. But it was at this point that my sanity became fractured. Even with my dulled senses, being in a tank with attendants chopping up parts of my innards was a fate beyond reckoning.
I became aware of what I had become. More monster than man. I cursed my existence. I was a victim, I didn’t choose this fate. I blamed whoever brought me to this state. Then I remembered. The government. They had turned me into a hunted freak. They made me desperate enough to set down this long road of no return. With vengeance burning hot in my fevered brain, I hired the last member of my team. An anti-government terrorist leader. His only task: Use me.
When Humanity 2.0 went into full swing, I could no longer think from the pain of the transformation. Not that I complained, mind you, but it was hard to be rational when pain was such an overbearing power. That was when the terrorist took control and we all became his tools. Again, I didn’t mind that. Every day, he would come to me in the solace of my tank and preach me everything the evil government had done. I was one of the many that had been screwed over by its corrupting influence. It was right of me to hate them. It was my moral duty to destroy them. I became fueled with such hate I didn’t know was within me. It felt good though. It went very well with the pain.
I didn’t know how long I spent in my tank with my organs splayed and floating all around me. But on the day I was released, I landed on limbs that no longer felt like my own. I stood up and found that I had four legs, stronger and more powerful than my own. I breathed in and felt air filling my every cavity, becoming as light as a bird. An instinctive flex and I found myself flying on wings sprouted from my back. I darted around the cramped warehouse and burst out of the confinement, tearing the ceiling as easily as cardboard, for I no longer had hands, but claws. I wheeled through the night sky, barely feeling any wind on my grafted skin. So I soared as fast as I could for as long as I could, somersaulting and diving through the air. When I returned to the warehouse and landed on my feet, I wasn’t tired at all. I felt my four altered hearts beating gently within my fused ribcage.
I gazed down at my assembled team and basked in their fear. The terrorist fired at me with his shotgun until he ran out of bullets. It hurt, but nothing compared to ascension into godhood. I laughed as my wounds regenerated and splattered him against the warehouse wall.

doed46x,xFreeZeex,118,"There are currently so many different cryptocurrencies because they serve different purposes and/or want to improve problems of other cryptocurrencies. Comparing Bitcoin to Ether (the currency is called Ether, the network is called Ethereum) is kind of difficult because they are supposed to serve different purposes. 

Bitcoin is a currency that *should* enable you to quickly and easily send transactions for low fees and without the need for a centralized party like a bank (now that this all is not working so well is obvious if one is kind of aware of the bitcoin community, there are disputes all the time about how to solve some problems like high tx fees or the time it takes to verify a transaction, that is why there was a hardfork some time back which left you with two versions of Bitcoin, the other one being called Bitcoin Cash, there will also be another hardfork comming at the end of the month. Also there are other currencies that essentially try to do what Bitcoin does but better, like Litecoin or Vertcoin but that is another topic).

Ether is also a currency, but it is not really intended that you should buy your coffee with it. The Ethereum Network is a platform based on the blockchain that lets developers build decentralized applications and write smart contracts. Smart contracts are just like real contracts, just that they are not only signed but programmed so that you also do not need a centralized party to enforce the rule of the smart contract. If A and B have a smart contract where A says that he will pay B 1 Ether if Spain wins the World Cup in 2018, B doesn't have to hope that A doesn't scam him, the money will be sent automatically if Spain wins. The money in play with Smart contracts, or how you pay when using decentralized applications (for example there are decentralized gambling services) in the case of Ethereum is payed in Ether. The currency is made to function in the Ethereum network. 

Now why some people are writing stuff like ""Ethereum or gtfo"" is because at the moment, transactions made with Ether usually go through faster and have much lower transaction fees. Cryptocurrencies are an interesting subject, if you'd like to read more I suggest to checkout /r/cryptocurrencies

Up until this point that was the case. If bitcoin is falling it is too risky to invest in. If its rising its too expensive.

However this is the first time in bitcoins short history that a sharp rise has lasted more than a few weeks. This rise has been ongoing for atleast 6 months. Which IMO gives these people the confidence that it may not crash this time, plus the time to learn how t buy and store it. 

This may very well be the begining of a 2 year bull run in bitcoin. Taking us well into the mania phase. We might see prices previously unimaginable within the next 24 months.

So if Wikileaks bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin on October 14th, 2010, they would have got 10,000 bitcoin, which would now be worth $56 million.  

I realize that you have based your sum off the percentage quoted by Julian, so your point is correct, but my calculation isn't based on Julian's percentage figure. I've just gone off what bitcoin was worth in 2010, and as I say, on October 14th, 2010, one bitcoin was worth $0.1.  

Julian's tweets says they first got into bitcoin in 2010. He doesn't say when specifically in 2010, so they could have bought at any price between $0.003 and $0.36. So depending on when they invested, based on the highest and lowest exchange rates for bitcoin during 2010, Wikileaks would now own between $15 million and $1.866 billion, based on an initial investment of $1,000.

My thoughts on the subject revolve around security and risk.  Bitcoin has been around for almost 9 years, surviving attacks and getting a lot of eyes on the code.  Monero is a new codebase and only has about 3.5 years under it's belt. There have been a couple security issues addressed that could have had significant impact if they had not been addressed.  Keeping the market cap down allows additional time to review the code base for bugs and weaknesses and minimize attack vectors before the coin becomes an attractive target.  Now if you buy and use it, this minimizes your time exposure to risk while helping expand the ecosystem.  If you want to buy and hold for speculative reasons, make sure you understand the risks.

&gt; A centralized network may have to charge a 2x% fee to meet their higher operating costs. All else being equal, which network will a consumer use for a transaction? The answer is the cheaper one, every time.

In my mind, the value of the token will dependent on 2 things and 2 things only: 1) The amount of $ transactions the network generates 2) the transaction fee that will be transformed into staking reward.

You rightly say that the OMG network can probably deliver a much cheaper transaction fee to McDonalds than any other provider. Which is awesome for the potential of the OMG blockchain. But if lot's of transactions are done with a very small fee, the question still remains: what will be the actual staking reward per token in the end?

The OMG token has to have value in order for stakers to remain honest. But at this point I don't see why it would matter if you could buy 1 OMG token for 50$ with a yearly reward of 5$ or buy 1 OMG token for 5$ with a yearly staking reward of 0.50$. (Obviously these are pretty random numbers just to make the point).

I ask myself, what is ""moon""? Is it a high token value? Or is it the transformation of the transaction model and high OMG network usage? I am honestly not sure what price is justified right now and that worries me. Am I willing to buy a token worth 10$ if the staking reward is only 0.50$ per year (5%), taking into account this is still a very risky investment? I don't know. I just don't know right now. Am I willing to pay 5$ per token if the staking reward is 0.50$ yearly? Maybe. It's still a very risky investment and I have ti account for that in the price. Am I willing to pay 20$ for a token if the staking reward is still 0.50$ yearly? I don't think so.

With most calculations I have done and have seen given by other people 0.50$ per year seems about fair in the beginning. I just have to face the fact that the token price will be completely dependent on the staking reward in the future, since that is the only thing the token will be used for (whitepaper). All your points awesome, I love OMG and I can;t wait to buy a cocktail in thailand with my $ or bitcoin without having to do a conversion first. But all those points at the same time mean very little for price it seems to me. All that I can see to matter for the price of OMG token is staking reward, staking reward, staking reward.

docya2s,Youareaharrywizard,52,"""Installation complete"".

I stared almost nonchalantly at the words. Of course, I made the assumption that this was some kind of malware, a consequence of countless porn fueled nights instead of making worthwhile use of my time. I got ready to pull up my antiviral software, when my computer froze. Not again. I regretted buying this piece of shit. Over the last month it would intermittently restart. It was used, of course I should've expected this from a Craigslist buy. The owner told me it was a sleeper, a computer that looked like it couldn't do much, but was quite a workhorse underneath. I bought it, literally.

It turned off, then restarted. Typical after an installation. But instead of the start screen, another menu popped up, with a bunch of random names for me to pick... I recognized my OS from the list, Windows 10, the current standard. Underneath was CoVert, Lion, Horizon, Agency, Marquet, BitMine. A lot of different Operating systems. Maybe the previous owner was a Linux buff. I should've asked. Curiously, I picked Horizon.

The OS was a simple knock off of the old Windows XP from my childhood days. There was no fancy work here. It was oddly silent, no system sounds were present. There were a few programs, named Hong Kong, America, EU, South Korea, Japan. I clicked on America, naturally.

A list of companies in alphabetical order popped up. I recognized a lot, but others were obscure. Amazon, I knew. Pfizer? What was that? I clicked Amazon. A list of names came up. I clicked on the first one I saw. I got an error message. I wasn't connected to the internet! I looked in the tray and my wifi card had been disabled. I removed the Ethernet cable from my Xbox and put it into my desktop. Immediately I was connected. I clicked again on the names and suddenly, a list of associated emails popped up. Hmm, I could email these big shots whenever I wanted, I thought to myself. What would I need an OS for that? I clicked on his Gmail. A new window popped up. I wasn't sending him an email... I was IN his email. I made an audible gasp as I realized that I was up to some illegal shit, and I need to watch where I step carefully. I looked only over emails that had already been read. A lot of it had to do with some merger that was occurring? I just say on that knowledge for a second. I googled it, nothing came up. Wasn't this insider trading? Was that the purpose of this program? To garner information to be ahead of the stock market? Should I buy up some Amazon stocks? 

I should look into it later, I thought to myself. I kind of wanted to check out the other OS's.

I restarted, and clicked on CoVert. More email servers, a quick googling of names gave me a broad horizon of foreign diplomats. Scary stuff. A heavy realization occurred to me, that I could find the secrets of people in power. I wanted to throw up. Who made this computer? Was it for doing good? Or was it for personal gain? There were ways to make quick and easy money, there were ways to blackmail politicians. And there were ways to bring down bad people with news of their deeds.

I turned to another OS, BitMine. This connected me to another PC somewhere else apparently, one that could perform a lot more work I was assuming. Bitmining was something I was aware of, and it took a dedicated computer with a lot of hardware, and a lot of time, to get even 1 Bitcoin.

The other computer I was connected to must've been ginormous, maybe an entire server? Nothing gave away whether it was, except the huge amount of storage for data that was available to me. A small square program came up. It said start. I clicked start. Mining started, you can now turn off this program.


It never occurred to me with a server that big, there were people out there who were watching, who were maintaining the servers just in case.

Unbeknownst to me, they were already watching me.",2017-10-15 00:34:37
dodyfg1,NLNico,51,"Embarrassing that's it's just the CEOs of these companies that don't seem to understand that this isn't about increasing the blocksize, but about setting a bad precedent.

They made an ""agreement"" in private (rather than suggesting a ""proposal/plan"" for the rest of the community.) They did nothing to convince us why their plan is the best. They completely ignored the technical community. They are trying to force their hardfork upon everyone by not adding strong replay protection. And now that more and more users/businesses are speaking up against it, they just arrogantly say ""***We, The CEOs, represent millions of users and therefor decide what bitcoin is and what changes are made.***""

Bitcoin is decentralized money for the people and controlled by the people. Changes, especially non-backward compatible controversial ones, should be difficult to make and require ""everyone"" (users, businesses, developers, miners, etc) to agree on it. This isn't easy and that is a good thing, because it shows potential bad actors (governments, banks, etc) cannot force changes upon bitcoin either. Measuring the consensus for changes isn't an easy/clear process. But I believe we are seeing it *right now*, with people/devs/businesses standing up against the 2x HF, clearly showing that there isn't consensus for this change.

I do believe that SW2x and these CEOs *did* have good intentions with their agreement. But it isn't how bitcoin works. Bitcoin cannot be controlled by a few CEOs. And the more they are attempting to force this change, the more resistance there will be. It isn't too late to cancel it though. Maybe instead of trying to generate a mess (which is guaranteed at this point), they should focus on putting some resources into a proper future hardfork.

14 days ago I made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/waltonchain/comments/73j7z4/waltonchain_first_ama_questions_answers/dnqtzhk/) about there being 574 Waltonaires eligible to run a masternode with 5,000 or more tokens listed on Etherscan. 

Last week there were an additional 78 Waltonaires for a total of 652. I also noticed there are a total of 6,506 Waltonite token holders listed on Etherscan. 

This week there are a total of 698 Waltonaires, and a total of 6,941 Waltonite token holders. Definitely some healthy growing there. Obviously there's some that keep it on the exchange, so this isn't the whole picture. 

I was checking out some of the addresses in the top 50 and I didn't see any whales selling anything significant, most were just holding. There was some significant pickups by a few whales though this week.

**TLDR:** This was the email what Satoshi used. The email was not spoofed and the authenticity of this email has never been debunked. Bear in mind: **not disproved ≠ proved.**  

**Sources:** You can find comprehensive references of my claims in the blog post: [Not all post 2011 Satoshi appearance has been debunked](https://keepingstock.net/not-all-post-2011-satoshi-appearance-has-been-debunked-fab9a5c23812).  

**Personal opinion:** Regardless if this email came from Satoshi or not, the content is instructive and it ages well.  

**Context:** In the August of 2015 someone sent this email to the dev mailing list from satoshi@vistomail.com as a response to Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn's Bitcoin XT fork attempt. This attempt also was accompanied by a [vote manipulation attack on /r/Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-closer-look-at-reddit-vote-manipulation-about-bitcoin-1458682699/). This resulted in a persecution of Core developers by this sub. Kinda like what you see today at
/r/btc, which did not exist at the time.  

&gt; He used satoshin@gmx.com (from original Bitcoin whitepaper) and satoshi@vistomail.com (from email logs). gmx.com is a free email service that may or may not have had location based restrictions on registration at the time. vistomail.com is an email service from anonymousspeech, the domain registrar proxy he used to register bitcoin.org.  

&gt; You can safely conclude the email did originate from vistomail.com servers and was not spoofed.  

**FAQ 1: But Craig Wright used this email address, right?**  
No. Interesting sidenote on the Craig Wright saga: he used satoshin@vistomail.com to deceive us, not the real satoshi@vistomail.com.  

**FAQ 2: But this email had been hacked, right?**  
No. satoshin@gmx.com was hacked, more specifically re-registered after it expired.

I've put some bitcoins aside for my friend (46€ already worth 61€) and sister (100€ already worth 117€) a few days ago, but I've decided not to tell them. If all goes well, they'll get a really nice gift in 5 or 10 years. 

I tried to convince my friends to buy a few bitcoins in 2012 and again in 2014, but no one ever showed any interest. I've never been a bitcoin evangelist, I just wanted them to get the same opportunity I did.

The only people who showed any interest were my father and my doctor. My father bought 21 bitcoins for 2000€, but he got scared and sold them a few months later for what he paid. I talked about bitcoin to my doctor when he told me that he had lost 30,000€ on a solar energy investment because the solar panels hadn't been installed before a deadline. Hopefully he bought some as the price quadrupled since our conversation.

I won't try to convince anyone anymore. It's their loss. ",2017-10-16 04:01:55

doerxko,navtechservers,47,"It is hard to value a product on ideas. I hold NAV Coin for over a year now and believe it is still very undervalued. However, real value comes from finished products. NAV Coin in it's current state might not be too different for outsiders than other projects. Fast transactions, anonymous transactions, based on Bitcoin, Proof of Stake.... so what makes it different?

NAV Coin is around since 2014 and the developers have shown since then to deliver what they plan. They do not work with dates for deadlines since they are very hard to estimate on a roadmap. It is done, when it is done. The no nonsense mentality is what got me in to the project. Some might argue marketing is missing but I rather have development speak for itself. 

Projects in development currently:

- NavPay: a light wallet for Android, iOS (if Apple approves), desktop and webwallet. It is based on copay and support NAV Coins anonymous transactions by simply checking a box.

- Polymorph: Anonymous exchanging service using Changelly. Every coin supported by Changelly can be send anonymous by using NAV Coins anonymous system, NavTech. This will create volume for NAV and a use case. NavTech uses double blockchain with RSA encryption. For example: 

&gt; BTC - NAV - NAV - BTC (two times NAV because of how the double blockchain works)

&gt; BTC - NAV - NAV - ETH

&gt; ETH - NAV - NAV - Vertcoin

- Community Fund: This week a vote will be held for a community fund. Stakers will vote for a change of the system. Currently stakers receive up to 5% annually. If agreed stake reward will go to 4% and every block 0.25 NAV goes into a decentralized fund. Here a fast infographic I made: https://i.imgur.com/N0LwIbJ.png. Stakers will be in control of the fund. It is fully decentralized and no central power can touch the fund. 

- ADapps: Anonymous Dapps...

- Growing Team: This month 1 full time and one part time marketing employee start working with the core team. They are also actively recruiting new developers (for now in NZ where the team is located!)

dof4nqq,bitcoinism,44,"Firstly, unless 300k is something you can afford to lose, and something you are prepared to lose, this is an utterly ridiculous idea. No offence but your statements that you expect bitcoin to be at that price in 12 months time shows you must be really new to bitcoin. Bitcoin is a super high risk investment and we could easily enter another bear market for 12 months just as easy as we could see 10k. 

If you have 300k available in your portfolio for a super high risk investment then go to an exchange. I reccomend Bitstamp. Open an account, verify your ID, then before you wire in $300k mail then and explain you're about to send them a very large amount of money and you want to know what you might need to be aware of. Should you send them proof of the origin of funds? Would they like a statement from a law firm, I have no idea since I've always bought peer to peer for less than 10k at a time. A much better idea would be to wire in a smaller amount each week, purchase coins then withdraw them to a wallet you control (trezor or ledger would be my choice). This averages your buy price, and it also limits your exposure to assets being frozen because you inadvertently triggered their suspicious activity detecting processes, which might take some while to prove that you have a legitimate source for all those funds.

Seriously, if you couldn't face seeing that money turned to 100k inside 2 months don't even consider it. Bitcoin is too new, too wild, and too unpredictable. ",2017-10-16 08:28:15

dof80ak,Gregonomics,41,"&gt;Hi guys So I only just recently discovered this subreddit. r/bitcoin seem to be the bigger subreddit and frankly more popular by reddit users.

That is because once upon a time we all co-existed peacefully on r/bitcoin - all helping build the sub to make it a great place for Bitcoin debate and information. One day the owner theymos disagreed with the majority of users and declared it his sub, his rules. He begun to censor posts not in accordance with his views. Today this censorship is even more organized, and carried out by the entire modteam - even the automoderator flag words associated with the opposing side. 

Bitcoin Core devs still directly or indirectly support the censorship just by using r/bitcoin. They are being opportunistic instead of showing integrity. If they just had been half as fierce in opposing the censorship as they have been in the block size debate, we'd still have one free and open place to discuss Bitcoin.

When redditors search for Bitcoin, r/bitcoin is the number one hit, and r/btc is not even among the top 3. Hence, the vast majority of new Bitcoin users land on r/bitcoin. They basically get indoctrinated  right from the get-go. It's like if a person searching for a religion was beamed right into the church of scientology.

r/btc has been fighting an uphill battle for an open and censorship free debate. New users keep flooding in on r/bitcoin every day though.

If anyone is lacking background information, the last major Dark Net Market was called Alphabay.

This is possible because the Bitcoin blockchain is public and transparent.

When the Alphabay founder was caught, the US government seized known quantities of Bitcoin, Dash and ZCash, but, according to the government affidavit ""An unknown quantity of Monero"", suggesting that the privacy protections of Monero had withstood close government scrutiny.

On that basis, it was inevitable that any subsequent Dark Net Market was going to use Monero exclusively. It is also apparent that the US government would have anticipated this, and would now be directing all its energy into ""unlocking"" Monero and catching the new operators of this market.

dohnoiw,RedAtWork92,67,"&gt;Is this a feature that allows me to increase the fee for the transaction I've already broadcasted? 

Correct.

&gt;How can this help me to do double spend easier?

It breaks 0 confirmation transactions. Before it was very reasonable to accept a small value transaction even before it was included in a block because the underlying software treated the first transaction as the valid one. Therefore if a shop owner (like a coffee shop) saw a transaction they could feel very safe letting the buying walk away.

With RBF (Replace by fee) **which people protested being introduced into the code**. You could now rebroadcast your transaction with a higher fee and the underlying software would treat the one *with the highest fee* as the correct transaction. 

This means that it is trivial to walk out of the shop, rebroadcast your transaction with a higher fee and redirect the funds back into your wallet. (Robbing the shop). 

The outrage this caused in the community lead to Bitcoin Cash being branded as ""Coffee Coin""... which is meant as an insult but **is actually a feature that BTC does not have.** *You can't use it for shopping without block confirmation for this reason, effectively breaking Bitcoin of its original purpose, to be used as electronic cash*.

This is why **Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin**. It gets rid of RBF bringing *usability* back to the currency hence ""Cash"" in its name.

This is why the core devs have ""Re-branded"" Bitcoin as a ""store of value"" instead of a currency... They purposely borked its ability to be used as a currency...

If you spend every cent you have on bitcoin you can't buy when the price crashes and you'll have to time the market or sell while the price goes up (make less profit otherwise). Plus you'd be staring at the prices every other hour worried about a 10% dip. That's stressful",2017-10-18 11:37:01

He said he buys gift cards with bitcoin and lives off that. I don't know how that makes sense since I was charging him 4% above market rate for the bitcoins.

* A prostitute, who bought a tiny amount, and she paid me with a $20 bill that she pulls out of her cleavage. This was around that time backpage.com only took bitcoins, so I assume it was so she paid for ads with it. I actually got a few hos during that time.

* 2 different people told me they buried money in their backyards. One was a disabled vet, and the other was just an old guy that did electrician work on the side for cash and didn't want to report it as income.

* One was this paranoid guy that for some reason trusted me and invited me to his house. He was a nice guy and we chatted for hours. His mom died that year, and he got her house as inheritance. He got like $500k for it, and he said after he deposited the escrow check, he went to the bank and withdrew $300k of cash. It took them a week to get the cash but they did it. He had it in a safe in the other room. I don't know if any of that was true, but if he was lying to me, he was a good storyteller. :)

* An early adopter that had bought many years ago and was sitting on $400k worth.

* One guy wanted to buy $50k a month, I had to decline since I'm not that big of a player! The guy looked mafia.

* One guy had me meet him at a resturant parking lot, he messages me ""There's a black Mercades, I'll pop the trunk remotely, inside is a paper bag with the money. Take the money and send the bitcoins to ______"". I was so amused by it, that I actually did it, I mean they're the one taking the risk! The same guy had me meet him at a massage parlor with lots of Asian girls there, and he had one of the girls hand me the money. They later ripped me off and got me to send some bitcoins and I would meet them later. But I just let it go, I'm not gangsta enough to mess with what might be some kind of mafia shit!

* I've sold bitcoins to 3 different people that were hit by ransomware. I can always tell those when they specifically want a certain amount of bitcoins, and not just $100 worth. When I find out it's for ransomware I sell to them at cost.


That's all I can think of that doesn't immediately reveal where or who I am, or betray the privacy of anyone specific that's well known in the Bitcoin world. I tried my best to not share anything that identifies anyone.

dojkhf7,pjkbmd,230,"While the speculative nature of cryptocutrencies cannot be denied, there are some major things about crypto and blockchain that are consistently disscued that are just plain wrong.

Blockchain without the coin: This doesn't work. To say you want to use the blockchain tech without the underlying coin, for example bitcoin, doesn't make any sense. The blockchain is just a database with cryptography. We already have cryptographic databases. The only reason the crypto blockchains are secure and immutable is because there is economic incentive for parties to do proof of work and expend a lot of electricity to in the hopes of getting a reward in the form of a digital token. This work makes it so that someone cannot monkey with the blockchain without incurring serious monetary penalties. If you take away the token, there is no incentive to secure the blockchain.

Increasing supply: while there are lots of new tokens being created to capitalize on this speculative market, but it doesn't affect the supply of already existing blockchain tokens. There is a limited supply of bitcoin that will ever exist, 21 million. It's not like someone could just rewrite the code later on and change the supply. It's hardwired into the system. In addition, I think almost 80% of bitcoins have already been mined, so the supply production is going to level off. ",2017-10-19 00:51:00

dok7pr0,Mr_Yukon_C,95,"&gt; One of the year’s biggest initial coin offerings, a $232 million token sale by Tezos, is embroiled in a management fight that is threatening the deal and highlighting the risks in this red-hot corner of finance.
&gt; 
&gt; Tezos’s fundraising in July at that point was the largest initial coin offering, a new type of rapid fundraising that has captured imaginations and rivaled venture capital for technology startups.
&gt; 
&gt; But a battle between the founders of the company and the head of the Swiss foundation they installed to give it more independence has put most trading of Tezos coins on ice, possibly until early next year.
&gt; 
&gt; That could alarm investors who were hoping that Tezos might catch on quickly. Sales of digital tokens like Tezos coins have concerned regulators and become a sign for some investors of a bubble in the cryptocurrency world.
&gt; 
&gt; The costly battle at the company will be an early test for the coin market, which has raised $2.3 billion this year, about seven times the amount raised in all years before 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; The money has poured in due to enthusiasm for virtual currencies such as bitcoin and open-ledger “blockchain” technologies that are often tied to the offerings. The largely unregulated coin offerings in turn have helped push the value of bitcoin and some other virtual currencies to record highs.
&gt; 
&gt; But the Tezos deal highlights some of the drawbacks of initial coin offerings, also known as ICO ’s : untested management, opaque structures and little transparency into what anyone involved wants to do with the huge sums they are raising.
&gt; 
&gt; The fight at Tezos is between the husband-and-wife team that started the deal and the founder of the nonprofit foundation they tapped to control the project.
&gt; 
&gt; “There’s a lot to regret here,” says Kathleen Breitman in an interview this week. She and her husband, Arthur, run the primary company developing Tezos, which wants to improve blockchain ledger technology through software. “We made a lot of mistakes. The best I can do is put my head down and work on the code.”
&gt; 
&gt; A lawyer representing the Breitmans on Sunday sent a nine-page letter to the foundation’s board, demanding that its founder and president, Johann Gervers be removed, or they would withdraw their support from the project.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Gevers couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; He has alleged the Breitmans’ involvement in his work “was incompatible with the needed independence of the foundation,” according to a separate letter from a Breitman lawyer, which referenced a Sept. 21 meeting at which Mr. Gevers made the claim.
&gt; 
&gt; The Breitmans, in their late 20s at the time of the offering, had done stints at major firms. He had worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and Morgan Stanley , while she had spent time at hedge-fund manager Bridgewater Associates and consulting firm Accenture . Ms. Breitman also worked as a fellow on The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page during the summer of 2011.
&gt; 
&gt; The couple now control Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc., which, according to Tezos’ website, “owns all of the Tezos-related intellectual property.” The Breitmans contends they used a Swiss foundation to boost the company’s independence and add checks and balances in its early period. Eventually, the plan is for the Breitmans to sell their company to the foundation for about $20 million.
&gt; 
&gt; But how much control the Swiss foundation has over the company’s direction has led to a dispute that has put trading of Tezos tokens held by investors in limbo while also putting some of the technology on hold as well.
&gt; 
&gt; The Tezos tokens, nicknamed tezzies, have yet to begin formally trading, though some trades are taking place in a less liquid prelaunch market. The formal start of trading is tied to the release of the production version of the Tezos platform. That has been delayed by the fight and may not come until February, more than six months after the money was raised last July, Ms. Breitman said.
&gt; 
&gt; The money that was raised in the deal is currently with the foundation in a bank account, Ms. Breitman says. The proceeds are in the process of being converted from virtual currencies -- bitcoin and Ethereum—into government-backed currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; The offerings are in many ways more akin to crowdfunding efforts than securities offerings, although the Securities and Exchange Commission has said it would review exactly what an offering is on an individual basis. The coins sold by companies in most cases aren’t equity in a firm. Rather, they are tokens that can be used at a future date to purchase services or products a company intends to produce.",2017-10-19 07:23:14

dokoiax,JustSomeBadAdvice,39,"&gt; (3) A non-segwit miner mints (1) into a block as an ANYONECANSPEND's, without any coinbase signature commitment.

This can't happen; The transactions are considered non-standard to a non-upgraded miner and won't be added to the mempool.

They could hack their code and recompile to do it, but they could also break themselves in many other ways too, so that's nothing new.

&gt; (4a) Non-segwit nodes accept (3) as a valid block since they have no concept of Segwit.

Yes, but it will be orphaned and ignored by the rest of the ecosystem.

&gt; (4b) Segwit nodes also accept (3) as valid? 

No, they will not.

&gt; If 4b is false, then this means Segwit nodes arrive at different consensus than the non-segwit nodes 4a. 

Correct

&gt; This can be exploited to fragment the network and chainsplit between non-segwit and segwit nodes.

If magically the entire system decided to stop applying the rules then yes, the network could split.  Just like my ""all addresses ending in k are now anyone-can-spend"" idea in my other comment.  Chainsplits that lose a minority of people who are deliberately breaking the rules are not a problem for Bitcoin.

&gt; How is this handled - specifically, how does a non-segwit miner mint a valid block with segwit transactions?

It is handled by having the ecosystem already upgraded and accepting segwit.  The rule change doesn't magically just vanish.  People using old clients are now in the minority, and businesses / economic drivers of transactions definitely have an upgraded supermajority.

&gt; Segwit consensus now depends on the memory pool, whereas before it was purely dependent on the blockchain.

Not correct, it depends on the ecosystem not suddenly changing the rules.  Just like it always did.

&gt; if it encounters a plain ANYONECANSPEND P2SH transaction X, it must cross-check this transaction with the mempool.

No this is not correct.  It cross checks with the witness data root and the witness data block.  If those things don't match, the block is invalid.  ""plain anyone can spend"" transactions that look like segwit but are missing witness data are invalid and will be rejected.  This isn't an issue since the type of sigscript it used is odd and very nonstandard, it isn't something that happens by accident, which is why the segwit rules made it invalid without witness data.

&gt; (A.2) If it does not have X in mempool, then it accepts the transaction and block

Not without the witness data being verified.

&gt; and new transactions spending Y as plain ANYONECANSPEND P2SH inputs.

Segwit  transactions are not plain ""anyone can spend"" transactions.  They are a very unusual, non-standard(won't get relayed) type of transaction, and post-segwit activation they became *invalid*.

doks8zr,nullc,37,"I think monero has a number of downsides which are unlikely to ever be fixed.  E.g. it has perpetual inflation which might become quite substantial after losses-- and other parts of the system depend on this.  This makes it fundamentally less interesting to me.

The specific cryptographic privacy approach in it also has fundamental scaling weaknesses-- though I believe that monero can probably upgrade once better tools are available, the requirement to do so means that its decentralization remains less complete. At the same time, I believe Bitcoin can also adopt better techniques when they're available.

The mandatory nature of cryptographic privacy in monero is a tremendous asset-- making it private in ways that other systems the claim to be private (like Zcash) can't match... but it comes with its own costs in scalability, good lite client comparability, and agility against cryptographic threats (e.g. quantum computers) that prevent it from being superior to Bitcoin, and in my view less valuable than Bitcoin.  ... but still an interesting alternative and far more valuable than almost all other altcoins.

Mining is indeed a complex operation, but it's not meaningless. The point is to 'validate' the previous transactions. Since bitcoin is using peer to peer, someone, somewhere, has to make sure that transactions are genuine and no is stealing bitcoins by adding fake transactions to the system. This is what mining is all about. Miners authenticate transactions on the network, and make sure no one is 'hacking' the system. They get rewarded with new bitcoins.

I was actually thinking the same.
My view is that people get on because price is still cheap and they think they missed the train for Bitcoin. Now they just wait and think it will go to the moon.

Despite the fact that Litecoin is one of the best crypto for every day payment it can still fail and fail big. 

In order to make it viable people must use it or at least help it to spread. The list of better technologies that failed is very long. 

If nobody use it will be overtaken by another coin and once it's done, its too late.
Think of a business (not a big crypto fan) allowing Litecoin for payment and nobody use it, it will turn its back on litecoin and may never come back. If another coin (even it is not as good as litecoin) succeed and a lot of people use it, where do you think the interest of businesses accepting crypto will be ? 

Google is still automatically correcting ""Litecoin"" to ""Bitcoin"". I don't think it helps people to get interested in. 
Because the traffic is far (far far) more important for bitcoin. A lot of articles, tutorial, courses, blogs are written everyday talking about bitcoin. Of course that is normal: bitcoin is still the gold standard but if we don't even try to catch up we will never catch up or keep normal distances.

Please if you want the price to go up, invest yourself and help it to do so :
- Accept it in your business.
- Write articles, wikipedia articles, blogs, tweets etc.
- Run nodes
- Mine it.
etc.

Just don't wait for it to magically do something.

Users running nodes helps Bitcoin through decentralization by securing their autonomous enforcement of the rules.  Some guy spinning up a bunch of nodes on VPSes is just a sybil attack more or less useless for anything but spying on user's transactions.

The only case where doing something like that would make sense is if the network was failed to the point that there were few enough nodes running that users were having trouble connecting and syncing... and in that case it would be better to just run a small number of high capacity nodes, not sybil attack with a false fleet.

We saw an additional 78 Waltonaires 2 weeks ago, and last week there were an an additional 46 for a total of 652. Today there are a total of 722, so welcome to the additional 70 Waltonaires this week!

Also 2 weeks ago there were a total of 6,506 Waltonite token holders listed on Etherscan. Last week we went up to 6,941, and today we have 7,466! Those are some nice steady gains for the community right there.

Again, I was checking out the addresses in the top 50 and I only saw one whale selling anything significant, most are still holding strong. There was some significant pickups by a few whales though this week.

[Rank 16 added 286k!](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0x38dffbb5fcd595f2f902a7775d79476b8aebe5bd) I was like holy shit when I saw that, how did that not move the market!

[Then I saw rank 19 who moved out 286k...](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0x2ced2e8c44142a72d678458d3e9a8887c6abfe5d) 

[Added 25,000](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0xdfb460e135902c62cc2111df89f9c1a8592fcd91)

[Added 31,000](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0x03d039ee088fbaf4a05c51953e7cd7101808d12b)

[Added 37,000](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0xa7777179bee93e37fb8d683c827058922c629a1b)

There 2 sellers, one that was pretty small, [1,716 out and then 412 back in.](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0x5331ee5db1082ad13cc47cac2bf6b69d7e248f72)

[And then there's the only big seller, a total of 23,500.](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7cb1c96db6b22b0d3d9536e0108d062bd488f74?a=0x5443021b9a3a931773b69f57bc36c6d293129afb) Which I was thinking this timed up with the PCB picks. Then I saw where he sent this amounts, and 23,000 of it went to the whale that gained 37,000. Another 500 was sent to a smaller address. So unless he's doing private selling, it doesn't look like there's any major selling going on in the top 50.

That big money in Walton is continuing to hold strong during bitcoin spike again this week, which once again should give us all faith during these recent ups and downs! Cheers!",2017-10-22 10:35:41

doovrlq,BTCrob,50,"THat might be true if Bitcoins most likely use case was as a medium of exchange. It isn't.

People are not going to spend a deflationary currency that will be worth more in the future for everyday purchases when they can make the same purchase in inflationary currencies that will be worth less in the future. They just won't. Assuming they will goes against everything that we know about standard human economic behavior.

Imagine a hypothetical: Let's say you purchase another deflationary asset, stocks. You buy $50,000 worth of Apple shares because your research leads you to believe that that will double within 5 years. Also, imagine in this hypothetical world, every merchant is set up with a point of sale system that connects to your broker allows you to make all your purchases with stocks as easy as with a debit card. Would you buy your coffee with your Apple shares? Or pay for dinner? Of course you wouldn't. Why? Because you expect them to be worth more in the future (or else you wouldn't have bought the stock). OTOH you also have fiat currency in your pocket, and you KNOW that will be worth less in the future. 99% of consumers would pay with their fiat.

That's the problem ""Bitcoin as medium of exchange"" folks are up against. It isn't an issue with Bitcoins coding. It's an issue with the coding in our brains. This exact dynamic is expressed by Gresham's Law perfect (i.e. assuming the same purchase price, bad money always drives out good). In this case, most would consider a currency that would be worth more in the future to be ""good"" money and one worth less to be ""bad"". People will spend their ""bad"" and hold onto their ""good""

And as someone who's spent a lot of time in online communities I can say that without exception I have NEVER seen a community split so hard, so fast, as when the 'moderation policy' took effect in /r/bitcoin.  

-------

**A small history lesson:**

For those that don't remember back this far, it was ~2014-2015ish, Gavin and Mike had just released the first Bitcoin-XT which included a miner voting hard fork block size increase.  It was of course very controversial, and those discussions occasionally got a bit heated, but there was generally an air of respect because we all knew we all wanted the same thing- for Bitcoin to succeed.  

The /r/bitcoin 'moderation policy' (which was also applied on the bitcointalk forum) simply said that anything which doesn't follow the current Bitcoin consensus rules is an altcoin, and therefore should not be discussed in Bitcoin forums.  Thus, Bitcoin-XT threads started to be deleted from /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk in great numbers.  

What started as a heated debate over the merits of XT erupted into an all out holy war, over the space of about an hour.  Within a day the entire discussion was dominated by this.  XT fans said Theymos was using censorship to kill a proposal he didn't like, that Core was in the pocket of banks, that Bitcoin should reject censorship and anyone who would use it is trying to kill Bitcoin.  Core fans said that XT was (depending on who you talked to) either an altcoin and should be discussed in the same places as Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc, or a hostile attack that was trying to kill Bitcoin.  The discussion fell apart from productive to useless almost instantly.  

Of course XT started to pick up steam, but then DDoS attacks against XT nodes put a stop to that.  

-----

The rest is the same- Bitcoin-Classic was a more conservative attempt (a single increase to 2MB).  That was killed with the 'Satoshi Roundtable Hong Kong Accords'- a bunch of Core devs flew to Hong Kong and promised to have SegWit done soon and a hard fork proposed soon after, if miners would drop Classic support.  They did.  SegWit ended up taking many months longer than planned and Core never really supported any hard fork.  The Core devs who flew down were immediately called [well meaning dipshits](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1330553.msg14835202#msg14835202).  

The next attempt was Bitcoin Unlimited- aka let's never have this problem ever again.  Hard coded block size limits replaced with 'emergent consensus', a method where miners can signal their max block size, but won't fork the network if everyone else disagrees.  It started to gain traction (much more than SegWit).  

What killed that was New York Accords.  A bunch of Bitcoin companies and miners sat down, and said half of us want SegWit, the other half want a block size increase, why not do both?  So they agreed on what we now call SegWit2x.  They activated SegWit immediately (as blocks were full and SegWit was promised to help with that) but allowed a few more months to finish the 2MB split.  
That 2MB split is coming in November, but it's once again being written off as a hostile attack.  

I like NYA.  But they made the mistake of assuming everyone would act in good faith.  They should have delayed the SegWit activation until the 2MB code was ready, so they could do both at once.  ",2017-10-23 17:51:52

dot7c3d,ep1939,107,"&gt; Is it really this easy to make money with crypto?

The point isn't being right once or twice, but consistently.

I've made close to 20x my initial investment in 6 months speculating on altcoins (sadly my initial investment was only 200$), and the idea about cryptomarkets I developed is that it involves a very huge amount of luck and timing.

If it wasn't for my successful NAv, OMG and Neo speculations in august-early september I wouldn't made that money.

Oh, and thanks god I never listened to the ""hold"" and ""real use"" crap. Or I'd be stuck with Siacoins bought at 700 sats, DGB bought at 1400 sats, ecc, and so many other coins that did shit.

I've lost so many profits and made huge lossess as well (was like -40% from september first till basically today).

There's plenty of solid projects that have no value and plenty of redundant coins with no use nor accepted anywhere that are so huge.

There's a reason why Warren Buffet says that it's not easy to beat the market.

Realistically speaking 80% of people speculating out there would've made much more bucks if they just bought bitcoin and sat on it.

Cryptos are too volatile and everyday a new coin is out that's better than the one you hold. And bitcoin keeps going up and your altcoin keeps going down (in bitcoin's value).",2017-10-24 18:19:25

dotas72,DCinvestor,53,"*Now that Gold is behind us, let's talk about the Segwit2x, upcoming in November:*

So let's face facts: Segwit2x is probably not going to become the ""real"" Bitcoin.  Futures markets, while very limited and possibly manipulated at the moment, put [BTC/BT1](https://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/bt1usd) much higher than [B2X/BT2](https://www.bitfinex.com/order_book/bt2usd) (about 5 to 1). As much as the businesses who support it would like it to, B2X will probably not take off the way they hope.   The market has spoken and they do not want two or more Bitcoins.  It may have a nice pop at first, and then slowly fade away- primarily due to the fact that current BTC buyers don't care how usable it is.  Most are simply buying it as a speculative investment and leaving it on exchanges.

These 2X businesses want the monetary / speculative value of Bitcoin tied to something that actually works (i.e., has transaction capacity and low fees) so it can be used for on-chain / off-chain payments and for other applications.  B2X probably won't be it.  Bitcoin Cash is also not well-positioned, without a committed fix for transaction malleability or a real development team / roadmap.

But you know what could meet these businesses' needs?  ETH.  *To the businesses supporting 2X, come join us by throwing all of your development / merchant effort behind Ethereum.*  Hell, if it isn't profitable for you anymore, stop accepting BTC altogether.

dotuqhw,NewWorldViking,78,"I think that many of the big miners got into it to be big powerful players in Bitcoin. Then the reality crept in that miners are actually subservient players in Bitcoin. By that I mean they are followers, not leaders.

**Developers:** Their role is to increase the efficiency of Bitcoin and expand the Bitcoin horizon with new features and functions. However they cannot force users to move to the horizons they create. In effect, they are only able to dangle carrots on a stick and hope the user base moves to bite them. If the user's don't value their developments, then their developments don't take hold.

**Users:** The central driving force and decision makers of Bitcoin. The users decide what developers they use. The users create transactions and offer fees. The users create the markets which gives value to Bitcoin. Every major decision in Bitcoin is ultimately decided by user consensus.

**Miners:** While they serve a critical role in securing the Bitcoin Network, it is only financially feasible to secure the network that the Users want and value. This makes Miners the most dictated group in Bitcoin. They must follow the markets established by the Users. Failure to follow what the Users value incurs a direct financial penalty. While needlessly unflattering, it is not unreasonable to call Miners the ""bottom-feeders"" of Bitcoin. They can only pick up the incentives offered by the markets as established by the Users. They cannot create their own or make their own determinations. This makes the entire Miner industry the financially bound slaves to the Users. The simply must do what the users want and offer to make a profit. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the Miner role is absolutely critical. So long as one understands the position of the role.

I think the language used by the Big-Blockers/S2Xers shows that the big mining players didn't expect the Miner position to be as it is. They thought they would be more powerful or even the most powerful, when in fact they are the least powerful group when it comes to steering Bitcoin. They are a powerful engine but they can't touch the steering wheel. They seem to be jealous of the Developers who create many new roads. But ultimately it's the users that decide which directions to go and the value it is worth.

IMO, I think this is an excellent balance of power.",2017-10-25 03:10:40

dou1tm9,Yorn2,76,"Yes, people don't understand just how difficult it is to buy and hold like they think 2011 investors did. Let me relate a story from the time to give you an idea of how hard it was to hold and/or time the market.

Imagine you've got a decent IT job at $40-50k in 2011. You have $1000 you can throw into this new ""Bitcoin thing that was just reported online as being used to fund Wikileaks while the government is cracking down on Mastercard, Paypal, &amp; VISA payments. You buy 1k BTC worth at $1 anyway and watch it increase to $5. You decide to sell $1k USD because it makes sense to make back some of your money.

One day you miss the price increase from $5 to $30 and it's fallen back down to $10. Do you buy or sell or hold? The next day it has increased again back to $15, but too bad, you don't get to buy or sell, there was a hack on the only exchange available. They promise they have your funds but the price will open back up at $10 again, do you buy or sell or hold? A few weeks later it has risen to $12 then fallen to $8, do you buy or sell or hold? A month later the number of Bitcoin miners has fallen to $6, do you keep holding? Two months later it's nearing $2, the difficulty has fallen more than 20% from the peak and Wired just released an article about how it was stupid to think any of us could make money ""mining"" with a GPU. In fact, they are right, it's really no longer profitable to mine in 95% of the US and all of Europe. Do you keep holding?

The answer to all of these questions was ""buy buy buy"" obviously, but it never *seemed* like the right answer. This is why so many people talk about the dollar cost averaging strategy at very very low amounts of investment. That way you aren't really risking anything (you're spending very small amounts of money from your current income) and you're accumulating something that might someday be worth a significant amount of money. Because it was never a significant investment of 5% or more of your net worth, you aren't as likely to sell it all at once for profits, either. For you, there's a point where the DCA strategy will put you at ""retirement ready"" instead, and you can simply retire and live off what you've accumulated by investing almost nothing every week.

We therefore strongly oppose SegWit2x. This remains true even if the SegWit2x chain has the majority hashrate or a higher price.

Why people buy it, use it, mine it, etc. There's lots of resistance and questions about its legitimacy.
Now, with all the forking, it makes bitcoin seem even more ridiculous. How can a currency split, creating essentially two new currencies? Where is the value of the new currency coming from?
I'm not saying forking is bad. When a crypto forks to implement something new that is to the benefit of the currency as a whole, that's fantastic.
But when it's happening on a continuing basis because people can't come to consensus and there's no built-in governance system to resolve clashing views, forking is bad and it's hurting the currency as a whole.",2017-10-26 05:49:10

Speaking of deception, does anybody who isn't G-Max or Adam have any more information on exactly why and how Austin Hill left Blockstream? My understanding is that they were using him for his VC connections only, and once the dipshits got in bed with Barry good, Hill was secretly pressured to leave the startup. Now that Barry told them he will no longer be leading or even participating in investment rounds, Blockstream turned to the East by bringing in Samson Mow who likely guaranteed them at least one more round of $10-50million.

doy8unn,vagabond_nerd,281,"I've been reading a book called Dark Money that shows how the rich changed how we view the world. At one point the common man wanted unions and sought less of a wealth gap by fighting the system. In the 1970s this gap narrowed by the most it ever had with the loss of faith in Nixon and people standing up to the government/ big business. The super rich didn't like this at all.

Guys like the Koch brothers funded ""charities"" and think tanks to shift the paradigm. Suddenly unions were bad, social welfare was for lazy ass people who didn't like working, and big business deserved more breaks on regulations and taxes because eventually that increased revenue would trickle down to the rest of us according to some Koch operative theories. Many people bought this bullshit and continue to believe it as Fox News muddy the waters between reality and fiction.

Banks aren't in the check-cashing or payment processing 'business'- they may derive some fee-based income from those services, but it's hardly their bread and butter. Banks are in the business of money rental. They pay you to park your funds with them, first literally via dividends (with more available the more locked in those funds are), then via incentivizing services like check issuance, peer to peer payments, online banking, billpay, etc. Those services are only an inducement to deposit, and all of those things are EXPENSES to the bank. They willingly pay them to secure the capital which they then promptly lend out. That's how they earn the lion's share of their income, and the better they strike the right balance of securing it for relatively little while lending as much of it out as safely possible, the more successful they become. They want to reward you for depositing cash with them so they can lend it out, and yeah, so they can cross-sell you more means by which you'll borrow (or earn interchange fees). But either way, that cash is promptly going right back out again at an advantageous rate of return. 

Bitcoin isn't an existential threat to that model. It could cause a disruption to the service incentive piece of the puzzle that helps banks secure cash, but they have many means of earning those deposits. Peer to peer lending, on the other hand, is a shot across the bow...",2017-10-27 01:03:58

If amazon starts accepting bitcoin today (or anytime) this website has no real value case.  OpenBazaar, being decentralized, can accomodate markets and products that no centralized service would be able to, meaning it will still be around.  

Honestly, I don't even see a reason to compare CoinMall to OpenBazaar at all.  Seeing as CoinMall isn't trying to be decentralized or secure in the same manner or for the same reasons.

Company X cannot compete openly in the free market so they conceive of some government regulation that will benefit them at the expense of their competitors. But you can't just go around say ""pass this regulation so that we can increase our profits at the expense of other people"". So what do they do? They find some way of spinning it such that the regulation is really for the ""public good' or for ""consumer protection"" or ""consumer safety"".

The brilliance of this propaganda strategy is they are able to convert extremely gullible but otherwise well intentioned people to their cause of fattening their profits. Average people start calling their congressman demanding this regulation. Rallies are held. Activists flood the communication channels with support ... All for the private benefit of special interest. 

This is how we got the Fed in the first place. The public was told this was a consumer protection measure meanwhile the President of the First National Bank of Chicago, James Forgan, was holding meetings where he tells the bankers, ""The purpose of this meeting is to discuss winning the banking community over to government control, directed by the bankers, for their own ends"" (actual quote).

dp04tc9,Ilogy,151,"&gt; A ASIC-resistant, or ASIC-impossible solution needs to be found. 

If Bitcoin can change its PoW and retain market dominance, that means its value isn't intrinsically dependent on the mining infrastructure. If that is the case, then future PoW changes remain a permanent option, and the threat of using that option severely discourages future collusion. With collusion no longer a threat, ASIC resistance is no longer a pressing need.

In other words, a successful PoW change -- where success means the value of the network is maintained despite the change -- effectively solves the mining centralization problem because centralized or not, miners will know that any meaningful attack will be met with financial ruin. This becomes even more true if the mining infrastructure is reliant on ASICs and is therefore unable to switch to the new mining algorithm. ASICs are actually preferable if a PoW change is a constant and real option precisely because a PoW change effectively bricks those ASICs and severely damages miners financially. So a successful PoW change in itself would be sufficient, changing to a more ASIC resistant algorithm would probably be superfluous. 

The problem we face today is that few people see a PoW change as a realistic option. Many are of the opinion that Bitcoin is too dependent on its mining infrastructure to divorce it without severe consequences. In many respects, the S2X fork will help clarify this matter, potentially even without a PoW change. This is because the gamble of S2X is that by starving the bitcoin network of hash power, and even potentially attacking the network to make it temporarily unusable, the market value of bitcoin will plummet. If they are wrong, then they have demonstrated that the value of bitcoin is largely independent of its mining infrastructure. Once that is understood, changing the PoW algo becomes a more realistic threat in the future.   ",2017-10-28 18:16:38

* Be physically fit/muscular
* Be charismatic
* Be funny
* Have a good haircut
* Have a good job/money
* Have a good fashion sense

* Be younger than 29
* Don't be a bitch
* Don't be too fat
* Don't have a massive physical deformity

Attractive women are born, attractive men are made, and made by their own hands.  So they inherently have more value.  And women chase value.   There is a REASON that the top 20% of men fuck the top 80% of women.  So if you look at women's behavior they are telling you through their ACTIONS that attractive men are superior.  Women date up, men date down.  Women choose men that they perceive to be superior to them.  

There is a reason that the women in europe are cuckolding their husbands with the violent middle-eastern immigrants.  Do you think those immigrants have a benevolent patriarch frame?  

So in a philosophical sense, yes you are correct that a homeless bum is not inherently superior to a supermodel.  But don't forget why we are all here.  We're here to explore sexual strategy.  And for bloopies, your message is very dangerous because it doesn't put them in the correct mindset to act like a superior male.

Its a false veneer of security setup to entrap people into thinking that their isn’t a backdoor built into the chips of every computer manufactured.

Computer chip designs are top secret information. I once knew someone when I was a child who worked on computer chips for intel. His computer was much like an intelligence agents computer. Gps tracked and the entire thing would instantly become unusable and wipe the hard drive with a single call.

The ease of putting a stealth circuit within trillions of transistors is obvious.

https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/

“Now imagine a backdoor planted not in an application, or deep in an operating system, but even deeper, in the hardware of the processor that runs a computer. And now imagine that silicon backdoor is invisible not only to the computer’s software, but even to the chip’s designer, who has no idea that it was added by the chip’s manufacturer, likely in some farflung Chinese factory. And that it’s a single component hidden among hundreds of millions or billions. And that each one of those components is less than a thousandth of the width of a human hair.

In fact, researchers at the University of Michigan haven’t just imagined that computer security nightmare; they’ve built and proved it works. In a study that won the “best paper” award at last week’s IEEE Symposium on Privacy and Security, they detailed the creation of an insidious, microscopic hardware backdoor proof-of-concept. And they showed that by running a series of seemingly innocuous commands on their minutely sabotaged processor, a hacker could reliably trigger a feature of the chip that gives them full access to the operating system. Most disturbingly, they write, that microscopic hardware backdoor wouldn’t be caught by practically any modern method of hardware security analysis, and could be planted by a single employee of a chip factory.

“Detecting this with current techniques would be very, very challenging if not impossible,” says Todd Austin, one of the computer science professors at the University of Michigan who led the research. “It’s a needle in a mountain-sized haystack.” Or as Google engineer Yonatan Zunger wrote after reading the paper: “This is the most demonically clever computer security attack I’ve seen in years.”

It's affiliated with the [Vietnam General Confederation of Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_General_Confederation_of_Labour) but is not an official government portal.

Further, the decree (which has actually been in effect since 2014) says *may* be subject to prosecution which is entirely different to *will* be subject to.  Translation of that is, investigators leaving enough wiggle room to fine an organisation they feel is doing dodgy stuff with bitcoin (such as people exploiting others through ICO's and fraudulent get-rich-quick schemes off the back of this technology).

We can look at the same Ngoi Lao Dong newspaper to dig even deeper, to an article published there just **yesterday** about FPT university accepting Bitcoin for tuition fees (they officially announced this on Friday).

See: http://nld.com.vn/kinh-te/thu-hoc-phi-bang-bitcoin-rui-ro-lon-20171027214311894.htm

Note how an official government announcement is yet to emerge, and is not expected until 2019.

*A lecturer of the National Economics University said that the government is assigning relevant ministries and agencies to draft a legal framework for the management of virtual currency, electronic money. It is expected that by 2019, the construction will be completed in the first step, which means that from now until the issuance of the legal framework, electronic money transactions will not be regulated and protected.*

This is all corroborated by a coindesk article [here](https://www.coindesk.com/vietnam-preparing-legally-recognize-bitcoin-2018/)

*An assessment for how the government should approach this process is due to be completed by August of next year. Once that is concluded, it's expected that drawing up the legal documents required to recognize cryptocurrencies under a regulatory framework will be completed by the end of 2018.

In tandem, officials will also begin work on a tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. According to VNA, a system governing how cryptocurrency users will be taxed in Vietnam is slated to be in place by June 2019.*

The conclusion to all this: Far from being illegal in Vietnam (as the knee-jerk headline implies), bitcoin appears to be in the same grey area as it was in when the original decree was drafted in 2014.

TL;DR: Until we hear from an *actual* official source you may as well be linking us to an opinion column in Entertainment Weekly.

Bitcoin is this unique synthesis of an asset and a network, and decentralised. I know I’m largely preaching to the converted but sometimes I see the FUD that overtakes here.

The bubble (which will come as the price eventually overshoots during a saturated market) has not even started yet.

Once bitcoin can be bought and stored safely with the click of a button, then the bubble will start. Right now it’s complicated and not secure for the average joe. 

Most people I talk to have heard of bitcoin but they don’t really understand it and maybe 1 in 10 actually own any, but that’s overestimating the general population because I tend to be around like-minded people.

This sphere inspires elation and anxiety in equal measure because we’re trying to read the future. 

And in the midst of this fork bullshit it’s important to remember that btc is already working. Forget the buying your coffee with btc bollox—use your worthless fiat for that. Nobody uses their gold to buy coffee.

Bitcoin is not going to replace the banking industry, at least not for the foreseeable future. It will coexist in the form of digital gold.
It will however start to make the banks and governments pay for their immoral money printing and manipulation. Its price will rise and rise as a response to more and more inflation.

It’s this multi faceted, multi layered nature of this sphere that makes me wonder at the phenomenon we’re living through.

So zoom out a little and try to have some patience. Hodling is probably the bet strategy for all save the experienced traders (whom I know abound here).

I guess they felt they had enough input right there.  
I know of various other people that actually put a very significant amount of effort into this and did not get to share their thoughts.

Also worth noting is that we have a mailinglist for coordination of any protocol improvements. There is no excuse to avoid communicating this kind of things, and I don't believe posting a press-release on one implementations' site is proper communication.

At this time I see no actual specification that mobile clients, or even Bitcoin Classic can implement. We have a date, is there an actual specific time defined that the hard fork will hit? Something specific enough to put in code?

If possible obtain said bitcoin paying in cash (look at [localbitcoin](https://localbitcoins.com/) for instance) to leave even less traces. Avoid any electronic transfers paid via Visa, Paypal or other crap that links to you directly. 

But that's not enough. Not nearly enough. Now, onto removing all traces - firstly, get a burner notebook. I am sure you can find some older ones you can get used. Buy one, fully format it, install [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) on it. Find a local hotspot at least 200 km from your real location, mcdonalds are probably a thing even there (just don't enter one so you aren't caught by a camera, do it from a distance). 

Once your data is published, **never** go back to that site. Assume it's already hijacked and visiting it would reveal your real IP. 

Oh yea, DATA. Remember that every [single printed piece of information has a unique marking on them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_steganography) that tells you what printer it was made at. Also if you acquired some government secrets and printed those within their network and then physically picked it up - you are already fucked and your safest bet is fleeing the country right now. Accessing printing history is not impossible and I am sure such logs are kept. So just by seeing this material published they can backtrack on who last accessed it. 

Save for that just remember about said marking so if you have such papers and want to publish them then scan &amp; print this 10 times over, edit them in Gimp to remove all these watermarks and then publish it in this form.

Frankly, I am not sure if this is enough. Depends on HOW important is this information. I am expecting NSA level organization to be able to still track back to you (since they have their own Tor exit nodes and God knows how many exploits on popular services). Especially since even the very data you are publishing (if it has been (re)written by you) has your very own unique writing style that could be a way of identifying you (frequency of words you use, any unique patterns/words combinations etc). 

One way or another be prepared to flee your country after publishing this. Because chances that you miss something are not close to 100%. They ARE 100%.

And they are manipulated by Roger Ver (memorydealers) and Jihan Wu (owner of Bitmain) and their mining cartel into blocking anything that provides off-chain scaling on Bitcoin, since that reduces the control of the miners. Bitcoin Cash is their brainchild (used to eke out more profits from ASICBoost), and the NYA fork would put Bitcoin under their control as well.

I could deluge you with links and articles along these lines, but if you just keep your eyes open you'll see the point easily enough.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have Segwit as that provides for offchain scaling via the Lightning Network, nor does it  have the fixes and improvements implemented on Bitcoin on 0.15 since it has no development team to speak of.

dp37m51,Gregory_Maxwell,112,"Well said OP, just some additional info:

The wizard behind the Bitmain chip is co-founder Micree Zhan.

Jihan is the business brain, he gambled everything he had on Bitcoin and he picked the right technical guy as co-founder to design the chip.

They took a lot of risk and they almost crashed and burned after Mt Gox fell.

Bitmain history:

[https://qz.com/1053799/chinas-bitmain-dominates-bitcoin-mining-now-it-wants-to-cash-in-on-artificial-intelligence/](China’s Bitmain dominates bitcoin mining. Now it wants to cash in on artificial intelligence)

A chance encounter with a chip designer

&lt;b&gt;Bitmain and Wu’s power would never have come about had it not been for a chance encounter on a Beijing street.&lt;/b&gt; Zhan, the Sophon chip designer and the technical brains behind Bitmain, was running a startup called DivaIP in 2010 that made a set-top box that allowed a user to stream a television show to a computer screen. One of Zhan’s staff was canvassing for customers when Wu walked by.

Wu was then in private equity, armed with a degree in economics and psychology from Peking University, China’s most august institution. Zhan, a graduate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, famed for its technical degrees, was trying to raise funding for DivaIP, so he asked Wu for advice. Ultimately Wu couldn’t help, but three years later it would be Wu who needed Zhan.

&lt;b&gt;Wu had discovered bitcoin in 2011 in a blog post, and one line stuck in his head. “They described it as the most dangerous open-source project ever,”&lt;/b&gt; he says. Bitcoin was envisioned as a form of stateless money that could be owned by anyone but controlled by no one—with no central bank, and no government in charge. “Such a monetary system is possible. It doesn’t have to be government-backed. It doesn’t even have to be gold-backed,” he says.

&lt;b&gt;In short order, Wu emptied his bank account to buy bitcoin, then just a fringe idea. One bitcoin could be purchased for under a dollar in early 2011. “I spent all my life savings to buy bitcoin in 2011,”&lt;/b&gt; he said. “Most people thought it was risky or a scam.” Two years later, bitcoin exploded, soaring from about $20 at the start of 2013 to $900 by the end of the year and, in the process, it captured mainstream attention. Wu realized that he could make money not just by trading bitcoin, but by creating it. At the time, a miner could earn 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes.

&lt;b&gt;Wu had capital from his 2011 bitcoin investments. But he needed a chip designer. Remembering Zhan, Wu set out everything he understood about bitcoin in an e-mail to him. “I spent two hours reading up on bitcoin on Wikipedia,” Zhan said. “I knew it was a good thing. I decided to do this business immediately.”&lt;/b&gt;

Bespoke silicon for bitcoin

&lt;b&gt;Zhan’s first task was designing an ASIC that would run SHA-256, the cryptographic calculation used in bitcoin, at maximum efficiency.&lt;/b&gt; The development of bitcoin mining ASICs escalated the race to devote greater amounts of processing power to bitcoin mining.

&lt;b&gt;“In the beginning it was very tough for Micree [Zhan],” Wu says. “He complained it was impossible,” to create an ASIC for bitcoin. But Zhan, 38, got the job done, and at record speed, taking just six months from idea to finished product.&lt;/b&gt; Time was critical, because bitcoin prices fluctuated wildly, meaning Bitmain could miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to profit from the ongoing rally. Other players were already on the scene; early ASIC makers like ASICMiner and Butterfly Labs crowdfunded their projects in 2012 to create the first generation of bitcoin ASICs.

In November 2013, Zhan’s first mining rig, the Antminer S1, was ready, and Bitmain opened for business. Sales took off. “We had very good sales during the whole of 2014,” Wu says. Indeed, bitcoin hit a historic high of nearly $1,200 in November 2013—only to crash months later after fraud was discovered at Japan’s Mt. Gox, then the largest exchange in the world.

&lt;b&gt;By the end of 2014, the Mt. Gox-spurred crash put Bitmain in dire straits. Nobody wanted to be paying expensive electricity bills to mine a digital currency that was falling in value.&lt;/b&gt; “The price fell too low, and the whole business plan was made when the bitcoin price was high!” Wu laughs. “So when the price fell there was not much demand for our bitcoin mining rigs. Our toughest time was at the end of 2014.”

Surviving the bitcoin crash

&lt;b&gt;Wu and Zhan clung on. “It was very tough,” says Zhan. “I thought if the price continues to drop maybe Bitmain will break down.”&lt;/b&gt; But by 2015, the cryptocurrency appeared to have bottomed out. There was increasing interest in the technical idea behind it—the immutable ledger known as the blockchain—from some of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions.

&gt; Let's say the price decreases from $100 to $90. This is a total loss of $60. If the BTC price drops to a point where my cash on hand can no longer cover the losses, a Margin Call occurs. A margin call forces me to immediately sell all of my BTC to pay back the money I've borrowed.
&gt; Now, this person shorted the market, betting that BTC would go down. So, as BTC price went up, they could no longer cover their short position and a margin call occurred, forcing them to buy a bunch of Bitcoin at the market price.
&gt; A margin call on a long position forces you to sell what you have at the current market price, and a margin call on a short position causes you to buy what you bet against at the current market price.

dp55xgg,4skin4life,78,huge news. old school institutions can enter the market through futures which is safer for them than managing the private keys themselves. this is also the first step in creating a bitcoin ETF which would allow retirement account money to come in,2017-10-31 23:26:12

please do comment on Tom's message, even if your to busy. Let's not follow core's operating mode. 

I saw very little input on the mailing list and like Tom mentioned no announcement made there.

Also the conclusions of nchain and bitprim hardly point to your algorithm being the most adequate. I would like 3rd party input on the complexity and risks of each implementation not just performance.

I understand what I would like is probably worth 0 but at least Tom should be heard a bit more, since he maintains an implementation of Bitcoin Cash. ",2017-10-31 00:02:10
