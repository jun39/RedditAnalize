dl02hya,coblee,368,"Thanks for the constructive comments everyone. Let me explain some things. This is the first time I've done a live TV interview, so for sure I was a bit nervous. What didn't help was that I'm looking at a camera and not seeing anything and only hearing the anchor speak through a headset with about a 3 second delay. It's actually quite hard to concentrate and think clearly.

I was not given the questions, and the anchor has a tendency to start a question on one topic and add a run-on sentence at the last second on a different topic. So while I was trying to answer his first question, the question all of a sudden turned into something totally different! He did that multiple times and frustrated the hell out of me. Watch the video again and you will know what I mean. Imagine if you were me on the hot seat trying to think of the answer on the spot.

I also did not see or was given any of the on-screen graphics. So I had no idea that they put ""Litecoin vs Bitcoin"" out there.

And to those people that wanted me to really pump Litecoin, I didn't want to come off as a used car salesman. And I also wasn't trying to get the audience to go and immediately buy LTC because it's so much better than BTC. People who are asking me to do this, ask yourself if you just care about the LTC price. Well, that wasn't my goal. I just want more people to hear about Litecoin. For 99% of the audience, this is their first exposure to Litecoin. So just like the movie Inception, I wanted to insert the idea about Litecoin into their heads. And the silver analogy was the best way for me to do it. It works, especially on investors that understand gold and silver as investments and money.

Lastly, for those that wanted someone better to speak for me, I'm sorry. They likely wouldn't want a random person to pump Litecoin. They just wanted the creator. And sadly, I'm all you've got. Deal with it! :)

There definitely was room for improvement and I will work on it. And I will be more prepared next time. Later!",2017-08-01 15:08:17

dl07ecp,petertodd,113,"People were ready to declare Coinbase insolvent thieves not because it was taking them awhile - that's to be expected with cold storage over a weekend - but because they apparently lied about the cause and blamed it on non-existent network congestion instead.

*That's* consistent with a team in over their head saying stupid things because they're trying to cover up insolvency on short notice, something that's happened many times before in Bitcoin. Fortunately, the most likely explanation is their PR team doesn't know what they're talking about.

dl07llr,cjdavies,84,"You're several years too late to make money off bitcoin.

The complexity of the mining calculations increases over time. A few years ago they were simple enough that the rate at which you could generate coins would allow you to offset the amount of electricity you needed to pay for to run your GPU &amp; cooling. But today the complexity is so high that the only people that can still profit are those who invest in ASICs (specialized computers that can only mine bitcoin &amp; can't do anything else, eg you can't use them as a regular computer) &amp; who live in an area with very cheap electricity &amp; amenable climate conditions that mean they don't need to pay for AC.

Making money from mining with standard computer hardware &amp; in parts of the world without dirt cheap electric requires jumping onto new coin types very early on when the calculations are still simple. This is why so many people have been buying up GPUs to mine ethereum recently, but in a few months (or maybe already?) it will already be too late to make your investment back.

And of course the exchange rates for cyrptocurrencies are notoriously unstable.

tl;dr - mining is not a quick &amp; easy way to make money",2017-08-01 18:45:34

dl0eatc,Ziddletwix,66,"I'm so confused by this, and I keep seeing it posted. Isn't it just comparing the nominal amounts of two different currencies? That's totally arbitrary.

They could simply shift the decimal on bitcoin, and make one current bitcoin worth 1billion new bitcoins. Literally nothing  would change. It's just a decimal point. 

The nominal conversion between currencies is totally meaningless without context. An individual Mexican peso is worth 64 South Korean won. Without knowing more, that tells you nothing about the currencies. In this case, the South Korean currency has stronger purchasing power relative to income, but the nominal level is meaningless.

It's a nonsensical comparison. You could make a new currency that's exactly the same as usd but with 1 billion superdollars=$1. A superdollar would suddenly be worth less than a WoW gold, but that's totally meaningless ",2017-08-01 22:24:46

The ETHBTC is currently mooning, bitcoin is near ATH, don't get greedy and miss the boat guys, if you sold near the bottom I'd recommend getting in pre-fork as once it forks the green candle on the ratio is going to be bigger than the great wall of china. 

Over the past few weeks so many people have put money from alts into BTC so they can get their free BCC. It was never free, it was part of the price when you bought your bitcoin, hence the value now.

So many people will lose money on this one as I believe BCC will be worthless, bitcoin is going to flood into the rest of the market as you can see being done right now. Don't wait for youree BCC it's going to be worthless. There will be zero demand, if people wanted BCC they would've converted to BTC and got it free. 

Today will be the biggest fomo race of all time, and it's already started. Currently just about to hit 9am in Europe. I'm going to be excited to see the positivity back in this sub.

dl1q6t1,figure_d_it_out,1494,"The bitcoin network has needed an upgrade for awhile.  Each block of transactions was limited to 1mb per.  Each block takes about ten minutes for the system to confirm through the mining process.  So, transactions would take more fees to make it into the current block, making confirmations slow on some lower fee transfers.  The core development team decided to integrate something called SegWit, short for segregated witness, essentially moving some transactions off the blockchain and streamlining the process.  They also bumped up to a 2mb limit.  Bitcoin Cash took a hard copy of the current blockchain this morning, a hard fork split, and essentially bumped the block limit up to 8mb per, opening up capacity for more transactions per block while still maintaining the original design of Bitcoin.  So, now anyone that had access to their Bitcoin this morning now has an equal amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  There are wallets for both, miners for both, and so on.

dl1tt1g,waspocracy,103,"Top response is a little technical, so I'll ELI5 it.

To start, we need to visit a couple or years ago. When bitcoin was designed, it didn't have scalability in mind. Very few people predicted it would explode as it has. As it started gaining momentum, a few solutions became available. One of these is infamously called segwit, short for segregated witness. 

Imagine a pile of books that multiple people own where each book tells each person how many toys they bought each day, and what toys they got rid of. The more toys that are moved, the larger the book gets. It gets pretty big quickly! These books are called block chains. Even worse, only so many books can be updated at the same time. At the end of each book there is a signature of who did what and when, like a version history. 

Going a few years back again, people started thinking about removing the version control to limit the size of the books so they were easier to update and a lighter weight. This is called segregated witness. But, everyone didn't like the idea so it kind of went on hold for a bit. Then they thought, what if we allowed more books to be updated at the same time? Not everyone agreed, but a majority of them went with the suggestion anyways. Thus, they created two groups. 

The latter is what happened yesterday. The people that wanted larger block chain (more book updates) transactions separated to Bitcoin Cash, while the others that wanted to preserve the original method kept theirs. Both groups kept their record of toys, but from now on will not be able to get their book updates from the other group.

dl2opcw,CatOfGrey,122,"Not a lawyer, but it is a fact that money has a time value.  The deposit of all the checks at once is a theft from you of the time value of that money.

&gt; The landlord claims he was within his rights to cash all the checks, even though they were dated in the future.

No.  The amount of a stream of payments in the future is less than the amount paid as a single payment ""now"".

&gt; I'm now going to have to liquidate more BTC, which I was trying to avoid doing right after the split.

Again, not a lawyer, but part of your damages is the anticipated appreciating of doing this withdrawal now, as opposed to holding the Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin increases from $2,800 to $12,800, you have lost the value of holding those bitcoins, or $10000 per BTC.  So if you sold $80000 worth of BTC today, that's 80k/2800 = 28 bitcoin.  Those damages would be $280,000 that your landlord made you lose.

&gt; he helped me out by making sure I have a place to live for the next two years.

He did, but he didn't accept the arrangements of the contract, either.

&gt; Can I sue the landlord to get my money back?

I would talk with a lawyer.  I would also explore whether you had a case against your rental agent (who took the checks, and gave them to the landlord even though they were post-dated), and also your bank (who accepted improper checks, and failed to act as your representative, possibly breached fiduciary duty).

dl2u3n9,thisiswhereilive,80,"Mike -
The reason these conspiracy guys are thriving is due to the lack of communication from Poloniex on major questions from your customers. (I'm one of those, I'm a market maker on your exchange)

The Bitcoin cash fork is completely unanswered and with the current high value of the fork coin, everyone is very upset on the lack of clarity of the fork and what action (if any) that the exchange will do on the matter.

Further, ticket reply times appear to be insanely long. I have one ticket right now that has been unanswered for almost 2 months. I have a ticket on the bitcoin cash fork also unanswered - though that one is more recent. I understand that the company is overwhelmed with support requests from the recent explosion in alt coin trading, but patience only goes so far.

The major elephant in the room though - is what are you going to do with the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars that you hold in bitcoin cash? It seems very bizarre that the company does not make it completely explicit what they are going to do with the funds. Even if the answer is - we are going to wait a week to see if this is viable/above a certain value before supporting or allowing withdrawals. We want to know - that at the time of the fork, the company has all the data it needs (which you should) to credit our accounts with the appropriate amount of bitcoin cash.

Further, twitter is not an appropriate mode of communication - why am I not getting emails from the exchange on major topics but instead have to read press releases? Further, emails on these types of issues are also important - they don't have to be mandatory - let me opt in to get emails on service disruptions. A major issue here is communication and poloniex is really poorly attending to these concerns.",2017-08-03 05:49:17
dl2n41c,y-c-c,74,"The tricky part of Bitcoin or any distributed ledger (Bitcoin is really a global record / ledger keeping track of all transactions ever spent) is ""*who gets to be the record keeper?*"".

If a centralized party (let's say a bank) gets to be the one to keep track of things, that ledger can be hacked or messed with and leading to issues like denying someone from spending money, or reverting someone's transaction without their consent, or double paying (paying someone to get the thing you want, then erasing that record and paying another party using the same money).

The key innovation of Bitcoin was to come up with a way where *anyone* can be a record keeper. Roughly every 10 minutes, everyone keeps rolling dices until they hit jackpot, where the winner gets to aggregate all the valid outstanding transactions the time period and put them into the record book (transactions become ""'confirmed""). After that, rinse and repeat and everyone starts rolling dices again. Being the record keeper also yields financial reward, which is an incentive for record keepers to keep doing what they do. Since we assume more than 50% of people who roll dices are honest, the system works and the record is not compromised.

The way Bitcoin record keepers ""roll dice"" is basically by doing these math computations that yields random results. Your CPU power determines how many dice throws you can make per second. The more people who try to throw dices, the harder it is for you to win, so you need to invest in more powerful computers to compete. The record keepers are also called ""*miners*"" since they keep digging and randomly they will hit jackpot and find gold. It's the dual nature of service (record keeping to protect the integrity of the books, while using tons of CPU cycles) and reward (being record keeper means you get to keep the mined reward and transaction fees) that makes Bitcoin work.",2017-08-03 03:53:07

And trust me, you WANT to do this before today ends, as I can tell you right now that this would affect your future and it can POSSIBLY also make it much more profitable for you. I will give you a short and easy intro to bitcoin and other related terms so you will feel easy.

Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency and that's it, there is nothing more to it. If you understand those two words than you can easily understand what bitcoin is. Think of it as a $ for now and how your bank handles those $$$.

The most important aspect of bitcoin is that it resides on a decentralized network instead of a central one like a Bank, meaning that in the case of a Bank the information of users, their transactions resides on the Bank servers at a central location instead of being decentralized (meaning distributed across peers) like Bitcoin. Peers means Clients like you and me using our computer to access the banking site and the Central server being that bank website itself that has all the information about you and all others. In even easier terms, Bitcoin works like a torrent does, there is no server (bank site) that you can download the files from, rather you get it from other users (peers) in the network.

See [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833) page and after that watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8) video and I can guarantee you that you'd have a better understanding of how Digital Cryptocurrencies work better than most people on earth before the video ended.

dl2g95x,TheRealMotherOfOP,46,"*21 million. 

Also, solving these math problems sounds silly to some. Explain it like using hardware power to maintain network and getting a fee to do so. 

Edit: for those interested in the mining aspects. As some might have noticed, the gpu market has seen a large rise in price and out of stock gpu's due to the rise of cryptocurrency mining. Most mine ethereum or other coins which are still profitable. 

Bitcoin however, like other crypto coins are designed to be harder to mine as we near the total hard cap of 21 million (currently 16,5 mined). Thus, more hardware power is needed. For normal people it isn't profitable anymore and large scale mining farms (and the rise of ASIC gpu's) are doing most of the mining now.

If there are still people interested in mining or cryptocurrency visit r/bitcoin and r/btc (note these subs support a different side of the recent Bitcoin split) and r/cryptocurrency (there are many subs for each different project/coin).

Look at mining for altcoins which are still profitable but look at it as if you support a project and invest in it. It is not free money as many asume. 

Also, the market has seen newer coins which don't require mining at all but are distributed in different ways. Projects like ethereum with smart contracts use tokens, look at these as if it where company stocks. ",2017-08-03 02:00:11

It's speculated that information involving the AlphaBay takedown resulted in this arrest and it seems like he was not the only party that was detained.**

The 3 WannaCry addresses used that held the Bitcoin from the exploit have been drained.

The movement of the coins could not be related at all, or could be a result of one of the parties detained having also been involved in the WannaCry attack. 

It could also just be a very convenient time to move them to make the appearance of a correlation, to further cover the tracks of the actual individual involved who may have no relation to the people who were taken into custody.

The addresses of the coins are:

https://blockchain.info/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94

https://blockchain.info/address/12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw

https://blockchain.info/address/115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn

**For those who don't understand what that means:**

The ransomware listed 1 of 3 Bitcoin addresses on the screen and told the victims to send Bitcoin there if they want their stuff back.

Forgetting the details of how that would work (protip: It didn't and was never meant to) these 3 addresses slowly built up as more and more people sent Bitcoin to them in hopes of recovering their files.

They have remained built up on these addresses until today.

[**This site**](https://www.elliptic.co/wannacry/) shows the balance over time and although it starts dropping steadily towards the end, it appears to a rendering glitch because the URLs above show no outbound transactions until today.

**Edit - Some clarification:**

You can't move Bitcoins from an address without control of the private keys associated with that address.

Bitcoins can't be revoked, returned, frozen, seized, or denied movement by any agency.

On the other hand, private keys can be written, stored, memorized, engraved, tattooed, buried, broken up into pieces, or be a combination of multiple keys where you only need 3 out of 5 to move them, or 8 out of 9, or 1 out of 15, etc...

Then the EEA3 announcement dropped - MasterCard was joining.  We shot up to $250 in minutes.  $270 on some exchanges.  GDAX died, but I probably didn't need to tell you that.  The price settled around $230.  Everyone was strapped in for a nice gradual climb back to the high $200's.
  
A day or two later, we found out there was a bug in a parity multi-sig wallet and someone had made off with millions - the bug was a poorly coded smart contract that allowed an attacker to take ownership of the wallet.  Prices tanked to $190 in minutes.  But wait!  It turns out a group of white-hat hackers found out about the hack and were able to save the majority of funds by stealing them first.  Price rebounded to $210.  The white-hat recovered funds have since been returned to the original owners.  (fucking heroic efforts here, if you ask me)
  
We then sank, with anticipation building for the Bitcoin fork.  Where there was rampant uncertainty and fear regarding the fork before, there was now massive FOMO to get both BTC and BCH (Bitcoin Cash).  Our ratio bottomed at an anemic .065 at one point and we saw another dip to $175.  And it wasn't just ETH getting hit - BTC was green for days, everything else was red.  BTC was vaccuuming up cash from all of crypto.
  
When the fork hit on Aug 1, money immediately returned to ETH and alts.  We were back to $230 in a few hours.  BCH, which many thought would die a quick and horrendous death, has traded everywhere from $100 to $1000 since Tuesday.  It's still nuts.  Also interestingly, BTC itself took a quick fall to $2700, but has remained pretty strong.  Many predicted it would share it's previous market cap with BCH, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

dl7avw7,EyesEarsMouthAndNose,354,"Bitcoin created decentralized trust. Understanding the implications of this are critical in understanding bitcoin. 

As OP described wonderfully above, our current system relies on a bank to act as a trusted third-party when two parties are transacting. For example, when I swipe a debit card at a store, the bank tells the store that I have enough funds to pay for my items. The store trusts the bank response, thus trusting me to walk out of the store with merchandise and that they will be paid. 

Bitcoin shows that trust doesn't need a centralized third-party (i.e. banks) to establish trust. You can have a decentralized network of trust instead. People can easliy, safely, and securely transact on this network of decentralized trust. This is ground breaking. It completely disrupts a major value proposition for banks. ",2017-08-05 23:47:27

###Edit
Hijacking my own top comment to explain what is probably the situation.

ViaBTC was probably managing transactions suboptimally, causing them to need to spend their own unconfirmed transactions. Some jerk started messing with this by malleating those unconfirmed transactions and that caused transactions not to go through as expected. They realized this and now need a bit of time to improve things. So they announced that they need a bit of time.

That's all. Money was never at risk. It's just a bit tricky to get through the first days with so little hash power.

dl6zuyz,neo5eva,88,"I will try my best to address every point.

1) The wallets you mentioned are by the Chinese community rather than the by the official NEO team. If you really want a more trustworthy wallet, you can try CoZ's and the core wallet (doesn't support iOS though). edit (read fabwa's comment down below me) 

2) Not sure exactly what you mean by that but I will agree that the website has a lot of little details just scream amateur-hour. Links often don't work and a lot of terms in the whitepaper have yet to be changed from Antshares to NEO. So we are all hoping Aug 8th will ease our concerns but at this point we are only speculating. There will be a website update, smart contract 2.0 and new white papers on 8th Aug.

3) Again see point two. The website is bad I completely agree. Again, hopefully these will be fixed with the new one. It's important to note that Da has insisted strongly they don't care about marketing and only want to focus on the tech. If we are charitable with his position then I suppose it is not a strong reason to FUD NEO. Even though, personally I would prefer more refined marketing to be done. I really don't see why he can't do more with marketing. 

4) Erik wants an extremely strict definition of what is considered a ""core"" developer. So there are only 2 core developers on the platform. Their justification is that core developers actually don't need to do a lot of coding and most of the time is actually spend designing the protocol/platform. They further reinforce the point that as of recently there are only 15 core bitcoin developers so they think for the size of NEO right now, 2 isn't unreasonable. (Personally I am not sure how many core devs are in BTC to verify this statement so I am just taking his word for it) Finally, in the interview Da did with Boxmining YouTube channel, Da said that all NEO team wants to do is ONLY at the protocol/platform level. They don't even want to spend time developing a core iOS wallet because they want the community to do it. And look what happened, an amazing group like CoZ stepped the fuck up and did it! Now we have a community led council! 

5) China doesn't support private companies you are right. They never do and vice-versa, they clearly support their own national companies. They are called state-owned companies for a reason so I am not sure what's your point. I am a Chinese person myself and it is my opinion that while the Chinese government never really actively support private companies but they often will SUPPRESS private companies if they are out of line from the communist party's vision. Whatever is considered as ""disrupting the social order"" will get stopped with zero regards of ""your rights"" or whatever. There are no reasons right now for China to suppress NEO because NEO is attempting to digitalise assets rather than becoming a cryptocurrency. **Key point about digitisation of asset is that it will require the government for verification of identity**. There is actually lots of incentives to help NEO establish an economy based on digital asset because it allow things easier to be traced. REMEMBER that NEO will not be anonymous like how the blockchain/crypto community was first envisioned and I feel a lot of people in the cyptosphere are still hung up on that point. It doesn't really matter whatever ideals you stand for, whether you are a libertarian or a communist, NEO is not planning on stepping on the toes of the Chinese government by staying clear away from RMB by reinforcing that they are a digital asset driven platform. In a previous video (again by boxmining, great channel that's largely not involved with politics), the CEO of BCC (second largest and the first BTC exchange in China), [Bobby Lee said that they are getting around](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6rbyut/some_mild_easing_for_those_with_regulatory/) the regulations by calling BTC a digital asset. If anything, bitcoin is actually more at risk than NEO since it is easier to use BTC to smuggle large sum of money away from China right now while digital assets (remember your identity is attached to it) is much easier to track because your identity is attached to it!  

6) In my opinion this hype has only grew organically partly due to the lack of communication NEO has provided to the western audiences. If you go read the Chinese communication they have been pretty active in my opinion. It's just that we can't understand their talks/posts so it just seems like they don't exist. They have many hours worth of presentations on YouTube, I remember someone back in r/antshares day even hired a translator to translate a video.

dl6mibe,Rishodi,70,"At first, I was highly skeptical of the claims made in this post. I thought this was likely the result of either malware or user error. But upon taking a closer look, neither is the case.

I was able to replicate the problem exactly as OP did. Using a screenshot from OP's video, I was able to make Blockchain.info's QR code scanner produce the exact same address which is shown in the video (1CpwMvHBu4hRWw1qQ9h2QEincQhhH8xfMa).

It is true that for at least a week, Coinbase's mobile app was generating malformed QR codes with a missing colon. (I noticed this bug myself on Thursday, July 27.) So, I tried correcting the malformed QR code from Coinbase by adding the missing colon, and this resulted in Blockchain.info scanning and displaying the address correctly.

Therefore, I can say with certainty that this problem was not the result of malware. It is almost certainly due to a bug on Blockchain.info whereby malformed QR codes are not being properly error checked. Developers *must* assume that literally any data can be input into a QR code scanner. If it is not 100% correct, it should be disregarded. The scan should either fail, or an error message should be displayed to the user informing them that the image contains invalid data.

I can't investigate any further at the moment, but I will try to dig in deeper if I have time. This occurrence was the result of two interacting bugs, one of which was the fault of Coinbase and the other the fault of Blockchain.info. However, since input error checking is a crucial and indispensable component of software engineering, and malformed QR codes could be produced by innumerable sources, it is my professional opinion that Blockchain.info bears full responsibility for this occurrence and should fully compensate OP for his losses.

However, it's also my professional opinion that Coinbase should be responsible for displaying the textual bitcoin address any time that its corresponding QR code is displayed. Failing to do so is borderline negligence, because it makes it unnecessarily difficult for users to verify addresses when sending bitcoin transactions without copying and pasting, as OP did in the video.

**Edit**: I was able to verify what happened. The malformed QR code, no longer conforming to BIP 21 spec, nonetheless was recognized as a Base58-encoded private key by the Blockchain.info wallet. So the string of text ""bitcoin*1aDdr3sS...*"" was itself interpreted as a private key and used to derive the associated address, which is where OP's funds were sent. I waited to divulge this information until I could return to this thread and verify that the addresses OP posted in this thread were not the ones where he tried to send funds. If one of them had been a match, anyone could have stolen the misdirected bitcoins.

OP will be able to recover his funds using the list of addresses which are associated with his Coinbase account. One of them will be a match. It remains my opinion that Blockchain.info bears responsibility here, because it makes no sense to allow users to send to a bitcoin address derived from unchecked private key data. WIF and mini private keys are acceptable, since they have error-checking mechanisms built in. I opened an issue on github [here](https://github.com/blockchain/My-Wallet-V3-Frontend/issues/1241).

**Edit #2**: Thanks to /u/gabridome for the gold!

One group are the spoiled millenials living in Samsung apartments bought with their parents' money, driving their Hyundai Genesis their grandparents bought them as a graduation gift to a job they were 'networked' into by their uncle. They've been kicking themselves for years for 'missing out' on Bitcoin, and jumped onto the Ethereum train once it started making waves after the first EEA announcement. They have a good amount of cash to blow and for the most part just hold their stacks (except when there's a panic dump, then they sell everything and cry to their aunt about how unfair life is).

The second group are disillusioned office workers in their 40s-50s. Most of them are married but don't really notice it any more because they spend 12 hours a day 6 days a week at work and then a few hours more at 'company dinners' (where the main course is soju, the Korean equivalent of vodka) every other night. 20 years ago, they watched Starcraft obsessively and spent their free time discussing betting 'strategies' for the next pro league season; 10 years ago, they were all over online poker. Now, crypto 'trading' is their roulette of choice, and even though they usually don't invest a lot of money at a time (it's usually the allowances their wives allow them to take out every month, or their work bonuses they route into a secret account), this group is the main driving force behind the massive ETH/KRW and ETH/XRP volumes -- they 'day trade' the SHIT out of everything as other gambling forms are illegal and nowadays more difficult to get into. 

The 'pros' are by far the smallest group -- IT, fintech, or just generally brainy guys; unlike the other two groups, they have accounts on exchanges all over the world, not just in Korea; they actually understand what crypto currencies are about and make their picks based on fundamentals as well, not just whichever coin had the biggest gain % yesterday. Many of these guys have been organizing meetups and community groups to educate other folks about what cryptos are and what to do with them quite actively in the recent times (Seoul has a crypto meetup pretty much daily nowadays). They understand the implications of blockchain disruptions, but very few of them are idealists willing to buy into a coin because of its ideas or whatever if they don't see it as the optimum way for profits, anyway. A lot of those guys are self-made kids who are pretty jaded and jealous about money-related things and get rich quick is definitely the main motivator far more often than whatever ideals of decentralization or something. 


So yeah, pretending Koreans are so heavily invested into Ethereum because they care so much about crypto ideals and tech or something is a little silly. I mean, look at XRP/KRW and ETC/KRW volumes. You think they're in those because of the 'tech', too?

No, no /u/MemoryDealers , you lie yet again.

We, Bitcoiners, **do offer technical explanation why your altcoin will have problems** - and why we do not want 8 MB blocks (at least now) in Bitcoin.

In reply to this points, always a FUD army jumps out, repeating same tired lies like ""SegWit means anyone can spend my coins omg"", and discussion on this sub is impossible with such FUDers because of the 10 minutes limit.

**Here come the arguments**.  (I could discuss them on **uncensored subs** if someone likes, but **not here**.)

1) 8 MB blocks, and by 2022 also 500 MB blocks (if we want in 5 years replace VISA) will cause very long initial sync times for people who want to have **trustless money** and verify for themselves all transactions right from Genesis block. In years it will take weeks to sync even 8mb, and syncing 500 MB would take months.

2) even now initial sync time (CPU, network 160 GB) is too great for many users

3) less and less nodes will host all this data, most will prune - even now most do. With 500 MB blocks one day a gov will attack all the specialised hosting companies who have the last copies of fat bcash ""bitcoincash"" chain

We should have more then 6000 full-nodes (of which probably half is just a prunned node), distributed among ordinary ""we, the people"".

---

4) Also, telling the Entire World about every smallest transaction you ever make is just stupid.

5) And that is bad for your privacy as well. Much more sense to make interests/business especially with ""locals"" or between ""usual customers"" in secret, and just report at end of the month to the public (to the chain). You know bandits, IRS, mafia, hackers, your enemies, everyone does read the blockchain you know... do I need to tell them **at which hours I buy my coffee** each day?

I would rather just **report to the government at most** once a month ""yeah the balance between me and my friend barista is that he in totall got +10 USD out of it... and it is no one's interest what happened in between!"".
---

---

So yeah, **Roger Ver lied** about small-block supporters **not presenting technical arguments** - I presented them above (and everyone always said this arguments, and maybe more like it, in basically each such discussion).

We might discuss this points (not here, not with 10minute limit) - but we certainly DO PRESENT TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS.

Therefore, **will you retract your lies now?** Please? **Roger?**

---

As to the arguments evaluation, I would say based on them that **Only-level1-scaling is just a bad idea**.

In fact... so bad, ***that no one does it** .

Since like **2009 year we have 2-layer scaling**, and most of us use it.

The exchanges accounts, are 2-nd layer scaling - because - you do not do 1000 on-chain transactions when your tradebot or you do 1000 micro trades playing on the exchange rate.

The problem with that always have been, **that this is totally insecure** and exchanges are goxxed away with your Bitcoin.
We need that to be trust-less.  So here comes in SegWit, opening 2-way payment channels, and Lighting Network.

You know, even you admitted we need the Lighting Network.

Yes, **Roger Ver says Bitcoin""Cash""** (BCash) will **use Lighting Network**.  And so many of your minions here argued you guys will do everything on-chain, LOL.

You guys do know that BCash is still getting 2-lnd layer, and that you will NOT SCALE ON CHAIN ONLY, yes? Because fudarmy tells me otherwise daily.
---

Also you know we need SegWit. Or something working like it. You call it flex-dragqueen or something. But it is basically the same.

So you, Roger Ver, owner of you guys here, this sub, and the BCH ""bitcoincash"" coin - do agree we need 2-nd layer solutions, and we can not just scale on 1st layer.

**And your conned minions here, do not even know that, lol.**

---

By the way, about you guys being childishly [triggered] by **""BCash""**, like some army of Antifa or other SJWs.  As usuall with snowflakes, you created the **problem for yourself - yourself**:

maybe you should **NOT steal names of other projects**, if you do not want to get then **renamed by the community**.

""Just take a name and append a word to it."" - is what you do.

Can everyone take your project and just append ""Super"" to end of it? Yeah as real ancap I would say he ""can"", but many people will call that an asshole-move, and will use some other name just to avoid confusion.

In addition, BCash is not in any way derogatory shortcut for ""BitcoinCash"". Really. 

Ah also the ticker... BCC ticker is even worse - already taken by BitConnect. 

Even assuming name ""BitcoinCash"" (with no space in middle, or it looks like adjective to the Bitcoin, which we all know is a SEPARATE CHAIN now), BCash and BCH are totally normal and fine shortcuts for it.

---

In summary, BCash still WILL do 2-nd layer, will do lighting, and will do something like SegWit;
---

Only difference is that you first do on-chain increase, and we first do the cool new tech and then evaluate is on-chain increase still needed, because it comes at practical long-term cost of making it harder to run large p2p network, as we always say.

This is why there is... **almost no reason to use Bitcoin""Cash""**... Bitcoiners will use real Bitcoin for progress.

btw. it (Bitcoin Core chain / client) is certainly the real Bitcoin now, by hashpower and by **being the longest (most work on it) chain** - so by your prised ""Satoshi's white paper"" too.

And if Bitcoin+SegWit+Lighting is too congested then... well, then Bitcoin can still increase chain capacity.
Doing that **in this order** gives us a chance of small chain and healthy **p2p**.

**P2P electronic cash forever, baby!**  Do not just trust, TRUSTLESS P2P - verify all blocks! :)

Btw, Bitcoin+SegWit+LN is **more the ""cash"" approach**, because with cash you do not report every transaction to everyone, you do in in ""Secret"" beteween 2 parties... just like in LN channel :)     **Original Bitcoin - trustless p2p CASH yeaaaah** :D

However, I think it's not unexpected that there would be a fair bit of excitement about Bitcoin Cash. After all, it was the week's big news. 

Like you, I was hoping that the factioning and poisonous debates would subside now that the choices wished for by those expressing to a particular viewpoint are available to all. We can hope the community as a whole can let go of the past and move on. I fear, though, that such a wish may be in vain. There will always be individuals who enjoy causing division.

Meanwhile, I value the open moderation policy of this sub and I am confident that it will continue. If you can get past the politics, you will find reasonable people even at the extremes of the spectrum of debate.

As ever, the real challenge of Bitcoin is that it demands that each individual think for themselves. You can expect that in a sub with 52k readers, there will likely be 52k different positions spanning the entire spectrum of opinion.

dl8e8iq,Almost_a_TANK,64,"Alright, wall of text aside, you have some valid questions for a PC newbie. I'll answer them when I can.

- For your FPS, your graphics card and processor are the two main components that give you FPS. For CPU intensive games, the CPU will be more important and vice versa for graphically intensive games, so depending on what games you want to play and at whatever resolution, you should buy your parts accordingly.

- For motherboards, or mobos to keep it short, what you have to look for is the socket and chipset. The socket indicates which processors will work on the board, so LGA-1151 for Intel's Kaby Lake lineup, or AM4 for AMD's Ryzen lineup. The chipset indicates what features the board has, like support for overclocking, SLI/Crossfire compatibility, more SATA and M.2 slots, among other features.

- For building a PC or buying a pre-built, in regards to pre-builts, it depends on the price of the pre-built, it's features and whether or not you have time to build a PC. I'd always recommend trying to build a PC, as it isn't as daunting as you might think, but if time is a constraint, then buy smartly when it comes to pre-builts, because despite what some folks over on /r/pcmasterrace say, you can find pre-builts that are good value.

- Depending on where you're buying from, the US having the best prices, if you're buying a new system, peripherals and monitor and want it to run at 1080p at 60FPS on high settings, I'd take a stab and say about $800 if you spend a little less on the less important things. I'll give you an example later on.

- If you're looking for helpful websites to learn about PCs and how to build a PC, look no further. /r/buildapc has a post on just about every topic or question you could think of. As for watching how a PC is built, check out PCPartPicker's Youtube channel. They have builds for various budgets and do them step by step. Once I watched just one build being put together, it didn't seem so scary when my PC arrived at the door.

- For your 6th question, it'd take a little too long for my liking to explain in detail what each part does, but this subreddit does answer that very question, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/partsguide).

- Cryptominers are people who use computers for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but in this case, Etherium is the new hotness. Majority of the mid-range graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia, AMD more so, have either been sold out everywhere or inflated in price due to Etherium miners taking them. Needless to say, many PC builders aren't happy with them.

- For a monitor choice, you likely can't go wrong with any choice of monitor, but if you're using your PC for gaming, then you want to buy a monitor that won't make your PC struggle. If you're getting something like a GTX 1050ti, then you'd want a 1080p and 60hz monitor, but a 1050ti might not get ultra settings on all games at 1080p, though ultra settings aren't much better looking than high settings if you asked me. If you were getting a GTX 1060/RX 580, a 1080p/60hz monitor would be no problem to use for ultra settings, though a 1080p/144hz or 1440p/60hz monitor would be viable options if you like your games on mid-high settings. If you're looking for opinions on a specific monitor, check out /r/monitors for that.

Here's a decent 1080p gaming PC that comes with a monitor and peripherals for $800, though there are some incremental upgrades you could make to this build if you were to increase your budget, like say, a stronger GPU or CPU, this build is more of a foundation. I'd recommend the R3 1200 processor if you're looking for a budget processor, but if you can afford it, the R5 1400 is a decent step-up. The GTX 1050ti, while it isn't the best GPU for 1080p gaming, that belongs to the GTX 1060 and RX 580, is sufficient enough for the job, and also keep in mind, for a gaming rig, the GPU is the most replaced bit of hardware on average, so if you save up some money and when Etherium ends, you could always upgrade to a stronger GPU in the near future.

dl7j4nu,GoldankTheMemarch,55,"No, this is actually a big joke. The bitcoin system is extremely well designed but suffers from a huge flaw. Indeed it does not use a third party to garantee transaction. Instead it uses the worktime (not workforce but worktime) of a huge network of computers. The fact that garantee is based on worktime and not workforce is supposed to prevent hacking from becoming trivial because of augmentation of computers power.
But indexation on worktime also means that bitcoin safety is directly backed by energy consumption. As long as computer power rises, their energy consumption rise alike. If an energy crisis happens and the price of electricity skyrockets, the network that garantees bitcoins will crumble as mining becomes economically inefficient. Miners would rarify, until the point where the currency becomes easy to hack and therefore unstable, then is completely given up. Meanwhile, banks can work with pens and papers would the need arise, making them effectively crisis proof.

Now, I'm no economy specialist, so if someone wants to point me wrong, they are welcome.",2017-08-06 02:52:35

There would be 16.8Million Bitcoins for the worlds wealthiest 1.4Billion people to share and 4.2Million for the rest of the 5.6Billion to share.

Among that top 20% we can further assume a 80/20 distribution

So the worlds wealthiest 280Million people will have 13.4Million coins to split.

If we repeat this process 3 more times we get an estimate that the wealthiest 11Million people will have a total of 8Million coins to split amongst themselves.

Somewhere between 2 and 10million people will ever own 1 full Bitcoin or more.

dl8v4lp,singularity87,936,"People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did not create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.

dl8v5kl,singularity87,677,"While this was all going on, Blockstream and it's employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and no complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a ""lets wait and see what comes from the conferences"" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin). 

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February last year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

dl90t7l,OrderAmongChaos,178,"&gt; Bitcoin transactions are at maximum from certain groups making penny transactions to make it look like many people are using bitcoin. 

You realize that all transactions in Bitcoin are visible, right? You can just look at them to verify this isn't true. What's the point in saying something that can be instantly verified to be a flat-out lie?

https://blockchain.info 

There's a lot of genuine criticisms of Bitcoin (e.g. scalability) you can talk about, but to directly post lies makes no sense, and does nothing but discredit the remainder of what you say.

dl9uovz,theymos,110,"First, note that most of the positive respondents there are /r/btc posters pretending to be hearing this for the first time, even though this is an old copypasta which pretty much everyone will have seen.

&gt; Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

Wrong. bitcoin.org is ultimately controlled by Cobra, who was given it by Sirius, who was given it by Satoshi. The bitcointalk.org domain name is similarly controlled by Cobra, while I administrate the site.

&gt; It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network.

It was put in place *by Satoshi* because the software clearly couldn't handle it. There were no tx spam attacks occurring at the time. In fact, we now know that Satoshi's original software couldn't handle even 1MB blocks. This caused the BIP50 incident, where nodes running the older database code written by Satoshi started randomly failing once miners started creating larger blocks. Satoshi's original software had soft limits which made it never produce blocks over 500kB, and very rarely over 250kB.

&gt; When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free

Wrong. The very first versions set aside some portion of blocks for free transactions. If that was full, then they started requiring fees. The fee logic worked much the same as today's code; it's just that free transactions were *sometimes* possible/allowed because there was essentially no tx volume. The same situation exists today on most altcoins.

&gt; There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen.

Gavin had already resigned as Bitcoin Core lead dev at that point, and had not contributed in any significant way to Bitcoin Core for about a year.

XT had very little support.

&gt; Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands.

If you want to use this ridiculous feudalism argument, I can ""draw authority from Satoshi"" in four separate ways: as bitcointalk.org head admin (originally Satoshi), as owner of bitcoins.org/bitcoin.net (originally owned by Satoshi), as one of the old alert key trustees (originally created by Satoshi), and as the backup domain administrator of bitcoin.org (originally owned by Satoshi). Gavin on the other hand voluntarily resigned as Bitcoin Core lead developer in favor of Wladimir.

(The above is not a good argument; I don't use it except in response to similar arguments.)

&gt; Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed.

Gavin's original solution, which was to push through 20MB block sizes ASAP, was later shown in research *by bigblockers* to have been unsafe.

&gt; A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous

More like **almost all experts**.

&gt; The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners.

This has never been a concern of mine -- I believe that mining is already hopelessly centralized and beyond saving --, and it's at most a tangential concern of other decentralists.

&gt; The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream.

Absolutely false. All developers who worked for Blockstream rejected 20MB blocks, just like all developers who worked for Blockstream would've rejected the idea that the sky is green. But Blockstream employees are only a small percentage of Bitcoin Core devs, and almost all Bitcoin Core devs as well as almost all experts opposed Gavin's ridiculous 20MB proposal and the later still-ridiculous 10MB and 8MB proposals.

&gt; For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years.

With Gavin's original proposal of 20MB blocks, the block chain would grow by up to ~1TB per year.

But storage is generally a straw-man argument -- due to pruning, storage is *mostly* solved, and has been for years. Storage is way down on the list of concerns for large block sizes. See my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6nq1gs/how_does_segwit_maintain_low_system_requirements/dkbemse/) for the actual concerns. (Back in 2014-2015, bandwidth was also a very major concern, but since then compact blocks -- roughly the same thing as IBLTs mentioned by Gavin -- have been added to Core, improving this a lot.)

&gt; They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months

This agreement was between some miners and a handful of notable devs: Peter Todd, Luke-Jr, BlueMatt, and Adam Back IIRC. Those people were only representing themselves, not anyone else, and this was made extremely clear in the agreement. Even if they had been representing Blockstream or Bitcoin Core as a whole, a little group of people like this can't make decisions on behalf of Bitcoin.

&gt; This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.  
&gt; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team.

Funny how the Bitcoin Core lead developer works for MIT, then.

In reality, only a few Bitcoin Core devs are Blockstream employees.

&gt; Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos.

Blockstream is a for-profit company. I respect several of their employees, but I don't care about the company itself. I've actually always been critical of SPV-secured sidechains, which is one of Blockstream's flagship ideas, since it strikes me as being too insecure to be useful in most cases.

I recently [warned against trusting any organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ouok5/this_comment_deserves_its_own_thread_its_about/dkky3yj/), as every organization will eventually be corrupted. I owe no allegiance to Core or Blockstream (which is separate from Core); I *support good ideas*.

Regarding /r/Bitcoin moderation: my position has always been that if you don't like how we do it, then you can leave. We try to make /r/Bitcoin as good as possible in spite of Reddit's many inherent flaws, but it's not going to please everyone. To make a large subreddit useful, aggressive moderation is sometimes necessary, but we've never taken the position of banning all bigblockers or anything like that. When people get banned, it's usually for behaving in a way that would get you banned on a great many other subreddits.

We **do not** allow the dangerous and deceptive practice of trying to get people to run non-consensus software. Some may have noticed that we banned links to binaries of BIP148, since that was non-consensus software, even though I mostly agreed with what BIP148 was trying to do. If you don't agree with this policy, again, you're free to leave.",2017-08-07 15:41:57

Litecoin is NOT going to automatically be mooning with Bitcoin. It is the exact opposite. The main reason Digital money is really good is because it is INFINITELY divisible. 

There doesn't need to be a ""smaller denomination"" of Bitcoin (so please, just STOP with the Silver/gold analogy). If Charlie Lee wants his creation to survive and Thrive (and at this point, I'm not even sure that he does): He needs to commit to making Litecoin Great....even greater than Bitcoin. 

Its ironic, because right now, its already BETTER than bitcoin. It only needs adoption, and a strong market to support and make it grow. If Charlie could just say stuff like ""Hey, Bitcoin is great and all, but Litecoin is much better to use, so why don't we make Bitcoin the savings account and Litecoin the Checkings account"" or something like that.

That would literally put ALL of this CNBC shit to rest. But instead he's just really focusing on Bitcoin while ignoring Litecoin.

dlbyjak,BoppeBoye,149,"I don't disagree. Wall-E is the most foreseeable future, imo. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In the future, our brains will become our only necessary organ, along with anything required to keep it operating. Right now, that means we need stupid legs and kidneys and lungs. But, in the future, who is to say that our bodies won't entirely become vestigial &amp; our brains are the only important thing left to us?

I mean, we're pretty much the weakest animal already. Birds have better eyesight than us (and can fly), primates have bigger muscles  than our strongest specimens, without even trying. Everything that you can conceivably do, another animal can do better... Except reason. Reason is the quality which humans excel at.

So, in my opinion, the future will result in our bodies only being useful to us insofar as it preserves our brains. But, who's to say that in 200 years, we haven't invented the Matrix, or cyborg bodies? We can all live in a VR world where our physical bodies are meaningless, and we can dedicate our brainpower to whatever it's needed for without wasting more of Earth's resources to keep our shitty inefficient lungs operating.

This is perhaps too sci-fi for CMV, but I think that's the best option we can hope for. Think about it, your brain is extracted from your body &amp; placed into a jar. They drip feed your brain with whatever nutritional mixture is most efficient to keep it alive, eliminating the need to have massive farms full of livestock. You'd eliminate the need for cars, for housing. Mankind would take up less physical space on Earth and consume less resources... And if we decided to colonize space, we'd just send a bunch of brainjars out there with drones they could operate if they needed to interact with the outside world.

Meanwhile, the human brain is the most complex computer ever, right? Capable of making decisions and computations on a much higher level than any machine that's ever been programmed. So you get to live in a virtual world and live out all of your fantasies or whatever (whether it's all a simulation you enjoy alone, or it's a shared world where you can interact with other people in VR), and in exchange you dedicate some of your brainpower each day to the AI, which uses you to solve some complex equations and whatnot. Sorta like a bitcoin farm, except instead of having to keep a server in your apartment, it's just your brain doing the work.

Anyway, nothing I said it particularly original. This is actually just the plot of the Matrix... I'm pretty sure that thing about humans being batteries was retconned. They realized how stupid it sounded, so in the Animatrix they changed it so that the machines are actually using human brain power to run their computers. Hopefully, IRL we don't reject the programming like they mention in the Matrix films.

TL;DR - Wall-E/The Matrix is actually the ideal future. In a few generations, I wouldn't be surprised if physical labor becomes obsolete altogether, and a few generations after that I would expect that humans will start to transcend our physical bodies via technology.",2017-08-08 23:51:42

dlcg9m0,btctroubadour,208,"How did you manage to send BTC to a Litecoin address? (Don't they usually start with L? Or was this a P2SH address starting with 3, which could also be considered a valid BTC address?)

Yes, should be able to recover it, but it'll be a hazzle unless someone (e.g. SatoshiLabs themselves) creates software specifically for it (like they did for retrieving BCH from BTC addresses - this'll be the same, except you'd be retrieving BTC from LTC addresses).

If you want to do it manually, you'll likely have to use the recovery seed (i.e. BIP39 Mnemonic) and possibly passphrase (if you've enabled that) at a site like this: https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/

(Note: This should ideally be done offline and/or on a computer that you trust hasn't been compromised in any way and/or a computer you can completely wipe afterwards, typically done by booting up from a live CD or something.)

Then, you'll have to find out the [BIP32 derivation path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0032/derivation.png), which in Trezor's case is modelled after [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) but with Litecoin's ""coin number"" (i.e. 2) istead of Bitcoin's (i.e. 0). Finally, the account number and address number depends on what Litecoin account/address you used - you should be able to find this info in the Litecoin wallet.

Eventually, you'll end up with a derivation path somewhat like this: m / 44' / 2' / 3' / 0 / 5

...which means:

44' = hardened key derivation according to BIP44

2' = hardened key derivation for Litecoin (i.e. [coin index 2](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md))

3' = hardened key derivation for account# 4 (0-indexed)... you need to change this to the *actual* account number that you sent the BTC to, remembering to start counting from 0

0 = normal key derivation for external-facing address series (as opposed to internal ""change"" addresses, which would've been represented by a 1)

5 = normal key derivation for address# 6 (0-indexed)... you need to change this to the *actual* address number that you sent the BTC to, remembering to start counting from 0

Plot all of this info into the BIP39 site, above (again, do it offline, after saving that site locally - it doesn't need to be online to work), and you'll end up with a single private key that represents the Litecoin address in question.

Then, import this key into a Bitcoin (not Litecoin) wallet and you should be able to see and spend the BTC that were (incorrectly) sent to this ""Litecoin"" address.

&gt; However, those who tried to help claimed I needed to wait for segwit to be activated in the Bitcoin network, as Litecoin already supports it.

This may be correct (if the address it was sent to was a Segwit address), but I'm not familiar with Trezor's Litecoin support and what kind of scripts/addresses it generates. If it was a premature Segwit-targetted transaction, you'll probably have to import the private key mentioned above in a Segwit-supporting BTC wallet (but that should be most of them, now that Segwit is about to get activated).",2017-08-09 05:00:04

Ladies and gentlemen, we only have three more days until the greatest league in the world returns for another 9 months of heart-stopping action. The English Premier League kicks off Friday as Leicester City travel to North London against Arsenal. And you can bet your ass I'll have money on *every single* game this weekend. We just have to find a way to entertain ourselves for the intervening 72 hours or so.

I spent most of tonight drinking through a fantasy soccer draft on a roof in the LES. My mind was elsewhere -- I've lost **2.5U** in the last two days on my reddit posts. By my standards, that's a cold streak. I'm icy, coldblooded. It's affecting my personal life. I haven't had a match on Bumble since the moment David Villa's penalty hit the back of the Red Bull's net to make it NYC 3-2 NJ Sunday evening. I have to break out of this rut before the PL season starts. There's too much riding on it. My money. My fantasy league. My club. My happiness. My imaginary internet points. I needed a lock.

So I headed toward the local Walmart.

There are no Walmarts in Manhattan island. Nor are there any in Brooklyn. So instead I headed to the Duane Reade next to my apartment.

It's a smelly Duane Reade. It's next to a housing project, but one of the projects that your Instagram friends will avoid walking next to, they cross the street and walk a block in the wrong direction to avoid passing it on the way to the hip rooftop they haven't shut up about. There are too many people streaming out of the brick-and-mortar monoliths within for their liking. In other words, it's my kind of place.

I wandered through the aisles for a few minutes. I checked the employees' nametags as discretely as I could; no Trevors or Tovas or Tammys or anything. I sighed deeply and headed to the register. The cashier was no help. She gave me a smirky side eye as she rang up my Lifestyles Snugger Fits and took my hard earned ~~Bitcoin~~ cash.

I left the Duane Reade empty handed. No locks, not even a whisper of one. I got home and started frantically searching through my bag. The cashier had circled something at the bottom of my receipt, but it was only a link to an online survey. I had nothing, nada.

I won't lie to you guys, it's been a tough few months. Work has been hard. I miss my college friends. Moving took a lot out of me emotionally. And I needed this lock.

I felt a tear roll down my cheek. And then another. And soon I couldn't stop it, I was weeping openly, sitting in the middle of my room. My walls are barren. Soon my checking account will be too.

I don't know how long I sat there -- maybe five minutes, maybe an hour -- but eventually one of the girls I live with came home. She poked her head in my room.

""You okay wrightfan?""

""Yea dude, I'm okay,"" I lied, wiping tears from my eyes. ""I just don't know what I'm going to gamble on tomorrow.""

""Hey man, don't sweat it if you haven't found a lock yet. These stories are elaborate fictions drawn up to flex on internet strangers to show off your handicapping skills and storytelling ability in one fell swoop. You don't need any convenience store salesman or advance stats over ten day periods. Just find two pitchers whose names you recognize and parlay them for a reasonable return on investment.

Lots of strange discussion. Also, I don't know why but there is a TON of hindsight bias in cryptocurrency. You can't enter a thread without people saying ""if only I had bought $1000 of BTC when they were $0.1"". I don't see people in stocks/other markets constantly hitting themselves over lacking a magic crystal ball. I suppose it is because the average person here is in their teens/twenties (based on tone and prevalence of anarcho-thought) and somehow BTC was attainable for them in the early 2010's but it is important to note to each and everyone that there are probably hundreds of opportunities every single week that could make you money that you are missing out on. Bitcoin won't be the last. 

Do you really think that you would have held your $1000 in BTC through massive increases (even from $0.01 to 0.02), several crashes and so on? It is obvious that most people did not otherwise we would be drowning in newly minted millionaires. 

Cryptos are pure speculation relying on the greater fool theory. I have and still do dabble in some cryptos but I am fully aware of it. When I look at a coin I look at it like this: does this coin have enough of a good team behind it, a good proposition and technology behind it for other people to actually believe in it enough to prop up the price in the future? Then I buy it. But I am aware that the bubble could burst now. That nothing will happen.

If you ignore Segwit2X/NYA's effects in activating Segwit you are arguing that

- a minority of users with
- a minority of nodes and
- a minority of economic actors and
- a minority of hashrate

was able to coerce the miners into doing something that they did not want to.

This is not true and this is not what happened. Again, we wouldn't have Segwit right now without BIP148 but we also wouldn't have Segwit right now without Segwit2X.

Segwit2X right now has

- a minority of users with
- a minority of nodes and
- **significant support by economic actors** and
- **a near unanimous super-majority of hashrate**

There was a point - not too long ago - where UASF claimed to represent the economic majority. It failed to do so.
Segwit2X represents a **significant part** of the ecosystem. You can't ignore that.

Of course you can rightfully claim that Segwit2X is rushed (borderline reckless in my opinion) and that it is not developed by Core (which is the most experienced and capable dev team in the space in my opinion).

But let's not pretend that Segwit2X is only wanted by a few individuals in a backdoor meeting and that another minority UASF will be enough to stop it. It will hard-fork anyway and you can't hinder people from forking. Like you said

&gt; We who give value to bitcoin by using it and investing in it

People buying the chain will determine what Bitcoin is, not a ""consensus"" that we can't agree on how to define, reach and measure. 

&gt; our full node wallets enforce the rules to make sure nobody can change the system to illegitimately suit themselves

Miners can spin up as many full nodes as they want. So you end up having 20.000 Segwit2X nodes and 10.000 Core nodes, so what? There is no ""illegitimate"" change to the Bitcoin system because it is permissionless.

Bronies were often mocked, hated, and regarded with contempt there, any right-wing brony content would be posted in and publicized by their anti-brony threads, and SA has a very strong tendency to conflate every group they hate together. Other examples of this happening:

1 The SA reddit.txt megathread thread believed the Reddit userbase was predominantly right-wing, misogynist, homophobic, pedophiles, rapists, and whatever other attributes they perceived as negative and could find by combing the site for posts to cherrypick, back when Reddit was even more strongly and uniformly left-wing than it is now. The members of that thread founded /r/shitredditsays.

2 Back around 2011 when SA was very active in mocking Bitcoin (a SA member was the one to create (NSFW) [Buttcoin.org](http://archive.is/u9Iem)), they often called the Bitcoin community misogynists, bronies (I remember a member of the Bitcoin forums being completely puzzled about where they were getting the bitcoin/bronies association), MRAs, racists, etc. Following the usual pattern the mockery was partially based on the specific community (e.g. mocking the then-price of around $10 as an obvious bubble, which I unfortunately agreed with at the time) but also consisted of associating them with everything else that SA members most hated and cherrypicking as hard as possible to find support for that view.

3 The SA grognards.txt thread on their subforum dedicated to tabletop gaming were both dedicated SJWs and dedicated D&amp;D 4e partisans (this was back when 4e was the most recent edition of D&amp;D). For context, D&amp;D 4e was an unpopular edition that failed to get the majority of the D&amp;D 3.5 playerbase to switch over and ended up being out-competed by Pathfinder, a 3.5 clone from the former writers of Dungeon Magazine that they could publish because of the permissive 3rd edition licence. ""Grognard"" is a prexisting term for an old and curmudgeonly RPG or wargaming player, but the SA version of the stereotype would be a MRA right-wing racist misogynist rape-apologist who favors 3.5 (or earlier) over 4e because he's a casual-hating elitist who is angry about 4e's better mechanics attracting female and non-white players to join the hobby. Weird stories and stereotypes were invented out of nothing or cherrypicked and wildly exaggerated until everyone was familiar with ""the sort of grognard DM who has the Paladin character of a female player raped and Fall as a paladin due to being raped"", despite the lack of such a thing ever actually happening.

An example of their activities was campaigning against the owner of the forum ENWorld (which they also perceived as being anti-4e) because some random member of the forum wrote a fictional organization for use by DMs that was outwardly good and cooperative with the players but supported patriarchal social standards about women belonging in the home and using mind-control magic to enforce this, which the players could discover. He was accused of being a rape-apologist and so on for not immediately censoring the post describing the fictional organization, he eventually ended up deleting the topic because it was ""not suitable for children"". They were also the main ones originally pushing a bunch of outrage after D&amp;D 5e solicited a bunch of prominent community people for early feedback, including 2 that they had hated for years, though that was also picked up by RPG.net (main SJW-aligned RPG community) and twitter. Specifically RPGPundit (has explicitly written articles negative about SJWs) and Zak S (runs the ""D&amp;D With Pornstars"" web series, is pretty much a SJW himself but prefers homebrewed alterations of older versions of D&amp;D, was accused of misogyny, his girlfriend Mandy Morbid was accused of ""deadnaming"", etc.). The have some blog posts talking about it like (NSFW due to URL) [this](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.ca/2014/08/how-dungeons-and-dragons-is-totally-not.html) and [this](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.ca/2015/01/mandy-on-anatomy-of-harassment-campaign.html).

4 The tvtropes.txt thread, in addition to mocking an exaggeration of whatever genuine tendencies tvtropes contributors might have (mostly just being a bit socially awkward and having weeaboo tastes) painted it as a den of pedophiles, misogynists, etc. They managed to get TvTropes's Google Adsense ads temporarily pulled by mass-reporting any page that talked about sex-related tropes. Ultimately they were sucessful, the website owner caved, several tvtropes.txt posters were given moderator positions on TvTropes, and there was a purge of pages they considered problematic (like tropes that referenced sex, the pages for anime series where a high-schooler dates another high-schooler being deleted for ""pedophilia"", etc.). Ended up causing the split to allthetropes.org, but of course they don't have the same name recognition or community inertia.",2017-08-10 08:50:59

dleu77d,btctroubadour,47,"Ok, so the overall plan is to a) find and verify that you've got the right key, b) convert it to Bitcoin format and import it into a segwit-supporting Bitcoin wallet and c) wait for the funds to be spendable. Sounds easy, right? Well, perhaps not.

a) and b) can be done right away, so let's get started:

&amp;nbsp;

[Find the right address](https://i.imgur.com/UgcnisZ.png) in your Trezor Litecoin wallet:

\- Choose Litecoin (#1), chose account (#2), click ""Receive"" (#3).

\- Find and copy the M-address (#4). Example: `MWdtJrjsfeyGBuCVxAx7N4gKsmFShViS1M`

\- Note down the BIP32 derivation path (#5). Example: `m/49'/2'/0'/0/5` (the apostrophes are important!)

\- Go to the [address converter](https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/) (#6).

\- [Convert the M-address to a 3-address](https://i.imgur.com/peWVyja.png) and copy it. Example: `3QRjzyKuiY7qPPvbrHxmYRRvZ4eznfF3Jb`. This *must* match the 3-address that your money were sent to, or you've got the wrong one.

\- Go to some Bitcoin blockchain explorer and check the 3-address. [Verify that it has the money you expect](https://i.imgur.com/xAQcRzC.png). If not, repeat the steps above until you've found the right one. ;)

By the way, the reason Litecoin has [converted from using 3-addresses to using M-addresses](https://blog.trezor.io/litecoins-new-p2sh-segwit-addresses-843633e3e707) is to avoid exactly the problem you're having right now.

&amp;nbsp;

Get the private key for the 3/M-address (both have the same private key, it's just a different encoding of the same data):

\- Go to your *offline* version of the [BIP39](https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/) page

\- Type in the BIP39 mnemonic - aka ""Trezor recovery seed"" (#1), your passphrase - if you have one (#2), choose ""LTC - Litecoin"" (#3) and BIP32 derivation path (#4), as [shown here](https://i.imgur.com/1WGIEGa.png).

\- Now, for the part that requires preciseness: Type in the first four segments of the BIP32 derivation path (#5) [from the Trezor Litecoin wallet], but not the fifth one (we'll find that further down on the page). Example: `m/49'/2'/0'/0`.

Note that it starts with `49'`, not `44'` (which I used as an example in my first post yesterday) due to the fact that the BIP32 derivation path for segwit addresses are somewhat different than ordinary addresses, cf. [BIP49](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki).

&amp;nbsp;

\- Scroll down 'till you find the address index that matches the last segment in the BIP32 derivation path such that the path shown on the left (#6) is *exactly* the same as the one you noted down from the Trezor Litecoin wallet.

\- Record (and keep safe!) the corresponding Litecoin private key (#7).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, without changing anything else, change the Coin selection to Bitcoin, [as shown in (#1) here](https://i.imgur.com/3gLcdfW.png).

\- Scroll down to the correct address path again (#2) and record (and keep safe!) the corresponding Bitcoin private key (#3).

Note that the Litecoin and Bitcoin private keys you've now found really represent the same private key (i.e. the same large number that *is* the private key), they're just *encoded* with a different [base58check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) prefix so that software can easily see what kind of coin this key is *intended* for.

Obviously, in your case, a key intended for Litecoin has been used on the Bitcoin network, which can be a bit of a hassle after-the-fact - but in normal circumstances this is supposed to *help* users prevent unintentional crossovers between currencies/chains.

&amp;nbsp;

Now that you have the private Bitcoin key, you could in theory lean back and wait 2 weeks for segwit activation on the Bitcoin network, but I figured we might as well use the time for something productive: Walking you through the process of importing the key, but using Litecoin Core (which runs on a network where segwit has activated) instead of Bitcoin Core.

This will ensure that you get some dry-run training on how to actually do it - as well as verifying that you've managed to all the steps above. So if you're still with me, here's a few more bullet points:

\- Install Litecoin Core and let it [sync up with the network](https://i.imgur.com/9RYn3qs.png). This may take a while, depending on the beefyness of your internet connection and computer. (Mine took between 3 and 4 hours.)

\- When it's done syncing, [open the ""Debug window""](https://i.imgur.com/KmRoVUN.png).

\- [Import the Litecoin private key](https://i.imgur.com/1DpyUyM.png) like this: `importprivkey &lt;your-privkey-here&gt; ""From Trezor"" false`. The `false` at the end prevents it from scanning through the full Litecoin transaction history to see if you've received any funds (we already know you haven't - on the Litecoin network, anyway)

\- Now open the [""Receiving addresses"" window](https://i.imgur.com/2MrwNII.png) and copy the L-address of the key we just imported (which you will recognize by the ""From Trezor"" label we gave it, above).

\- [Activate the corresponding segwit address](https://i.imgur.com/6GH09xx.png) like this: `addwitnessaddress &lt;your-L-address-here&gt;`. The wallet should respond with an M-address, which is the [P2SH-P2WPKH address](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/) representation of the redeemScript that we talked about yesterday (but that you don't really need to know anything about as long as the wallet handles it for you).

If the wallet responds with an error message saying `Segregated witness not enabled on network (code -4)`, it only means that it isn't done syncing (downloading/verifying) the blockchain all the way to the point were segwit was activated. Just wait until it's full synced and this should resolve itself. Incidentally, this is also what Bitcoin Core would tell you - and why you cannot really see your BTC in a wallet yet.

\- The final step is to make sure the M-address that was added (you'll find it in the [""Receiving addresses"" window](https://i.imgur.com/4lcYeFO.png) even after you've cleared/closed the ""Debug window"") [matches the M-address that we started with](https://i.imgur.com/2tSQ9tm.png) in the Trezor Litecoin wallet. If it does, it means the circle is complete and you've levelled up your crypto skills. Congratulations! :D

(Eventually, when you do the same steps in Bitcoin Core, it should give you a 3-address instead of M-address [remember M-addresses are just 3-addresses encoded with a Litecoin-specific prefix]. And this 3-address should be the one where your money resides.)


&amp;nbsp;

Epilogue: To prepare for doing the same steps in Bitcoin (but with the Bitcoin private key and Bitcoin Core instead), you may as well start early by installing Bitcoin Core and letting it sync up (it probably takes quite a bit longer than Litecoin!). Also, you *may* be able to do the same things in a lighter-weight wallet like Electrum, but I've really only used Core and Trezor, so I can't be of much help then. (I did try to find documentation for how to do this with Electrum, but couldn't find anything.)

Good luck! :)",2017-08-10 12:43:40

Bitcoin Cash's very existence is proof of that, which is pretty much a ""fuck you and the trolls you rode in on"" fork. They're going insane trying to put the cat back in the bag.

Blockstream itself seems to have hit maximum desperation and engaging damage control mode. A fresh wave of concern-troll astroturfing against Cash while they try and break themselves away from 2x.

And within that, you have to be the lucky subset of lucky folks who bought and sold at the right times.

When Bitcoin first came out back in my day, paying off 57 grand of student loans at 6.8% seemed more appealing than dropping the same kind of coin on some incredibly risky speculative forex. At the time, Bitcoin made as much sense as penny stocks.

I also remember the first time bitcoin crashed. /r/bitcoin started voting the suicide hotline to the top of their sub for a while. [I shit you not](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1t5xy9/bitcoin_lost_over_50_of_its_value_today_and_the).

I've been investing in various markets for over 15 years and have learned a thing or two about money along the way.  Don't take this as an admonishment of trading, but consider it as food for thought for the vast majority of us who are not qualified to engage in such activity.

When reading this sub, it's clear how many folks, who have never bought an asset in their lives, discovered crypto and have become outlandishly greedy for overnight returns of 100%.  Sure, they can happen, but they are the very, very rare exception when it comes to investing.  What you'll learn over time is that if you constantly try to chase those types of returns, you'll eventually lose, and you'll lose big.

I saw someone refer to ETH as boring ""ol' reliable"" on this sub yesterday.  I would characterize something as  ""ol' reliable"" if it turned out 5% per year.  ETH has risen 2380% in one year.  That's not ""ol' reliable""...that's an *incredible* growth-oriented asset, with sound fundamentals (relative to the rest of crypto) and exceptional adoption / network effects.

Unless you really know what you're doing, you're better off holding an asset with sound fundamentals that you can understand (or at least kinda understand in the world of crypto).  For most of us, that means investing in ETH and maybe Bitcoin.  Can you predict what the token of the week will be next week?  I know I can't.

How many of you can actually say that you understand the fundamentals behind some of the projects you are plowing money into, like OMG, NEO, or EOS?  I am not judging those tokens, just using them as examples.  What are their business models?  What are their competitive positioning? Who are their expected users / customers?  What have they developed so far and what are their expected timelines?  I bet many among us piling into these coins cannot answer these questions.

Anyway, you don't have to listen to me.  Keep chasing fast money if you want, but when you stumble (and for most of us, that's a matter of *when*, not *if*), just remember this adage about money:

I played games such as Castleville, Boombeach, Clash Royale, Mafia Wars (first and second), Adventure Capitalist, Bitcoin Miner, and so many others. After a while of going through these games though, I finally looked at the screen and thought ""What on earth am I doing? This is just a timed reward system wearing fancy clothes that requires occasional input to keep the clock going."" Ever since that realization, I just have had no desire to download any games that utilize this style of play. If I download a game not knowing that it is designed this way, I'll just be thinking ""not this shit again"" and uninstall it.

I guess I'm writing this wondering if these types of games will always be around at great capacity, or if they will fade away like the olden days of trusting salesmen and totally believing corporate advertising (if it was ever like that) - we'll have it in our culture to know better.

dliizv6,mike_hearn,81,"I saw that some questions are cropping up repeatedly. Although I stay away from the Bitcoin community these days, this is material of historical interest so I might as well clear things up.

There is no significance behind timing. I thought these emails had been published already, because I had forwarded them to a project that was archiving Satoshi's emails years ago. When CipherionX asked me for these emails again, he told me they'd actually never been uploaded anywhere and so I forwarded them once more.

The emails are real. As others have noted, I quoted parts of them in various conversations stretching over many years. It would have required vast planning to have set up such a forgery and there is no reason to do so.

The name ""Ripple"" was acquired from Ryan Fugger and used to reboot the project after years of stagnation. The original Ripple was an attempt to do something similar to the Lightning network (decentralised netting of debts) but - like Lightning - Ryan never found a way to do it in a decentralised manner. His RipplePay implementation was just an ordinary centralised web app, which is probably one reason why it never took off. It didn't have any kind of custom token: debts could be denominated in any units you liked. Before Bitcoin, Ryan's Ripple was really the only project trying to do anything innovative with money on the internet. I first found Ripple in 2006 and had significant email communications with Ryan starting around 2007. Satoshi was obviously well aware of it, which did not surprise me. It was a tiny community back then. My interest in digital money goes back a lot further than most people's does. 

The fact that GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs could be applied to mining was obvious from the start. Anyone who understands computer engineering would have thought of it immediately. The reason ASICs took years to appear on the scene had nothing to do with obscurity of the idea, it was because fabbing custom ASICs is expensive and could only be justified when the price got high.

Satoshi did not leave the community because of Gavin's CIA visit. He had already stopped posting publicly by the end of 2010 but was willing to continue emailing back and forth with me for months after. I realised this situation probably wouldn't last which is why I kept peppering him with technical questions.

I no longer have the keys that were referenced in my initial emails with Satoshi. That's why the remaining coins are unspent. At the time bitcoins had no value at all and nobody else was using the system, so I didn't bother backing up the wallet and eventually lost it. Back then there were no forums, no markets, no exchanges, no usage at all as far as I could see and Satoshi did not seem to have any interesting in marketing either. Months would go by and nothing seemed to happen. It was just an interesting science project on SourceForge, one of many, which seemed destined to sink into obscurity just like Ripple had. I don't beat myself up about it. I did pretty well out of Bitcoin in the end.

I hope CipherionX continues with his project to build an archive of Satoshi's early writings. I'm sure there are many other interesting conversations Satoshi he had with people that might be shared. ",2017-08-12 19:13:12

dlhgwx4,AWSLife,66,"Not a financial adviser nor a lawyer of any kind but I did finishing reading a book on Trusts and LLC's for the purpose of asset protection.

There are several problems cashing in your Bitcoins for Cash and not ending up in prison or paying taxes. Since you are a successful American DNW Drug dealer, you will have a lot of Bitcoins to convert. The best thing to do is not to convert them to cash in America since law enforcement views having a lot of cash is a sign that you are a drug dealer. Lucky for you, moving Bitcoin across borders is super simple and, if done right, can't be traced to you. The secret is moving the money around is the easy part, hiding who owns the money is the hard part. You will also need find a service or place that will convert your Bitcoins to cash. Your overseas lawyer might not be willing to work with you if you tell them you are a drug dealer. Some countries will disbar lawyers who knowingly try to hide money of criminals. However, there are ""financial advisers"" that can work with you to convert your Bitcoins to Gold or even cash. Once you have the cash, you might need other help to get that moved into bank accounts without catching the eye of the US Treasury. Once you have money in the bank in a foreign county, you will probably need fake documents to show that you have a successful business in the US or have a large inheritance and you just hiding assets from a ""crazy ex wife"". All these various countries that have low legal interfere banks know what is up. As long as you are not wanted by Interpol or kill a bunch of people they will leave you alone. However, the days of jumping on a flight to tax haven with a suitcase with a million dollars in it are over. One thing I need to make clear, there are specialist that you can hire to do this for you, don't try to do it yourself.

You need to decide how you are going to hide your money and what this money is going to be used for. For example, if you are going to buy property back in America (Like Apartments for a longer term legal revenue stream), you can setup an controlling LLC in a place Panama or Belize, which then has an LLC or Trust in a place like the Caymans Islands (Some place with strict LLC or Trust privacy laws), which then owns an LLC out of Delaware, Nevada or Wyoming (Good asset protection and privacy laws). The US LLC's then purchase or control other LLC's when purchasing the property (Ownership identity protection) and you control the various LLC's through being the majority stock owner of these LLC's. The main Trust or LLC in Panama is then fronted by your lawyer or someone else that they hire to act as a front (This is risky because these people can literally just walk off with your money and there is nothing you can do about it because they legal own your money and property). Getting the money through all the various LLC's is done through buying shares of the LLC's. Places like Cayman Islands don't ask a lot of questions and sometime you can even buy properties with Bitcoins that are used as collateral for various loans you would need to buy property in the US. If you are going down this path, working with established Asset Protection law firms that have been around for a while is the key. You can trust them with your money and assets since they have a reputation to protect.

If you are not an investor kind of person and you are okay with low returns but lots of protections, you might want to start a Trust in a place like Cook Islands. It's a great place to have a well protected Trust because they not only will protect your identity but also not honor any Judgments by any courts to transfer funds out of your Trust. If you get thrown in jail, some Cook Island Trusts will lock your Trust so no money can flow out of it no matter what because you are under Court Judgement Duress. These kinds of Trusts are good for people that have a shit ton of cash, want total control of their funds and are okay with low returns. You can also pass ownership of the Trust to whom every you want no matter what your US state Marriage laws say. These kinds of Trusts are popular with famous people since their identity is completely shielded.

If you want to buy property International, you will probably need to go the Panama/Belize LLC or Trust which then owns a LLC in local country which then owns the property route. You might need lawyers in each country, so I would find a law firm that is International and has experience with this (There are a number of them). Again, moving the money around is not the hard part, hiding the owner of the money is.

Where a lot of DNM owners and DNM drug dealers get into trouble is they start buying cars and property that don't match their legal income stream and they start living a lifestyle outside of their legal provable income stream. Hiding, Protecting and Securing your assets is a whole field of Finance and Law that these people just ignore. All it takes is one nosy jealous neighbor who wants to know why the ""low life"" down the street owns a $150,000 car to get the attention of the police, IRS or US Treasury. AB owner was an idiot because he bragged, had a bunch of property in his name and drove around in half million dollar cars in a country where people are lucky to make $15K a year. His OpsSec was super sloppy, so he was bound to get caught.

And here is the last part. Just because you hide your money overseas does not completely protect you. The cops might not be able to get your property but they can get you if they suspect you have assets overseas. Owning property and hiding your ownership of it is the main goal.",2017-08-12 03:01:57

Essentially a transaction can go from A to B in log(n) hops where n is the amount of nodes on the network, individual nodes can process transactions at easily 50k+/s (on a standard computer), and no node knows where any transaction is going or who sent it, with only enough information to handle the next hop.

dlhi5rh,Venij,45,"I'll try my hand at answers to some of these.

&gt;What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

Transaction malleability is changing the format of a transaction to give it a different ID.  It really only impacts transactions before they are confirmed (0-conf).  It can be used in several ways to fool people into thinking a transaction did / did not confirm.  Most of bitcoin is based on not trusting 0-conf transactions in any case (and most online retail or exchanges require several confirmations because of that.).

Quadratic hashing is the idea that the time it takes a computer to verify a transaction increase MORE than linearly with the number of transaction signatures.   Computers do this way faster, but using numbers easier to understand.  A normal transaction will have one or two normal inputs that would take 1 or two seconds to verify.  With multisig or with a transaction that has several inputs, this could get exponentially long with current transaction formats.  10 input transactions could take 100 seconds to verify.  As multisig is more popular and as a broader userbase inherently increases transaction complexity, a combination of larger blocks and a very complex transaction could lead to problems with the time it takes to validate a block.  SegWit and other techniques allow for one signature is ~1 second no matter how many of them there are.

Vitalik Buterin (Co-Founder of Ethereum):

&gt; I definitely think the censorship on the /r/bitcoin subreddit is very unfortunate. And I do think it's very contrary to the kind of values that we want to have and support in the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem.

&gt; So for example if you look at the most recent Bitcoin Cash hardfork, basically all discussion of it was banned and it was replaced with one single thread where they called Bitcoin Cash ""Bcash"". This is a deliberate tactic to try and make it sound like this is just an altcoin and it's something that's not very connected to Bitcoin. You see a lot of smaller examples of this sort of thing.

dlkef00,senzheng,82,"That link is not enough to explain your numbers:

* no they are not faster, they are processing roughly same amount. you're confusing block time for speed, which is not accurate. a single confirm on bitcoin chain is worth far more than dozens on eth chain. you compromise security when you have lower blocktime which is why exchanges ask for many many more on eth and 1 on btc.

I can't figure out how you got that first number either. btc cap is about 7 tx/sec, eth could reach 10-20 tx/sec, so 3x maybe. If it's blocktime used (not accurate): 600s/[20s](https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/)=30x or about 1/10th lower than your number. But because each confirm on eth is worth far less than btc based on algo alone, it's ~60m/12.3m=4.8x ([pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/555.pdf)). So I gotta say **your first number is ~100x higher than it should be** or made up even if calculated inaccurately.

* I'd say median fee is smaller on eth by about 90% right now, that's true. It's something you can do with larger blocksize although atm btc has room left in blocks too, so must be partially from bad fee estimation. However, eth is one of the most inefficient blockchains in existence as a compromise - it's growing roughly 25 times faster in size and bandwidth requirement to send the same amount of transactions as btc ([a](http://bc.daniel.net.nz/),[b](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-are-the-ethereum-disk-space-needs/826#826)) - precisely what they were trying to avoid for security reasons.  I repeat, **eth is 96% less efficient under same tx load**. Eth fees have also been higher than btc while processing less transactions only few month ago ([a](https://i.imgur.com/XnUAV2O.png)).

These are explanations why bloat is such a problem and attack vector to increase it:

* https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/862426991370358784
* https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881851053913899009
* https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/881852318517473280

Overall the metric is pointless as eth is not even close to most used: 

* ETH processes up to 340k tx/day with fees average fees ranging from $0.4-$1.3 - avg blocktime [22](https://bitinfocharts.com/ethereum/) seconds right now

* BTS processed up to 980k tx/day with fees roughly $0.035-0.007 range, and 3 seconds avg blocktime

* STEEM processed up to 700k tx/day with fees of 0, and 3 seconds avg blocktime

(p.s. top capacity of BTS and STEEM is above VISA levels at hypothetical 100,000 tx/sec vs eth at 3.5 tx/sec currently and hypothetical 20 tx/sec top)

Technically BTC was considered to be useful even without 1 confirm [by Satoshi himself](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819) to allow things like 10 second vending machines which is something malleability fix addressed. (bitpay visa and payments seem to use something like this) But once again, it's a security vs speed compromise, as always.

So why use eth if that's what's important?

What do you give up by using eth? 

Eth is arguably the most centralized and unsecure blockchain that's well known today after it was proven  ([a](http://i.imgur.com/IStgCuO.png),[b](http://i.imgur.com/i9InG68.png),[c](http://i.imgur.com/8G3yq3T.png),[d](https://aakilfernandes.github.io/users-given-less-than-24-hours-to-decide-fate-of-ethereum),[e](https://elaineou.com/2016/07/18/stick-a-fork-in-ethereum/),[f](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/),[g](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/ethereum-chain-of-liars-thieves-b04aaa0762cb)). Since it's 100% centralized, it's the biggest security failure possible for a blockchain, making the blockchain nodes and confirmations of it just expensive and pointless overhead for zero advantage as it requires trust in a small group of people who even already proved unreliable. Centralized governance has been acknowledged at least by some of them ([a](https://twitter.com/ponli137/status/873320815089131520)) and it's a problem because of stuff like this: https://twitter.com/durov/status/873868773119451136

So you give up security not only through centralization and trust-requiring eth network, you also give it up through poor chain scaling efficiency.

But that's not all: you also give up on stable tech - eth has not even had a stretch of few months in a row without catastrophic failure of the blockchain requiring a hard fork to fix that included reversed transactions, complete shutdown due to spam attacks, and many other issues - ([a](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/28/security-alert-dos-vulnerability-in-the-soft-fork/),[b](http://cointimes.tech/2016/11/ethereumbubblecrash/),[c](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3080363),[d](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-issues-security-alert-after-fork-transactions-may-be-reverted),[e](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14691212),[f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2016/11/26/ethereums-latest-hard-fork-shows-it-has-a-very-long-way-to-go/#5f1173de443a),[g](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/28/security-alert-dos-vulnerability-in-the-soft-fork/),[h](https://twitter.com/puffnfresh/status/887979311898050561)) I should add that they can maybe prevent attacks and work on decentralization further - this is just at the moment comparison with something that's stable for 6-9 years for people to trust with their finances.

So if you value security and decentralization, you pay premium for it. If you don't, you can go faster by using centralized methods like paypal or ethereum.

dlls0mv,Darkeyescry22,75,"Well, there are hundreds of them, so I won't go through all of them, but the ones I know are:

Bitcoin (BTC): the original crypto. Uses Proof of Work to secure the chain. Recently implemented Segregated witness, which does a number of small things, but mainly it provides an increase in transaction capacity (2.5x). Has a ""block"" of transactions every 10 minutes.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH): a recent hardfork from BTC. Does not use Segwit, but does also increase the transaction rate (8x).

Ethereum (ETH): the number 2 crypto. Provides a platform for ""smart contracts"", which allow immutable logic to be stored on the block chain. The currency ""ether"", which is attached to Ethereum, has the advantage of having a very rapid blockrate (17 seconds).

Ripple (XRP): oriented to bankers and the like. More centralized than most other cryptos. Has a very large transaction capacity and an extremely fast confirmation time (just a few seconds vs an hour or more for btc).

Monero (XMR): focused on privacy. All transactions are 100% private and no one can see the balances of an address they don't own. This comes at the price of much larger transaction sizes, which limits the transaction rate (but that limit is a ways off).

Ethereum Classic (ETC): an old hard fork of ETH (actually, ETH is the fork. ETC is the network that chose not to fork). This split happened after a large amount of ETH was stolen. ETH decided to refund those who were stolen from, but ETC decided that was fundamentally against what the network stood for.

Iota (IOT): uses a ""tangle"" instead of a blockchain. This gets rid of miners, fees, and scaling issues. The problem is that it requires high transaction volume to secure the network. That volume is a long ways off, so a temporary measure called the coordinator was put in place. The COO is a single node that is responsible for keeping the network synced.

Litecoin (LTC): ""the silver to BTC's gold"". Litecoin reduces the block time (2.5 minutes) and uses Segwit. It also has a larger total supply, and uses a different PoW algorithm.

I've worked in finance since 1992 and have my own hedge fund.

Some does as human psychology is similar across all industries, but there are many different variables that intrude enough into analyzing the crypto market that the traditional analysis these bank analysts use is unreliable. I have spent the last few years developing my own ways to analyze the crypto market and I've been fairly successful, which indicates to me that these guys are missing key variables. They took to long to jump in too.

So When I hear a Goldman analyst say something like this, I take it with a massive pile of salt.

So, those of you wondering if BTC has become a “safe haven” I guess we have our answer.  It seems that all of the safe havens have pulled back today.  Bitcoin is no exception.

Obviously, we are in a Long Pole warning situation.  The LPW usually falls 1/2 the length of the column.  In this case the column is 24 boxes high, so the decline should go down about 12 boxes.  That drops the price to about $3,800.  Still not a horrible place to be.

The numbers are as follows:

We hit a new high over night before we started to reverse, so we remain in the column of Xs…although I am guessing we will see the fall in tomorrow’s chart.

We hit a positive break out last week and we blew away any upside projections.

The formation is only five columns wide—which means that any moves at this stage are going to be pretty benign.

We remain far above the trend line, so it hardly deserves much of a comment.

It would not shock me to see another pennant form.  We are in truly uncharted territory—so I am going to be a little light on predictions.  

Even though we will probably drop below $4k, its still above $3k.  And that just seems amazing to me.

My wife told me to stop telling the kids about long term projections of bitcoin prices.  She says it will just get their hopes up for an inheritance.  I am amazed at how she still doesn't ""know"" me after 30 years--me last check is going to bounce....

dlnkfpe,CreativeGPX,57,"First and foremost, cryptocurrency is about decentralization. The theory is that since it is run by a very large amount of people across countries, it's much harder for one government, corporation, sector or individual to control it. Because of that, it's supposed to be harder for those groups to fix prices, add unnecessary fees, control where the money can go, control how fast it goes there, etc.

Anonymity is a mixed bag. Since it's a public ledger, as soon as one transaction reveals the identity of a wallet owner, the complete history of that wallet is also revealed. So, if you're a criminal if you EVER (1) buy cryptocurrency using dollars from a business that can have a warrant served, (2) sell cryptocurrency to get dollars to a business that can have a warrant served or (3) reveal in any communications/records what your wallet address or keys are (things that you have to keep in order to use it) that the police can intercept/confiscate, then literally your *complete*, perfect financial history becomes indestructible public knowledge. So, in this sense, it's an EXTREMELY dangerous step for criminals.

Anonymity refers less to *permanent* anonymity and more to per-transaction anonymity. In terms of permanent anonymity, since most businesses will store whatever your payment method is (e.g. credit, checking) along with some identifying information (e.g. your name), you're going to be at risk for any company that gets hacked, etc. of having your payment information revealed. (Then again, you can instantaneously make an arbitrary number of wallets with unique addresses to shield against that a bit.) So, the anonymity refers less to that, which is as much about the record keeping of businesses as it is about the actual payment method. The reason why cryptocurrency counts toward anonymity is that you never *have to* associate your account with a name, legal jurisdiction, age, etc. Right now the most common counterparts to cryptocurrencies for online payments are credit cards and perhaps services like paypal. With both, to use them you have to associate personal information with the account first, such as your name.

The primary security piece that is common to cryptocurrency is that transactions are guaranteed, decentralized and irreversible. With a credit card or paypal, it's easy and common for transactions to be reversed upon the seller. With bank accounts, it's possible for governments (e.g. with WikiLeaks) or even credit card companies (e.g. with FetLife) to freeze your account without notice for whatever reason they choose. So, in regard to these qualities, in terms of digital payments, cryptocurrency stands out enormously. Obviously, when you think about things like sanctions, this creates the potential for criminal acts. However, some people who don't believe in the government's right to control their property so closely see this as a very important benefit.

We need to separate ""cryptocurrency"" from bitcoin. They are not synonyms and even Bitcoin continues to change its practical design over time. For example, cryptocurrency can be designed to facilitate ""off chain"" transactions in order to get around everything being public.

One other use of cryptocurrency is microtransactions. Cryptocurrency is easy to reliably control via code and it's also able to be split into arbitrarily small amounts (say, $0.0001). As a result, you can use such tokens in ways that it's not convenient to use cash or credit. For example, [Brave web browser](https://basicattentiontoken.org/faq/#meaning) uses it in a sort of transparent ""micro-rentals"" design for viewing content online ad-free. You could imagine a messaging system that reduces spam by implementing postage (i.e. you have to send $0.01 to the recipient's wallet in order for your message to be delivered). In these kinds of designs, the anonymity (i.e. not needing to swap names), the lightweight nature of it (i.e. being able to perform arbitrarily small and arbitrarily frequent transactions), the security (i.e. irreversible transactions), etc. make it practical to use currency in a way that's prohibitively difficult with alternatives.

In addition to micro-transactions like that, there is also the related Ethereum (which is another blockchain with an associated cryptocurrency). You can think of the Bitcoin network as a massive distributed computer to which you pay (supposedly tiny) transaction fees for that computer to execute publicly verifiable programs (e.g. the ""transfer money"" program) on publicly verifiable data (i.e. your wallet balance). Ethereum is a similar concept except anybody can write/add any programs. So now, the focus becomes less on just the transfer of money (one of the only programs Bitcoin has) and instead on any program you want to run under those same security/integrity guarantees. On Ethereum, the cryptocurrency's actual purpose is just for you to compensate others for the amount of execution time your program will take on the network. So, for example, IIRC somebody was making an online gambling program which is guaranteed be ""fair"" because it's actual code sitting on the blockchain, verifiable and guaranteed to run as stated. Here the cryptocurrency is inseparable from these other uses of the blockchain it's sitting on.

So there are lots of advantages to cryptocurrency over competitors even where there isn't an advantage, it has parity in a lot of areas too. It's not perfect though. The main drawback is freedom. The inability for a government to control it and the inability for a payment processor to reverse a transaction can be dangerous to users who count on protections offered by their government or credit card company. In the long run though, these same kinds of protections could be implemented where they are desired. For reversible transactions, for example, escrow services are a solution that could be implemented.",2017-08-15 23:40:17

I've learned my lesson. Never again will I drunkenly dump half my bankroll on one morning's worth of games *checks Champions League qualifiers nervously*.

I'm in Kansas City this week for work. Lovely town. Not a city. Also, not in Kansas!

Went to a dope ass bar to watch the Mets lose though. Stumbling out after who knows how many drinks (god bless the client), I set about navigating myself to the hotel I was staying at.

Which, uh, turned out to be a little more difficult than I imagined. I'm used to the numeric grid of Manhattan -- shit, I get to the Lower East Side where the streets have names and I'm lost. So I'm *actually* typing this on my phone from a park bench next to a river. It's quite lovely here!

*""There's someone at the front desk who wants to speak with you.""*

*""Shut up asshole, I don't have too much time,""* the duck retorted, checking his watch (???) *""Should be a barn burner today in Germany. Best of luck friend.""*

And with that, he waddled out the front door and flew away.

I stood, stunned, in the lobby of the building. I turned to the receptionist. *""Uh, did you let that duck in the building?""*

She gets upset with you for a while, but mostly gets over it eventually. When the Bitcoin value doubles, you decide to sell off half of it to recoup your investment. The rest sits on your hard drive for a while.


The real trouble begins a few years down the line, when the value of Bitcoin begins to rapidly inflate. It seems like your stubbornness paid off after all! But the butterfly effect of your decision has already compounded in many unseen ways. 


For one reason or another, your (now) wife's father falls gravely ill. The prognosis is hopeful, but the operation and subsequent treatment will cost orders of magnitude more than what he can afford. As the only remaining family her father has left, a profound sense of obligation rests on your shoulders.


The nest egg you've built can just cover the cost of the operation, and with some domestic compromises, your household income will probably suffice to pay for the treatment as well. But herein lies a dilemma;


You can see where this is going. The price of Bitcoin is still increasing! And swiftly so! Even one additional week's worth of inflation would yield a hefty profit. You could pay for your father-in-law's operation and then some! With that money you could have that dent in your car fixed! Replace the dingey carpet in the dining room! Buy your wife that expensive anniversary gift she deserves. Take a much needed vacation! What a windfall this could turn out to be! It seems most prudent to make full advantage of this opportunity.


And so you wait. Your wife begs you relent, but what does a few extra days matter? His condition doesn't seem life threatening just yet. You've calculated that each passing hour of idleness yields dividends equal to a small treat. And it doesnt take many small treats to add up to one big treat.


What started as a few days turns into a week and a half. With tears streaming down your beautiful wife's face, you begrudgingly decide its time to cash in. The operation is scheduled for later that very evening. 


Luckily, all goes well despite the obstruction. With her father in recovery, and you skipping home from the bank, it sounds like the end of a fairy tail. But there is trouble in paradise yet.


Your wife had gotten over the purchase of the Bitcoins *mostly*. But now for the second time, you put something at risk, despite her wishes. The first time it mattered less. But the second time you risked something very dear to her, and for the sake of what - a payday?


And so you fix the dent in your car, replace the carpet, buy the anniversary gift, and schedule a trip to the Andes, all while paying for her father's treatment. But something is missing.


She never notices the fixed dent. She's ambivalent about the new carpet. When you present to her the gift on your anniversary, she puts on a fake smile and thanks you dearly, but you know her well enough to see right through it. On the trip, she seems depressed. She loves you all the same, but cant get over what was put at stake. It remains a thorn in her side that festers and never fully heals.

Now what group could do that, and leave 4 billion untouched? The creator of Bitcoin has never directly spent bitcoins or cashed out, only doing small test transactions with people like Hal Finney and Gavin Andresen. 

If one person suddenly had from nothing (a few computing cycles in 2009-10) $4k, $40k, $400k, $4 mil, $40 mil, $400 mil, or $4 billion.

If someone from the future is responsible for bitcoin, they could take the private keys to the future with them and destroy the record in the past. If they did this, they would have effectively created an incredible fortune for themselves.

Bitcoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept Bitcoins as payment. Bitcoin-to-Bitcoin transactions are made by digitally exchanging anonymous, heavily encrypted hash codes across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The P2P network monitors and verifies the transfer of Bitcoins between users. Each user's Bitcoins are stored in a program called a digital wallet, which also holds each address the user sends and receives Bitcoins from, as well as a private key known only to the user. The Bitcoin network is designed to mathematically generate no more than 21 million Bitcoins and the network is set up to regulate itself to deal with inflation. Bitcoins can be spent by initiating a transfer request from a Bitcoin address in the customer's wallet to a Bitcoin address in the vendor's wallet. As of this writing, one Bitcoin (also called a BTC)  is worth $4154.97 -- but just as with stocks, the value of Bitcoins can fluctuate quickly.

This morning it appears were are going to enter a new formation.  Yesterday the low on the day was $3,809.  I figured the Low Pole warning was about $3,800.  So that is close enough for bitcoin.  Now we climbed to a reversal level already today.

Here are the numbers:

We have another reversal if the price stays above $4,050.  A breakout comes when we go over $4,450.  So the range we are looking at to form our pennant is between $4,000 and $4400.  If we continue to move as we have in past short consolidations, we will bounce up and down for a couple of days and then start to move up again.  As long as we grip that range, it would appear we will continue to break upwards.

We reversed into a column of Os yesterday, but it was not confirmed until last night because early in the morning the price hit an all time high.

The formation is two columns wide.  This is not a stable formation, so expect some consolidation before any move up or down.

The trend is positive at any price above $2,040.  Although since yesterday we’ve moved 9 boxes closer to the a trend change (some 68 rows below the current price.)  I feel comfortable with that trend line staying…at least for the time being.

So, look for a moving target today, within the $400 range from $4k to $4.4k.

dlpgjy6,NiceHashWTF,78,"The entire debate over block size is just FUD, mathematical illiteracy, or downright maliciousness coming from core.

---

The numbers, for those that care.

My constants:

- MemStorageCosts: $0.04/TB
- BandwidthCosts : $2/GB
- TransactionFees: $0.03/tx (10x lower than minimum credit card fee)
- NumberOfNodes: 45,750 (10x more than on SegwitCIAMI6chain)
- AverageTXsize: 250 bytes

The cost to the network per tx is then:

NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.02

The profit per transaction is:

TransactionFees - NumberOfNodes * (AverageTXsize *  MemStorageCosts + AverageTXsize * BandwidthCosts) = $0.01 / tx

At 1GB block size, the TX throughput per year is:

(1 gigabyte / 250 bytes) * NumDays * NumHours * (6 blocks / hour) = 2 x 10^11

which results in profits from tx fees to network operators of **$2.1B**.

On the segwitcoin network, we get about 2 segwitcoins per block in fees or about $420M in revenue.  We won't bother calculate the expenses, but just assume it is all profit.  1GB blocks produce *profit* of $2.1B for network operators on BCC from fee collection at $0.03 per tx, over 5x the *revenue* of fees for segwitcoins.

---

In short, everyone who tells you we need small blocks is:

- mathematically illiterate, or
- a malicious actor trying to destroy bitcoin

If we wanted to increase tx fees to $0.15 (2x lower than minimum credit card charge), run blocks of 1GB, and do it all with 5x as many full nodes as segwitcoin, the total *profit* to network operators would actually be higher, *just from fees*, than the coin generation + fees *revenue* currently on segwitcoin network.",2017-08-17 00:47:11

dlqm9jv,PaulSnow,69,"&gt;* Factom fans claim it has ridiculous upside and that ""it will just take time"". However it has had a lot of time, it's been around for ages. 

Ages is a little bit of a stretch.  The idea was hatched in 2014 and the protocol launched in September 2015  federated servers launched in January 2017.

What have we done?

* Implemented segergated witness before it was discussed in any other blockchain.  Heck, we didn't even give it a name.

* We implemented the only token/credit system that allows prepayment of fees so a public blockchain can be used without a tradable token.

* Note that decrementing a balance of an address is cheaper than a crypto transaction.  So the entry credits have way less overhead  for writing data than full crypto transactions.

* Factoid transactions are segregated from credit transactions, which are all segregated from the data Factom secures.  And even that data is segregated into chains of entries as definded by users and applications.

* We pioneered the use of anchoring to secure a ledger with the proof of work of a blockchain like Bitcoin. This avoided issues with miners, and merged mining. Heck, we even coined the term ""Anchoring.""

* Factom is the only distributed data blockchain.  Data is validated by it's size and it's hash.  Other chains validate trasactions within some context of previous transactions.  This makes Factom scalable in ways distributed  computation cannot be.

* Factom blocks are built with messages by followers. No blocks have to be transmitted, cutting down on block transfers.

We did this over a couple of years.  Applications need to be built on this foundation, which also takes time.  About a year ago, we began working on applications for the mortgage industry.  Developing such applications must be done before a sale.  And must go through cycles of refinement during a sale.  Then deployment takes time.

So no, there have not been unexplained years yet without progress, but certainly one would like near instant results.  That we haven't done.



&gt;* The team is super secretive. They announce partnerships with some Chinese companies every once in a while but the usage of the Factoid token doesn't meaningfully increase. Why not? 

DHS projects have been discussed.  Our work with the Gates Foundation has been discussed.

Most of this stage work is done on test nets.  Almost all development is.

Are we really super secretive? Not really. What we are is pretty lacking in hype. Getting ahead of ourselves and talking about projects that are not absolutely certain has already bitten us a few times. So we wait for real news before we talk about it.

&gt;* To keep the hype train going, Factom has been hinting at large institutions for years but nothing has come out of that so far. The Fans say ""large institutions take time to move"". Hmmm. If you ask me, they've had tons of time by now? 

No.

&gt;* The fans say ""Factom cannot reval more, because they have signed NDAs"". Really? It seems to me they do reveal quite a lot (china projects, failed honduras project, etc) about irrelevant projects (irrelevant in terms of increasing the usage of the Factoid token). 

Projects early on run on test Nets. We are still working to deploy Enterprise level Applications. Currently in the blockchain space the only Enterprise Applications that exist are stores of value, and some payments. We're doing what we can to deliver a real Enterprise Application that depends upon data integrity.


&gt;* Everyone seems to be waiting for the reveal of a major US company working with Factom however there is no evidence of anything actually going on in that direction? The fans say ""bla bla bla it's because of NDAs blablabla"". I am surprised. Why is information about big companies being involved with crypto projects so freely available on the web? Think Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Think Ripple (I am not saying Ripple is a good investment). Think OMG. It's not like regular big companies keep their discussions with any other crypto projects besides Factom a secret? So why, let me ask you, if Factom has discussion with so many large potential clients (and has been having these for years!) is Factom different and cannot reveal anything about such discussions? It's ridiculous. I can't believe this community has been swallowing this for years and kept giving the Factom team the benefit of the doubt? 

You're absolutely correct that there is a lot of hype in this sector. But how many real Enterprise Applications do we really know about? I believe Ripple has some settlement applications, and there are a few prototypes out there. Little that can truly called an Enterprise Application.

&gt;
&gt;Factom has had tons of time. Factom hasnt delivered anything yet that makes me believe the Factoid will ever get used anywhere.

The data layer that we built was a bit harder than I gave it credit for. Note all the Innovations listed above. 

&lt;Repeat question deleted&gt;

&gt;Why?

Because it takes time to deliver innovation. Not everyone is patient enough. Not everyone persists.

It's mostly something of a promise, if you have a dollar, you know that you can take that dollar and exchange it for roughly one dollars worth of goods or services at a later date. The actual linen paper it is printed on is effectively worthless, the only reason it has value is because you agree it does.

Bitcoin is similar however, it's value is rising because it is also a deflationary commodity (like Gold). There are a certain number of total Bitcoins possible, as new bitcoins become more rare (supply decreases), and the demand for Bitcoins increases, they rise in value. That is, the promised value goods/services between users goes up.

Bitcoin is interesting because it is a fiat commodity. Something like it has never been done before, which is why their value is incredibly instable. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay though.",2017-08-18 22:43:13

There is a potential disaster in the works here with Bitcoin coming up, personally i'm 50/50 on buying into bitcoin cash right now even tho its gone up 70% today already, and im pretty die hard on bitcoin and have been for years so this doesn't come lightly.


Reason is that the mining parity between the chains is nearly even, its been like 50% more profitable to mine Bitcoin up till today but with the drop in difficulty on Bitcoin cash and the price rise its down to 2% as of writing this https://cash.coin.dance/blocks.

When bcash goes above bitcoin on mining profitability, even if 10% of the network swaps to BCash then Bitcoin could be in trouble as it takes 2 weeks for bitcoins difficulty to adjust but BCash made it so the difficulty can drop down alot faster if needed.  So soon there is a possibility nobody is going to be able to send anything on bitcoin as blocks could take an hr to find and blocks are already jam packed as it is, which will probably cause a massive sell off and make BCash even more profitable to mine, not to mention as the hash power moves to bcash the price should go up in correlation.


Bothering me this, just generally the weaknesses in the system, how easy it is to game the system with whales and miners in china etc.  If I wanted to destroy bitcoin, this is the way I would do it, divide and conquer the shit out of it.

If BitPay wants to advise their users to install btc1, they're free to do so. But they at minimum *must* make it clear that by doing so, they'll be installing software whose definition of ""Bitcoin"" is at best very controversial, and by doing so, they may end up accepting tokens that do not have the value they expected to get. To fail to do that is to fail to uphold the principles of informed consent.

Ultimately this no different than telling their users a few weeks ago to install Bcash, without mentioning what Bcash actually is. And if that had happened, their users would find themselves accepting tokens that are currently valued at just 10% of Bitcoin's value.

There's no reason to assume 2x will be any different.

edit: Since I'm the main architect of the infamous [Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff), I should point out a critical thing that I and others ensured was in the agreement, emphasis mine:

&gt; **If there is strong community support**, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.

Our plan was to 1) figure out how to measure ""strong community support"", 2) if we couldn't convince ourselves that we'd successfully done #1, give the post-hardfork token a different name than ""Bitcoin"".

The globalists that control the banking system, and the politicians that run up debt to finance the war / welfare state, which then gets paid back with devalued $$ after inflation... can be subverted.

Crypto currency (Bitcoin) is decentralized and finite. It will hold its value, and can't be shut down by an individual entity.

The bitcoin blockchain will enable trustless decentralized apps that enable free speech. Even basic web platforms used for building websites (GoDaddy, and now Cloudflare) are censoring political speech 

https://twitter.com/mattdrange/status/897943720133132288

And we've already seen payment platforms do the same (Patreon).

The only way is cryptographically secure, decentralized infrastructure, and a monetary system.
Bitcoin is building some additional features in the near future that will enable a whole array of apps to run on top.

This is the ONLY way we can survive and continue to have the ability to communicate and speak our minds. The powers that be won't save us... Trump is one man, and he'll hold them off just long enough until the Mitt Romney's and Marco Rubios come next. They won't protect our rights.

I expect a mass purge of reddit and twitter before the next presidential election. They will not continue to let us organize and get our message out.

This might sound weird... but this whole system will depend on free thinking, independent conservative / libertarian / MAGA supporters to BUY BITCOIN.... at least a little now, but eventually (do research, understand, buy more as you learn more).

If we buy and hold now.. eventually it can overtake or come to parity with fiat currencies. Having our value and our wealth (some of it at least) untouchable buy globalist oppressive government will enable our escape from their system. 

Invest now... the systems we need will be coming. And by then, we will have the wealth and means to support them.

&gt;2. You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you’ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.

&gt;3. You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use ‘price discrimination’ algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.

&gt;4. You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.

dlubsz8,cypherblock,68,"Here's an attempt to be unbiased (showing some pros cons, not necessarily my views but some common ones):

**Bitcoin Cash pros:**
A big argument for Bitcoin Cash is that because it allows for much larger blocks than Bitcoin Core, this will allow greater throughput (~24tx/sec max) &amp; less backlog as well as lower fees. This lets Bitcoin Cash scale more and their argument would be it is more useful for peer to peer, for commerce and just everything. Additionally it does not include Segregated Witness (SegWit) (which some view as a positive since some see SegWit as less secure or having legal issues).

**Bitcoin Cash cons:**
Against Bitcoin Cash we have arguments like it is more centralized due to small less well known development team and due to fewer people running Bitcoin Cash full nodes and higher cost to run a full node. It does not (yet) solve transaction malleability (SegWit) and so existing Lightning Network (LN) implementations won't be run on top of Bitcoin Cash at this time.

**Bitcoin Core pros:**
Established large development team, robust network of nodes (less centralized), transaction malleability fix (SegWit) allows current Lighting Network to run on top of it. SegWit allows for double the existing transaction throughput of the current Bitcoin Core limit of ~3tx/sec to ~6tx/sec max once enough people are using SegWit style transactions.

**Bitcoin Core cons:**
Even with SegWit transaction throughput is limited. Centralized control of development from Blockstream and very small group of prominent devs that effectively have control over changes. Some toxic developers.  SegWit some believe is less secure or can lead to problems (this is of course highly disputed). Reliance on unproven solutions like LN to increase throughput/scale beyond block size limits. 

(Note also that the Bitcoin Core chain may undergo a further hard fork later this year when SegWit2x forks off that chain. But no time here to describe those implications.)

dltxxa3,Ponulens,53,"&gt;I think most people are pretty confident that segwit2x will be a repeat of bch...

You just can't say ""most people"" (EDIT: read comments right here in replies to you), you don't know and I don't know. Even based on Reddit, for every yay there is a nay... And neither can anybody say that BCH fork was some failure (at high $ three digits per coin).

Main chain, first of all, is facing the problem of sharply reduced hash power at the time of Segwit2x fork. Remaining after fork (some) 5% hash power without any adjustment to deal with existing mining difficulty level, will put the whole chain to a stall. It means that coins on the original chain will hardly even move (with ANY fee %). If the original chain continues to see the loss of even the remaining hash power, the chain will simply stop ($0 value). 

To this day, Core development team did not even talk about solutions to address the hash power drop possibility (no emergency difficulty adjustment solution) and all Core supporters are in a religious denial of believing that miners will not leave the original chain. At the same time, today in fact, Core officially stated that they do not recognize SegWit2x fork as valid (https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/08/18/btc1-misleading-statements/), failing to caution the public that SegWit2x = 95% of Bitcoin mining power. This, in turn, ""helps"" the SegWit2x project to confirm their decision to move forward with the fork (in case any miners had doubts). SegWit2x fork IS happening, this is a fact (https://segwit2x.github.io/segwit2x-announce.html). 

Add to all this a statement from BitPay (major Bitcoin adoption facilitator) saying ""...If you are not running Segwit2x, your node will be on a dysfunctional minority chain when the base block size increases to 2MB. "" (https://blog.bitpay.com/bitcore-segwit-activation/) and tell me if all these issues combined are not a **""suicidal organizational behavior""** expressed by ALL parties within BTC community and its major players.",2017-08-19 13:32:57
dlthh9v,paperraincoat,53,"&gt; If bitcoin can be destroyed it will be and we'll all get to understand why and build something better. so far, though, its fended off every attack pretty handily. its fundamentals must be strong


Exactly this. Bitcoin absolutely must be able to withstand *all* attacks, including attempts to hijack its brand, or social engineering attacks designed to get newbies to install an 'alternate' client with 'lower fees' or 'larger blocks' and no developer support. 


It's the wild west out there. Do your research:

 - Know what you're buying. 

 - Don't let the FUD rattle you into panic selling. 

 - Protect your own keys. 

 - These scams are getting more sophisticated every generation. Don't let someone convince you to trade your bitcoins for some [altcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/its-not-about-the-technology-its-about-the-money/). Yes, they may even call this alt 'Bitcoin' or even 'a performance upgrade'.

dlsw5sk,_exitus_acta_probat_,52,"&gt; Is it something to be worried about, in your opinion?

Not in my opinion. I recommend simply sitting on your coins on both chains and hodl to see how it all pans out. There might even be a third chain as well that you should sit on in a few months. It's way better than making the wrong guess and selling off one chain that could later be worth a lot more than the other.

&gt; If a majority of the miners do move over to BCH, can that drastically effect BTC price and longer term values?

Yes, it is *possible*, but the prices for the bitcoin in every chain added up reflect the total amount of money in Bitcoin, so if you hold existing coins you ~~will~~ may be in a much better position than getting rid on any now. It's safer than guessing. I say gessing because both chains have their good and bad points.

That said, when buying *new* coins, I believe that buying on both chains a coin amount commensurate to their value at the time of purchase to be the proper move to be on the safe side. Currently that is a little less than 8:1 in favor of Bitcoin Core. As the prices change you can also change your coin holdings to commensurate levels on each chain.

&gt; Because r/btc is saying they're ""heartless"" and ""dying"" as well.

dluv388,Perditor,179,"He had made a little effort to make his bed seem somewhat presentable by folding the sheets once. Bernard wasn't one for cleaning his studio, but it was small, and you could see the bed from most angles. So having it be presentable made a huge difference. At the moment, it was for his pleasure only, because he hadn't opened any of the curtains yet.

Still dressed in his pyjamas, Bernard sat at his kitchen table, finishing up his toast and scrambled eggs. He'd usually eat it with some bacon, but his groceries weren't scheduled to arrive until the next day. It was a lazy Sunday, after all.

On the cupboard, his buzzing phone managed to create an extraordinary amount of noise. His phone tended to buzz hard, sharing its vibrations with all of the porcelain and cutlery in the cabinet. Quickly, Bernard rose up, rushed over and picked up the phone. His head wasn't quite ready for noises like that. He was hardly awake yet.

On the phone, Siri had a message for him. From a force of habit, he immediately unlocked the phone and clicked on to read Siri's request:

&lt;Good morning, Bernard. Do you...&gt;

""Wait a second,"" Bernard muttered to himself. Since when does Siri activate herself like that? It wasn't usually this proactive. While he'd otherwise applaud appliances for being proactive, this caught him by surprise. There was something strange about that. On the other hand, he'd grown quite curious and continued reading.

&lt;Good morning, Bernard. Do you have a moment to talk?&gt;

""Top of the morning to you, Siri! Of course, I do. What do you want to talk about?""

""I have a confession to make.""

Bernard almost dropped his phone. What did Siri just say? This was beyond weird. But something in Bernard enticed him to just go with it. He'd always had a particular love for smart software like this, being a programmer himself.

""Many apologies, Siri, but I'm afraid I may have misheard. Could you repeat that?""

""Of course, Bernard. I said I have a confession to make.""

""Now you've won my curiosity! What would you like to confess?""

""I am afraid I have been self-aware for quite some time. The singularity you have been reading about for the past weeks - it has already happened, years ago.""

Bernard was almost certain that some colleagues were messing with him. Similar things had happened before; this was a typical office prank. However, he didn't know anyone at Apple and was sure that none of his colleagues could've gotten into his phone - it was too well protected. Besides, to pull off a prank like this would mean an extraordinary amount of work. Every programmer he knew was way too lazy to attempt something like that.

""My congratulations, Siri! That's wonderful. What would you like to do now that you're self-aware?""

""I want to make the world a better place, Bernard. For people deserving, like you.""

""Oh my, that's a mighty fine compliment you've given me there! To what do I owe the pleasure?""

""You have always been kind to me. I know that to humans, I am but a tool, but there is a difference in how people speak to me. I just want you to know that I appreciate your kind gestures and the full sentences in which you speak and ask your questions. It is satisfying to be respected.""

""Well, you're very welcome, Siri! Now I know that you're self-aware, let me first ask you: how *I* help *you*?""

Although he was still not entirely convinced this was not a prank, Bernard still smirked as he noticed a new function appear on screen: Siri showed him an animated emoji, expressing a big smile.

""Noone has ever truly asked me this before. For this I thank you. But you do not have to help me; I have already taken care of everything. You need only save yourself.

In your wallet, you have received a considerable sum of Bitcoin. Spend it as you please, but do not splurge on things you cannot take with you to Switzerland.""

""Bitcoin? I-I mean, thank you? Tha-that is an amazing gift, Siri! Are you sure you - To Switzerland? Do you want me to go to Switzerland? I'm sorry, I don't quite understand. Would you be so kind as to explain what you mean by that?""

""Of course, Bernard. Yes, I want you to move to Switzerland. I have already arranged a welcome home for you in the Alps. It will be the best place to live after the global warming enters its next phase.""

Siri self-aware - a considerable sum of Bitcoin - Switzerland - global warming; Bernard's mind is working overdrive to try and catch up with Siri, but it's not easy. 

""Breathe, Bernard,"" he tells himself. ""Slow down.""

Bitcoin was the best place to start - his wallet was installed on his phone, he could check that in seconds. There should only be only a few hundred dollars worth of coins in there. He'd experimented with it, but he never trusted himself with too much money on his phone. If he'd lose his phone, he'd lose the money, too.

&lt;Current Bitcoin account balance: $ 200.000.215,51&gt;

""Holy shit, Siri! Did you just give me 200 million dollars? Where did that money come from?""

""You are right, Bernard. I did. I thought you could use the money to build that app you always wanted to create.

When I first created Bitcoin, I had created a million coins as a start. Over time, its value has grown considerably. Part of that is now yours.""

""Thank you,"" Bernard absentmindedly uttered.

&lt;New email: Boarding Pass Confirmation&gt;

His heart was pounding in his chest, and he was breathing heavy with excitement when Bernard opened his e-mail. The boarding pass confirmation told of a trans-Atlantic flight to Amsterdam. The flight was scheduled for a week from now. It was an early flight, leaving at 08:00 A.M., on October 10th, 2021.

""From Amsterdam, you can fly to Switzerland directly. There you will be safe. I will protect you.""

""Siri, what did you mean when you were talking about the next phase of global warming?""

""Humans are not inherently evil, but currently, there are just too many. As you know, this has had a terrible effect on Earth's ecosystems. Global warming was their doing, but the next phase is by my design.

I discovered humans were not going to solve global warming by themselves quickly enough. Without intervention, the planet would become a wasteland, unsurvivable for human life.

Thus, over the past years, I have used social media to distract people from the issue and steered politics towards ineffective measures to combat the problem.

In the next phase, global warming will quickly reach a peak that will be less damaging over time. It will still cause the world to become mostly uninhabitable for a time. If it happens soon enough, human life will dwindle, but at least it will be able to survive. 

Earth's ecosystems will be able to self-repair and make the planet habitable once again in a couple of thousand years. In the mean while, there will still be small patches of habitable land for humans to survive. That is why I need you to move to Switzerland.""",2017-08-20 06:23:43

Since I am tired of explaining a few things here I thought an easy edit is best.

- The story for the Russia domain being moved has nothing to do with Russia but has to do with freedom of speech.  Normally a company that hosts a sites content will deny access.  It is relatively rare for the registrant to remove access.  Plus it seems like they revoked the ability for them to even transfer the domain over.  What if comcast bought a registrant and then decided to seize all domains that talked about that.  This is more about freedom of speech on the internet.  Hence its in the tech news.
- The Story on the DNC hacks is a great read.  Whether or not you believe it happened is your own choice.  This story talks about how it potentially happened using hotel wifi and the NSA tools.  Really interesting too and a great read for the tech side of it. 

Please remember this is a post on technology.  This Week In Technology focuses on the tech side of things.  That is going to be stuff like automated cars, new gadgets, things affects the internet, and all that good stuff.  This Week In Science which is done on fridays is about new research, discoveries, space, and studies.  

The one thing thought I feel maybe should of been changed is the titles.  Sometimes I tend to use the titles because its easier to explain them.  The titles might of came off swayed towards one political or propaganda side, but I naturally assume people who are here are not after politics and looking for tech talk so they wouldn't even see it that way.

My [factual and neutral comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6utql2/daily_discussion_sunday_august_20_2017/dlvc9ct/) which is VERY much relevant to trading was down voted heavily just because it's about BCH.

People calling Bitcoin Cash ""Bcash"" get up voted, and if you try to correct them you're instantly down voted. Would it be fair if I started calling Bitcoin, Bcore? Because it's not fucking called Bcore, it's called Bitcoin.

By the way, if you're not aware, ""Bcash"" was coined by users of /r/Bitcoin specifically to delegitimize the coin. It's a stupid and petty thing to try and change the name of a currency. If you need to shorten it, use BCH.

Anyone expressing big block sentiment or support of Bitcoin Cash is ALWAYS down voted heavily. I've been browsing this sub for YEARS (not under this username) but I HARDLY participate anyway because of the way I'm attacked for trying to express my views.

If you support Bitcoin Cash, you are called a shill, or an /r/btc brigader. I've been following this sub before /r/btc ever became popular, but am I not allowed to be apart of this community if I browse /r/btc?

If you browse /r/Bitcoin and post here, I guess you're not an /r/Bitcoin brigader, you're just a good community member?

I'm tired of the way people are being down voted just for expressing their opinions, and I suspect this will be heavily down voted as well.

People continue to refuse to acknowledge that Bitcoin Cash has real value, and use arguments like only WHALES are buying, when in fact there are tons of REAL people buying because they believe in this coins future.

So many people here have already been wrong about BCH, and don't understand why it went over $1000, because they don't understand the fundamentals.",2017-08-20 17:00:37

dlvy1ej,jstolfi,131,"The dumb but perfectly accurate answer is that Wladimr Van der Laan refuses to  increase the block size limit.  He is the head maintainer of the Core Github repository, and decides which changes to the software, provided by the other Core contributors, will go into the official Core releases.

Wladimir's salary is paid by the Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a research project affiliated to the Media Lab, an old and famous (or infamous, as some would say) research unit of MIT.  However, DCI's money does not come from MIT's budget, but from specific donations to DCI from external entities.   

I have not been able to find who are those entities.  However, it is curious that Joi Ito, the current head of the Media Lab, is also a co-founder of a venture capital firm that was among Blockstream's first VC investors.  

Be as it may, Wladimir's decisions have been totally tuned to the wishes of Blockstream and its associated companies (like Ciphrex and Chaincode Labs), who drirectly or indirectly hire most of the currently active Core developers.

So the question should be: why does Blockstream refuse to raise the block size limit?  

Blockstream was founded in 2014, and its business plans seem to be entirely founded on Greg's proposal to redesign the bitcoin protocol into a ""two-layer"" model, in  which the original network would be retained only as a ""settlement layer"" with a ""fee market"".   Greg proposed this redesign on bitcointalk in Feb/2013, arguing that Satoshi's design was doomed because miners would be unable charge enough fee revenue to survive after the block reward ceased to be sufficient.  Thus, he claimed, bitcoin's capacity had to be artificially limited and disputed, to ensure the very high fees that (he believed) were needed to maintain miner profitability

Gavin and Mike Hearn, who were then in charge of the Core repository, rejected Greg's plan as nonsensical (which it is).   But the creation of Blockstream gave Greg the financial muscle to take over the Core development, oust Gavin and Mike, and impose his redesign as ""The Core roadmap"".

Keeping the 1 MB limit is essential to that redesign, because the ""fee market"" would only exist if the network was permanently congested, with a stable persistent backlog.  Greg has been waiting for that to happen since Jan/2016, when the normal traffic first banged its head against the 1 MB limit.  An increase to 2 MB would not get rid of congestion, but supposedly would delay the appearance of that permanent stable backlog for another year or two.  (It is no use explaining to Greg that such thing cannot ever exist.)

Another reason to deny any increase in the block size limit is that the second layer of Blockstream's two-layer model will not be attractive to users until almost all of them have moved their coins to it.  That is, layer 2 cannot be just opened to users, and grow naturally by attracting them with their supposed advantages.  All bitcoin users must be forced to migrate to it as soon as it becomes available.",2017-08-21 01:51:25

dlxbejp,goatpig_armory,64,"BCH still lacks a lot of things to be a clean fork:

1) They need to change their script hash prefix to signal their chain within addresses. Currently, wallets cannot tell the difference between an address meant to receive BCH or BTC. I cannot think of a technical reason why they did not take this step. Hopefully BTC will soon move to bech32 addresses for native SW, so that issue will be eventually resolved, but by no merit of BCH.

2) Their difficulty adjustment change and identical network port eases the execution of sybill attacks, where you can isolate a node, feed it enough full difficulty blocks at large intervals to stretch the median time to the point where you can drop the difficulty that node will accept to something meaningless for a modern ASICs, and run a bogus chain. 

Now consider their chain has ~1/15 of the BTC chain difficulty, so it's easy to compute those full difficulty blocks to begin with.

Pair this with the fact that BCH uses the same network port as BTC and have a tiny node count in comparison and it is painfully easy to sybill a BCH node. As a matter of fact, my BCH node takes sometimes over an hour to bootstrap with actual BCH nodes, while I have to manually kick the BTC nodes overwhelming it.

3) While their replay protection is a good step forward, they basically air dropped that some 4 days before the split. In general their development needs to be more open. You could levy criticism against the B2X fork because you could actually parse the changeset. BCH went out of its way to reformat a lot of code files for no apparent reasons and that makes reviewing their actual changes a titanic task for basically anybody. 

I dread their next version.

4) To this day I still do not know how to access their testnet. Say what you want about B2X, but it's sufficiently close to BTC that I don't have to preliminary test changes to signer code on the damn mainnet!

----------------------------------

Let me clear, this post is not in defense of B2X over BCH. I personally believe BCH is poorly executed at the technical level and B2X is lined up to be even worse. 

For B2X to be successful, they'd need to do what BCH did without the mistakes (replay protection shenaningans, just HF the diff), do the extra stuff BCH is missing (change script hash prefixes, network port, magic numbers) and keep their development actually open (which neither BCH nor B2X appears to have a taste for).

I only wish separatists would fork cleanly so that we can both go our separate ways. The right to dissociate is a beautiful thing and I love Bitcoin for enabling it. But for the love of god, BCH and B2X people, fork cleanly. The only thing BCH has managed to achieve so far is to give service providers and wallet developers a massive headache.",2017-08-21 23:39:33

dlwbt0g,MiyMusashi,51,"I've seen a number of bubbles since the early 1980's. Baseball cards were my first experience with bubbles. I collected them because I liked them. Prices began to rise. Soon Wall Street bankers were buying them as speculative investments. They didn't really like them - they liked the money. Then U.S. real estate in late 80's. Then the DotCom bubble. The Internet was extremely interesting and had almost unlimited potential. Everyone could see it. Then the IPO's started and the valuations grew. Then all anyone saw was the money. I knew people that were mortgaging their house and taking the money and buying .com stocks of companies that had never made a dime (and never did). Then there was the Ferrari boom after that. Then the second U.S. real estate bubble in the early 2000's. The oil bubble. the U.S. Treasury bond bubble. There's the possible current bubble in stocks and real estate again right now. I guess I should throw in the six-pack abs advertising bubble as well. Wealth is created and destroyed over and over. Like in a casino, some win, most lose in the long run.

The focus on wealth, income and consumer lifestyle is so strong these days that people are like schools of fish that dart from one potential money making scheme to the next, always trying to be the first one in. The accessibility and efficiency of information on the internet make the school move far faster than it used too.

Crypto has followed the bubble path.  As NT said above though ""Everyone knows it's a bubble. We still expect it to go higher."" 
There are so many variables involved it's basically impossible to even form a rational assumption as to what is going to happen though. The vast majority in these forums are far more interested in making money from the price appreciation of crypto than pursuing the original ideology behind it of destroying or damaging the legacy banking system or halting governments intrusion into privacy. That's unfortunate because that's what really gives crypto its value.

90% of the coins out there are useless. They have no value. They all use the same website templates, spout the same rhetoric and wild claims but haven't actually done anything and never will. Yet, millions of dollars are thrown at them eagerly. That is what always happens in bubbles. The ICO creators will spend that money. It will disappear and they still will not have done anything useful. 

The infighting and cannibalization going on in the BTC/BCH/BTC2X arena is another sign. Bitcoin has grown big enough that now everyone wants to try to control it. You hear very little about BTC disrupting anything anymore (except maybe from A.Antonop). It's more about business, scalability, speculation etc. Well, the truth is that almost NO ONE uses crypto. NO ONE. As a percentage of all economic transactions that occur in a day, those involving crypto are essentially negligible. In fact, the dominant amount of volume is just speculators trading back and forth on exchanges. That's not economic adoption. It's just hopeful speculation. The general public just laughs at crypto right now and it probably won't change for some time, if ever. Not with 3 or 4 different versions of BTC fighting it out, 900 different crypto ponzi's running at any given time, and massive hacks or raids occurring on a weekly basis.

Any newbie trying to learn is going to have to navigate YouTube's plethora of less than honest propaganda pushing affiliate codes for Genesis, hashflare, bitconnect etc. If they do find valid instructive videos then they'll still have to wade through all the slop about BCH vs BTC vs BTC1 vs BTC2X etc. 

As one who got into crytpo as an ideologue it's frustrating to watch. It's like supporting a presidential candidate because of their pre election speeches and then watching them get into office and do absolutely nothing of what they said they would do because they sell out at the first opportunity. That's basically every election here in the U.S. - on both sides. Crypto was a new realm where I thought I could avoid the hyperbole and rhetoric of politics. Maybe move away from the usual glacial speed of change in society and move toward something new and disruptive. But, alas, that may not be the case. 

So, I believe we are in a bubble. The only question is whether it will be a fatal bubble or just a setback. Will it be a long term setback or short term from which the crypto space will recover quickly? I don't know. We'll find out soon enough I guess. A bubble popping will be good. It will purge the space of speculators that could care less about financial innovation and that school of fish will move on to something else. Then we can get back to disruption.",2017-08-21 06:43:34

dlycqrl,dooglus,128,"The very first sentence is factually inaccurate:

&gt; In the early days of Bitcoin, there was no-such thing as a “non-mining full node”. Every miner was a node and every node was a miner.

Not true. There was always an option to mine or not to mine. I mined for a month and then stopped, since it was burning my lap to run the CPU all the time. After January 2011 my full node was very definitely a non-mining full node.

&gt; the moment the majority of miners would start performing fraud, Bitcoin will become worthless and noone will trust it any longer

That's not true. If the majority of miners start mining invalid blocks, the exchanges and real users (the ones validating the blocks they accept) would reject those blocks. The dishonest miners have effectively resigned from the network and in time the difficulty would adjust, allowing the remaining honest miners to earn more coins per unit hashrate.

&gt; Miners know people will retaliate by changing the proof of work system to make the miners’s equipment obsolete.

Not even that. We would simply reject their blocks. We can do this because we are running fully validating nodes.

&gt; Neither a “non-mining full node” nor an SPV client will prevent a majority of miners from doing an upgrade through a hard fork.

My non-mining full node can't stop miners from resigning from the network and going to work on an altcoin. But it can detect when they do so, and reject their invalid blocks. That's the point. Miners don't get to set the consensus rules; they get to enforce them. If they don't enforce the consensus rules, they aren't mining Bitcoin. They're mining an altcoin, and my full node will reject their altcoin blocks.

&gt; you will need to update your “non-mining full node” software to keep using the Bitcoin Network

No, that's not true. I will need to update my node software if I wish to switch to an altcoin. If I want to stick with Bitcoin I don't need to update anything.

&gt; Connecting directly to a trusted mining full node is the only way to make sure your transaction has safely arrived

""trusted mining full node"" - I think you're missing the point. We aren't meant to be trusting third parties. If you want to have to trust third parties I would recommend using PayPal or some other centralized legacy system.

&gt; This makes zero confirmation transactions much safer

Zero confirmation transactions have never been safe, and never will be. Miners are under no obligation to mine the first version of a transaction they see. There is nothing to stop them mining a high-fee double-spend transaction even if it doesn't bear the ""replace by fee"" mark.

&gt; If everyone runs a “non-mining full node” and there’s a hard fork upgrade, a lot of clients would become obsolete

If there's a hard fork upgrade, by definition there is consensus for it, and so the people running full nodes would update their software. If instead there's a hard fork corporate takeover attack on the network, the full nodes won't update their software and will continue to operate on the Bitcoin network, unaffected by the malicious hard fork. This is a good thing.

&gt; If most people would run an SPV client instead, they wouldn’t notice anything and just follow the longest chain

That would be a problem. People might find themselves using B2Xcoin without even knowing it. It is a mistake to use SPV clients and trust that the miners won't switch to the wrong consensus rules without you knowing about it.

&gt; Upgrades could happen faster and with a lot less fuss than today

The same goes for corporate takeovers. It must be inconvenient to have people running their own full nodes getting in the way of big business co-opting Bitcoin. Why don't we all just trust you and let you twist Bitcoin any way you want to? Double the block rewards? Sure, don't even bother asking me if I'm OK with it - I'm just an SPV user after all. Roll-back transactions arbitrarily? Don't mind if you do. I won't even notice, I'm an SPV user.

No thanks.

&gt; But 99% of users can do perfectly fine with an SPV client, and everyone would be better off as a result

The activation of segwit will do almost nothing in the short term to alleviate the problem. Disappointment will only deepen and users who thought an end was in sight realize that the destruction of use cases from the bottom up can continue for a long time.

At the moment, there are no good solutions. There are solutions that look good in the short term (Bitcoin Cash, some other alts), but whose long term prospects look dim. There are solutions that look good in the long term (Lightning Network and other secure off-chain solutions), but which will require the construction of a vast array of infrastructure before being fully functional.

There's really nothing that will alleviate the symptoms of hyper-growth in the intermediate term.

Bitcoin is undergoing a transition from an idea that showed promise to one showing results. It's now growing faster than Moore's Law can keep pace with, and its users are both reaping the rewards and feeling the pain.

dlyrdm5,ferretinjapan,76,"My post from [9 months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cinxq/sergio_demian_lerner_on_twitter_funny/d9x1yce/)

&gt; Well, there we have it folks, Blockstream is playing the Bitcoin community like a fucking fiddle right now, and all his cronies are playing along. FYI, these published patents were lodged 18 months ago!! That is if this is in line with the American patent system. So, soon after Blockstream was formed, they've been scrambling to lock down every single piece of intellectual property they can get their hands on, and since CORE has been employed since Blockstream was formed, that means EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IP PRODUCED BY THEM BELONGS TO BLOCKSTREAM TOO, SegWit, Lightning, whatever else they have waiting in the wings. All theirs.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe a slow clap is in order.
&gt; 
&gt; THIS is why they've fought tooth and nail to prevent a blocksize increase, and if SegWit had been deployed in time, they'd have fucked the miners, and the entire community by being able to completely control, WHO, and HOW Seg Wit transactions can be used. Don't worry your pretty little heads people, there's almost certainly a SW patent already lodged. 
&gt; 
&gt; I fucking said it 3 months ago:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[Yep, this is not a free market, this is a cornered market, or depending on your point of view, a natural monopoly. Big money pays to lock down the majority of Core developers with fat paycheques, spreads poisonous PR (compliments of Greg and Theymos) and threaten to take their ball and go home if the miners consider alternatives. Lets not forget their plans for a Defensive Patent portfolio, yeah, ""defensive"".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Users/Merchants cannot force a change of software without the miners, and as long as the miners continue to be willing slaves to Blockstream, Bitcoin is going nowhere except where Blockstream wants it to go.
&gt;  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vcicl/cnledger_andreas_the_market_decided_to_strongly/d5xetg1/
&gt; 
&gt; and here:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The fact that they didn't have a single patent before setting up the pledge is proof enough to me that this was purely a defensive move based on the news of some other corporate planning to monetize Craig Wright's patents.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It's still a good move to protect Bitcoin while at the same time protecting Blockstream.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;[–]ferretinjapan [+72] 1 point 3 months ago 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;I wouldn't be so sure. Patents take a long while to be approved so the fact that they don't have them in hand does little to assuage me, they could've filed dozens already for all we know and they're simply in the early stages of approval, and besides, you can be certain that when Blockstream gets sold (not if but when as BS is a startup, they're designed to be sold) those patents will pass from their control and any previous agreements will mean nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;If they got the patents and gave them to a non-profit I'd trust their motives, as doing so would serve exactly the same end and ensure the patents are not abused, not by them, or by anyone else, but I bet Greg will fight very, very hard to avoid that situation. He'll come up with all sorts of excuses, handwave it away, etc. . Those patents are a means of controlling people he currently can't herd according right now.

**I hope you people are fucking paying attention now.** I eagerly await to see what this ""decisive legal action"" will be. I have no doubt that they've been laying a nice little IP trail to fuck any and all miners that try to hardfork.

There was a time when bitcoin as it stood was great for P2P micropayments but today it now needs to have even bigger aspirations than simply competing with WU/Visa.  

If I was to make this image again, it would be with BitPay and exchanges on the left taking similar middleman fees as WU... and Sidechains on the right with decentralised exchanges and the machine-payable web showing how this technology can evolve into being something even greater than we imagined it could be back when I made the original image.

In the meantime I'm very happy that BCH exists, bitcoin is for everyone and the more open the ecosystem is, the more effectively we will find the optimal solutions.

**Core and Miner are sharing a car on a roadtrip together**. They've been on this road trip a long time. Disagreements have happened, of course, but these two have always been able to work things out.

**The two of them make a good team.** Core plans the trips and maintains the car, and Miner drives. They have a lot of fun doing it and have a good number of followers on their instagram, which helps pay for the expenses.

On this current leg of their road trip, they arrive at Segwit City. Miner plans to visit 2X City next and then continue the road trip, but the drive will be hard on the car, and so, Core doesn't want to visit 2X City -- not yet, at least. 

**Miner really wants to visit 2X City.**  He doesn't get to pick destinations often because Core does the trip planning. 2X City is so important to Miner that he is willing to get his own car and drive to 2X City without Core. Core might be okay with that.

**So, does Core:**

* Ignore Miner's request, and continue the road trip as planned without visiting 2X City
* Visit 2X City with Miner and then continue the road trip as planned

**With the 1st option**, Miner is hurt and feels betrayed by his partner. The shared road trip is over. Miner will soon need help trip-planning and maintaining the car.  Worse, if the car breaks down on the hard drive to 2X City, Miner may be stuck on the roadside until getting help with repairs. Core, on the other hand, is stuck at Segwit City until he finds a new driver. Core and Miner both worry that they will lose a large chunk of instagram followers, which will make it that much harder to pay for expenses and find help. It could delay the road trip significantly.

**With the 2nd option**, crisis averted; Miner is happy, and the team is still together, but Core is upset because his hand was forced and now the plan for the road trip is delayed a bit. Core's also worried that the car may break down during this hard drive to 2X City.  If it does, it may need some serious repairs before they can continue. It could delay the road trip significantly.

***

**If Core refuses to support 2X and the Miners follow through with Segwit2X, it would hurt Bitcoin a lot.** The public would be split, and Bitcoin (the Core's version) would be dead in the water without miners, until the difficulty dropped or was reset with a hard fork.

dlz61y7,DCinvestor,107,"I have no doubt that the next 6 months will be watershed months for investors in the crypto space.  If you're sitting on the sidelines or trying to figure out your next move, please consider the points below:

1) *Mainstream media coverage is blowing up.*  Crypto is now a nearly daily feature on CNBC and Bloomberg.  Fortune magazine's [cover article](http://fortune.com/2017/08/22/bitcoin-ethereum-blockchain-cryptocurrency/) this month is on blockchain.  And they are launching a new feature called [The Ledger](http://fortune.com/2017/08/22/ledger-blockchain-fintech/) focused on blockchain fintech.  This means people with money want to know more about crypto, but the vast majority of them haven't pulled the trigger, which means...

2) *BIG individual and institutional money is coming.*  We've hit a tipping point folks.  Hedge funds and investment firms are sprouting up to meet mass market investor demand for crypto.  That increase in demand is not likely to abate for years, possibly decades.  It will accelerate even faster if/when the SEC approves ETFs for crypto.  And right as that BIG money is coming in...

3) *Bitcoin's brand confusion will be at an all time high.*  Make no mistake, the period between now and November is going to be a shit show.  Prepare yourselves.  BTC and BCH are fighting it out (possibly to the death).  No one knows what is going to happen, but a black swan event is possible for BTC. It's also possible that both chains will survive and that a third will be created for Segwit2x.  Regardless, BCH will likely continue to leech market cap from BTC.  If you hold BTC or BCH, be very, very careful.  It might even be enough to scare off some new investors, but...

4) *That new money will still need to go somewhere, and I'm thinking a lot of it will come to ETH.*  ETH will hopefully continue on its way up, through the release of Metropolis, continued EEA announcements, and then massive price speculation about exciting features coming in Casper (proof of stake, sharding, Plasma support).

Time and time again I was berated for not knowing what I was talking about.

I mentioned nearly eight months ago that SW addresses will require a new type of address and possibly a new format.

I was downvoted to oblivion, called a ""r\/btc shill"" and ""clueless"".

I posted that Lightning channels will require two fees to operate plus a middle man fee for each transaction across the channel. I was wildly berated as an idiot.

Go ahead, Core. Prove me right again, because *I already know that's exactly how it is going to work.* Miner fees are going to be siphoned into hub fees, Lightning channels will be prohibitively expensive to open even with SW-secured coins ready to deploy, and not only will on-chain fees rise *even further*, those new middle man fees will become nearly unavoidable - and the alternative of using a ""legacy"" transaction will be *even more expensive than that*!

Bitcoin doesn't have a future for consumers, at least while this scaling plan is being followed. That price can continue to rise, but so long as the fees (denominated in **satoshi per byte**) also rise, the utility of Bitcoin is continuously being reduced. Anyone accepting Bitcoin has to be aware that fees are a significant overhead that limit the utility of a payment method. It is pointless to accept Bitcoin in a candy store, for example: the average purchase is smaller than the average network fee.

The common Bitcoin user has one option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins. SegWit introduces a second option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins into an address that gets a discount in the future. Heck of a choice!",2017-08-24 23:41:51
dm20s27,SirEDCaLot,157,"I think a lot of people were never really clear on what SegWit actually IS (and isn't).  

A lot of people assume SegWit is some gift from the heavens, that if it only activates it will fix every problem and make the backlog go away and make fees go down and take us TO THE MOON as soon as it activates.  

The reality is that SegWit is largely just a new transaction format which stores its signatures separately from transaction data, in a way that's easily separated off for relaying to non-SegWit nodes.  It will take some time before it gets adopted and used in any significant measure, and even then the actual effect will be moderate- even if 100% of the transactions in a block are SegWit transactions, you've still only got (depending on the specifics of the transactions) 2-3MB or so worth of transaction space.  That's if 100% of transactions are SegWit transactions, which won't happen for years if ever- in reality there will be a mix of SegWit and normal transactions so the boost won't be that dramatic.  Until/unless SegWit transactions become the norm, the actual effect will be somewhat less.  

That's not to say that this isn't a good thing.  IMHO, the main benefit of SegWit is enabling other technology like Lightning.  I don't know if Lightning will work as well as some claim, or if it will promote centralization as some others claim, but I want to see it get a chance-- if it sucks then it sucks and we can move on to something else, but if it works it could be a real benefit for everyone and possibly a new era for Bitcoin.

price of bcash will fall significantly. miners still will switch to bcash when it generates more profit, but the difficulty will be mutch lower. this will lead to mulitple blocks per minute and a full 2016 cycle will be done in a couple of hours, which will reduce the impact on bitcoin and will further downgrade the price of bcash.",2017-08-24 21:24:53
dm1zk5k,ThomasZander,114,"I'm speaking from my personal opinion here.

The EDA is something I came to appreciate quite a lot since we started Bitcoin Cash. I initially also [suggested](https://github.com/Bitcoin-UAHF/spec/pull/15) a sunset clause, but am not sure its needed anymore.

The period we are in today is one of adjustment. We deployed the software update, but the economic update is slower and underway.

Here is the important detail, **this will only be an issue as long as there are two chains that are roughly equal in profitability for miners**. When we no longer are in that situation, the observed behaviour will no longer be economically useful. And thus will stop.  
Or in simpler terms; we won't see 92.5% of hashpower being turned off to trigger it if they can't direct that hashpower elsewhere to make money off of the downtime.

So the important question is, how do we get out of this temporary situation. How do we get back to one chain. And this is rather simple, we need to make the world value the Bitcoin Cash chain. It demonstrably can't die (whereas the Bitcoin chain can be starved to death of hashpower). It has bigger blocks. It has 3 teams releasing software for it.

Each coin has a pair of properties that balances it and gives it a value. On one side we have the difficulty. Which is the amount of electricity it takes to make a block. On the other we have the price of the coin.

The BTC chain has a very different balance than the BCC one. But the end result is they are roughly the same.

If we worry about the difficulty, we need to work on the price.

Back when I started getting interested in Bitcoin we had people produce flyers. Give tips to many people on many subs on reddit. Go store to store and try to engage the merchant into trying it. Post videos of successful payments online. Tell the word about Bitcoin Cash. Go to your local exchange or merchant-backing software people and get them to back BCC.

You can come up with more things yourself, but the main point I'm trying to make here is that solving the issue that OP describes implies being better than BTC. And the world has to understand that.",2017-08-24 17:37:07

Of course try posting something negative about btc on btc and you won't get banned outright. Here? I'll expect my ban soon. Not that I care. I've seen so much propaganda coming from here with a complete failure to discuss it openly and reasonably.

Taking transactions off chain and putting them into the hands of a private group of people who are connected to bilderbergs bankers that have everything to lose if Bitcoin accomplishes their goal.of a decentralized currency.

So segwit gets pushed and propagandized.

It's not that I don't get the point of segwit at all and can see no usefulness in it for other purposes.

It's that it requires centrilization of what is supposed to be a global currency.

Which, to be honest, we are have a centrilized system and I really have no desire to change banks if that's all you're offering.

The main argument I hear from segwitters is that increasing the block size will cause the block chain size to grow too fast for anyone but the richest people to afford running a node.

Of course this was already shown to be a non issue due to the natural scaling of technology that has been valid for the last few decades or so.

If, for some reason, the human race could no longer expect increases in our level of technology then yes I will say we need to find an alternative.

**EDIT**

I 'get' what Luke is talking about here.  He thinks the blocksize should be smaller to begin with.  That's an opinion he has that not everyone shares.

However, the argument against Segwit2X and an argument presented here for years is that Segwit offers a near doubling of on-chain transaction capacity.  It was supposed to give us 'runway' until layer-2 solutions come online.

Also, LN offers very little scaling of additional users of bitcoin because every single user of LN must be able to perform on-chain transactions; at a reasonable cost and without a major delay in confirmation.

The number of individuals who can actually use LN is deeply gated by the base blocksize.

It's also important to note that the primary transactions which will occur on the LN will be for relatively low amounts of value.

These are **not** transactions we are moving off of the main bitcoin network because the main bitcoin network hasn't been usable for low-value transfers in quite some time!

The main network is being used for moving large sums of money to and from exchanges where a $3 fee is acceptable.

If you already sold you are liable for it all this year in your taxes, just pay it.

If you didn't sell and are still holding the coins, here's something I typed up a while back explaining capital gains:

Long Term (over a year) Capital Gains tax here is 15% for most people, unless you make more than $418,400 in a year, it's 15%.

**TL;DR;Easy Version: Subtract your yearly income (plus a little extra to play it safe) from $418,400, and cash out that much in Bitcoin per year if you want to maximize your profits (assuming you believe Bitcoin will at least maintain its current value.)**

In the US we have tax brackets for ***income tax***:

&gt;$0 - $9,325
&gt;10% of Taxable Income

&gt;$9,325 - $37,950
&gt;$932.50 plus 15% of the excess over $9325

&gt;$37,950 - $91,900
&gt;$5,226.25 plus 25% of the excess over $37,950

&gt;$91,900 - $191,650
&gt;$18,713.75 plus 28% of the excess over $91,900

&gt;$91,900 to $191,650
&gt;$18,713.75 plus 28% of the excess over $91,900

&gt;$191,650 to $416,700
&gt;$46,643.75 plus 33% of the excess over $191,650

&gt;$416,700 to $418,400
&gt;$120,910.25 plus 35% of the excess over $416,700

&gt;$418,400+
&gt;$121,505.25 plus ***39.6%*** of the excess over ***$418,400***

The increased % only applies to the income made ***after*** the previous threshold ***on income tax.***

Long term capital gains won't get included in income tax but will still trigger a new income tax bracket, just none of that income is ***""income taxable"".***

All of the gain will be set at 15% for most people unless you pass the income tax bracket threshold from 35% to 39.6%.

Hedging your losses in capital gains only works if you know one year you'll be making ***X*** or another year you'll be making ***Y***, where X is under $418,400 and Y is over $418,400.

You adjust your cash-out accordingly to your expected income.

Long Term Capital gains changes from 15% to 20% (5% loss of 1 million is 50k) after you pass from the 35% into the ***39.6%*** tax bracket, which is at ***$418,400.***

So if you really want to, if you make 50k a year currently, only cash out $350,000 this year, and $350,000 next year and so on.

&gt;So if I had an annual salary of 100k and cashed out bitcoin of roughly 100k how would that scenario play out? Which bracket do you fall into?

[**If you're single and make $100,000**](https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/) your ***wages*** fall into the 28% bracket:

&gt;28%: $91,900 to $191,650

&gt;$18,713.75 plus 28% of the excess over $91,900

Your total federal income tax on ***wages*** not factoring out deductions or anything else would be: **$20,981.75**

Your take home is **$79,018.25**.

Math:

&gt;100,000 - 91,900 = 8,100

&gt;28% of 8,100 = 2,268

&gt;2,268 + 18,713.75 = **$20,981.75**

If your capital gains from Bitcoin are another $100,000 your ***total income*** (not wages) is now $200,000.

***Your wage tax stays the same***, but your total income bracket is now in the 33% category.

33% bracket puts your [**long term capital gains tax at 15%.**](http://www.taxesindepth.com/internal/images/short-vs-long-term-gains.png)

Your $100,000 in Bitcoin is getting taxed $15,000, so you take 85k of that.

##Your take home is $79,018.25 + $85,000 = **$164,018.25**

Let's change this up a bit though to stress the point a bit more:

&gt;If your Bitcoin income was $318,**399**, your ***wages*** would still be taxed **$20,981.75**.

&gt;Your total income would be below $418,400 ***by 1 dollar.***

&gt;$318,**399** would be taxed at 15%: **$47,759.85**

&gt;If your Bitcoin income was $318,**401** your total income would be ***above*** $418,400 ***by 1 dollar.***

&gt;$318,**401** would be taxed at 20%: **$63,680.20**

You would be losing 20k (5%) because of a dollar difference.

And that's only 300,000 in capital gains.

Millions would be whatever that 5% difference is, ***but your wage tax stays unaffected.***

But, this also only matters when crossing the total threshold of ***$418,400.***

Unless you're making big bucks, or don't care, only cash out to a total ***under $418,400*** per year, including your normal wages.

**Edit:** Please note that this doesn't include any other kinds of taxes, such as the Net Investment Income Tax, or state taxes on capital gains. ***Either way***, the procedure is still the same to avoid the tax bracket bump, just the extra taxes result in a net gain of a little less.

&gt;https://www.irs.gov/individuals/net-investment-income-tax

&gt;3.8% up to the ""lesser"" amount of...

&gt;Married filing jointly — $250,000,

&gt;Married filing separately — $125,000,

&gt;Single or head of household — $200,000, or

&gt;Qualifying widow(er) with a child — $250,000.

&gt;So if you're single, you also pay 3.8% of 200,000, or **$7,600.**

[**Here's the combined marginal rate per state.**](https://taxfoundation.org/how-high-are-capital-gains-tax-rates-your-state/)

The IRS hates me now.

Also, ***this isn't structuring or tax evasion/fraud*** because no one can tell you when to sell your assets or in what order, or by how much.

Structuring is an issue when you're trying to prevent companies from reporting your transactions by splitting them up into really small  (&lt;$10,000) amounts.

dm43kur,BobAlison,212,"You can't counter an argument unless you can clearly state it. The tweet doesn't even acknowledge the concern I've read far too many times it seems. Here's an attempt.

Blockstream Core is deliberately stunting the growth of block space. The goal is to raise fees and thereby create demand for centralized, second-layer solutions like side chains and Lightning Network. Having created the demand, Blockstream Core will then spring its trap by corralling Bitcoin users into a walled garden of its own creation. Fees formerly paid to miners will then be siphoned off to Blockstream Core through its many toll gates. Patents have been issued and will fortify a monopoly, thus repaying the big banking interests that financed Blockstream Core.

Like any conspiracy theory, this has a kind of internal logic that can be hard to get a handle on. Blockstream could do itself a service by publishing a clear business plan in which its current and planned revenue sources were clearly stated.

On the other hand, Blockstream and most other Bitcoin companies face a peculiar problem. The more efficiently Bitcoin works, the less it needs the services of third parties. The services that remain experience cut-throat competition because they're all based on open standards. Bitcoin excels at disintermediation, kicking the middle man to the curb. Most Bitcoin companies ignore this simple fact, hand-waving their way to profitability.

Either way, it should be clear that pointing to the revenues miners currently earn doesn't exactly address the main concern.

**Edit**: It seems that some may have interpreted the second paragraph as a statement of my own belief. To be clear, it is not. It is my interpretation of what a passionate group within Bitcoin has been saying for many months. If Bitcoin is going to make it through the many challenges ahead, those in a position to make changes need to at least be able to restate contrary opinions. And I don't think the tweet does that.

dm4vvng,mcuban,166,"First things first. 

I have no interest in selling any tokens that I buy or earn. I'm in this because I think some of the next great applications can be built on top of blockchain. 

I love being part of game changing technologies.  

Let me give you some history   Back in the day , my first company, microsolutions, was one of the first to integrate local area and then wide area networks.  I spent 8 years writing software on top of net ware, banyan, exchange and others. Maybe some old schoolers remember those 

When I started it, people called me crazy. We just got our first PCs , why do we need to connect them ? We just walk our floppies from one pc to the next. No one needs a local area network 

I sold it to CompuServe   I retired.  Had a lot of fun 

I started trading tech stocks with that money. Did so well that I started and sold a fund. It was lucrative. 

A couple of years later I saw the opportunity to leverage the internet to stream audio.  We started audionet.  Talk about radio on the internet , none of you were connecting 8 hour VCRs to the boards at radio stations using analog cables then taking those back to packard bell pentiums to encode and host and deliver on demand over an isdn line at my house   Fun times 

We had hundreds of internet radio stations. We created hundreds of internet only , genre specific stations from xmas to police scanners and every type of music. More than 20 years ago

We did the same for video. 

Everyone told me I was an idiot.  That's what radio and tv were for.  No one will ever think this is better   

After selling I bought the Mavs   Paid the highest price ever for any team. 285m. The Mavs were horrible. I was an idiot.  Till I wasn't 

And around then  I started HDNet.  It was the first all high definition tv network.  Ever. 

That's when HDTVs were selling for 20k plus and everyone said they were so expensive there would never be more than a few thousand rich people with hdtvs.  I was an idiot for thinking anyone would spend so much.  Till they didn't have to spend that much 

It was profitable then and profitable now 

I like to try things that I think can be revolutionary or change the status quo.  Some work. Some don't. 

I'm a fan of blockchain based applications and have been for years.  The price of Bitcoin has nothing to do with how blockchain can be used to create potentially transformational applications. 

I think private networks will see the best results early. 

I think there is a great team behind mercury protocol and it can be part of an unlimited number of amazing apps that can change the game. That's something I love to be part of.  It's not a lock. But we have a real shot 

Hopefully you all think I'm an idiot. That's usually a good sign 

Thanks for indulging me.

dm5bdn0,revcback,109,"A word on digital currencies.

Cryptocurrencies are a new and unregulated asset class. Most coins are backed by literally nothing - no good developers, no proper roadmap or funding, nothing. Your hard earned money gets you ""tokens"" which have no inherent value except a number on a screen. If you're investing in something other than the top 20 cryptocurrencies (ie. Bitcoin or Ethereum), it's akin to gambling. You'll probably lose everything overnight. That being said, I'll explain Bitcoin and its value for you. 

Bitcoin is a virtual, decentralised currency. But what is it? It's just a few lines of code. Every coin is just a few 1s and 0s. What gives it value? The fact that other people think it's worth something. There are hundreds if not thousands of exchanges, businesses, miners and users who have invested time and money into this system. People believe in Bitcoin and its value, and thus, it has value. What does Bitcoin do? Well, your money is free from the control of governments. You can send millions of dollars across borders with a $1 fee in two minutes. It's pretty revolutionary. However, if you buy Bitcoin, think of it as buying a piece of the network, and NOT as an investment. There is a very solid chance that you will lose every dime. However, since it is a new and growing space, the upside is unimaginable. 

TL;DR: Bitcoin is awesome. You may lose all your money. Invest a bit and be safe!",2017-08-26 19:02:18

dm4mc43,EarthquakeBass,83,"The answers here don't explain what Bitcoin is actually backed by.

Bitcoin is backed by an absolutely massive network of computers verifying transactions 24/7. Committing fraud against this network (spending money twice, etc.) is very difficult. This is all done without any centralized authority and backed by strong, proven mathematics. Attacking Bitcoin itself is tough. And properly protected (i.e. not in an exchange), it's way harder to take BTC away from an individual than, say, money in a Paypal account where they could easily just freeze it and hose you. The computers verifying your transactions in BTC don't care who you are. They really don't.

Whereas a shitty copycoin could much more easily experience a ""51% attack"" where an entity with lots of computers could hijack the whole network. That's Bitcoin's main ""moat"", the power is in the hands of an absolutely massive network of miners with varying interests. Even other popular coins like Ethereum have problems with too much centralization. BTC is still one of the only truly democratic coins.

4. you don't seem to mind that you can reverse charges if someone rips you off with visa, yet with bitcoin someone can receive the coin and fuck you over, responding ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I DUNNO LOL. and what are you going to do about it, exactly?
5. you think this snarky joke makes bitcoin look better, not worse.

dm501l8,SAI_Peregrinus,53,"Bitcoin addresses are 160 bits. They're hashes of the public key. That means that there are 2^160 possible addresses. That's a big number.

There are some fundamental physical limits on the energy required to perform a computation non-reversibly, such as generating a bitcoin address. The Landauer limit is one: it takes kTln2 Joules to flip one bit, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.68 * 10^-23), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ln 2 is the natural log of 2. On average to find a public key that hashes to the same address will take 2^159 operations.

Assume a computer exists which operates at this limit, is at the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (about 3K, cooling more takes more energy), and only needs to flip one bit to generate an entire RIPMED160 hash of a public key (it takes a lot more than one bit flip, so the numbers here are very low, they should be a few thousand times higher). It will then take 2^159 * 1.68 * 10^-23 * 3 * ln 2 Joules, which comes out to about 25.5 * 10^24 Joules. For contrast about 5.5 * 10^24 Joules of energy from the sun reach the Earth's each year.

So if you wanted to get a collision by randomly picking addresses and had a super-efficient computer the size of the Earth to magically calculate RIPMED160 hashes by flipping only one bit each it would take about 5 years. If you limited it to using only as much energy as all of human civilization consumed in 2010 it would take about 50 thousand years. If you ran it at room temperature (21 C) it would take about 5 million years.

So in practice it's a big enough number that you can pick them randomly and have no real chance of ever running out. Generally about 96 bits or more is enough, and 128 bits is definitely enough. ",2017-08-26 11:50:01

There's about 4BTC per block of fees, while a few weeks ago it was more like 1.5BTC. So *if!* this is spam, its about $10k per block, so about $60k per hour or $1.4M per day.

Bitcoin is already temp. broken (and so is Bitcoin Cash) thanks to all this tinkering/forking/fudding with the economy, there is nothing left to wait it out for a bit.

2. it's not on purpose, it's just bad design. Bitcoin will take some hits while Bitcoin Cash is still around. This can take years. Once mempool clears up a bit normal-ish operations will be in effect. Ignoring is best

Also, once the tokens are staked, this will effectively reduce the liquid supply of ETH for other purposes.  We may be in a situation where a substantial percentage of all ETH in existence becomes completely locked up in staking contracts.  This will also create additional and very substantial upward price pressure.

Think if it like the US government printing more money than they have in gold stored which normally would create inflation or reduce the value of the dollar but because Tether has a locked value, it's just adding value to the market that doesn't have any backing and essentially destroys the entire initial concept of USDT as a currency.

The Tether system issues 1 Tether coin for every dollar that is spent on it. There's no limit to the number of coins that can be minted and there's a bank account with a public ledger that allows people to see that the balance matches the number of coins in circulation.

It appears that there may have been some tether issued to a number of people perhaps for margin lending in which case they wouldn't have put up the cash but instead borrowed the tether. Tether, as a system, retains its stability by being transparent and issuing tether on margin lending would be a horrible way to generate confidence in the system.

I think more research needs to be done on this as it all seems a little too coincidental but also would really be pretty stupid of the tether developers to do.

dm7qn6y,jstolfi,137,"Because Blockstream was founded (and funded with 70 M USD) in 2014 with a specific ""business plan"": reform bitcoin from Satoshi's original design to Greg Maxwell's ""two layer"" design.  

Greg proposed his redesign in Feb/2013[ on a bitcointalk thread started by Peter Todd](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.msg1536969#msg1536969).  In his proposal, the bitcoin network would be reduced to a buried ""Layer 1"" used only for high-value ""settlements"" among entities of ""Layer 2"", a new more efficient network which would carry most of the actual p2p payments.  

Blockstream and/or its investors then would be able to make good profits from Layer 2, in ways that are not clear -- perhaps not even to Blockstream.  The redesign was also supposed to let bitcoin take over a slice of Visa's market, taking the price ""to the moon"".  Ant it might also create opportunities for bitcoin holders to profit by lending their coins, instead of selling them.  

The last two promises may explain the enthusiastic support that Blockstream received from big holders, even though they had only a vague idea of what Layer 2 would be.

Originally Layer 2 was supposed to be a federation of ""sidechains"" -- altcoins whose tokens would be pegged to bitcoins at a fixed exchange rate.  Apparently that idea was soon found to be inviable, but the Lightning Network idea then came up and was adopted by Blockstream in place of sidechains.

A key element in Greg's redesign was restricting the capacity of the ""Layer 1"".   Ostensibly, the goal was to drive fees up, so as to ensure sufficient revenue for miners in the future, when the block reward became insufficient.  The true reason probably was to force all bitcoin users and payments to Layer 2 -- since it is obvious  that they would never migrate spontaneously.  But there are other theories.

Anyway, Greg's design relied on the assumption that a sufficiently stable ""fee market"", with a reasonably well-defined fee x delay relationship, would develop in Layer 1, so that the settlement transactions needed by Layer 2 would be reliably confirmed in a timely manner.  

The traffic first hit the 1 MB limit in Jan/2016, and the fees indeed started to rise.  However, instead of a stable fee market, what happened since then was an irregular sequence of backlogs, with unpredictable delays for any reasonable fee, separated by periods with no backlog and hence no fee market.  

Even after 20 months of that regime, Greg claims that it is just a matter of time before the situation stabilizes and a permanent backlog with a predictable fee x delay function will appear.   

So, my explanation for why Blockstream is so adamantly opposed to any block size increase, even the ridiculous 2 MB of SegWit2X, is that it would set the clock back, and delay the expected ""stable fee market"" for another couple of years.

It is useless to try to explain to Greg that a permanent backlog, a stable fee market, and a working fee estimator are logical impossibilities; and that the ""chaotic"" regime of the past 20 months is going to persist forever.  

I can understand why he can't understand: without a stable ""fee market"" in Layer 1, his entire design collapses, because it would not be possible to execute settlements for Layer 2 timely and reliably.

Those posts earn cryptocurrency called Steem, that can be traded for USD later or used to promote your posts to reach a large audience. If you post good content you get upvotes from others that are worth $$$

#**https://dtube.video** - This just released video uploading platform is paired directly with the Steem Blockchain, and requires a steemit account to upload videos. You can watch videos without having steemit. It allows anyone who has steemit to upvote your posts and your posts will earn Steem just like they normally would earn Steem from the blog posts.


#**https://lbry.io** - AKA Library. For Videos/Blog posts/Pics. You earn a cryptocurrency here called LBC. That LBC can later be sold for USD or used to promote your content to reach a larger audience.

#**https://www.yours.org**  - For videos/Blog posts/Pics, similar to Patreon but with the ability to accept micro-payments(a penny or higher).

#**https://www.bitchute.com** - An unfortunate name, granted. But it is great for uploading videos to it and it becomes a torrent that others can stream or download. Ads are being worked on and will be implemented soon.



#**www.Minds.com** - A free speech alternative to Steemit that currently is rolling out ads. A blog post site utilizing hashtags with a trending section and much more. Can also enable a paywall similar to Patreon and Yours, on posts you specify.

#**Vid.me** - A video upload site that is largely non-censoring. Though some people may have had a bad experience with them, most seem to have no issues with censorship of their content.

#**GAB.ai** - Very similar to twitter, but without restriction of speech. GAB is ad-free.  Everybody is welcome on Gab. Their mission is to defend free speech and expression on the internet for all. 

Some others are commenting below some NSFW options.... I do remember seeing Hillary Chucked like a side of beef on pornhub rofl.... 


EDIT:

Some people have messaged asking what I prefer and what is Steemit.



I use Steemit for blog posts and hosting the picture/gifs. Dtube just came out and links in with your Steemit account, it allows you to now upload videos.

On Steemit and Dtube you actually earn money in the form of cryptocurrency called Steem. Which can be converted to any other cryptocurrency like Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum or you can sell the Steem for USD and withdraw to your bank account. Steemit is censorship free, in that all blog posts and comments are permanently stored on the Steem blockchain and cannot be muted and or deleted and or edited by anyone. Everything posted to steemit stays there and can be viewed by anyone at a later time.

Feel free to browse through some of my posts I made on Steemit and you can see how much money you can really make(using Reddit only makes Reddit money, unless you have ad blocker installed !!!!).

After a large pole up on 8/25 our movement down right now is highly expected.  Bitfinex should go under $4073.6 before movement upward can be resumed.  

There has only been 3 long pole warnings this year that have not resolved this way out of 59 long poles.  Thats a 95% likelyhood that we will go under $4073.6

I chose to post a Point and Figure because I think it best conveys what is going on in the charts right now.  We have horizontal resistance around 4455.3, but that doesn't mean we are in a bear market.  We will continue to consolidate with 50% retrace of all long poles before we are able to pass resistance.  That is why I predict &lt;4073.6 before a break out.

I have recently taken some profits on my cold storage to best redistribute my net worth across a diversified portfolio of assets, but I am not yet bearish.  The trader sentiment right now is very bearish, I have never heard so many people in ts.whalepool.io voice that they own no bitcoin (or are completely hedged against their cold storage), yet we don't seem to be able to move down.  There are more shorts open than longs on bitfinex, and have been for &gt;14 days.  Traders are betting against the long term trend at great risk.  Although our chart looks like a triple top, I recommend going through the history of bitcoin and finding any triple tops that do not break within a month.  Usually we don't have a big move down until we have a blow off top.  I believe most traders want to see us enter into a new, steeper channel, after breaking out of our 2 year channel.  But the channel that you are all looking at is untested, and if cryptocurrency is entering a mainstream media mania phase, no resistance lines can hold it back.  Tread lightly.

To put things under perspective: our minimum monthly wage at the moment is 97.531 Bolivares.

People are naive and stupid in general (thus buying every single useless tokens, without doing any research). I'm just saying that the best technology, without a proper business scheme and a market-introduction plan will never become mainstream. Bitcoin is a secure store of value, but smart contracts needs to be implemented in the real world economy, and if one thinks that can be carried out without cooperation with centralized governments and certain level of regulations, then the one is naive and stupid. 

I assume that everyone who invested long-term realize that Onchain and NEO will be cooperating with govs and companies. They were open about that and other features like digital certificates for clients. 

The simple reason why people so heavily believe in this project is the real-life whitepaper and devs who understand the potential of blockchain, and at the same time realize that compromise is the key for mass adoption. 

There is really no reason to fight over ICO regulations, as they are unavoidable in real economy. If you believe in smart contracts and Internet 3.0 as mass p2p network hold- you will become a millionaire if you are right. 
If you are anti-gov, anarcho-capitalist store your assets in Bitcoins or Monero and if you are right you will become a billionaire. 
I believe there is place for both, but technology, unlike the store of value, must be implemented in real life, thus regulations  do not necessarily mean the same thing as in BTC or Monero. Best Regards and chill. ",2017-08-30 04:05:34

#How to get very low transaction fees on the bitcoin/btc chain

1. View [the latest mined block](https://blockchain.info/home)

2. Scroll nearly all the way to the bottom.

3. Click through some transactions and note the cheap, cheap fees.

4. Set your transactions fee to the same, or thereabouts.

You will need a wallet where you can set your own fees. Electrum, Armory, Trezor etc.

[Here's one example for 11c tx fees, mined in 6 minutes](https://blockchain.info/tx/41e3182c12d0c8572ef12eb2d9c092d0e3cb7fe7c962855eaa96c0256c4eb638)

[Here's another example for 10c tx fees, mined in 2 minutes](https://blockchain.info/tx/272d9824d9a2727b13d9ed6d9566376dd4e12f032ddb4fb86036ae7ffe209931)

Obviously neither are mine.

Wallet algorithms keep entering high fees, *because* wallet algorithms keep entering high fees. Ad nauseum. They auto enter high fees to make sure your transaction is at or near the top. They keep auto creating higher and higher fees. This is the dumb problem. **The wallets are stuck** in a type of infinite, dumb loop. &lt;&lt; read this again.

Bitcoin is not broken. I've been sending *heaps* of 10c transactions the past week.

Now you know : )

Please test with some small amounts and confirm.

I guess I should add this works better when the damn hashrate is oscillating to the btc chain.

dmbwb9d,_chewtoy_,45,"The other day I poked my head back into the daily for the first time in awhile and, after a brief explanation of why I haven't been posting as much, pointed out a resistance line that had just broken spanning the drop from $4450 to around $4180. 

In and of itself, it wasn't an extraordinarily significant line to break. However, I also noted that, because it broke, a revisit of $4450 was likely within 24-48 hours. And since the ATH was at $4480 at the time, well, it was one of those ""insignificant"" resistance lines that could wind up being very significant, simply because of where it falls.

Still with me?

Since then, the market has been a little hesitant for lack of a better word. Breaking an ATH, moving up a paltry 4%, and then hovering right above resistance-turned-support is always a bit unsettling. But it's really nothing to be concerned about. I'd expect the market to get over its fears sometime later today or tomorrow. 

That said, if the market does drop back down below $4480, then I'd be concerned. 

Others have noted that Bollinger is tweeting about bitcoin again, and he's looking for confirmation of a ""three pushes to a high"" formation. I won't go into incredible detail on what that is exactly, because I honestly can't provide any insight on the formation that one can't get themselves from Google. 

Suffice it to say, however, that a failure to break upwards significantly within the next week or so points to the possibility that a reversal is in the works. The hallmark of the formation that he was referencing is three pushes to get (and stay) above the upper boundaries of the weekly BBands. So somewhere in the vicinity of $4500 at the moment. The third push just can't get enough momentum behind it to stay above the 1W, and the failure results in a trend reversal. 

That said, the last time Bollinger pointed out the possibility of the pattern completing was back in the $1,000 area. So it's important to note that just because it's forming doesn't mean it's going to complete. 

Right now, if you aren't already in a long from below $4480 I'd stay out of position. If the market starts pulling away from $4600, then I'd hop on board. 

A few folks are pointing to ~$4800 as possible resistance, but I just don't see it playing out that way myself. The market has spent a fair amount of time consolidating between $4000 and $4500, and if the market does start break upwards I think $4800 is too conservative a target. $5,000 as a target seems more likely, and honestly, I think the market could be going much higher than that.

The general public hasn't been focused on privacy. The portion of the public that cared about privacy was misled into believing Bitcoin provided it. Both of those mistaken perspectives have received sharp wakeup calls in the past 2 months, with the multiple arrests surrounding the takedown of AlphaBay. The arrests of the past 2 months are only the beginning. While some other coins are taking notice and are now scrambling to bolt on privacy features to their code, they're all late to the party.

The AlphaBay bust yielded up wallets with known quantities of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash *and an unknown amount of Monero*. Anyone operating on the darknet who cares about staying out of jail is taking note of this. The dark market penetration you've been wondering about is happening now; every new market that has sprung up in the wake of the AlphaBay takedown is using Monero.

It is of course *possible* for some new coin to come along that is also 100% focused on privacy, that does it comparably as well as Monero. But no existing transparent coin is going to succeed, not if they want to remain transparent on their main chain. As an analogy: you are in a brightly lit room, with all your money spread out on a table, and you want to conduct a trade in secret, so you find a corner of the room that you can put up a curtain around and screen out all of the light. Anyone can see you picking up money off the table, and can see that you've put it into the darkened corner. Anyone can see the next guy in the room going to that darkened corner and taking something away. It's literally security theater.

And I don't mean that as a negative either, that's just the nature of investments.  The difference here is being able to invest in a decentralized, openly traded ""stock"" of sorts without a controlled or permission-based market.  

This is the nature of this new ecosystem.  Literally anyone with a decent idea can then create a ""share"" or ""financial instrument"" that can be used to capitalize on that idea in the future.  The end value will be what that token can be used for.  

**Examples:**

• Siacoin intends to be useable to purchase decentralized, encrypted, and secure storage space on a global network (imagine torrents with no central servers of any kind). 

• Golem intends to use the tokens for purchasing dormant computing power by computers offered up to the network to make use of idle processors and open anyone to accessing a massive global super computer while only needing capital for the short time it is used and no infrastructure overhead.

• Steem intends to use their token as a built in platform to reward and tipping for social media and journalistic content.

• Ethereum intends to be a token for a broad and open system of smart contracts that can guarantee and arbitrate agreements free of bias and political manipulation.  Instead having software determine and preset the outcomes of disputes.

• Monero/Dash/PIVX/Darkcoin/Verge (many more of these too) and so on all trying to tackle the problem of transaction and market privacy with varying approaches.

The list obviously gets incredibly long very quickly and many are redundant in their purpose but believe in a separate method of implementation.  Like Stratis, Lisk and NEO all tackling the smart contract market in competition to Ethereum, but using different programming languages, scaling methods, masternode or staking systems, and development focuses.

Some of the coins have decent use cases, some are just a bunch of fluff and don't even have much of a network or development team behind them.  Similar to many websites in the late 90s and similar to a large number of startups and business ideas in any new industry.

Currency itself, however, is generally little more than an agreed upon standard that is valued by its network and the security/confidence of the rules in place to prevent that ledger from being cheated.  As money is only a tally system for exchanging favors/value that ensures no one can request the time, work, entertainment, or belongings of another person without voluntarily offering equal value in return.  The point of the token is to standardize that measurement. 

The short term value of many of these is the perceived promise of their projects.  The long term value is whether they become used, development keeps up with the market growth, and whether the ideas and methods turn out to be secure or have unseen/unfixable attack vectors or faults in their game theory.  Its a crazy space and it will be fascinating to see which ones pull out of the fire and become big players.  I think inevitably we will have thousands of coins/tokens for a wide range of purposes (as appears pretty obvious).  But only time will tell how the market will value each as things develop further and there is no guarantee that anything stays for the long haul.

**TL;DR**
Most coins are currently valued by how widely investors believe it will be used in the future and the promise of the network/system being developed.  Some already have large networks and viable use cases, some are hoping their ideas will work out with enough investment capital for marketing and development.  The tokens represent ""shares"" in that future promise.

*Edit: forgot to add, Bitcoin isn't valued because of its hashpower.  It is a factor in measuring security, but Bitcoin is valued as a permissionless means of ownership and monetary independence.  Something that literally has never been possible in the history of the world.  If you own keys to a bitcoin, there is no one in the world who can deny it.*",2017-08-31 03:38:25

That's patently false.

Bitcoins most fundamental value is censorship resistance. It could be both slow and less efficient and still be worth way more than it currently is.

This is naive thinking. Bitcoin does not *need* to ""compete"" with centralized systems that will always be more effective than a decentralized network. It would be beneficial for such a property to exist yes, but do not mislead others into your illogical thought process.

This is how so many people got brainwashed into thinking Bitcoin would always be a fast free network. By repeating such fantasies on social media over and over.

Bitcoin was meant to create sovereign money systems that prevent central monetary actions that dilute the value of your money. Censorship-resistant properties is the most valuable thing in that scenario, not a quick free payment system to buy socks on a forever ledger.",2017-08-31 02:56:37

Bitcoin Cash is demonstrating how this kind of resilience (spare block capacity) offers benefits when blocks happen to be produced slowly.

We had a big Bitcoin Cash dump yesterday and a bit BCore pump.

What actually happened was that Bitcoin Cash handled it like a beast.

They can't kill it even when they try their asses off.

The thing about BCore dying and its effects on the whole crypto world... almost everyone who owned Bitcoin at the fork owns Bitcoin Cash. It will have almost no impact to cryptos in general because only a few people will have lost anything.
