dbuzq9x,rmxz,29,"&gt; when he claimed bitcoin was created by the illuminati I stopped listening to him.

You're taking him too literally.

It's extremely likely bitcoin was designed by researchers that 

* had the capability of doing significant internal peer review with a deep understanding of math, and
* had the capability of keeping that quiet

It was just too well thought through to be a single guy's hobby project.   It's also likely that the initial people involved in bitcoins have *many* - possibly enough to control the market.

I believe he intends ""the illuminati"" and ""lizard people"" to be thought of as metaphors where he doesn't know the exact group involved.

There aren't too many groups that are that good at math, that good at software, and that good at keeping things quiet (which rules out most academic organizations) out there -- so you yourself can probably narrow it down to a few dozen candidates.     But clearly you can't narrow it down to one, because each of the candidate groups are good at keeping their involvement quiet.",2017-01-01 15:52:31

dbv6in3,JollyMort,18,"&gt;One well-known example is the maximalist vision of proof of work, where “the” correct blockchain, singular, is defined as the chain that miners have burned the largest amount of economic capital to create.

This is a common misconception.
The nodes alone can and do enforce all protocol rules except one: chronological block ordering.
That is the only purpose of PoW and miners.

You can put as much PoW behind an invalid block as you want - it will simply not be accepted by the network. The PoW is there to ensure that **sequence of transactions can't be changed** and nothing else. If the transaction is invalid in the first place, it won't be accepted regardless of when it happened. Someone taking majority PoW doesn't have the power to change the rules of the network. He only has the power to rearrange, add, or remove transactions to make the end result in his favour, but this re-arranged chain still must conform to the usual rules like sum(inputs)=sum(outputs), scheduled block reward, etc.

If there was no PoW, anyone could claim: ""our current blockchain is not in correct order, this transaction came before that transaction, that other one  - because I said so, so let's use this version"" and there would be no way to prove him correct or wrong without some form of centralized trust.

Nodes (exhanges, services, users) enforce the network rules, and miners support those rules by securing the blockchain against revisions. That's it. It's important that nodes and miners live in harmony, ie, that one version of rules attracts most miners. If it were not so, a network enforcing one set of rules without enough PoW to back it would be at mercy of miners mining on another network with a different set of rules. They could attack it at any time. Here, the game theory comes into play - why would they want to do it so much they're willing to give up their profits from the ""right"" network?

Edit:

&gt;Originally a mere in-protocol fork choice rule, this mechanism has in many cases been elevated to a sacred tenet ...

It's still a ""mere"" in-protocol fork choice rule. Without this, a cryptocurrency wouldn't work. Exactly this is what made Bitcoin succeed where previous attempts failed - the fact that you can't change history.

He gets it right in that one sentence (on a second look, maybe I misunderstood the first quote):

A ""in-protocol fork"" means chain re-arrangement while following the agreed rules as enforced by nodes - it's the same cryptocurrency, but a different version of recent history gets accepted as valid.

Out-of-protocol fork would mean changing the block validation rules - in effect creating another crytocurrency with shared past.",2017-01-01 22:27:53

dbu74hy,Essexal,16,"Here is my opinion.  I'm neither a savant or Warren Buffett.

The Euro experiment has failed.  Youth unemployment in Greece is over 50%.  Italy's banks have just received another bail out - NOTHING SINCE 2009 HAS CHANGED.  Deutsch Bank and their derivative balance sheet is ridiculous enough to make Gods cry.  There is absolutely no sane person that could look at that and think there isn't a problem about to explode.  

French elections come early in the year, 'populist' parties are on the rise. 

Merkel has ruined not only German through her immigration policies but the rest of Europe through its monetary policies. Talk of 10 years lost growth in Italy and Greece, why are they going to just sit there for those 10 and say 'this is fine'????   

We (the U.K.) have thankfully left the sinking ship, once we trigger article 50 and start getting some favourable trade deals the smart countries will start to ask themselves what the great dream and the one currency is doing for them. 

I would (and relatively am in trading terms) betting my left testicle on the Euro as a currency not being around in 10 years time. 


As for the ETF, if, and that's still a big if ((however Trumps cabinet seem both favourable to Bitcoin and are technologically savvy(most important thing here)) then institutional investors and old ladies who can't even internet can invest, risk free into Bitcoin. 

It will be the biggest moment in Bitcoins (short) history if it is approved, and because we are dealing with an asset that can't be printed at whim or constructed on demand, the higher the demand the higher the price.

More importantly if this were to happen the Morpheus quote comes applicable, and we will soon stop worrying about how many dollars a bitcoin is worth but how many bits our weekly shopping will cost. ",2017-01-01 02:31:17
dbuqyc9,gingeropolous,15,"simply put, yes.

If you add additional factors, kinda.

Monero, itself, is private and untraceable. Everything outside of monero is not. 

Which is the same with cash. Cash itself is private. However, the pawn shop that gave you cash for that guitar knows that you were the dude that sold the guitar for cash. 

The trust relationship is where it should be - with humans as participants of a transaction. Not the medium of exchange itself. 

If bitcoin was used, anyone can use the public database to see what happened.

With monero, a lot of external data is needed, and even then, you don't get far.

For instance, with the shapeshift example, shapeshift knows - due to their records - that a particular monero address has received a certain amount of monero. Thats the extent of the information gained. 

But if you go and publish that same address somewhere with your real identity, then someone could connect the two pieces of data.

dbvylw2,Capt_Roger_Murdock,288,"Here's my standard explanation for why I believe Bitcoin to be so revolutionary and important.

The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one *actually* wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that bitcoins are ""just data."" But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or needs). 

To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is *de*centralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the ""ledger"" of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the ""accounting entries"" in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient from a transactional perspective. 

Enter Bitcoin.

 It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized AND digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold, more transactionally efficient than ""modern"" digital banking, and enables greater financial privacy than cash. It could certainly still fail for one reason or another, but if it doesn't, it has the potential to be very, VERY disruptive.

dbwk1bb,vbuterin,104,"My general views are:

* Second-layer protocols are cool tech, but at the same time have their dangers. For example, **any** interactive protocol, including channels, Lightning, Raiden, Ethereum Alarm Clock, interactive verification, etc, has the property that a 51% miner cartel can not only prevent transactions or reverse recent transactions, but they can also steal. This is because they can simply play one side of the game, cheat, and censor any attempts to challenge them. Furthermore, even without miner collusion, there is an attack where a large economic actor can become a counterparty to a very large number of these games at the same time, and then try to cheat in all of them at once; there literally would not be enough block space for all counterparties to challenge in time. These issues are IMO all surmountable, and both the lightning.network team and researchers like Jeff Coleman have thought of various heuristics to mitigate the issues but it's quite wrong to claim that definitively overcoming these issues is easier than bumping the block size by even an entire order of magnitude. Ironically, some of the more effective mitigations (eg. ""stopping the clock"" on challenge periods if blocks are &gt;75% full) are easier to implement on ethereum than on bitcoin.
* With miner collusions, it's actually even more subtle. With on-chain transactions, all transactions are bound together in a kind of ""suicide pact"", so miners can't 51% attack one person without severely disrupting the experience for everyone else. With off-chain interactive mechanisms, yes you can censor selectively, so it's not clear there's as much of a ""red line"" discouraging miners from actually doing so.
* The notion that average users will in the long term continue to run full nodes is totally unrealistic; light nodes are perfectly fine. If you're willing to trust miners not to 51% attack to steal from channels, then you should be willing to trust miners to tell you what the state roots are.
* Hard forks are a much better form of governance than soft forks. Sure, soft forks provide ""stability"", but they do so by being coercive, as if you don't like a change you're forced to go along with it by default. IMO this is a fundamentally anti-market way of doing things. They also provide a large amount of decision-making power to miners, which is weird because miners are a security expenditure, not an end user (which is what the system should be trying to serve). In the real world, we have a term for highly coercive institutions where what are supposed to be security forces end up controlling decision-making power: military dictatorship.

That said, Bitcoin Unlimited has problems of its own; I can see how it makes sense as political strategy, as ""implement some funky mechanism that lets you claim the market is deciding"" is the only sensible schelling point aside from ""literally infinity"" and ""1MB forevah"", but if I was dictator I wouldn't go for it, I'd probably go for some flexcap scheme that creates incentives to target some particular stale rate.

That said, the whole second-layer debate applies primarily if bitcoin is looking to be a high-scale payment network; for digital gold, even $3 transaction fees are totally fine. And I think there actually is a case for bitcoin as a store of value alone; there's a clear portfolio theory argument that there exists an equilibrium where if cryptocurrencies end up growing with world GDP long term, and they are even slightly dis-correlated with other asset classic, then there's an incentive for everyone to hold at least some of them. This point is underestimated. That said, bitcoin maximalism is overestimated; the same portfolio theory argument also makes a case for hodling many cryptos - I ran a model last week and it even advocated holding litecoin (!!).",2017-01-02 23:52:21

1.  The is a problem with BTC - not enough transactions per second.  There can only be 7 and it should be 7-70,000.  There a number of ways to achieve this.  Make the blocks bigger is one option, but that will impact decentralization and give marginal gains.   Additional layers in the Bitcoin specification is another option.  SegWit and the Lightning network will achieve this, but it's not without technological hurdles of its own.

2. This difference of opinion on this technical choice is exacerbated by differing economic interests.  It's not for lack of leadership.  Bitcoin is decentralized, there is no leader.  Satoshi has been out of the picture for years and years.  Craig Wright is unable or unwilling to provide adequate proof of his connection to Satoshi.

3.  The lack of a leader is the one of the defining and distinguishing features of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is open-source which allows innovation to occur freely.  It's decentralized to prevent corruption of the chain.  
Who is in charge of Linux? The worlds most used operating system has no director or president or board.

4.  This rise (as with much of this years rise) is tightly correlated with the Chinese Yuan devaluing and related Chinese capital controls.  Add in some US election fears, India cash recall, Venezuelan hyperinflation, and you have a strong demand for Bitcoin.

Shorting: 


Imagine I borrow your Playstation 4 to play some Last Guardian when the price of a PS4 is $300, but instead of playing games, I immediately sell it on Craigslist for $300. A week later, Sony drops the price to $250. I then buy you a new PS4 for $250, replacing the one I owed you, and pocket $50.


That's shorting in a nutshell. You borrow a stock, commodity or asset, sell it, and agree to give it back at a later date, making money *if* the price goes down.

this is false, and there is proof today in cryptography.  standard cryptographic ciphers aren't secure through obscurity or complexity; that's a hard no in information security.  the ciphers are mathematically secure for a limited amount of time due to the inability for computers to timely reverse long-running computational operations and our system of rolling ciphers, private keys, and measuring risk are pretty good.

dbzri6j,vbuterin,37,"&gt; How to reach consensus in a distributed network is a very complex computer science problem: progress beyond proof-of-work has been scarce; shortcuts to forms of bilateral consensus would easily negate the distributed nature of a ledger. Lack of a reliable consensus algorithm ... are the most relevant challenges

Has this person not heard of any of the dozens of standard BFT algos that offer 1/3 fault tolerance, going up to 1/2 if you're willing to accept (imo unnecessarily feared in academia) synchronicity assumptions?

&gt; Instead of pondering why blockchain without bitcoin (or another native token) made no sense (and admitting that blockchain was just abused as a snake-oil marketing buzzword), many of the projects originally touted to ""bring blockchain to finance"" flippantly shifted to DLT.

I'm pretty sure that ""blockchain"" and ""DLT"", as used in real life in the ""permissioned"" space, are basically synonyms. Technically, the word blockchain emphasizes history whereas ledger emphasizes state, but those are just two sides of the same, err, coin.

&gt; Decentralized consensus seems so far very hard to reach without the economic incentives provided by a blockchain native digital asset like bitcoin.

If you're in a permissioned and regulated environment, the incentives are trivial: if you act maliciously, you risk losing your banking license. Don't see what's so complicated here.

&gt; All hail notarization

Yes, notarization is cool.

&gt; How can people possibly care more for the sub-par append-only sequential data structure known as blockchain instead?

It's not about some silly ""sequential data structure"" (as if future versions of blockchain tech will even look like that). It's about **stateful decentralized applications**. Remember how disruptive BitTorrent was? Well imagine that, but giving these networks **global persistent memory**.

&gt; This Hayekian scenario is to be loved, and indeed a lot has been learned by this fierce competition. Yet, I believe the only conclusion is that bitcoin has come out on top.

Everything from here is basically the usual Bitcoin Core partisan talking points; for refutation see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5llba3/do_any_of_yall_ethereumers_support_the_current/dbwk1bb/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5f55cf/is_multiple_implementation_a_good_practice/dahl7yn/), [here](https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179#.4hw86yejc), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWSxbELIJqM) and [here](https://blockchain.info/charts/bip-9-segwit).

In bitcoin, those sellers are primarily early adopters who own the vast majority of coins and miners.

Do you see like umm a massive conflict of interest here? The bitcoin market is supplied and owned by a tiny group of people. How exactly does that make the 19 billion market cap real? It doesn't.

Satoshi + Ver + Voorhees + Winklevoss own upwards of 22% of sellable bitcoin in existence. The annual bitcoin supply increases by something like 5%, that entire new supply is delivered by 1 or 2 mining pools.

It is not far fetched to say that less than 100 individuals control even 90% of all bitcoins in existence. If you look at Ethereum, 82% of coins are held by insiders. Bitcoin is no different.

Merchants won't take it (and those ""bitcoin debit cards"" don't count; the exchange is taking your bitcoin plus a fee and giving the merchant dollars, which they of course happily accept).  

It's slow (10 minute confirmation times).  

It doesn't scale (block size limitations are already a problem even though nobody's actually using bitcoin for anything except for illegal transactions and speculation).  

The markets are unregulated (which is a very bad thing; there's all kinds of ways an exchange can dick you over if there aren't any rules, as experience shows).  

It's ridiculously complicated to secure and you can lose everything through a fairly simple mistake or security lapse (just search for ""SFYL"").  

It's based on shitty economics (not understanding that small and predictable inflation is a good thing for an economy, and that deflation through having a currency increase in value over time, which is what they all expect, is terrible because it encourages hoarding).  

Its fan club is generally a bunch of stupid nerds who don't understand finance or economics and expect to get rich by buying some ""financial asset"" that produces absolutely nothing (at least shares of stock represent an ownership share in a company that actually creates something and produces earnings).  

Bitcoin trading is a zero-sum game:  The amount of money speculators make is exactly equivalent to the amounts others lose (again, there are no dividends because nothing of economic value is created).  All you're buying is the hope of selling your stake to someone else for more (actual) money, and the person that buys from you is buying the same thing.  How could such a thing be sustainable?  

Even its ideological appeal of being decentralized is wrong because an oligarchy of Chinese mining pools is swallowing up more and more of the mining market share (See what I mean about bitcoiners not understanding economics?

dc4vg3x,BitttBurger,35,"Read the first paragraph of the Satoshi Bitcoin white paper.  Core devs have literally said it doesn't matter what Satoshi said. I've seen them say it. They view his influence as historic and often ignorant.  

Satoshi calls it a Peer to Peer payment system.  Core devs currently feel it should be a store of value and not necessarily a currency or direct on-chain payment system.  As they view it as a store of value, or digital gold, they don't see much need to continue evolving or growing it's capacities.  The enhancing they are currently doing came only after literally years of uproar from the community.

Those who view it as a currency, or a peer to peer payment system, recognize that it desperately needs capacity increases. This matches what Satoshi himself said numerous times.  He mentioned scaling transactions to ""visa level capacity"" and yet core devs mock the concept anytime ""visa level transaction capacity"" is raised.  

For the most part, on the other sub, it's primarily developers/coders/programmers.  On this sub there are more business owners, entrepreneurs, and people who understand the real life needs of end users. 

Over there are coders.  Who often have absolutely zero education in business, nor finance, nor how to make a product succeed in a marketplace. And they have no concern about it either.  

If you've ever managed development projects, it's basically what would happen if you let the programmers do whatever the fuck they wanted, which means nothing gets done, project timeline slip ... by literally years, and the priority list gets all fucked up. 

Stuff that doesn't matter, gets pushed to the top. Things that are important to end-users and business owners to make the product succeed, get ignored. 

Way overcomplicated, complex development decisions to ""do things the cool way"" (codewise) are made rather than efficiency, and adherence to timelines so that the product doesn't just completely fail in the real world. 

There's a major disconnect between developers brains and non developer, real world lay people. No offense to the developers out there. But that's why there's usually project managers, product managers, and marketers controlling development projects.

Basically it's the worst possible way to run a project.

On this sub, you tend to have people who actually wanted to build a financial ecosystem with bitcoin. Those who understand the need for a technology to remain competitive in the marketplace. They know what bitcoin is lacking, and they push for enhancements.

So it's basically developers (who represent their own egos) versus business people (who represent end users in the real world). 

Developers who think bitcoin should just remain digital gold, versus business people who want bitcoin to be exactly what they read in plain black and white on the white paper written by Satoshi.  ",2017-01-08 08:18:08

dc4ala9,Merlin560,34,"Point and Figure Chart 

This is one of those situations where it takes a little more explanation of how this system works.

When I posted last, we had reached our recent high of $1175 on Coinbase.  As we all know, the next day we crashed.  That is reflected in the high column of Xs, followed by the drop down to the $880 range.  No surprise with that column.  That happened on 1/4.  As we all know, after hitting that high, we started falling.  But since we had hit a NEW high, before it fell, we count it as the top of the column of Xs.  EVEN THOUGH IT DROPPED that day.

1/5 showed the price reverse downward even more than the day before, breaking $880 down to $875.  This is when the full view of the reversal is seen.  This creates the opposite of a long pole warning.  It is called a Down Pole Warning or Short Pole warning.  This happens when you drop so low as to be four boxes (rows) further down than the Negative Breakdown point.  (And the break down point is when you fall further than the previous low column.  In our case, the breakdown point came when the price dipped below $930.

Today the price dropped from the low of the $880 box all the way down to 814.  It doesn’t matter if 814 was a fat finger trade or 1 singe transaction.  (The same holds true when the price spikes.)

Now as I look at the chart we are back up to $896  (9:53 EST).  But for the purposes of this chart it doesn’t matter.  Any reversal will show up tomorrow.

This system is not great for brutal swings the likes of which we have seen.  It is confusing to shift from one column to another, especially when what you are watching in real time is so different.  It is easy to draw a new column for tomorrow and start thinking we are on a real upswing.  That is dangerous.

For a Short Pole Warning, the process is similar to the long pole.  When it breaks upwards you should see a movement at least half the length of the drop.  So, based on the “rules” when it reversed up from $814, moving up three boxes, the price “should” move halfway up the down column.  That down column is 27 rows.  So, we should see a price move 13 rows up in price—counting from the bottom.  Switching rows and counting up would put our target for this reversal in the $930-40 range.

PnF charts are going to give you the big picture and a visual trading range.  The issue with Bitcoin is the “Crazy Ivan” changes in direction.  This last change should not have been a shock.  But the speed and ferocity of the moves will catch the best of us off guard.  Therefore, look to these charts like a 20,000 ft view.  You are going to be given “guideposts” for the trip.  But its not showing the potholes that could ruin your wheels.

Where do I think its going?  I think in the long run we are going to go up.  I think that because we haven’t broken the long term trend (the little ‘+’ marks.)  I put in little red ‘-‘ marks to show the closet point of support.  We never hit it in this turn around.  If we break THAT support, then the next support line is the “long term trend line.”

So, the chart tells me to pay attention to the firewall at $800.  And its telling me to get quite nervous at $700.

I think we will start to form a consolidation $850-$900 range for the next several days.  Of course, this does not take into consideration ANYTHING external having an impact.  My view is based solely on the chart.

&gt;**Multisig**: This was supposed to fix all security issues. Except no living being can figure out how to use it and the user experience is super shitty, so it was relegated to use by professionals who work at exchanges and know what they are doing. Just kidding, Bitfinex! No one even pretends that multisig adds any security any more.

-

&gt;**Sidechains**: This was quite the hot item when it was announced. So hot that it killed off altcoins. But the ""trustless reverse peg"" turned out to be a bunch of handwavy bullshit and never materialized. If you want to experiment with a trustless altcoin today, you cannot use sidechains, and that was the whole point of sidechains.

-

&gt;**Smart Contracts**: ""Money is only the first application,"" they used to say. But it turned out that it was also the last app. Smart contracts had to be developed by Ethereum, which took over what butters see as their own territory, namely, hype. Butters now end up constantly shitposting about ETH because they are bitter about their inability to claim this new area.

-

&gt;**Segwit SF**: The main point was to increase the blocksize. Ooops, no, it was to fix transaction malleability. Oops, no, it was to create a fee market to prepare us for the coming coin apocalypse in 2041, because butters can never be too prepared. Even the Chinese miners, who go along with just about anything, got pissed off at this shitshow, and now, it will not activate.

-

&gt;**Lightning Network**: This doesn't work unless Segwit is activated, so it's dead now. Without Segwit, I can steal cash out of the channel, so this dumb idea isn't going anywhere.

-

&gt;**Off-chain scaling**: No one knows what the big peer-to-peer credit network between incorrigible gamblers and casinos as well as addicts and their dealers looks like. But that doesn't stop the butters from claiming that they can compete with SWIFT with this non-existent network. Wanna send money to the west coast? I'll just send it to my dealer Big D, who has a credit relationship with a diseased whore who has a john, who knows a guy ... This is supposed to be the future.

-

&gt;**LN Routing**: Speaking of which, routing for the Lightning Network doesn't exist. The only topology that is efficient to route over is a single hub-and-spoke, with a bank at the center, and some deluded butters are lining up to actually make this happen, the same deluded people who oppose big blocks because mah-de-centralization. Also, routing leaks information, like how much credit you have with your dealer Big D, and how much of it you used this week.

-

&gt;**Confidential Transactions**: Confidential what? Even the IRS knows how to trace Bitcoin transactions now, and ZCash completely cut into Bitcoin's main selling point. Anyone remember how they used to say ""Bitcoin is anonymous?"" Then it was ""Bitcoin is pseudonymous?"" Well, what is it after your exchange turns over all your info to the Feds?

-

&gt;**Teechan**: This was announced with a whitepaper but without a prototype, which is an improvement over the usual butter way of announcing bullshit on an irc/slack channel, but in any case, my bet is that these guys don't have any code. In the fine tradition of Craig Wright, when it comes time to unveil the code ""in a few weeks,"" there'll be a huge no show and following public embarrassment.

There used to be a key that allowed only *messages* to be sent to users of Bitcoin Core for the purpose of alerting them of critical updates and so forth, and Gavin was one of several people with this key, but this feature was removed. It does not exist in the most recent versions of Bitcoin Core, and it never allowed any sort of control over the Bitcoin currency. Full node software such as Bitcoin Core will *never under any circumstances* accept an invalid block or transaction, even if every other person in the world signs off on it; this absolute absence of trust is a cornerstone of Bitcoin. Satoshi said:

&gt; The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
&gt;
&gt; A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

You'll either get a pink slip or an undercover postal inspector at your door ready to arrest you after you sign off on the package. 

Yes, currently this is the safest way to purchase drugs, real drugs that won't cause you extreme negative side effects or just be outright fake. There's a certain level of ""checks and balance"" in place due to the review systems in place on the good markets. 

As of right now all of Europe, with Germany leading the charge, is cracking down on the dark web hardcore after a gun wielding lunatic went on a rampage with a weapon allegedly purchased from the dark web. 

Where you will have a 99% chance of being apprehended on the dark web, regardless of security measures taken, is if you so decide to purchase a weapon. 

Purchases of drugs, sent to another address, in quantities of one ounce or less, are not risky and have a 99% chance of success domestic, and about a 90% chance international if done correctly. 


There are plenty of in depth and informative guides to the dark web online that will teach you to even remotely access it off your phone off a public wifi network somewhere random... 

Don't do this with the computer you love and cherish. 
Don't download Tor without connecting to a proxy first. 
Don't go buy bitcoin with a credit card and spend it on these dark web markets. There's a cash alternative to this called LOCALBTC. Find a dealer near you, pay cash for your coin, tumble the coin and then, and only then would I suggest spending it. 

The point here isn't to evade law enforcement. 

The NSA have quantum computers. They laugh at TOR encryption.

The NSA can destroy anything you've seen in terms of encryption in a matter of seconds. 
This is a branch of government with unlimited resources, in the most powerful country on the planet.
These are the guys who are actively monitoring terrorist communications. 

They know who you are. They know what you are doing. 

The only measurements you can take to protect yourself only goes to the extent of making their job more difficult and costly and time consuming. 

This makes you a lesser priority target, then say the major dealer who doesn't use any encryption. 

You, being a small time user, using high levels of encryption and data protection, are going to cause the NSA major budget/time efficiency issues and they will not bother targeting you. 

Customs will target you for anything they find. 

I advise doing heavy heavy research on a public wifi network somewhere on this before attempting to do it.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mowfl/the_forbidden_truth_nodes_can_loosen_their/

In other words:

Only Core/Blockstream's shitty code has a ""blocksize limit"". 

But **Bitcoin itself doesn't actually have a blocksize limit**. 

Bitcoin _has_ been suffering under a recently-added, _temporary_ blocksize limit - and it will also eventually be liberated from it again. 

Note that *all* devs teams recognize this - including the corrupt, censored corporate-funded Core/Blockstream dev-team with their _centrally-controlled_ blocksize limit and weird discounts in their unpopular SegWit-as-a-spaghetti-code-softfork ""offering"" - and other better dev teams such as Classic and Unlimited with their _market-controlled_ blocksize limit

This is because Satoshi designed Bitcoin as a consensus-forming machine - and once the ""longest chain"" or ""chain with the greatest amount of Proof-of-Work"" has a glorious block 1.1 MB at its ""tip"" - that very chain is now the ""valid"" chain (since the ""valid"" chain in Bitcoin actually is a derived concept - based on the more primitive concept of the ""chain having the most proof-of-work"").

So... Bitcoin ""has"" a blocksize limit - until we all decide that it ""doesn't"".

They were kept until something like 3am in a conference room until they agreed on their own to work on some hardfork designs if miners the participating miners didn't run classic.  **Within a week F2Pool began signaling classic, breaking their agreement, and yet the couple developers there still did what they said they would do and posted a design
Dec 19 01:50:31 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;       when they said they would**.  Since then the shill army on rbtc has constantly repeated the lie that ""bitcoin core promised to hard fork""  which is absurd.  A couple people who aren't even among the most involved, said clearly they'd work on their own time on a proposal, which they did. They had no power or authority to obligate Bitcoin Core to anything, nor does Bitcoin Core have any power or authority t
Dec 19 01:50:37 &lt;gmaxwell&gt;      o promise a hardfork. What they did say they would do, they did-- even though the miners breached their side of the agreement.

Addressing your last paragraph:

&gt; [Most] miners aren’t idiots, they will increasingly derive income via fees and keeping blocks at an arbitrarily small size to help their fee-siphoning competition just doesn’t make good business sense. While most miners could assume good faith at the time of the HK agreement, they now require promises to be made in the form of shipped code.

dc6i0u0,happyscrappy,21,"Typical hopeful bitcoiner bullshit. Does the writer even understand the difficulty of decentralizing trading for any item which doesn't originate on the blockchain itself?

A decentralized ledger works for bitcoin because anyone with a full copy of all the transactions can verify if a new transaction is valid. So anyone can extend the chain by adding valid transactions.

But this only works because bitcoins originate on the chain. There are two criteria for a transaction being valid:

1. It is signed by the private key associated with the source address (account).
2. The source account had sufficient bitcoins in it to send that many out and not go below zero.

Anyone can verify any of these things and thus determine that a potential transaction is valid. So when extending the chain you just put on only the valid ones and not the invalid ones.

The problem for nearly anything else in this world is that the rules for validity cannot be codified completely within the chain. If I want to sell a stock how do you know I'm allowed to sell it? Are you sure I have it? Are you sure I'm not under legal restriction to not sell it?

With this unsolved it is unclear how you can use a blockchain to create canonical transactions for most things you think you would want to use one for.

And this is before you get into the issue of why would anyone want to keep a full copy of every transaction (and thus be able to extend the chain) if there is nothing in it for them. With bitcoin you are rewarded for extending the chain. If a chain has no rewards who would extend it? You'll have to give out rewards (and likely not just make them out of thin air like bitcoin does) at which point why even bother making it distributed, just have a group of professionals (i.e. paid to do it) who add to the ledger?",2017-01-09 10:34:26

Presumably, you're in the U.S. (you mention W2s). It sounds like you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how capital gains work. You didn't pay taxes on Bitcoin last year because buying Bitcoin is not a taxable event (at least in regards to the Bitcoin). However, selling it is. If you sell at a profit, you're subject to short- or long-term capital gains tax, which varies depending on how long you held on to it (more or less than a year) and your marginal tax bracket. If you sell at a loss, you're allowed to deduct up to $3,000 a year of those losses on your taxes, and these losses are able to be carried forward.

In light of this, we can reexamine your statements:

&gt; This year I pay a shit ton because I sold a lot.

This year you pay a shit ton because you sold a lot at a profit.

&gt; If my Gain/Loss is super negative one year, I pay 0 taxes.

If your Gain/Loss is super negative one year (from selling), you deduct up to $3,000 in losses on your taxes for that year, and are able to carry the rest of the balance forward (to deduct up to $3,000 of the remainder the next year, and so on).

&gt; Why don't these years cancel each other out?

They would, or will, if you had realized a loss (by selling) one year and then realized a profit (by selling) the next year. Since you only sold in 2016 (presumably at a profit), you owe taxes on that profit.

&gt; If I had just bought and sold on the same year I would not owe taxes.

You would realize either a short-term profit or a short-term loss. You would either pay taxes on the profit, or deduct (a portion of) your loss.

&gt; Shouldn't my 2016 taxes take into account all the buy's I made in 2015?

They do, to the extent that your buys determine your cost basis, and whether your gains or losses are long-term or short-term.

&gt; Did I make a mistake by not putting in a big buy order on 12/30/2016 to make up for all the selling I did in 2016? I could have just put in a sell order 01/01/2017 to delay the tax (in case value of bitcoin declines 2017).

No, because buying anything does not realize profits or loss, relative to what you bought. This makes sense intuitively, I hope. Note that depending on what you buy it with, you may have realized a profit or loss on what you bought it with. USD doesn't count, from what I understand, but property in general does. For example, if you bought Bitcoin with gold bars or a classic car that has appreciated in value since you got it, you would realize a profit (and hence have to pay capital gains) on the gold bars or the car, but not the Bitcoin.

The only ""unfair"" part, really, is that taxes on profits are unlimited, whereas deductions from losses are capped at $3,000 a year. (Though it works out in the end since most people can eventually deduct all of their losses over multiple years.) Blame Uncle Sam.

dc8pgqr,g2n,15049,"Hello Julian Assange,

In recent months, there has been some concern to your well-being following the events of the October 17th blackout. Would you please reply with a signed message that includes the contents below?

1) State that you are alive and well, and in no serious harm.

2) The current date and time.

3) Something unique that happened in the news yesterday, January 9th, 2017.

4) This nonce value: 8059e91804efbe266c8e324b52de605f829eca993d4c7020bc8a34db337fabd5

I ask that all Redditors take screenshots and SHA256 sums of this post and Julian's reply, in the perhaps likely event that either of these posts are modified by Reddit admins.

Edit: Julian has officially skipped my question, claiming along the lines that ""the scores are changing too fast"". However, this post has remained at the top of this AMA throughout the entire duration. If no signature is created by the end of this AMA, it will be my opinion that Wikileaks is compromised.

---
Edit 2: Julian is answering a different question (not mine) regarding proof of life. He claims that ""setting a precedent is better proof of life than a digital signature"" and that it's ""quite hard to protect keys"". I am starting to suspect that Julian is no longer in control of the Wikileaks private key. Note that he did not provide a signed message.

---
Edit 3: Julian read off a recent hash of the bitcoin blockchain: https://blockchain.info/block/00000000000000000178374f687728789caa92ecb49b4d850dfc173a7c0351e6

It is likely that Julian is alive. However, failing to digitally sign a message with the Wikileaks private key is of great concern. It is possible that Julian is no longer in control of Wikileaks, provided that he cannot sign a message with the private key.

&gt;The State’s complaint alleges that Hunczak created at least four bitcoin “wallet” addresses where he deposited bitcoins mined via the E-Sports botnet. Hunczak allegedly then sold the mined bitcoins, converting them into U.S. dollars and ultimately depositing them into a personal bank account. According to the State’s complaint, **Thunberg supervised Hunczak’s activities, provided Hunczak with input, and authorized Hunczak to use company time to develop, create and test the E-Sports bitcoin mining code.** E-Sports apparently terminated use of the bitcoin mining code in May 2013 after an E-Sports subscriber discovered it.

&gt;**The complaint filed today charges E-Sports, Thunberg and Hunczak with violating New Jersey’s Consumer Fraud Act and the State’s Computer Related Offenses Act.**

Emphasis added. Note how the attorney general was directly implicating the developer (Sean ""JaguaR"" Hunczak), Thunberg (lpkane), and ESEA itself. They didn't leave ESEA to punish JaguaR separately.

Edit, so this is the core of the contract:

&gt;provide to GD the identity of the hacker, the evidence linking the

&gt;employed in the security breach.

Did you provide the identify of the alleged hacker?
Did you provide evidence that links the hacker to the security breach?
Did you provide the details on the attack vector(s)?

~~If yes to all, then I would say you held up your end of the bargain. I would say under these circumstances it would have been assumed that just doing that alone would not be enough since they want to see the hacker go to prison. The evidence has to clearly show that the hacker is responsible for the theft. There is nothing in the contract about the evidence must lead to the arrest and conviction of the alleged hacker. This is a poorly written contract. Leave it up to Adam Back to write some garbage.~~ 

I would say at this point if they aren't living up to their end of the bargain, to release maybe some of the evidence, and also release the full evidence to the FBI. You should continue to write about this in full detail, maybe make a Medium account just for this. You have to be clear and upfront about everything. I think it's pretty shitty on BitFinex's part and Adam Back to be messing around like this on such a serious fucking issue.

dc80dac,USOutpost31,36,"Here are the indications that something is going on:  

Calls his business 'biotech' yet clearly is not biotech.  Biotech is about as esoteric as it gets.  It's the same as Computer Tech in 1976 right now.  Clearly OP is not in Biotech, but calls it Biotech for some reason.  Is it nefarious?  Probably not.  If you run a MJ farm you can call it Biotech.  Technically, this is correct.  

Now, does the above mean anything?  No.  But neither does OP's claim of Biotech.  Selling seeds ain't Biotech as he means us to understand it.  Disingenuous off the bat.  

Second, I deal BTC with Chase, BofA, Comerica, Huntington, and Flagstar.  Now, I don't wire to Exchanges from all those, but I personally walk in and make deposits buying BTC from all of those, some multiple times.  The banks don't like it, but they do it.  All have varying degrees of regulation when depositing into someone else's account, usually a business account is required and then some form of ID or credential from the Depositor is required.  

*Anyone who deals BTC knows this*.  

Third, OP claims he had problems at one bank, then repeated the situation and ran into problems at the next bank.  He ain't going to be in business long, he is into something illegal, or he is making up a story for some reason, I am guessing right now as a shill for some BTC-based app which will exchange BTC (for a small fee) above and beyond what you can already do.  

Fourth, OP claims to be 'running a mining operation in the Southern CA Desert.'  Hmmm.... nahhhhhh.  Nope.  He doesn't.  You run a mining operation in one of a very few locations in the US, and you are currently opening shop in China.  *Everyone who has been in BTC for a while knows this*.  

Fifth, everything you said about banks and fucking around stands.  *Everyone who has had a business account at a commercial, retail, or CU bank knows what you said is true.*  

Sixth, Chase is the bank which takes pains to take every State's EBT deposits, welfare deposits, VA deposits, SSI deposits, because they are mass-scraping pennies out of retail banking right now.  Chase is *the* generic go-to bank for small-time retail transactions because that's their business model, right now, and it hasn't changed.  I just dealt with Chase a few days ago and they are the same Chase they were in 2009 when they went basement retail.  Chase will send money to the Zetas right now if they can get a 0.0001% fee off it.

Epic shitpost by OP but interesting to talk about nonetheless.  

Kid shitpost for kids, and you nailed it.  

Or, OP is a Bitcoin-mining-in-Southern-California Tycoon with special ties to the PG&amp;E for special rates on Electrons who is also a nascent Biotech Billionaire with VC from 23andme and Elon Brin, the famous Moon Millionaire who is funding a Bitcoin-Biotech Incubator from the Mountains of Madness.

dc8fgde,Meh5678,36,"I work at a mid size regional bank in the AML Department, often dealing with accounts like yours. Each Bank is going to have a different risk tolerance for Bitcoin activity. Way above my pay grade, but for instance our current policy is we do not bank any Bitcoin ATM or other businesses primarily dealing with Bitcoin. That could obviously change in the future. 

In your situation, I assume you're doing all this activity in one personal checking account. It's quite possible a bank may be wiling to let this activity take place in a ""business"" account where you create an LLC for your 'daytrading of Bitcoin', if they were comfortable with those types of businesses (our Bank is not one of them and we'd shut you down for that activity every time, no questions asked).

 You can be mad about it, call it unfair, but the fact remains banks have a shit ton of regulations to comply with and when something appears remotely risky with little upside they are never going to keep an account open. Additionally banks have the right to determine whether a customer is just someone they don't want to do business with (you in this case) and I can almost guarantee they also wrote at least 1, if not more SARs on you so for your sake I hope you're story is the truth.

Also the threshold (rules for alerts to be created) is going to be massively different for a business account than a personal account. Any personal account with the volume of transactions noted ITT will probably at least ""alert"" according to most AML software whereas a business account at most banks (except ours) would probably slide through. 


Tons of accounts alert all the time that are not deemed suspicious. But it's really just each bank's own risk tolerance for a customer's activity, and as always the answer is ""It Depends,"" on many, many different factors from account type, customer profile and history, other activity in the account including if the account has nothing but the Bitcoin activity or do you have regular living expenses and other deposits as well that are a significant percentage of the account's activity.

Secondly, I bank with a local credit union, have a good amount of money in there with them, and any ""investment accounts"" through them that I have are diversified as well.  Its just common sense.  You don't put all of your money into one thing, and you don't keep all your eggs in one basket either.

Thirdly I really wonder what you're doing, because I move money around on a fairly regular basis to keep stuff diversified, adding to my investments as I go throughout the year or as needed, etc.

My money is you are doing things to try to circumvent tax reporting, like keeping transfers right under the limit, etc, to try to avoid IRS intervention.  That kind of stuff is the kind of stuff banks don't like, and if you do enough of it, they will do what they are doing to you, after warning you a few times about it.

I think there is a lot more to this story than you're telling, and I don't blame you for not telling it completely on here, but there has to be more to it.

I buy bitcoin on a regular basis when the price is at a level I feel makes it a good investment, and I've never had an issue.

I also own half of a small business and we periodically make large purchases/deposits and similar.  Same bank, never a problem.

Something else is going on here, has to be.  I never have problems because I don't try to hide anything, I keep receipts, and in the case of BTC, when I buy it, I move it to paper wallets and keep them as proof that I'm still ""holding"" the money.  If I sell, I keep paperwork on it, and I pay taxes on it.  Banks report everything, and thus you should have a paper trail on any investment-including BTC, to cover yourself.  And when you owe penance because you made money, you PAY IT, you don't try to get fancy, cute, or follow some advice online to try to avoid the tax man.  Unless, of course, you want them to fine you into oblivion.  They do, after all, know what you do make, even if you try to be slick and hide some of it....

I got the heck out of Wells as soon as my investments there matured, btw.  I wouldn't touch BOA with a 10 foot pole either.  Sounds like I may need to reconsider some of the stuff I have in Chase.

dc8f85i,nullc,27,"&gt; pretty sure he said something over 90% of his worth is in BTC

I'm pretty sure he didn't, and I'd love a link that shows otherwise. But even if he did:  He also said that MTgox was solvent and that it's problems were due exclusively to the traditional banking system; he said this as an _investor_ in the company while physically present in their office in a video appeal to encourage people to stop pulling their funds out.  He doesn't exactly have a good track record for honest behavior.

Even if it were somehow true, percent of total matters a lot more than absolute amounts. Lets imagine that I own 20% of FooCoin (e.g. like the zerocash not-quote-premine)  which currently has a market cap of 1 million, and lets say I own 1% of Bitcoin, with a market cap of 16 billion.   If, through my actions I was able to cause FooCoin to have a market cap of 1 billion (1/16th bitcoin but as a side effect pushed Bitcoin to _nothing_  I would make a 40 million dollar profit from the move even though at the start 99% the value was Bitcoin.

I didn't make my claim that he was trying to split the network based on speculation, FWIW. I know it to be true.

dc8tnwt,NoWittyUsernamesLeft,211,"I sort of transcribed his answer for anybody who wasn't watching but wondered what he said. Don't take this as truth, it was just me typing as he spoke and I definitely missed quite a bit. If it sounds disjointed and a little wishy-washy, that's likely me trying to catch up to his text. He didn't seem totally unable to stay on topic.

&gt;""Personally, we were very pleased there was such concern. We expected all these attacks, if you looked at our public statements in the lead-up to the internet cutoff and that difficult diplomatic situation, we are going to need people to defend us, an army to get through this. And then the concern for how I was doing and why I wasn't seen etc. was we were interested in something quite different, so anything we did that claimed to be some proof of life would be to set the precedent on what a reduction--what mechanism could be used to redue concern.    

&gt; The calls for example that I issue a PGP signed message is fine if you can verify it is ME using it, but the PGP doesn't tell who issued it at all. Let's look at what kind of precedent we would be setting. We would be setting a precedent that says if there is a concern one of our staff has been kidnapped, that concern can be alleviated simply with a message of text which is coupled to a particular cryptographi key. If WikiLeaks is under serious threat it is possible it may lose control of its keys.     

&gt; The reality is it is quite hard to protect keys from that kind of interference. The way we manage the keys is not to sign messages, but even if it was to be used it would be used to set a precedent that would be very dangerous in the future. You could take control of infrastructure/person to produce some signed message We are much more interested in proving our people are not under duress through live video, because then you have a few seconds, because even if you are under duress you can slip in code words (I'm not by the way) Yes I am alive, no I am not under duress.""   

&gt; When the concern came out, a black PR campaign infested the concern and tried to make it something else. What happened? Fabricated messages claiming to be our staff were posted on 4chan, a reddit user claiming to be our staff. Completely fabricated. They called for people ot to trust the leaks, to give funds. It is obvious who benefits the PR campaign, it should be obvious in hindsight to those trying to support me, that those type of messages were intended to undermine WikiLeaks &amp; my support. so if this sort of thing happens in the future think to yourselves ""is what is claimed undermining the ability for WikiLeaks to operate? The ability for it to get new info, and to support itself?"" If the answer is yes you should be extremely skeptical about what the claim is.

EDIT: AND MORE

&gt; With claims of video and audio editing, people are calling for more proof. I have to say it is a little bit silly, not in relation to us being under pressure, we are under pressure, we are very good at resisting. But regarding whether I am alive/kidnapped, it is very silly. If you look at John (somebody), long time friend of mine, investigative reporter, if you think about the number of people who would have to conspire and the work that would have to be done.. it's too many. There is a social proof, you have to look at the costs and understand the costs of pulling all of those people, and keep a lid on this. As well as the technology that does not currently exist. For what benefit? That's an interesting question.

&gt; Real-time proof of life, intellectually the most interesting one is to take the most recent block in a bitcoin block chain. Give the number, at least 8 digits or something of the hash, and maybe sign the hash out in sign language. It is intellectually entertaining. Let's see if I can get a recent hash.

(He read out the block and the hashes. I missed them, and my audio cut out for most of them. Sorry guys!)

&gt; &gt; If I disappear or somebody else disappears, the answer to whether we are okay should be given by 2 things in the future. #1 by friends, lawyers, people who run my defense campaign, the carriage foundation and associates, Jennifer Ronaldson, linda Taylor, and the ability to do live, interactive video where somebody (who could theoretically be under duress) can interject in the stream quickly to say something. or could give a variety of messages in a way that might not seem to make sense at first, but the last one gives the key to decrypting them.

dc9almp,Bitcoin-FTW,72,"Ya'll mo'chuckas is insane. This right here is literally the dream price action for long term bulls. I understand that many of you are trying to trade shorter timeframes, so you have every reason to be worrying about what $20 move the price will make next, but for the long term, it's accumulation time. Stock up with confidence at anything near this level. Don't do it on high enough margin that a drop to even $650 could take you out, because there is a chance, however tiny, that an ultimate capitulation move like that could be what slingshots is to a new ATH.

First off, let's talk about what the last bull run accomplished. We passed the ATH in CNY by 10%. We came within 1% of the ATH in USD. Now considering that the CNY has lost significant value since the last ATH and USD has gained value, I personally think the accomplishment is a much bigger deal in USD terms. However, it's certainly worth noting that any Chinese person who stored wealth in bitcoin instead of CNY, even if they bought at 8000cny in 2013, benefitted from doing so. That's gonna be a big talking point for Chinese looking to divest from CNY. Coming within 1% of the USD ATH though is a bigger deal though because it shows that the previous ATH is not only well within reach at this point, but we got there pretty damn fast. No matter what people attribute the 2013 peak to, we have now shown that in 2017, that price is back on the radar and getting there this time has looked 100x as organic and fundamentally justified. Takeaway: passing the previous ATH is only a matter of when and not if at this point.

Second, take a look at the charts. Open the weekly Bitfinex chart on log scale. Draw a line from the $504 peak to the $789 peak. See how it touches our $1166 peak perfectly? That's a good thing for many reasons. For one, that line and the channel we are in is logarithmic. That's awesome. It should also give you a fair bit of confidence on what is going to happen over the next couple months. Just look at the price action after $504 and after $789. A ""crash"" to just above the previous high, a strong bounce, and some consolidation until we end up rubbing up against the lower trend line again. So far that is exactly what has happened. I see no reason to trade against this pattern until the pattern is invalidated. The pattern would be invalidated by a drop below $780. Otherwise, if you expect the pattern to play out a third time, it's time to accumulate. I think there will be plenty of chop all over the range of $800-$1050 over the next two months or so. In fact, I think it's quite likely we see slowly move up to $1050 or so before getting another test of our lower trendline. That's what happened both the last two times. I mean could you ask for a more perfect set up for an explosive 2017 bubble than 3 repeating breakout and correction patterns that ultimately end right around the ATH?

Third, we are consolidating at freaking $900. Absurd. Absolutely insane awesome, absurdly bullish. I could try to talk more technically about why this is so awesome, but if you've been in bitcoin more than 2 years, you sure already know how awesome that really is. 

But seriously, keep the worries coming. It gives me confidence to keep buying. It's completely rational to be worried, but if the only reason you are worried is the 100% expected and predicted drop that just happened about a week ago, then you are off your rocker. We just got gifted the ultimate trading opportunity with maximum reward and minimal risk. Two months or so of consolidation with plenty of volatility that I believe will ultimately stabilize out and  become the start of the biggest bitcoin price move we have seen since 2013.

As to Assange. Yeah two women accused him of refusing to use a condom then having consensual sex with them. Something that is illegal in Sweden. 

Yeah I'll believe anything Assange says once he stops running from what should be a minor situation. As to his fear that he'll be extradited to America if he goes to Sweden.

dc8zjph,ThomasZander,34,"Over the last year we have seen quite a lot of people that get worried about the UTXO growth. Lets find out why.

For those catching up; the UTXO is the Unspent Transaction Ouput database. The essential database that is needed to find out if a new incoming transaction is actually spending money that exists.

The growth is explained well in [this blog](http://gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh) from Gavin Andresen, the blog is already older, so the growth has continued.

There are some reasons why people claim this is an issue. Lets address each of them in turn.

1. *The UTXO needs to be in memory completely. It will grow faster than internal memory can.*  
    **Answer**: The implementation in all Bitcoin full nodes is that the entire database is stored on disk. With a smart memory-cache to speed up lookups. The memory-cache is configurable and the default is 300MB. (its the dbcache config option) The entire database is significantly larger than 300MB, as the above blog states.  

    The claim that it has to be in memory is weird because none of the full node implementations actually do that. Sure, miners can adjust their settings to allow a bigger cache, and be different from everyone else. But this doesn't mean the UTXO should stop growing...
    

2. *Bigger blocks make the UTXO grow faster!*  
    **Answer**: The UTXO is a database of where money is stored. With more people using and holding Bitcoin, this will grow. The UTXO will not grow based on more transactions, the UTXO will grow because we get more customers. Which can only be done when we have bigger blocks.  

    So the argument isn't directly false, it is misleading. It is missing the fact that UTXO growth is based on more people using Bitcoin. Maybe the people making this accusation are aware that saying they do not want more customers will make them look stupid.

3. *UTXO on disk will make miners lose money because of slow block validation.*  
    **Answer**: This may have been true in the past, but is no longer true since we introduced xthin blocks. This technology allows any node to communicate a new block with only the header and some meta-data. The receiving node will then use the transactions that are in his memory pool to reconstruct the block.  
    The direct result of this is that when a new block is mined miners will not validate the vast majority of transactions again because the transactions in their mempool were already validated. This means that there is no bottleneck any more for miners using xthin (available in BU and Classic).


Bottom line is; its a database. MySql/PostgreSQL/MongoDB etc. have had decades to perfect database technology. Being scared of a database growing on todays hardware is unfounded and not a very intelligent thing to say.",2017-01-11 02:45:17

However, it seems that very few people are interested in using BTC to move money out of the country.

[Here is an article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bitcoin-idUSKBN14T190) about one of the exachge exucitives stating something similar. If this is true, then the current meetings with exchanges (which the exchanges executives can now publicly discuss) should bring about some light regulation, which can be healthy for Bitcoin.

dcb5wp1,murderhomelesspeople,73,"I would like to say the main reason I tumble is for privacy. I don't like the idea of my coins being followed through a public block chain. By eliminating the trail I eliminate unnecessary evidence floating around. 

&gt;Anyone who is only worried about an exchange user account being closed (An intermediary wallet like the one on tails will prevent this. There is no way of knowing who owns a wallet like that. There are post here where people had their accounts banned because they sent it to a tumbler. The solution from the advocates, ""use an intermediary wallet!"")

You really need to start getting your facts straight. Your claim of intermediary wallets is completely unverified and is a terrible recommendation, the worst I've ever seen a mod give. The amount of posts for people being banned by sending to a tumbler is minuscule and becomes irrelevant when compared to the the amount of people who've been banned from sending it directly to DNMs and intermediaries. Sending it from a exchange tied to your name means you absolutely need to clean your coins some how. 

&gt;In this post https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs/comments/5muyvd/bitcoined_ypu_mined_yourself/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit, a guy asked if his coins needed to be tumbled even though he mined them himself 5 years ago. Some user tells him yes. But when asked why, he had no idea. ""peace of mind"" was his only reason. He even argued with me and afterwards deleted his account. If a mechanic tells you he can fix your car, he should at least be able to tell you what's wrong with it.

&gt;Here is another example of a person with anonymous coins not knowing why he should tumble. https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs/comments/5na3mt/safety_first/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit. His reason was because ""somebody told him"". Every social engineer knows that **if you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth. I believe this is exactly what has happened in this community.**

You picked some random idiots in the noobs sub to make a point? What in the lords name does this prove about anything.

&gt;Here is a post that had a very tricky title. https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5n1hpu/tips_for_maximizing_safety/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit. It seemed to be about security and OpSec tips, but quickly turned into an advertisement for GramsHelix with a quick edit and a few comments from the OP.

Really stretching. That guy is retarded look at his post history.

&gt;Someone made a post the other day and summoned me to it wishing to discuss this very topic. I joined in and summoned The moderatores and Operators of GramsHelix to the discussion. I watched as that post was hit with a shilly barage of down votes. I think it had something to do with my initial comment. https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5n2llv/on_the_usefulness_of_tumbling/ I didn't get a response from the main advocates of tumbling until a little while ago, when the post was all but forgotten and hardly seen.

You got down votes because you made wild and ridiculous claims about grams. While at the same time grouping it into the same place as a known scam subreddit which highlighted your lack of knowledge on the subject. A subject you claimed to be looking into by comparing the admins but failed to realize that the usernames were different making your claims ridiculous. No shills required to down vote this.

&gt;Money laundering is a high priority to many three letter groups (even more sought after than drug dealing)

Yeah and so is tor and all our encryption stuff. Same stuff is used by terrorists, pedophiles, weapons/human traffickers and government spies. All this stuff is top priority for every government intelligence agency across the world.

&gt;They are a completely unknown third party. (A cardinal rule of privacy advocates everywhere is never to trust unknown third parties. Calling a sevice like that ""trusted"" is shilly propaganda)

u/pinochetHA had a great response to this 

&gt;The stuff you are claiming here is logical but still defective. Use Tor? You are probably trusting an unknown guard node, which if compromised is very bad news. Use Alphabay/Dream/etc.? You are trusting an unknown endpoint. Any of these things could be compromised at any time. Using a computer? You are trusting the manufacturer was kind and didn't add mean firmware, and also that they were competent and didn't allow compromise by staff or other malicious entities. Using Tails? You are trusting that your usb key is safe from bad usb and the machines firmware is OK and you are also probably trusting the software. At some point most of us are trusting something and it is very unlikely that we will ever be able to prove that these things are not compromised or weak to takeover. Proof would be really nice but we do not always get nice things.

We all have to trust somebody, some more than others. Some have to trust different people due to circumstance. 

&gt;They could be police. (SilkRoad2 is an example of how this is a possibility. Anyone remember this article? http://www.ibtimes.com/interpol-built-its-own-dark-net-drug-marketplace-cops-posing-dealers-2089299. This all went down around the same time as the Oasis debacle. Those swing-set-sniffers from playpen know what I'm talking about. Cops will allow crimes like drug trafficking and the trade of sick kiddie shit to collect data. Fast and furious allowed guns that killed LE. Why wouldn't they do the same for money laundering? Gotta connect the dots somehow. Investigations can last years. LE crave and survive on information.)

You say this a lot but I've never actually seen you post proof. Even that link doesn't have anything to do with SR2. Remember what you said earlier. 
&gt;if you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth

So let's see some actual proof. No reason to believe the site was ran by LE. Yeah they'll **temporarily run an already active an existing site to gather data and strike**. Starting a new one from scratch is a different ball game. That link you posted was just a test. Have they advanced further? Who knows but it would take some massive justification and resources to start large tumbling service or a DNM which would enable kids to buy fent, heroin, meth, oxy, guns, cocaine, ketamine, molly and they might just get sent bunk shit and die even if they're careful, who could justify that?

**edit: I realized I didn't finish this post so I completed it now, I'm on a hit of speed and I feel alive.**

&gt;They operate a money laundering service on reddit. (A clear net site /r/grams)

Are you being serious right now. Bitcoin isn't money no crypto-currency is and they never will be. They are a digital asset more akin to gold and oil, crypto is a lot easier to understand when you think about it as shares instead of coins. Tumbling is like putting all our gold bars in a box and switching them up to get new ones, no taxes evaded. You misewell stop using alphabay because they operate on here as well and post frequently.

&gt;Their ""service"" breeds scam sites, phishing links and dedicated mock scamming subs (/r/GramsHelix is filled with phishing links and even has an active team. How convenient.)

You're gunna have to stop using all markets immediately. I'm terribly sorry.

&gt;The owner and operator of grams helix told me himself: ""Yes there are ways to tumble your bitcoins for free or almost free."" in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5n2llv/on_the_usefulness_of_tumbling/dcag1cc/?context=3&amp;utm_content=context&amp;utm_medium=message&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage(If anyone is serious about privacy, they won't trust a completely unknown to not analyze their coins through a false sense of security. They will look for a way to do it themselves.)

Yes he told you this out in the open for all to see. Because it's the truth and there are other ways to do it. I can't tell if you post is an attack on tumbling or on grams specifically. 

&gt;There has never been a shred of evidence that BTC have ever been tracked back to any Marketeer. Not one single arrest has been made due to BTC being traced back to an illegal transaction ever.

Do you wanna be the first? There's definitely instances that exist when it would be beneficial. The fact that nobody gets arrested for it is a terrible reason that sends a terrible message and would lead to a weakening in opsec standards.

&gt;People who are afraid of being tracked back to their illegal transaction (even though money laundering increases the laws broken and there has never been proof that this is even possible)

**Tumbling is not is not illegal**

dcap8ow,_JulianAssange,57,"TRANSCRIPT:

I have to say that it is a little bit silly. Not in relation to us being under pressure. We have been under a lot of pressure, but we’re very good at resisting pressure. But, in relation to whether I’m alive or kidnapped. If you look at people like John Pilger, for example, long-term friend of mine, runs my defense fund, is a famously brave investigative reporter, my lawyers, close friends, people like Lauri Love, the Ecuadorian government. If you think about the number of people who would actually have to conspire and the amount of work that would have to be done to produce these false images is too many. That’s a social proof. And to understand that, one needs to look at the costs and understand the costs involved in trying to pull together all those people and trying to keep a lid on them and engage in all this kind of fabrication technology, which does not yet exist, as far as anyone can tell, in a capacity to do what is done. To do all that, that’s the cost. And then, but for what benefit? That’s an interesting question.

In thinking about real-time proof of life, intellectually, the most interesting [method] is to take the most recent block in the blockchain, in the bitcoin blockchain, give the number and at least eight digits or something of the hash and then maybe to spell out this hash by sign language. That’s intellectually entertaining, but what is the problem with it?

Well, let’s see if I can get a recent hash. While it’s intellectually entertaining, the problem with it is this — it’s very complicated, the underlying technology, so it has the same flaw that sophisticated voting machines have, cryptographic voting machines, which is the average person can’t understand whether the security claims are in fact born out. Now experts might be able to, but the average person can’t and so then you’re back to a social proof. Does the average person trust the expert? And then how do they know that those experts are really experts that haven’t been compromised?

So, in fact, while it’s intellectually entertaining, it’s not at all a good type of proof of currency. But, I’ll give one anyway, so this is block 445706 and the hash is 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. Ok, I think I made a mistake in the block number, which is going to drive everyone crazy! So, the block number 447506. This is how you can tell it’s real time because of mistakes! Hash 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. OK, intellectually entertaining.

You don’t actually have to read out the whole hash number, maybe eight digits or so combined with a block number would be enough to show currency within a ten minute, hour, period, something like that. But the better way to show currency is news that can be widely checked, is widely spread, and is unpredictable before it happens. The best would be a few different natural disasters, maybe a lot of weather measurements, and otherwise need something that’s not easily predicted and which can be widely checked or widely seen at the time. And a good example of that is sports scores. 

For example, the New Orlean Pelicans versus the NY Knicks won 110-96, Oklahoma 109 versus 94 Chicago, Dallas 92 versus 101 for Minnesota. So, that can give you currency.

In terms of any future precedent, if I disappear or someone else disappears, the answer to if we are OK or under duress should be given by two things in future: Number one by lawyers, publicly associated close friends, people who fund my defense campaign. So, let’s look at those. John Pilger, The Courage Foundation, people associated with it, my lawyers, such as Jennifer Robinson, Margaret Ratner in the United States, Melinda Taylor.

And [number two] the ability to do live interactive video, where someone, even though theoretically they could be under duress, can interject in the stream quickly to say such a thing or to give a variety of messages in a live way, which each one is not comprehensible at the time that is said, but the last one, if you like, provides the conceptual key to decrypt them. (I am not doing this now! I am not doing this now!).

I very much appreciate the support. It had some good effects. I think it probably contributed significantly to restoring my Internet. 

But a lot of that well-intentioned support was waylaid by a black PR campaign, so don’t let that happen again. And, that’s it. Thank you, Reddit. Thank you, Redditors, for spending so much time on our material. We are really, really happy with it. Thanks. ",2017-01-12 03:49:43
dcaqaaa,damianoloan,51,"Thanks, I've tried to provide translations or information where I can on the r/bitcoin threads, I'll keep an eye over here. I'm also in the Whalepool Telegram group, I sometimes post a translation or reading of events there.

For what it's worth, I think today's press releases were entirely predicted by the last set a few days ago. This wasn't news and it shouldn't have been a big deal. People complain about the 'unregulated Chinese bucket shops' and then when someone steps in to make sure their business is legitimate, they express their view by selling everything.

China holds a big stake in the wider Bitcoin ecosystem, if not Core development, and that's not likely to change in the near future. It's about time we got a bit more nuanced.  If the PBoC and Bitcoin have an interaction, that doesn't mean you should sell now. China's shown itself to be much smarter than western nations in terms of both regulation and industrial development so far and, despite their need to protect their national currency, there's no reason to believe that'll change.

My attempt to answer the questions above would be:  

- The date of today's press releases is currently showing as 2017-01-11, didn't notice any mistakes earlier.
- I don't know where the 2017-01-17 date that's being discussed came from. I could believe the on-site investigations may take around that length of time, or that they may be shorter. I'd be surprised if a written report was released so soon. This is speculation on my part.
- It would seem prudent for a business owner to wait for the PBoC press release before making any comment, if nothing else as a mark of courtesy, but also to avoid any contradictions.
- Today gave a concrete form to something that was announced in the last press releases. Nothing more, nothing less.

Edit to add PBoC Beijing link: http://beijing.pbc.gov.cn/beijing/132005/3233066/index.html  - although BTCC have been the focus of attention for some reason, all news so far has been identical across the Shanghai and Beijing exchanges.  
Edit to add: the source of 01/17 date appears to be this CNBC article - http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/bitcoin-falls-5-as-china-plans-to-investigate-firms.html - which falsely claims the ""People's Bank of China published an announcement this morning that it will carry out site inspections on January 17."" This is just inaccurate.  
Edit to add: Bobby Lee was interviewed and discussed what BTCC were asked about: what status exchanges should have, how to set rules for exchanges, whether to issue licenses for exchanges, structural issues, fees, leverage, loans, price fluctuations, whether exchanges should operate 24h. He says the attention of the PBoC wasn't only in response to price movements, but also certain companies advertising bitcoin as a way around FX controls and as a substitute for the Renminbi - http://finance.sina.com.cn/china/gncj/2017-01-12/doc-ifxzqnip0886902.shtml",2017-01-12 04:09:00

The picture I believe was [first seen in this article from 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/us/politics/13paul.html), or at least that's where I found it. Ron Paul was notable in 2007/2008 for being one of the most ignored candidates despite his grass-roots support. This picture really encompasses that.

I had helped out his campaign in the Iowa Straw Poll in 2007, the caucuses in 2008, and majorly volunteered in 2012, when he won the Iowa Caucus (it was a three-way tie but in the end by the state convention, the Paul people had won with grass roots support).

In 2010, I remember finding this article and picture and made it my desktop background around the time I got into and started learning about Bitcoin (which was in the news because it was being used to fund Wikileaks). My father, a retirement-age formerly pro-Bush neoconservative, saw it once and laughed, asking why I possibly thought such a picture to be worth putting as a background. I told him it was a reminder of what we were up against. He laughed again. Needless to say, we didn't always see eye-to-eye on politics, despite both being conservative/libertarian at our roots.

The ""it's happening"" GIF got to be popular in 2012 when Ron Paul was actually making waves, but this is still one of my favorite images (along with the [""Chewbacca - Ron Paul - Gadsen"" image](http://cdn.redalertpolitics.com/files/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-01-at-10.04.26-AM.png) ).

The network is frequently maxed out and currently priced out of the 3rd world remittance and mircrotransaction markets because of fees.  Like come on, that is **broken**.  Like, two of the earliest bitcoin use cases I ever heard about (remittances and microtransactions) are already not viable because of 1mb blocks.    
 
&gt;fracture the network....put real users at risk...better, safer ways of upgrading the network that won't put it at risk.

THIS RIGHT HERE...That is called being ""conclusory"".  All you’ve done is *say* it's dangerous and bad, but you don't say why.  How is it dangerous?  This whole two day argument has been about you not being able to explain why this is risky.   I don’t know how to be more clear than this:  **the main opposition to segwit is that other viable alternatives, particularly a hard fork to increase the blocksize is said to be too risky by a select group of people, but no one can explain why this is the case.”**

&gt;There are hundreds or thousands of other people who fully understand the technical nuances who recognize that hard forking now is a bad idea.

Right there, another logical fallacy.  This is called an ""appeal to authority."" You don't give reasons, rather you want me to believe there are lots of experts out there supporting your proposition.  Great...where are they and what is their reasoning?  Again, you can not provide any reasons whatsoever for why increase via hard fork is such a risky proposition. 

Talk about Dunning Kruger…don’t you see how you are absolutely not answering the question?  All you’re saying is “it’s dangerous because experts say.”  That is not evidence, you waffle. 

&gt;Dude. This is what I'm saying about the fact that you're NOT LISTENING. Segwit blocks are bigger blocks!

And this is just as shocking as everything else.  Of course segwit increases the blocksize.  I never said that it didn't....I'm listening.  Do you see me listening?  Yes, segwit increases the blocksize- but CLEARLY I am talking about increasing the blocksize via hard fork. 

----
So to close, increasing the blocksize via hard fork was something everything thought would occur a long time ago, and now it's bene pushed off indefinitely.  Instead, we got something called segwit.  ""Hey, looks great,"" said everyone, ""but about that hard fork?  What about that hard fork?  Guys, remember the hard fork?""   When the community asks why, all we get is a bunch of bullshit answers like you’ve been providing, namely:

-Hundreds maybe thousands of experts say we shouldn’t
-It’s contentious
-It’s risky
-We are fixing something that isn’t broken.

BashCo-Those are not reasons.  Why can you not see it? Surely you must see that those do not answer the question.  Two are conclusions.  One is a straight fallacy (appeal to authority) and the fourth is just so far in the weeds I don’t even know where to begin.

&gt; Bitcoin Unlimited is software that creates an alternative protocol and network based on Bitcoin

I suppose one could argue that it's an alternative protocol (IMO it's an alternative client that allows user to adjust protocol parameters), but how does it ""create an alternative network""?  The only way we'll get larger blocks in the Blockchain is if the majority of the current network accepts such blocks too.  

&gt; Whether Bitcoin Unlimited would initiate a Bitcoin hard fork or effectively constitute the creation of an altcoin depends on what people decide...

What about the possibility that it simply leads to bigger blocks being included in the Blockchain (i.e., no fork event whatsoever)?  This IMO is the most likely outcome.

&gt; [Bitcoin Unlimited] requires a hard fork...and thus all users moving over to a new network...which can be difficult to coordinate

Another strange use of the words ""new network.""  If the Blockchain begins to include blocks larger than 1 MB, most users (i.e., those using SPV and other lite wallets) would come along by default.  How can you get that all users must move to a new network out of this?  

Sure, full node operators (perhaps ~1% of the user base) would need to increase their block size limits, but this can and is being done ahead of time (e.g., by running BU or a modified version of Core).  

Getting more transactions per second by having people start using an entirely different transaction format (segwit) seems much more difficult to me.  ",2017-01-13 08:45:00

With the market cap so small and with whales having so much control of the price you truly have an unpredictable market. That's why bitcoin is NOT ready as a currency, and still has ways to go before it establishes itself as a reputable commodity. It's getting there, and my bitcoin is staying off the market when the big picture is still intact. To quote myself from last week:

dcc2jrz,zbufferz,24,"No, it *was* going his way.  First, nearly every great scientific or intellectual mind in the early 20th century was German.  Second, the trend in place was towards collectivization, mass movements, e.g. labor unions, mass industrialization, mass communication,  etc.  Hilter succeed by appealling to the working class German's frustration through racism, etc, but in a way that was collective.  Rallying mass movements was the forefront of politics, Lenin and Trotsky did it to overthrow the czar for example.

Fascism and communism are very similar in the notion of a single party state representing the will of the working class masses.  Hitler was the first to apply this collective politics to the trend of mass industrialization and essentially industrialize the military, and launch a war that would be fought on an industrial scale.

However, now we are post-industrial, and mass communication and mass culture shaped by a hierarchy of political and economic power interests has given way to a network that is decentralized, diffuse, and always shifting.  Trumps appeal to ""the middle class"" is a pointless impotent reaction that won't last two years.  In the post-industrial world there isn't supposed to be a middle class because we don't have any middle class work to do.  We have producers, consumers, creatives, investors, influencers, etc.  We have a network and the groups grow and contract and shift in real-time. 

The long-term trend which in no way is being impeded by Trump, is away from nation states, towards homogenization of ""rights"", relatively unimpeded flows of capital, currency, goods, and resources, relatively unrestricted travel, etc. 

Anything transnational is the future, and anything national is the past.  Bitcoin and crypto currrencies are a sort of transnational money, ebay and alibaba are transnational ""retail"" (sort of).  Economically and commerically, this is still very early, but the trend is there.  

Likewise identities are shifting to transnational ones.  LGBT is a transnational identity, for example (the identity is consistent across national boundaries.  The meaning of ""white"" as a race is inconsistent)  For people of majority racial or ethnic identities, the trend is to claim an identity based on social attitudes (feminist), consumer attitudes (e.g. ""geek"", ""fitness bro"", ""gamer"", ""fanboy"" for one thing or another) or work (""I'm a designer"") rather than ethnicity or even religion.

Even on reddit you talk to people from everywhere, but you gravitate to subreddits (i.e. a collection of users) based on things other than religion, ethnicity or race.

Trump doesnt' understand this, and I think his real estate background itself is proof of his retrograde reactionary nature.  His business is tied to place, and to close deals he deals with national authorities.

*sorta*

K so with bitcoin the whole magic is you can send this Internet money and everyone knows it because it's all public right? So no more need for JP Morgan to hold your money. You have bitcoin. You send bitcoin. You receive bitcoin. Anyone can tell you how much bitcoin you have. Done. 

*Right...*

So Ethereum is all that but with these things call smart contracts. Which means you can do more. You can send. Or you could have the app /smart contract send at a certain time. Or have the app not send unless it's a certain time. Or let's say you want to place a bet. You don't have to go to the casino and trust the casino, you just send to the app - the smart contract - and the rest happens. In public. So everyone can check and be like 'yup, she sent 1 eth. And the smart contract rolled the dice. And she won. And the smart contract sent her 10 eth'. 

*but I don't want anyone to know if I have 10 eth*

That's fine. It's all behind a string of numbers called an address. That isn't linked to your name, your identity. Why do we need your identity. We just got rid of banks and the Fed. And you can have however many addresses you want. Theyre free. That's what I build. I build an app where you click a button and it gives you a new address. And it doesn't ask you for anything. You just click a button. Click it 100 times. We don't even know you clicked it.

dcepoek,varikin,266,"I want to expand on the SIMD part. This stands for Single Instruction, Multiple Data. A regular CPU is SISD, single instruction, single data. SISD is very general purpose. SIMD is not general purpose.

So, say you have 2 million pixels (that is about 1080p, 1920 x 1080) and you want to apply the same filter to all of them, at the same time, 60 times a second. This is exactly what a GPU is build for. For example, you are playing a game and there is a red light, the GPU might be told, take these 2 million pixels (the multiple data), and apply 5% red (the single instruction) to all of them. The GPU will due that as a single operation. The CPU, on the other hand, will have to do that that operation (5% red) 2 million times in a row. If you want this done 60 times a second (60fps), do you want to do 60 operations on 2m pixels or 120m operations 1 pixel at a time? Of course this is a vast simplification, but you get the idea, right?

Now, GPUs are used frequently for other things, like bitcoin mining, scientific analysis, and other number crunching. Basically, some people realized that a GPU is just a general purpse SIMD processor and much cheaper than ""proper"" SIMD processors. A good computer with a great GPU is under $2000. A ""proper"" computer for handling SIMD would probably start at 10 times that. So, 5% Red is really just math, right? So why not just do math? Lets say you want to do weather analysis. You have 2 million data points across the ocean and want to know how the wind affects that. That is the same as ""5% red to 2 million pixels"", but in this case, 5% Red is add wind, and instead of pixels, you have the current state of different points of the ocean. Now this doesn't buy you much until you do this 60 times a second for a week. As for things like bitcoin, that is all math based. I haven't put much research into it, but I do now the math for it is easily broken up into SIMD patterns. 

Finally, the comment above mentions that CPUs are a lot smarter. A lot of that is to allow it to stop and resume a task. You have a browser running (with 10 tabs), an email client, word, spotify, etc all running at the same time. The CPU basically gives all them a 1ms to work, pause them, give the next a 1ms, pause, etc, then resume, work 1ms, pause, etc. Pausing and resuming is expensive, but it gives you a great experience. The GPU doesn't always care. Oh, you paused, it will throw away all that work. You want to resume? Start all over again. Again, vast over simplification. ",2017-01-14 14:47:55

It's absolutely a shit show - hotels are sold out, security/construction/activity is being set up etc. I've heard while a ton of pro Trump people are flowing in for the inauguration, there's also droves of anti Trump people coming into town for protests, ""protest parties"" (huh?) and such. (Talk to your Uber drivers, they are the grapevine) Keep in mind this area (esp the NOVA/DC/MD parts) are generally liberal. I personally will not attend the inauguration because it's going to be one of the most depressing and darkest days of our great country's history.

I do have an interesting story though. A couple of months ago a buddy was visiting from out of town and staying at a really fucknig upscale hotel in the city. The crowd there is almost all diplomats, business executives, lobbyists, big money types. I was at the hotel bar one night and we were shooting the shit with this couple sitting at the bar, they were from the UK and probably mid 60's? The guy was very sharp and we were talking about everything from bitcoin to history to politics, and eventually the talk came to the election (naturally). The guy had mentioned he was a semi retired economist or something who was in town giving some talk to a university or a think thank, can't recall. I do recall thinking after 20 mins or so that this guy was probably a former spook or from that world, the way he spoke about domestic instability in Pakistan or about the nuances of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, or about election rigging in a Central American country, and just stuff that gave me a pretty good gut feeling this guy has been around the world and not for sightseeing. 

Anyways, when we were talking about the US election (at this point in the zone where you're in a buzzed conversation with another buzzing person so loose talk starts) he asked if I thought Trump would win. I said it was next to impossible but you never know. And then he said, and I'll always remember this *""there's a lot out there on him, a lot of stuff is going to come out. Some of it.. it's just not on...""* (""not on"" = Brit slang for ""not good"" or ""not cool"" I believe). He looked almost disgusted or perturbed.  It was strange the way he said it, it was strange how he seemingly realized even after a few drinks he probably shouldn't have said that and stopped himself, and I mean his entire demeanor just stuck in my head.

When we were leaving the bar I asked my buddy if he thought that old British dude was a retired spook or something, and he said yeah he thought so too - and *he* chatted with the guys wife who had mentioned having worked in the British Foreign Office. This is totally normal for this area - spooks/intelligence analysts/diplomats/defense contractors/military/politicians are allover the beltway.

dcepf3t,PAPPP,35,"Everything they say is plausible (it's not movie-hacker babble or anything, and it corresponds with documented events) but nothing is in any way specific enough to be confirming.  Most of it is notes about assholes buying time on the poster's vast army of hacked consumer devices to send unreasonable amounts of useless resource-consuming traffic at targets they wanted to hassle and/or knock offline (ddos, literally ""Distributed Denial of Service"").  There's a fair amount of reference to the major incident with Mirai in which a huge bunch of devices infected with mirai were pointed at the website of a prominent security researcher, causing large-scale problems on the Internet, which got the feds involved and inspired OP to get out of dodge.  They then explain that they released the source code for mirai so that others would modify and use it, in order to muddy the waters about who was involved, in hopes of escaping detection. 

Just to expand some lingo, in that context:

""Mirai"" = A piece of malware that affects IoT devices, mostly network cameras and routers.  It chiefly works via a list of shitty default credentials rather than any sort of fancy exploit.  Once hacked, a device scans around for other devices to infect, and listens for commands to do other things. 

""IoT"" = Internet of Things, putting network-connected garbage in consumer devices. 

""btc"" = Bitcoin

""cnc"" = ""Command and Control"", a server used to issue commands to infected devices. 

""water torture"" = having the army of attacking devices perform DNS lookups for [randomgarbage].targetdomain.tld to attack the nameservers for the target rather than the target itself.

""bestbuy/popopret"" = folks claiming to be selling ddos-for-hire access to an/the army of mirai-infected devices. 

""therealdeal"" = ""Dark web"" market for selling exploits. 

""Krebs"" = Brian Krebs, a security expert/writer. 

Akamai, CloudFlare = Content Delivery Network providers, basically gigantic distributed content caches for hire.  They mitigate/take much of the load of dos attacks on things they distribute for. 

digitalocean, lonestar, OVH = hosting companies

""dyn"" = major DNS provider whose shit has been wrecked several times by IoT botnets.  OP accuses them of ineptitude and exaggerating the extent of the attack directed at them. 

I'm not sure what ""hf"" is in that context, I suspect it's some forum where script kiddies hang out these days, but I don't really keep up with that shit. ",2017-01-14 14:39:18

I think the Chinese government is very hostile towards the bitcoin. It gave a first warning about the volatility of Bitcoin that does not have the price reduced. There followed a second notice of ongoing investigations. If the price does not drop the PBOC will use strong measures to discourage the outflow of capital to the bitcoin. The government has simply tolerated the bitcoin in the past. Now it becomes a danger to the stability of the yuan and will be taken of the important countermeasures. Across the ocean in U.S.A. bitcoin is attacked by the IRS. Bitcoin runs in a liberal and globalized world but it is an enemy of state sovereignty that issues money.

Some more info on ZeroNet from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroNet): 

&gt;ZeroNet is not anonymous by default, but users can hide their IP address by using the built in Tor-functionality.

So the Shadow Brokers are likely using ZeroNet with Tor.

&gt;ZeroNet uses bitcoin cryptography and the BitTorrent network.

There's a torrent site that ignores DMCA requests due to it's decentralized nature: https://torrentfreak.com/play-p2p-impossible-shutdown-160301/


&gt;As of 2016 there is no way to take down a ZeroNet page which still has seeders, thus making such pages immune to DMCA takedown notices. By default, sites operate with a max-filesize of 10 megabytes, but this is a soft limit, and some websites go as big as gigabytes.

The politics that exist can exist because ""ermagerd did you see that block #32432 was mined by that pool and it was empty!!"" and stuff like that.

I mean, the dynamic blocksize could be optimize, but even if Monero core team disbanded today and no consensus was reached for 4 years, Monero will still function as intended - dynamic blocksize scaling to demand, transactions default private, decentralized money for the people.  

the nature of the system will influence how the system works.

I ended up breaking even after ~5 months with the 280 and 290 radeon cards, and by that time the difficulty had far exceeded the ability of cards to profit on a per kWh basis.  I had to shut down or spend more chasing the increasing difficulty with ASIC miners.  I had 2x Radeon 290X, 2x 290, and 2x 280 running mining operations.  I mined in winter, paid only $0.10 per kWh, and used the mining as a primary heating source for my house near Seattle, so reasoned my real electric rate was closer to $0.08 kWh. My lessons learned:  
-Used equipment price is not adjusted for the future difficulty.  There are too many people who plug in the current hash rate and difficulty into a simple calculator and believe they can make a profit.  You will likely lose 30% on used equipment (at lest I did with BITCOIN miners)  
-If you bought a modern ASIC miner TODAY, you may make a profit this month compared to electricity expenses, but likely will have severely tapering profits and never make your investment back, unless you have free electricity.  Expect profits to dry up in a matter of months due to actual corporate miners with millions to spend on the latest equipment.  
-If you have free electricity, no reason not try! If I was back in college dorms with included electricity this would still be a 24/7 GPU operation for me with an ASIC or two, but of course if you use a GPU it puts a lot of stress on it and may shorten its lifespan.  
-Bottom line, if you're just looking to get litecoin, just buy them.  If you want to have fun mining, consider it like gambling in vegas.  Spend the $300, enjoy the process, and if you make any of it back, great, but plan on losing it for the process of enjoyment.",2017-01-15 17:35:57

I for one am past the tipping point: I consider the dynamics of the Core organisation both childish and authoritarian - and I believe it cannot be fixed.

FTA: ""It's time to stop being ashamed about being labeled ""political"" for opposing Core features. The debate became political a year ago. The opposition is working. None of the major changes the Core has proposed are being implemented, and confidence in the Core is slowly being lost. While it is sad to say so, the best way to force a leadership change is to oppose everything the Core says or does - good or bad - until the industry sees how much money is being lost. Only then will we finally be led by people who are looking out for us.""

What you are feeling right now is what people call in this community Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. Your composure is shaken because Monero has dipped in price and your ""FUD"" is causing you to say goodbye to Monero prematurely. People are questioning your maturity because you lack the perspective that comes with time , not in your chronological age but in how long you've been in the crypto-scene.

In the past Monero has dropped from 14 dollars to 5. Do you know why that doesn't matter? It's because Monero was and still is the most decentralized, fungible, private and scale-able currency on the planet. In my eyes **that** has value.

 I don't care what its market valuation is, the market is stupid. There are many *many* people investing in Bitcoin unaware of its untenable flaws as a currency because *they are blinded by the dollar signs*. Don't be one of them, don't get distracted by how much people think it's worth. Forget Monero's price right now. The question is what do **you** think it's worth? If you think it's worth a paltry 10.50 then sell, sell it all and cut your losses or make your profits. If you think its worth more then remain steadfast in your conviction that what you feel has value will rise again as people wake up to what is objectively better technology.

&gt; Then we hit on this idea of, ""Why don't we just store *money* in the handheld devices?"" The next iteration was this thing that would do cryptographically secure IOU notes. I would say, ""I owe you $10,"" and put in my passphrase. It wasn't really packaged at the user interface level as an IOU, but that's what it effectively was. Then I could beam it to you, using the infrared on the Palm Pilot, which at this point is very quaint and silly since, clearly, what would you rather do, take out $5 and give someone their lunch share, or pull out two Palm Pilots and geek out at the table? But that actually is what moved the needle, because it was so weird and so innovative. The geek crowd was like, ""Wow. This is the future. We want to go to the future. Take us there."" So we got all this attention and were able to raise funding on that story.

&gt; Then we had the famous Buck's beaming - at Buck's restaurant in Woodside, which is sort of the home away from home for many VCs. Our first round of financing was actually transferred to us via Palm Pilot. Our VC showed up with a $4.5 million preloaded Palm Pilot, and they beamed it to us.

With the current 1MB blocklimit, nodes are already [struggling]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5n18qy/my_bitcoin_node_hit_a_new_record_last_friday/). And a 16 MB blocklimit might sound great, but in reality it doesn’t give us that much scaling at all.


-


At the moment we can process 3 transactions per second which is next to nothing. Multiply 16 with nothing and you still have barely any scaling, but you would put the network at enormous stress. It would also require a hardfork and since I can never be 100% sure that every wallet, darknetmarket, exchange, shop and every Bitcoin user in the world would adopt that hardfork it might split the network in two. So it would be a huge risk to do this.


**Roger Ver:** “Impossible” what does that even mean?


**Developer:** Well I might have a good solution called Segregated Witness. It enables us to process twice as much transactions, it can be done as a softfork so we don’t risk splitting the network, it doesn’t put a lot of stress on nodes so we can keep the network decentralized. And most importantly it makes better scaling solutions possible like Lightning, tumblebit, Schnorr and all sorts of great things.

In October 2014, we released the sidechains whitepaper. In June of 2015, we launched Elements, the first working implementation of sidechains. This inspired a number of other exciting sidechains projects, like Rootstock and Hivemind. In October 2015, we launched the Liquid protocol, which is our first production sidechain. This protocol makes bitcoin exchanges interoperable. Bitcoin exchanges are just the first test case for the technology and it can be applied across a number of financial assets.
While we’ve made a lot of progress, sidechains are currently federated rather than truly decentralized. There’s a lot of work to be done on this front still.

He and his team of researchers at Cornell have been investigating attack vectors (""selfish miners"") and proposing innovative scaling architectures (Bitcoin-NG) for Bitcoin, for several years now.

Plus, I believe they were responsible for [the ""Cornell study""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4cq8v0/new_cornell_study_recommends_a_4mb_blocksize_for/) which showed that Bitcoin could _already_ support 4 MB blocks using _existing_ hardware / infrastructure.

**Trusted hardware**

Personally, I've always been uncomfortable / suspicious about Intel's TPM (Trusted Platform Module) - and I'm also uncomfortable / suspicious about Intel's newer SGX (Software Guard Extensions) - but maybe this whole idea of ""trusted hardware"" is something we should be examining more.

Already we ""trust"" a lot of the code we download - and if it's critical, then we ""verify"" that it's ""authentic"" it by checking an MD5 or SHA hash, plus a PGP signature published by the dev.

**A ""license"" or just a ""verification process""?**

The procedure which many people are arguing about in this thread (involving an SGX ""license"") sounds somewhat similar - but maybe the unfortunate name ""license"" is scaring people off? I still don't know all the details yet about this.

Meanwhile, will the only source of ""trusted hardware"" always be Intel forever?

There are some projects where people are working on **""open source"" hardware**, and maybe eventually that's the direction the world will have to start heading in - if we want to store trillions of dollars on our computers using Bitcoin.

Maybe we could get to the point where we don't have to trust Intel, in order to trust our hardware?

**Qubes and SGX?**

Also, what about a project like Qubes, developed by Joanna Rutkowska et al? 

Joanna is a very outspoken and paranoid security expert - and the OS which she and her colleagues have developed, called Qubes, offers some very advanced security guarantees.

Over the years, Joanna has become well-known as an outspoken and honest ""white hat"" expert on Intel's TPM - and now I expect we could also learn a lot from her discussions about SGX in the context of the Qubes ""reasonably secure"" OS:

https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.fr/2013/08/thoughts-on-intels-upcoming-software.html

https://www.qubes-os.org/

**MirageOS and SGX?**

Finally, I also wonder if there might be any synergy between MirageOS and SGX.

&gt; Mirage OS is a ‘cloud operating system’ that seeks to avoid security vulnerabilities and bloat by facilitating the creation of single purpose virtual appliances. Applications are developed in the OCaml functional programming language and compiled into standalone ‘unikernels’ that run directly on the Xen hypervisor. By removing the traditional operating system, and replacing it with language libraries that replicate operating system constructs, Mirage offers the promise of smaller, faster applications with a reduced attack surface area. Applications can be deployed directly into Xen based public clouds such as Amazon’s EC2 and Rackspace Cloud.

https://mirage.io/

https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/12/mirageos

**MirageOS Bitcoin Piñata**

By the way, there was a cool little MirageOS project / demo / prize called the ""Bitcoin Piñata"" where you could win some bitcoin if you cracked a TLS server written in Ocaml and deployed using MirageOS:

http://amirchaudhry.com/bitcoin-pinata

https://mirage.io/blog/bitcoin-pinata-results

https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-bitcoin-pinata

**Ocaml and Bitcoin**

Long-term, I think the best Bitcoin software might end up being a ""MirageOS appliance"" - written in typesafe Ocaml, and compiled to a secure, fast, tiny unikernel.

Ocaml is a much safer language than C++ - and it's reasonably close to C++ in performance - so a Bitcoin-implementation-as-secure-tiny-fast-MirageOS-appliance could provide important benefits to Bitcoin users.

There's already some Bitcoin-related libraries available in OCaml:

https://github.com/nickgian/ECC-OCaml (elliptic-curve cryptography)

https://github.com/dakk/secp256k1-ml (elliptic curve library secp256k1 wrapper for Ocaml - using Ocaml's ""monadic"" foreign-function interface to C)

And Ocaml's modular FFI (foreign-function interface) to C is pretty amazing:

https://mirage.io/blog/modular-foreign-function-bindings

I expect someone might eventually take a look at some of the other Bitcoin implementations which (unlike BlockstreamCore's implementation in C++) are more modular and/or use functional languages (eg: [BtcSuite in Golang](https://github.com/btcsuite), [Toshi from CoinBase in Ruby/Postgres](https://github.com/coinbase/toshi), or [Bcoin in Node.JS / JavaScript](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin)) - and maybe one of those modular/functional implementions in Golang / Ruby / JavaScript could serve as a guide (along with BlockstreamCore's non-functional / non-modular implementation in C++) to writing a modular, functional Bitcoin implementation in OCaml and deploying it using MirageOS - which would be much more efficient and secure than current implementations in C++, Golang, Ruby, JavaScript.

I did a quick Google and managed to find one PDF which makes a passing mention of both SGX and MirageOS, so who knows what could be done if someone were to rewrite TeeChan in Ocaml, and create a MirageOS single-purpose virtual appliance which also leverages SGX somehow. 

---

**Conclusion**

These are all long-term ideas involving projects in their early stages - but there could be some ideas here which could stimulate future research and results - possibly providing innovative ways of running much more scalable and secure Bitcoin implementations someday.

And it sure is nice to able to comment on an OP like this, about a serious mathematician / programmer like Emin Gün Sirer proposing some innovative cutting-edge scaling ideas for Bitcoin.

Circle was another good option, but sadly they discontinued their Bitcoin services. For buying a single Bitcoin you aren't really going to get a better deal than Coinbase. Another good option is libertyx.com if you can find a supported location to pay with cash, the only issue is there's many locations listed, but most of these convenience stores have no idea what you're talking about and how to process the payment even though they do have libertyx on their bill pay terminal. 

In my opinion, I would not advise keeping savings in a bank, you are getting next to nothing in interest payments, and you risk having your funds legally stolen by the bank in the event of a bail-in. If you simply keep cash secured away under your own control, and a bail-in scenario does end up happening, then your cash will be very valuable, at least for a short time before the system collapses and goes hyper-inflationary. 

Just keep in mind Bitcoin is a high risk investment, I wouldn't personally advise using it solely for savings unless you are comfortable with what you invested potentially being worth nothing or very little later on, but on the flip side your investment could gain tremendous value.  

A diverse portfolio reduces risk, if you want to gamble all of your savings on Bitcoin, I won't stop you, who knows it could really pay off. But, if you want to reduce risk then I'd suggest buying some Bitcoin alongside other traditional investments such as stocks and precious metals. Bonds aren't worth it IMO, they don't beat inflation, while good stocks generally do.

&gt; **We know that issued assets and smart property contracts could grow to eclipse bitcoin traffic entirely**. Some of us are even convinced this could happen quickly.

This is evidence the BC developers are knowingly imposing restrictions on Bitcoin mainnet to artificially prop up *sidechains* so as to whisk away the bulk of Bitcoin transaction volume onto BC syndicate controlled territory.

Greg Maxwell and the BC syndicate hire [full time trolls](https://www.reddit.com/user/brg444) to bamboozle Bitcoin users into believing the syndicate's actions, of protecting full nodes on desktop, are *benevolent*, when in fact Satoshi's vision was the polar opposite:

[Satoshi](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/):

&gt; Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but **as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware**. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

[Satoshi again](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/105/):

&gt; Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don't generate and don't participate in the node network.  They wouldn't need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain).  If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that stage, **most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated**.

Satoshi envisioned full nodes being run entirely by specialists in datacenters, implying Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin mainnet as fielding a very high volume of low-fee transactions.

To counter this obvious but inconvenient fact, the BC syndicate employs persecutory tactics on social media and assaults anyone who points out that it was Satoshi's vision that full nodes would be run by specialists in datacenters.

Satoshi's paper mentions _nothing_ about cooperation (or trust, or permission). In fact, it _assumes_ certain people will be malicious.

Bitcoin does _not_ work by ""cooperation"" - it works by _economic incentives_ aka _greed_.

Bitcoin works because it is very unlikely that the _majority_ (51%) would do anything against their economic interest.

But you have never understood these things. Hence you continue to shit-post, and get downvoted (but not censored) - and now you want to play the victim when in reality you're just an idiot who has nothing relevant to say.

dcki1hz,Adrian-X,32,"&gt; ? Are people going to be buying BU instead of regular ol bitcoin?

no, not according to Shatoshi's Bitcoin white paper:

&gt;Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work
is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.

So those calling a fork or BU an altcoin don't actually understand how bitcoin works. 

When BU gets more than an average of 50.01% hashpower, and can sustain it, miners can safely move the block limit. BU is one safe way of doing it as described in the White Paper. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf.

dcjuxb0,kevinmhealy,25,"I agree that some of the decentralized company charters might not be feasible in the short term.

However, using ethereum as a replacement for bitcoin strictly for monetary transfer is feasible.

I also think that ethereum has thousands (or more) minor use cases that will be extremely valuable outside of just decentralized charters.

...and if ether did become the ""primary built in payment of the web"" (as he wants to see bitcoin) it would be extremely beneficial in 10-20 years from now because the network already has valid entry points to build on top of.  So once AI is mature it can easily plug into the network.  Whereas bitcoin doesn't have those entry points outside of centralized institutions.

We have to remember that he's obviously going to be a little bit biased because he's already invested so heavily in bitcoin.

That being said, the fact that bitcoin does have so many people heavily invested in it... is a valid competitive advantage.  Superior technology doesn't always win.  Look at Nikola Tesla who had far superior technology that never saw the light of day.  Where as Edison was able to bring inferior tech to market and make it mainstream.

Or the fact that Macintosh who most would agree had more elegant technology than windows... was far surpassed by windows in the 90s.  

So it's up to us, if we want to see ethereum win, to make it accessible to the mainstream market.  I think ethereum is doing a good job so far.  But it's an important point to remember that the mainstream can't comprehend or really care about the inner elegance of the technology.  They usually just use things that they understand (even if it's vastly inferior).

We have to make the superior technology understandable to the mainstream in order for it to succeed.",2017-01-18 04:12:18

3.) rbtc accounts flood into the 4-day-old thread, obviously voting each other up like crazy. So I removed the citation comment temporarily because the brigading is so damn blatant. I also banned a few of the accounts raiding the thread.

dcl70n9,deb0rk,54,"Conversation quality has been going downhill in pretty noticeable manner. 

To cover some general things, first and foremost keep to **Rule #1: Be excellent to each other.**

Some general points:

* This sub is for trading and market analysis. We have permabull / moonkids, and we have skeptics and even buttcoiners. Honestly, it doesn't matter what you think of BTC, you're welcome to discuss **trading and the markets** and well reasoned and supported arguments for price going in either direction, because **profit happens in both directions**. If you're unable to look past your personal, emotional stance on bitcoin to see profit potential, this sub is probably not best for you and your respective echo chamber is a happier place to be. If you are addressing other traders for being a permabull/moonkid or a buttcoiner instead of their trading ideas, **you're doing it wrong, that doesn't belong here**.

* Supporting your argument for a trade really helps make your post not be low-quality. Charts, math, literally anything than numbers pulled from ~~your ass~~nowhere really helps.

* Non-excellent behavior includes deriding, cheering, or otherwise calling out people for losing in either direction. Bulls or Shorts ""get rekt"" is not excellent. 

* Calling people out for making wrong calls is likewise non-excellent. Simple and undeniable fact is, everyone will make the wrong call many times. A good trader will be able to make the wrong trade many times, but still overall have the ability to be in profit due to proper risk management, etc. 

* This is not your twitter feed, nor is it a price ticker. We don't need a post every hour letting everyone know what the current price is. There are websites and even the banner at the top. Likewise, this isn't an outlet for your stream of thoughts. ""Price is going up"", ""WOW"", ""what's going on?"", or ""is china waking up?"" is not a helpful post. A post consistently wholly of ""I'm long"" or ""buy the dip"" belongs on your twitter feed or told to your dog/cat, as it doesn't contribute anything meaningful.

It's literally stuck at 25% for more than a month now. I mean, maybe I'm reading it wrong, or don't understand the reasons why miners do not update their clients yet.

Merchants who ""accept"" Bitcoin, actually don't. They can't risk holding it, so it's converted immediately to fiat. 

How does this help Bitcoin adoption? It doesn't.

The only way to adoption is through the incentive of ""gain"" - i.e. as in Bitcoin's increasing value. The total value of Bitcoin needs to grow significantly in order to reduce volatility.

So, merchant acceptance will come when future millions of holders decide it's time to spend some. And by then, hopefully Bitcoin will be widely considered as ""better money"" where merchants are eager to accept it and hold it - even offering discounts to get their hands on it.

Meanwhile, the thing that will drive adoption is self interest - the hope that one's Bitcoin stash is going up in value. As more people see the proof of this, they will want Bitcoin too.

1. No one can feed you false history, because you have validated all blocks back to genesis. It is not very probable that this attack would happen, but if we are talking about lots of transactions, or lots of money, the risk might be enough to worry about.

2. Because no one can feed you an invalid blockchain, you are helping maintain the integrity of the bitcoin, and confidence in the integrity of bitcoin. The more people fully validate payments, the less likely any invalid-block fraud can be perpetuated by a miner or a man-in-the-middle. Running a fully validating node is good citizenship for this reason, even if you run a pruned node and do not do forward any transactions.

3. Improved privacy, since you will not be sending your transactions to a third party for broadcast. A dedicated attacker could figure out that you were the first node to broadcast a transaction, but at least you aren't giving the info to some rando running an electrum server.

4. If you have a decent internet connection, and are willing to get your hands dirty technically to keep your node running, your operating system patched, and your bitcoin software up-to-date, running a full node can be a way to feel like you are making a positive contribution to the project.

5. Running a full node can be a way to express your opinion during forks.

Are those reasons good enough to justify running a full node? Not for everyone certainly, but for me they are.

dcn933o,peoplma,20,"I was against it when you originally proposed it, because at the time dogecoin and litecoin's hashrates were pretty equal.  But as our mining reward halved every 2.5 months, dogecoin's hashrate quickly paled in comparison to litecoin's.  I think the devs implemented it at just the right time, as dogecoin's hashrate fell well below litecoin's with no hopes of regaining it.

I was worried about the transitional period, while AuxPoW was activated yet miners hadn't implemented it yet, dogecoin would hav been vulnerable to a 51% attack at no cost to the miners.  However thankfully a lot of shibes (including you, iirc) worked very hard to get all the miners and businesses on board before the fork happened.

There was one downside, a small exchange (I forget the name right now) continued accepting old fork coins.  So some people mined a bunch of coins on the old fork, then sent them to that exchange and traded for bitcoin, the exchange was left with a bunch of invalid, old fork dogecoin and went insolvent, and a lot of people lost money.  But thankfully, it was just a small exchange hardly anyone had heard of.

Now, 3 years later, I am convinced it was the best option to save dogecoin from losing all its hashrate.  Without it, profitability indicates we would be at ~5% of litecoin's hashrate or less, so even a small litecoin pool could attack.  So yes, it was the right choice, especially in combination with out 10,000 doge per block forever inflation (because without that as well, litecoin miners would have no reason to continue mining dogecoin as the reward fell to 0).

I'm just curious, litecoin's fate in the far future seems like it will be the same as dogecoin's, as the mining reward drops (assuming consistent price and no significant increase in tx fees) litecoin will become more vulnerable to a 51% attack (as will dogecoin).  Do you have any plans for litecoin at that time?  It will be in the far future though since litecoin halves so much slower, but just curious if you've thought about it.

dcmt3bj,identiifiication,20,"I haven't really been submitting any TA recently (and have been long since October/November (I know..) but seen as I'm reading far too much bickering and too little direction, I thought I'd have my say today (well try, atleast) 

I'll start it off with the link to what I'm seeing - 

http://imgur.com/gallery/iJbQw

*The Cup and handle.*

I thought I'd start by looking at the most of obvious and probably most spoken of term this year.  

Well I for one was blinded by the upwards movement (and thought going over the previous Market cap of $14 B to $19 was a confirmation of the breakout).. (hence my continued non-leveraged long). However with the refusal of the west to breach $1175, I should have realised that we were reaching the tip of the cup. 
  Unfortunately, I did not see the equally parabolic drop coming.. and missed the near 50% gain like many here missed, some even  capitulating on the 47% crash from 8800 CNY to 4880. ( :( ) 

The second image in the link is (pretty obviously) where I think the price is headed towards. I don't expect it to take anywhere near as long as I've drawn on the chart to complete however. (I'm still a believer that we will see the local top around 16/2/2017 in accordance with the 235 day cycle) 

*MACD*

Unlike what some people have said here, I don't think the 1wk MACD is looking the MOST promising I've ever seen it. Generally when the MACD has began to recede it has entered periodic bear markets. So I'd take what people say about the bullishness of MACD with a tub-full of salt. 

*OBV*

(this is probably the indicator I'm least familiar with) Over the last year Okcoin's volume has increased nicely with the increased price in Bitcoin, representing a positive OBV, until recently.  The Okcoin PBOC conundrum must make me take yet another spoonful of salt. As who are we to know how legitimate the volume is there, at all?  

Since the crash a few weeks ago, the volume increased on a decreasing price (so if someone could explain that a little more that'd be good) Perhaps it is a bearish divergence? 


*RSI*

I don't have the most clear understanding of the RSI, but I do know when it goes over 70, its pretty clear sell category and when its below 30 its a good buying time. 

Well right now its about 65-67. On this indicator alone, it'd suggest to sell now and buy back lower (although I find these indicators are trailing, and only really represent the best buying or selling opportunities after its already happened.) 

*StochRSI* 

Welp, I do understand that RSI and StochRSI are two different sides of the same coin. Looking at the (bottom image on the link) I can see that we are approaching 20, which signals over-sold territory. 

*conclusion to TA* 

- C&amp;H looking healthy for Bitcoin, testing long term support of 5000 CNY (not on charts, sorry), now up, up and more up in sight. 

- MACD, leaning towards Bearishness

- OBV - Bearish divergence ? (I'd be happy for someone to correct me) 

- RSI - closer to overbought than oversold - 65 

- StochRSI - Oversold 

(my question is, if RSI and StochRSI are two sides of the same coin, how can they show contrasting values.. or am I getting something wrong?) 

*What about the socio-political-economic state of the world?* 

TA aside, looking at the fundamentals of Bitcoin in 2017, its looking stronger than ever. 

   Clinging close to $900, in a world of crashing fiat economies, a erratic China stomping their feet into throwing away $1T in a attempt to slow currency devaluations. 

The Euro, the Mexican Peso, The Venezulian Bolivar.. the list goes on, fiat currencies are not doing well, at all. 

Its days like today that Bitcoiners must be thankful for deflation. No longer can he governments seize your gold, rob you of your wealth when time gets rough. 


Not to forget the *WildCard* - 

   March 11th, the day for A ETF confirmation or not? This event is probably the MOST bullish signal we have (besides Segwit) for 2017.

P.s I used Okcoin as they have historically been market leaders. (fake volume or not)

dcnqzna,theymos,20,"* MW can't support advanced contracts. Sometimes you can replicate the effect of Bitcoin contracts with elliptic curve tricks, but not in all cases, and figuring out new MW pseudo-contracts is very difficult.
* MW will be completely wiped out by quantum computers, whereas Bitcoin has some innate quantum resistance and a clear path toward secure existence in a post-QC world. There's no known way of doing anything like MW without exposing it to quantum attacks, so if quantum computers come into existence, that'll be the end of MW (absent new crypto).
* Bitcoin has a very powerful existing ecosystem.

Also, MW doesn't *instantly solve* anonymity/fungibility. It needs to be paired with an effective, specially-designed mixnet-like network to do that, which will be an additional engineering challenge. Though there's been decades of research on mixnets, so MW won't have to start totally from scratch.

That said, a MW altcoin would be the first altcoin that would IMO have a chance of out-competing Bitcoin, since its disadvantages may be outweighed by its many powerful advantages. People who hold BTC should work hard to get it added to Bitcoin as a sidechain ASAP so that any altcoin version of MW doesn't have time to gain ground.",2017-01-20 13:17:42
dcnwdul,naterush1997,20,"I think you raise some interesting points, but there are a couple things I'm not sure I agree with from a PoS algorithm design perspective.

I don't think that ""a good PoS algorithm should just try to solve nothing-at-stake and keep everything else as close as possible to PoW."" IMO, this mindset, seemingly a fear of innovation, is part of what stops crypto from exploding onto the mainstream.

If we were to just create a PoW copy in PoS, we would lose many of the new security measures that PoS allows us to create. For example, to paraphrase Vitalik paraphrasing Vlad, having control over validators staked Eth allows for incredible disincentives to cheat -  ""it's as though your ASIC farm burned down if you participated in a 51% attack."" 

Also, it is possible to create incentives that [stop censoring cartels from being incentivized to form](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-5-8652959cef58#.3htwspgop) - something that no other blockchain that exists today currently does. 

With that being said, I don't think that PoW should be touted as the pinnacle of security that it is. For example, Bitcoin's PoW can conceivably and effectively be attacked by a cartel with as little as [25% of the hashing power](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/selfish-mining-a-25-attack-against-the-bitcoin-network-1383578440/). Furthermore, [recent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09426) has shown that an effective attack may be possible with as little as 5% of the hashing power of a PoW blockchain and a short attack on groups of nodes. 

There is understandably a large about of FUD about Ethereum taking the blockchain space in a new direction, but I think it's moves like this that give the space new life and room to grow. The blockchain space was built because Satoshi was willing to take the world in a new, uncharted direction - and imagine what we would have lost if Vitalik had just thought ""a good Ethereum should just try to solve scaling and keep everything else as close as possible to Bitcoin.""

Unfortunately what started as simple censorship has turned into a cancer within the Bitcoin community.

This sort of attitude is TOXIC to any sort of productive discussion, and it kills the sense of community and shared purpose that Bitcoiners used to have.  This attitude is present on both sides, but IMHO is much stronger on the small-block side of things.  IMHO, this is a bigger problem than any scaling-related dilemma.  

I've been involved in online communities for a great many years, and without exception I have never seen a community this close, split so fast and so hard as when the censorship started.

Updated Jan. 20, 2017 9:08 a.m. ET


The race to get a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in front of retail investors heated up Friday, when a firm run by technology entrepreneur Barry Silbert filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its Bitcoin Investment Trust on the New York Stock Exchange.

The move by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, could expand the audience for the fledgling virtual currency if the fund is approved by the SEC. It also could prove an early test for how an SEC run by a Donald Trump appointee will greet innovations that may raise investor protection or other market-structure issues.

Bitcoin Investment Trust, first launched in 2013, already trades on OTC Markets Group Inc.’s over-the-counter exchange, OTCQX. With the new filing, the trust would operate as a traditional ETF, meaning that specialized traders would create and retire shares based on demand. These traders, called “authorized participants,” are pivotal players in the ETF market and keep ETF prices aligned with the value of the assets they track.


Two Wall Street firms, KCG and Wedbush Securities, are in discussions to serve as authorized participants, according to the filing. Additionally, the fund’s trustee will be Delaware Trust Co., and the transfer agent will be Bank of New York Mellon, according to the filing.

Grayscale Investments declined to comment.

The benefits of being first on a major exchange could be big, assuming that bitcoin does manage to establish itself as a viable asset class. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF launched in Nov. 18, 2004, and has $31 billion in assets. The iShares Gold Trust ETF launched on Jan. 21, 2005, and has $7.7 billion in assets. Gold, a commodity not backed by any particular government, appeals to investors for some of the same reasons that bitcoin does.

In addition to Grayscale, two other groups are seeking SEC approval for their bitcoin ETFs. Winklevoss Capital, the firm operated by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has been trying since 2013 to get approval for their bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Investment Trust. The SEC is expected to make a decision on it by March. Additionally, another group, SolidX, is seeking SEC approval for its bitcoin ETF, which also would be listed on the NYSE.

In recent weeks, trading in bitcoin has been volatile, with prices helped by uncertainty following the 2016 votes in the U.K. and U.S. This month, concern about Chinese demand hurt bitcoin, with the price sliding to near $900 from more than $1,100.

Some have taken to using bitcoin—a virtual currency backed by algorithms rather than pledges from national governments—as a hedge against dollars, euros, yen or yuan. But it largely has remained a niche product popular with technology hobbyists and coders, partly because of cybersecurity concerns among firms who deal in bitcoin.

The goal of a bitcoin-based ETF is to offer an product that will be easier for investors to access, and will mute at least some of bitcoin’s volatility—though not all, meaning it is still a riskier investment than other ETFs. “It appears there is significant pent-up demand from the investment public for such a vehicle,” Needham analyst Spencer Bogart wrote in a research report earlier this month.


But he also added the probability of one being approved in 2017 was very low, expecting the SEC could be cautious about such a risky asset.

Initially, the trust will seek to launch with $500 million, the filing said, though the target is subject to change. As of Dec. 31, it had about 1.8 million shares outstanding. Based on a net asset value of $89.39 a share, its assets under management totaled $164.2 million.

dcpj381,naterush1997,25,"Hey! Welcome to the community - I'll try and answer all the questions I know the answer too, but hopefully other people hop in and help out where there are holes in my knowledge. 

First of all, the DAO hack was very different than the empty accounts attack. The [DAO](http://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/) was a smart contract written on top of the Ethereum blockchain by [Slock.it](https://slock.it/). It was not a part of the Ethereum protocol itself. So yes, if the code written on the blockchain has bugs in it, it is easy to attack (but this is no different than the [internet today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed)).

However, the empty accounts attack was a legitimate attack on the Ethereum protocol itself. A DOS attacker took advantage of a couple mispriced OP-codes to increase the size of the state of the Ethereum blockchain for much cheaper than they should have been able to. But these issues have since been fixed with a protocol upgrade (hard-fork).

There is no denying that Ethereum has a larger interface to the world than Bitcoin does, but I don't think that necessarily means it has a larger attack surface; IMO, Ethereum has a large surface area, but a very opaque one. I read a quote somewhere that said something to the effect of ""at some point, a DOS on the Ethereum network attack will be indistinguishable from regular transactions.""

1. I also think that many Bitcoin maximalists are critical of Ethereum for two reasons. The first is that they feel threatened by it, and the second is it breaks a lot of the rules they think should exist in the space. The threat portion of this critical attitude is something that exists with most cryptocurrencies. It existed when Ethereum was created and when Monereo was created and when Z-Cash was created - people who are heavily invested in a cryptocurrency have no motivation to support a new currency and every motivation to hate it. The second part of this criticism is that many Bitcoin maximalists feel Ethereum ""breaks the rules."" Many people have been involved with Bitcoin since the early years and maintain some level of reverence to Satoshi and Bitcoin's innovations (it's worth noting there is also some amount of dev worship present in the Ethereum community - but in this case, it does not halt innovation, IMO it helps support innovation). This mindset and reverence to the original ideas make Ethereum's new directions understandably uncomfortable to some. 

2. I would argue no. As I said before, there is a difference between having a large surface area and a large attack surface. On top of that, as illustrated by the recent hard-forks to fix the aforementioned mispriced OP-codes, Ethereum is constantly decreasing its attack surface area. As compared to Bitcoin, the Ethereum community seems to be devoted to protocol improvement (see [Casper](http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-casper-proof-stake-rewrite-rules-blockchain/)).

3. Transparency, good practices, and good communication. The key to any good cryptosystem is open-source code that follows well-defined security practices. Of course, there will probably be some more issues before the platform reaches maturity, but the community has shown it is willing to adapt and recover quickly, and I think that is the most valuable trait of any crypto-community.

&gt;Segregated witness is a new major upgrade to the system. The upgrade is a new way of spending Bitcoin, such that the signature that which signs the transaction is treated in a different way. This has a number of benefits, including:

&gt;**Large c110% onchain capacity increase** (From a user perspective this occurs almost instantly) - Bitcoin is becoming more popular and therefore fees to use the system are increasing. This is a major concern to some users. SegWit implements a large capacity increase of around c110%, it does this by increasing the amount of data in each block from c1MB to around 2.1MB. This should lower the fees one needs to spend to use Bitcoin by a considerable amount. The great thing about this is SegWit is a backward compatible change, therefore the capacity increase can occur very quickly. As soon as a user upgrades, they get the benefits of more capacity without needing to wait for other users to upgrade.

&gt;**Malleability fix** - When you send a transaction, it is possible for a malicious third party to modify it a bit, before it is included in the blockchain. This can be a massive pain for users and this bug has caused huge problems in the past (See https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2014-02-11-malleability). For example if I receive bitcoin and I want to forward it on right away, its possible for someone to change the original transaction which would break my transaction that forwards it on. This makes Bitcoin slower and harder to use. SegWit fixes malleability.

&gt;**Linear scaling of sighash operations** - As a transaction gets larger and larger, the time taken to verify the transaction rapidly increases, in a quadratic way. For example, you could say doubling the size of the transaction increases verification time by 2 squared = 4 times. This could be a problem as somebody could make a really big attack transaction, that would take so long to verify, many Bitcoin nodes could crash and be stuck. There is currently a 1MB blocksize limit in Bitcoin, many people like me are worried about increasing this as otherwise somebody could make an even bigger attack transaction. If we solve this quadratic hashing bug, this will enable us to safely have a much larger blocksize limit and increase the transaction capacity of the network.

&gt;There are also other benefits of SegWit including making hardware wallets easier to manage, making future upgrades easier and more effective management of the database of unspent transactions.

I just detailed the concerns with a dynamic or unlimited blocksize. Whether you agreed with those concerns or not, I know many people do. Therefore the hardfork would be contentious. So do a contentious hardfork that risks centralization and market price catastrophe? Hard pass.

The whole ""central dictators Core/blockstream trying to control bitcoins advancement!"" Narrative is so whack. It's a narrative that was fabricated from them simply not wanting to perform a contentious hardfork that would do nothing but kick a can down the road. Then of course ""not doing what we want when we want!"" was twisted into ""they are evil dictators trying to control the development for their own financial gain!"" Perhaps the funnies part of this being that the whole argument falls apart when you realize blockstream is already loaded with money and stands nothing to gain financially from off-chain scaling solutions, with the exception of perhaps being very knowledgeable about them and therefore being the top choice for consulting on such solutions. But once you realize all their code is open source, and LN is open source, it's impossible to put together how dictating Segwit over a blocksize increase actually makes them more money. Well... one way it makes them more money is that they all likely hold bitcoins, and anyone who thinks a contentious hardfork wouldn't hurt the price drastically, at least in the short term, is off their meds. So yeah maybe their one financial incentive is the market price of bitcoin. Doesn't seem so bad to me. Also seeing as the market price is crucial to achieving more adoption (merchants need to eventually feel comfortable holding), concern over market price is literally concern over bitcoin adoption.

This whole adoption process is showing that in fact they are doing the opposite of dictating. Seeking 95% approval on something before it would take effect is the opposite of dictating. 

Weird that you have these views but also expect a bitcoin bubble on the horizon. Do you expect hardfork and then bubble? Do you expect a bubble regardless of any scaling progress?

dcqkov0,thisusernamelovesyou,91,"Fuming with anger, Roger logged onto Tor and began spamming his contact. ""Hey"", he typed at an impossibly fast speed, ""I need you to get someone's info for me *right now*. The guy's name is Theymos, and I'm sending you his IP address. Get me everything you can -- full name, address, favourite ice cream flavour, everything. This is urgent.""

He sat back in his seat, his heart pounding heavily in his chest. Bitcoin was meant to be free, and was to be associated with a free market: why the hell was someone trying to regulate each and every aspect of it so heavily? Such censorship would be detrimental to the ecosystem, and he would *not* let it happen - not on his watch. Roger checked the price ticker on /r/bitcoinmarkets -- yep, the price had gone up another 5%. Just another day. 

The sharp, ringing notification sound startled him. He quickly opened Tor, and sure enough, he had a response. Roger smiled. This information was gold -- time to post it on Reddit and completely ruin Theymos.

**1 week later**

The night was dark, starless and silent. Donned in black clothing and a ski mask, Roger thought back on the events of the past few days. He, the great MemoryDealers, had been banned on Reddit - how? All he had done was post the name and address of that wretch Theymos... That horrible, SegWit loving small-blocker. Now, it was time for him to pay.  He'd already gotten Theymos's address, and now here he was, right under his apartment block. Roger grinned - it was a smile of pure evil; he hadn't smiled like this since BU support hit an all time high.

Roger unzipped his dark grey back with a satisfying *zip* and pulled out his beloved grappling hook gun. He aimed it at the window of the fifth floor - where Theymos would undoubtedly be sleeping. He pushed hard on the trigger, and with a loud *click* the hook went flying through the air right into Theymos's window, latching itself onto the window ledge with a satisfying *clang*. He tugged on the rope - yep, it was taut and would hold his weight. With a grunt, he grabbed onto the rope and began pulling himself upwards.

His feet softly thudded onto the floor of Theymos's carpeted bedroom. He could vaguely make out its shape in the darkness - it was a gigantic room with a beautiful five monitor setup and a TV opposite the large bed. Roger stepped closer to the bed where he saw a figure sleeping. The man in the bed's chest rose and fell softly with his breathing, and Roger's heartbeat began getting faster and faster. It was time.

He took off the hook attachment from the gun and put the magazine in. Six deadly bullets - but only one would be necessary. Roger went closer to the man, who's face was still shrouded in darkness. Closer and closer and closer, and soon Roger was inches away from his face. He could see him properly now, and Roger stopped dead in his tracks.

The man was *gorgeous*. He was, by far, the most beautiful man he had ever seen. Sharp, high cheekbones, gorgeous blonde hair, long eyelashes and pale skin. Roger felt a rush of blood go to his cheeks, and he dropped his gun with surprise with a loud thud. The man's eyes suddenly flew open: magnificent electric blue eyes. In astonishment, he rolled off the bed and fell right on top of Roger with a groan. Roger scrambled to get up, and the man pushed himself up with his muscular arms. ""What the fuck?"" he screamed, ""what the actual fuck?"" Hastily, he flicked on the light switch.

Before Roger stood the hottest man he had ever seen in his entire life. He was tall, and shirtless, with chiseled abs. Annoyance was evident on his handsome face. ""Who the everloving fuck are - oh!"" he exclaimed, as realisation dawned upon him. ""You're Roger Ver! What the hell are you doing here?""

Roger stood, dumbstruck. His mind was blank. He had no idea what to say, or do, but there was one thing he knew for sure: he was in love.

""Well?"" Theymos said, ""what the fuck, Roger? What do you want?""

""Theymos, I... I wanted to talk to you about activating SegWit.""

""What? I thought you hated safe transaction capacity increases.""

""I've changed my mind. I'll switch all of my miners over to signal for SegWit activation.""

""I'm so confused, what the fuck?""

""But, I have one condition.""

""Which is?""

""You have to kiss me, right here, right now.""

""..."" 

A myriad of expressions ran across Theymos's face. Surprise, distress, confusion, anger. And then, he did the unexpected. He walked up to Roger, grabbed him by the waist and kissed him passionately. They kissed for a few seconds, and Theymos broke away. ""Roger, I've always had a crush on you. I've always sort of wanted this to happen.""

""Shh, don't ruin the moment."" Roger placed a finger on Theymos's lips and began kissing him again. He slowly slid his hand into Theymos's pants, and then slipped off his boxers.

**1 month later**

*Roger and Theymos are now married and are expecting a baby girl. The price of bitcoin is $4,500. SegWit has been activated and Core plans to increase the blocksize within the next 6 months.*

Once this piece is in place all the issues with potential backlogs and unpredictable fees go away and proper, focussed work can resume on taking things further. Bitcoin is still very early days why are we rushing to support 2nd layer solutions that are still maturing at the expense of real users on the main chain and real businesses wishing to innovate upon it right now?""

If we go with Segwit we are still stuck with a magic number limit and we will outgrow the increased capacity that Segwit potentially offers (once broad adoption could occur).  Then we are once again supplicants to core for some other capacity increase - and I can see that it would be even harder to get an increase once Segwit is in place. 

Bitcoin was meant to be a self adjusting system - with miners constrained by the bounds of their self interest.  It should not be deliberately constrained by a few people who don't necessarily have serious skin in the game (indeed, may have investment in other areas - sidechains etc).

dcpxyrn,vintermann,19,"No, there are other ways. Some bitcoin person said there were three ways to prevent sybil attacks (which is a pretty way of saying ""flood of accounts"" attack): Costs of entering the network, cost of staying in the network, and cost of leaving the network.

The cost of entering the network can be high in the way you suggest, by providing a hard-to-forge identity. But it can also be high in the form of payment, for instance. Or proof of work, as they use in blockchains.

Cost of staying in the network: For social networks, this can be aggressive kicking of inactive accounts + accounts that don't behave like humans. 

The latter is not necessarily as impossible as it might seem. Most Twitter/Facebook/Google plus bots are dead simple to recognize. Try searching on twitter for @SpotifyCares, for instance. You'll find the official Spotify support account. You'll also find a small herd of bots who say _exactly what the support account says_, with mentions removed. My guess is that they're a bot army who try ""saying the sort of stuff other accounts say"" by literally copying them. It sticks out like a sore thumb when they're attached to a support account.

On Google Plus, I found a network of bots who mostly share pretty images. They don't post spam. They exchange pleasantries, it looks kinda-sorta human, until you watch them for a while and see that they're exchanging the same pleasantries over and over again, and that they share pretty pictures around the clock, month after month, year after year. My guess is they try to trick real people into following them, so that they in turn can follow (and grant google juice to) spam accounts.

Point is, this can be detected and aggressively pursued. It's just a question of explaining it to people, once the spammers inevitably complain and claim legitimate accounts were removed. The spammers can fight back, but it's going to cost them: high maintenance costs, reducing the effectivity of sybil attacks.

dcq7vgp,ydtm,19,"Although everyone knows u/the_bob is a troll with nothing important to say, I will take this opportunity to provide some background and analysis:

(1) I've been thinking long and hard about how to make this OP.

I was noticing people saying ""Hey SegWit gives you 1.7MB"" - which is really pathetic, in terms of sheer numbers.

Even Adam Back's proposal offered 2-4-8 MB. So SegWit is already one of the shittiest proposed capacity increases of the whole past few years. In terms of actual capacity - it's pathetic.

(2) But wait it gets worse!

There is another vital aspect to this debate: the ""framing"".

Some people are trying to ""frame"" the debate as ""1MB blocks (now) vs 1.7MB blocks (with SegWit).""

**This is the wrong framing.**

Instead the debate is actually:

- **Centrally controlled blocksize** (with a pathetic 1.7MB), bundled into a messy spaghetti code soft-fork - that's the SegWit poison pill.

   - LOL that's the best Blockstream can do - because they get fiat money from bankers, and they debate their proposals on censored forums. **So they've gradually drifted out-of-touch with Bitcoin.** They no longer know what real Bitcoin users want - because they condone censorship, and they get paid by central bankers.

**versus**

- **Market-controlled blocksize** (providing any size blocks we need, now and in the future - with no need to do any more hard forks or soft forks to get them)

   - This is what Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic is offering - a serious, long-term, market-based decentralized blocksize solution providing any blocksize which the Bitcoin market decides it wants, now and long into the future - not a pathetic one-time bump to 1.7MB via some shitty soft fork so we can keep having these debates for the next decade while Blockstream continues to fuck up our code.

**And _this_ is the kind of argument which loser trolls like u/the_bob simply cannot answer.**

- Bitcoin Unlimited / Bitcoin Classic **let the miners and the market keep controlling the blocksize** - like they have successfully done for the past 8 years (and FlexTrans can also easily to everything that SegWit does - and more - using a much cleaner and safer hard fork).

- **Core / Blockstream are trying to centrally control the blocksize** - and offering some weird number 1.7MB which they evidently pulled out of their ass (plus all that weird 1 versus 4 weighting / accounting hanky-panky which nobody understands) - bundled into a messy spaghett-code soft-fork which creates ""technical debt"" (and gives Blockstream devs more ""job security"").

So this is the real question in this debate. 

**The debate is not about 1 MB vs 1.7MB** - which is already a sad and pathetic choice just in terms of how tiny 1.7MB is - remember Adam Back's 2-4-8MB? Have we sunk this low??

**The debate is actually about WHO SHOULD CONTROL THE BLOCKSIZE?** Shitstream - or the market?

_That_ is a better explanation of why this post is zooming up so fast - because this is a really, really important point about ""framing"". 

And that is also why the loser troll u/the_bob is terrified to actually address the argument in the OP - because he knows he has no counter-argument. So instead he cries like a sad pathetic little small blocker ""Waah waah a popular OP is popular it must be vote manipulation!!1!!"" LOL

But the reality is: the market ~~wants bigger blocks~~ wants to decide on its own fucking blocksize.

Don't let the trolls [frame](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lakoff+frame+elephant&amp;t=hs) the debate. 

- **The debate isn't about 1 MB blocks (current) vs 1.7MB block (SegWit).**

- **The debate is about centrally-controlled blocksize (Blockstream/SegWit) versus market-controlled blocksize (Unlimited/Classic).**

dcq2jvi,redditor4oneminute,19,"I responded to someone yesterday in regards to this and I think you should take a look at what I said as well:

&gt;Let me preface my response with the fact that I don't expect you to change your mind.

&gt;Whatever you think Bitcoin is, forget it.

&gt;My grandma isn't going to be using multisignature solutions, but that's like saying my grandma isn't going to be using SMTP.

&gt;When she emails me on her iPod Touch from her GMail account, she's using it, but she's not hosting her own webserver and telling people to send email to her IP address or telling people to telnet to her server so they can chat it up all night about the weather down in Florida.

&gt;My younger sister won't be doing this either.

&gt;Bitcoin has some great properties but it's not this magic F.U. to authority with the words FREEDOM painted on the side.

&gt;All it does (to say the least) is allow people who want to be *free* the choice to do so without removing them from the system society builds for people who want things to be *easy*.

&gt;You're *free* to go hunt for your own food and live off the land all you want, but if you want *easy* food and *easy* shelter, you're gonna end up paying taxes on it. You also can't just find a McDonalds BigMac out in the woods, you're going to have to walk inside a McDonalds. Which is probably alongside a road that was built by the goverment that people travel on with vehicles regulated by the goverment to prevent (arguably) death and other unsafe conditions.

&gt;You can agree with the systems in place, or completely and utterly detest them. Chances are if you choose the latter and apply it 100% you won't be able to mingle well with society at all.

&gt;Here's the catch to all of this, Bitcoin, from a monetary perspective, allows this. That's what this thing is.

&gt;You might not like that, you might think everyone should work off of private keys. Like I said, I never expected to change your mind.

&gt;This doesn't change the fact that you need these people and these systems for Bitcoin to become viable. You won't get mass adoption without it because most people just want things to be easy.

&gt;The beauty is that Bitcoin allows both mindsets to coexist.",2017-01-22 04:40:33

This comment from u/brg444 reeks of desperation. I knew this OP zoomed up for a reason - and it's showing. u/brg444 is bloodied. He is lying worse than he usually does.

He tries to direct his closer at me - but actually, the only person it describes is himself - to a tee:

&gt; I know your reality distortion field is well tuned but unfortunately for your its returns are diminishing because you can only manipulate truth so long until you get left behind on the wrong side of history. 

The only people who are suffering ""diminishing returns"" and ""manipulating the truth"" are Core / Blockstream / r\bitcoin and ui/brg444 - as more and more people are abandoning Core / Blockstream's **centrally-controlled blocksize**, and adopting Unlimited / Classic's **market-controlled blocksize** - as reflected in the recent network statistics, which show Unlimited / Classic growing ([on some recent days they've been as high as 25% of the network](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5o7mnx/in_the_last_24_hours_unlimited_classic_hashrate/)), and Core / Blockstream declining ([with several recent all-time lows in number of blocks mined](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=ATL&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=month)).

Lies and censorship and fiat. That's all that Core / Blockstream / r\bitcoin and u/brg444 have going for them.

And even with all their censorship and $76 million from AXA, they just lost 25% of the network to code that offers **market-controlled blocksize** instead of their shitty **dev-controlled blocksize.** Imagine that.

Dude, you're getting paid to post here - and I'm not. And ironically, that is exactly why you're losing.

Just let that sink in.

dcqrc2p,Capt_Roger_Murdock,17,"If Bitcoin Unlimited hands control to the miners, where do you think that control currently resides? But you're wrong. Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't give the miners any power they don't already possess.  It merely lowers an (in any case, unsustainable) ""inconvenience barrier"" to exercising that power. [My favorite summary of this point:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/558ef0/call_for_proposals_bitcoin_unlimited_is_making/d896dlw/)

&gt;BU is exactly the same situation as now, it's just that some friction is taken away by making the parameters configurable instead of requiring a recompile and the social illusion that devs are gatekeepers to these parameters. All the same negotiation and consensus-dialogue would have to happen under BU in order to come to standards about appropriate parameters (and it could even be a dynamic scheme simply by agreeing to limits set as a function of height or timestamp through reading data from RPC and scripting the CLI). Literally the only difference BU introduces is that it removes the illusion that devs should have power over this, and thus removes friction from actually coming to some kind of consensus among miners and node operators.

With respect to your claim that:

&gt;Miners may have short term economic incentives that do not align with Bitcoins best long term interests.

No, I don't think that's correct. As I've written before:

&gt;Bitcoin's security model is generally understood to be premised on the assumption that a majority of the hash power is ""honest."" (From the whitepaper: ""we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change **if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.**"") More generally, it's premised on the assumption that a majority of the hash power will recognize their interest in preserving the health of the system.  (From the whitepaper: ""**They vote with their CPU power**, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**"") Of course *ultimately* we rely on investors / ""the market"" to protect the integrity of the system. (Miners are *one type* of investor and they act as a first-line proxy for all investors as a class.) If a majority of miners act improvidently in a way that significantly depresses the value of the Bitcoin network, investors can respond by buying up hash power (at now-artificially-depressed prices) and righting the ship that way, or by choosing to value a fork (if necessary, a PoW-changing fork) that avoids the errors made by the foolish miners. Bitcoin's security model is certainly *not* premised on the notion that miners will or should blindly run the software that's uploaded to a particular repository -- or blindly trust the attempted economic parameter setting of one particular group of volunteer C++ programmers.

Also, I highly recommend reading [this great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5hre90/cores_miner_envy_and_bitcoins_adolescence/) by /u/ForkiusMaximus that explains miners' role as stewards of the network.",2017-01-22 14:16:04

Find this man. Google his name, stalk his social media, befriend his aquantiences. Find out where he lives. Scout his home for a week or two from a safe distance finding out when he is there, when he leaves arrives ect. When he sleeps. 
After that is the easy part. Youre gunna need a trenchcoat to hide your suppressed ar15 w flak jacket, skimask and gloves. You won't need to use the AR but worst case scenario you need to be more well armed than anyone who might arrive during your visit. 

Wait till noone is home. Climb in through a window that you slowly remove if necessary to avoid making noise. Then help yourself to anything in the house. Drug dealers are generally lavish spenders so finding good loot shouldn't be a problem. 
Toss all the loot in two large Walmart plastic bins. Be out in 15minutes. Carry bins to car. Bounce. 

Anyone catches you, two in the head, move across country, never return.

dcsmm44,jtoomim,35,"I think Peter R was trying to make a distinction between a central property (in the sense of an essential, sine qua non property) and a property that people care about. 

The 21 million coin limit is not a technically unchangeable feature of Bitcoin. It's just a couple of constants in the code that keeps it what it is. As such, I would not consider the fixed money supply to be a central property of the Bitcoin technology. The PoW system is much more of a central property of Bitcoin. Even the Script processing language is more central to Bitcoin than the 21 million coin limit. 

On the other hand, the 21 million coin limit can be construed as a central property of the social contract that Bitcoin investors and users bought into. People made their decisions to buy or mine Bitcoin based on the fraction of the total currency which they expected to receive. Changing the limit but retaining the current issuance system changes that fraction post-hoc. This would be a violation of trust, and would piss everyone off. Therefore, it won't let it happen.

Most users of Bitcoin don't really care about the Script processing language. They just use it to send money from address A to address B, and aren't concerned with things like multisig, time-locked transactions, and Coinjoins. Even though Script is a central property to how Bitcoin works, it doesn't matter to most people. On the other hand, the 21M limit is a peripheral property of Bitcoin--it's just a couple code constants based on arbitrary decisions that Satoshi made--but it matters a lot to every Bitcoin user.

The fixed coin supply in Bitcoin has always been a valid topic of debate, and it has always been something for which around 90% of people have the same opinion. Because sentiment is overwhelmingly in favor of keeping it fixed, it will remain fixed.",2017-01-23 22:38:43

In early 2013, Bitcoin was very strongly associated with the Silk Road, and many believed that this one darknet market was what made bitcoin valuable. After Silk Road went down and it became obvious that Bitcoin was more than just that one thing, it quickly gained a lot of legitimacy, which culminated in the famous Canadian Senate hearing with Andreas Antonopoulos. 

Now we're seeing something very similar play out. Bitcoin, and especially the price of bitcoin, has been very strongly associated with what happens in China and on Chinese exchanges. Suspicions of fake volume and price manipulation are usually accepted as at least a plausible explanation for what the price does.

* 1) it has allowed weak hands to exit rebalancing who holds the currency

* 2) it has caught out lots of people who sold ETH for BTC/USD and now are unsure whether to reenter

* 3) it has allowed people like myself to increase exposure to ethereum at a 3 year BTC high and 1 year ethereum low

There is indisputably a lot of bullish price events coming down the line this year - predicting the price is a foolish venture, but the price staying flat or breaching $100 wouldn't surprise me. Development continues. Innumerable DAPPs are in progress. Major bitcoin players like Fred Ehrsam are starting ethereum startups. A Bitcoiner from 2010 like Charlie Shrem is saying negative things about ethereum in public but is using ethereum for his next venture nonetheless. PoS is in development and the scaling roadmap is extremely ambitious. Countless private chains are developing on ethereum - every platform that does adds developer support to the ethereum ecosystem and means the public blockchain will benefit in the longer run. The meme that ethereum is mutable due to the DAO fork is fading with every day that passes.

The price could drift lower before a major rise. But buying support in the 9$ and 0.011 range has been staunch. As soon as a timeline for Casper is announced I think we will see some significant upwards price volatility with pre-PoS positions being allocated by very major players. As Casper approaches (three months away) I suspect that much like the recent Halving the price will reset upwards and then ethereum will undergo a full blown rally after the hard fork due to the little discussed change in behaviour amongst holders (PoS encourages hoarding, mining encourages selling..).

Trading is fun but ethereum at 10$ will look like a steal if it manages just a speculative rally based upon the above. If ethereum actually begins to find mainstream penetration with a DAPP (gambling like decentralised poker, gaming or a bank or something) or through direct investment (250k new coinbase users a month) then watch out above as it could really go on a tear that will hark back to the dizzy heights of 2013.

dcsv08l,Peter__R,63,"As I typed that last night while visiting Core Slack, I pondered the inevitability of that quote ending up on Reddit and being used to discredit Bitcoin Unlimited: ""ZOMG if people can change the block size limit then the inflation schedule will certainly be next!!!1""  I typed it anyways because that sort of FUD no longer works.  People understand that [Bitcoin is a creature controlled by the market of people holding Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@Mengerian/the-market-for-consensus-203de92ed844#.iuzbhcx4y).  And the market of people holding Bitcoin want what's best for Bitcoin.

A bit of background: 

I came to Bitcoin from the ""hard money / gold"" side of the Internet--you could say I was a ""gold bug.""  I believed that the government's ability to create new money out of thin air negatively distorted the economy, served as a stealth tax, and facilitated world war and unbound governmental growth (I still believe that today). 

As a new bitcoiner, I was obviously very concerned when I learned that the ""21 million coin limit"" was not really a limit at all: it could be changed just by making changes to the code!  It seemed inevitable that inflation in Bitcoin would one day spiral out of control: if extra coins _could_ be created by only changing the software then certainly they _would_ be created that way, or so I thought.

Eventually I came to understand why it doesn't matter that Bitcoin's inflation rate could possibly be changed: Bitcoin is and will always be what the market of people holding Bitcoin wants it to be.  And why would the market of people holding Bitcoin ever want inflation to spiral out of control?
 
Right now as I type this Bitcoin has 16,120,850 coins.  My node will permit miners to award themselves up to 12.5 new BTC each block they find for another 180,332 blocks, followed by another 6.25 BTC for the next 210,000 blocks, etc.  If we do the math on this pattern, it works out that my node (unless my grandkids make changes :) ) will permit just shy of 21 million coins sometime next century.  Your node is likely enforcing the same rules today.  And so is nearly everyone else's node.  This is what makes Bitcoin's inflation rate secure: the only way the inflation rate will spiral out of control is if we (node operators, miners, exchanges, etc.) all decide to change the rules in our nodes to permit too many coins to be mined.  _But why the heck would we do that?_

So back to the topic of Bitcoin's central properties.  What are they?  In my opinion, they are the properties that make Bitcoin money: Alice shouldn’t be able to create bitcoins out of thin air, Bob shouldn’t be able to spend the same bitcoin twice, and Carol shouldn’t be able to freely spend bitcoins that belong to Alice or Bob.  Or, as Satoshi Nakamoto put it:

&gt; The steps to run the network are:
1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash

I'll end this post by saying that Bitcoin Unlimited will not be adding an option to allow its users to adjust their node's inflation rate.  But not because doing so would be _dangerous_.  We're not adding this option because there is no demand from users to have such a feature.  If you understand Bitcoin you'll understand that the inflation rate would not be threatened even if we did.

Bitcoin is not controlled by the developers.  

**Bitcoin is controlled by YOU.**

The accusation of ""network spam"" seems unlikely to me. The link you give shows a steady stream of plausible transactions. But maybe we have an attacker that's trying really hard to be sneaky about it? Probably not.

My boring theory here is that congestion on the mempool is simply a function of the blocks being full, or at least they'd be full were it not for some peculiar miner policies.

So this is another round of the ""Replace By Fee"" dance. There aren't enough chairs for everyone to sit down at the end of the dance, so a good chunk of those transactions will eventually simply fall off the mempool.

Folks have predicted this would happen for years, along with a simple fix that'd buy us time to do something better for the long run, and they've consistently been told to shove it.

So we have been put in a position where we are out of time. Whatever is being pushed down our throats must now be adopted as-is, or bitcoin will slowly rot.

Fee Market is a misnomer.  It is a block space auction with tightly limited supply - that simply cannot adjust to rising demands. In most markets (free markets) rising demand creates rising prices which incentivizes increased supply.  Without the ability to increase supply in response to demand prices become unpredictable and increase to the point where a lesser good is purchased (eg an alt coin, or a visa/pay pal transaction).  I feel that Greg has shown a couple of times in replies to me that he does not have any basic understanding of the effects of inelastic supply.

https://twitter.com/cnLedger/status/823451402357784576

Here's a quick summary of the show, too long to do subtitles:

**Introduction**

- Main theme is, what is currency exactly?
- History of money, from sea shells through metals to paper money (for easy taxation) to digital currency. Each step represents progress in civilisation;
- The most recent step forward is ""virtual currency"", such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin.

**Economist Xuanfeng Lang**

- Given the 123% YoY price rise, and recent investigations of exchanges, he'll look at the pros and cons of Bitcoin; 
-  Price growth is explosive, compares it on YoY terms with gold, CNY, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen second hand real estate (13.5%), but that doesn't mean people should go invest;
- 50% of the first 13m coins are held by 950 people, 80% of all coins are held by early investors. Early investors buy high volumes at low prices, late investors buy low volumes at high prices - this makes it a Ponzi scheme;
- To attract new entrants: 24h trading creates inflated trading volumes. Higher search engine results lead to higher prices, showing how rumours lead to price spikes. Marketing mBTC units gives the impression of holding more.
- Shows risks with the pump and dump of Quarkcoin, Zetacoin, Litecoin. Greater fool analogy. Recommends not investing.

**CUFE Professor Wang Fuzhong**

- First and foremost Bitcoin is an investment asset that has always increased in value, and it's a currency of genuine significance.
- Currency is what people accept as value, it doesn't require government backing, which is a relatively new concept. People trust Bitcoin's math and tech. It's proved it's utility in cross-border transactions.
- He's asked how can the number of coins be controlled, and what makes Bitcoin different. Describes founding principles as distributed memory, cryptography and consensus, which together make it extremely secure - never been hacked.
- The reason central banks everywhere are researching cryptocurrency is a presents a huge challenge for them.
- Bitcoin isn't anonymous, every transaction can be traced.
- Governments are unable to shut down Bitcoin. The only thing under investigation is the exchange network.

That's enough, I hope, to show that it was a fairly balanced debate and the discussion was open and informed.

**Ransomware app hosted in Google Play infects unsuspecting Android user**

""ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS!"" malicious app warned.

^(by Dan Goodin - Jan 24, 2017 1:29pm PST)

**G**oogle Play, the official market for Android apps, was caught hosting a ransomware app that infected at least one real-world handset, security researchers said Tuesday.

The ransomware was dubbed *Charger* and was hidden inside an app called EnergyRescue, according to a blog post published by security firm Check Point Software. Once installed, Charger stole SMS contacts and prompted unsuspecting users to grant it all-powerful administrator rights. If users clicked OK, the malicious app locked the device and displayed the following message:

&gt;You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes. WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc… We collect and download all of your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. We collect all data about your friends and family.

The app sought 0.2 Bitcoin, currently worth about $180. In an e-mail, Check Point researchers said the app was available in Google Play for four days and had only a ""handful"" of downloads. ""We believe the attackers only wanted to test the waters and not spread it yet,"" the researchers told Ars. The infection was detected by Check Point's mobile malware software, which the company sells to businesses. Google officials have since removed the app and have thanked Check Point for raising awareness of the issue.

An analysis showed that Charger checked the local settings of an infected device and wouldn't execute the app's malicious payload if the device was located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus. The behavior was likely an attempt to prevent the developers from facing legal actions in those countries. In the blog post, Check Point researchers added:

Most malware found on Google Play contains only a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device. Charger, however, uses a heavy packing approach which [makes] it harder for the malware to stay hidden, so it must compensate with other means. The developers of Charger gave it everything they had to boost its evasion capabilities and so it could stay hidden on Google Play for as long as possible.

The malware uses several advanced techniques to hide its real intentions and makes it harder to detect.

It encodes strings into binary arrays, making it hard to inspect them.

It loads code from encrypted resources dynamically, which most detection engines cannot penetrate and inspect. The dynamically-loaded code is also flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through.

It checks whether it is being run in an emulator before it starts its malicious activity. PC malware first introduced this technique which is becoming a trend in mobile malware having been adopted by several malware families including Dendroid.

In 2012, Google unveiled a cloud-based scanner dubbed bouncer that was billed as a way for the company to detect malicious apps before they were made available in Play. Five years later, discovery of malicious apps like Charger are a regular occurrence. Google makes little reference to the tool these days.

The incident is the latest to underscore the risks posed by apps hosted on Google servers. On Monday, Check Point documented the return of the virulent family of Android malware known as HummingBad, which managed to get from 2 million to 12 million downloads from the marketplace before the 20 affected apps were detected and removed

dcugloq,Merlin560,39,"Point and Figure Chart


Today’s chart shows that we reversed into a column of Os as a result of the fall in price to $890.

Here is why I see this as neutral to good news.  A bounce off $890 or even $880 will mean that we still remain in the short term up trend.  A breakdown here (below $880) would not have a ton of support under it.  But after the past couple of days of relatively calm trading I think we are consolidating nicely.

The reason I think this is good is that if we can bounce up and down around this rage it will build a nice level of support.  Then when we finally move up, it will be in a formation that is pretty big.  Looking back over the years the widest formation I’ve ever seen was 12 columns.  Its that kind of stability that some people want to see in the price before they jump in.  WE think the pops and drops are fun ways to make money.  Over the long term that does more harm than good.

Here are the numbers we need to look at for the coming days:

The negative breakdown is at any price below $880 (6034CYN) on Coinbase.  We reverse upwards with a price (tomorrow) at $920 (6308CYN).  A breakout occurs at a price over $950 (6514 CYN.)

As you can see, the market is still working with Yuan as a base.  The “important” price points are clearly around “round” yuan numbers of 6,000, 6300, and 6500.

As I wrote the other day, the changes in China are going to affect the market.  We’ve already seen significant changes in volume as people unwind their positions.  

The next few days are going to be very important.  While the paradigm of Bitcoin and the Blockchain haven’t changed, the paradigm of Chinese volume dominance is in a state of flux right now.

The benefit to the longs is that when the liquidity runs out, the price will go up.  I suspect we will see that in a few days.

dcv4ur7,nullc,36,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_(mathematics)

A witness is a concrete example for an existential claim.

Say you stand up and say, ""My security is protected by the mathematical formula  n^2 != 49"" 

I reply, ""no way man, you're insecure, there exists an integer n such that n^2 == 49"".

You then say ""I don't believe you, prove it!""

Now-- I could prove it to you in several different ways, e.g. with some convoluted proof that 49 is a square number-- but in this case, the easiest way is to just provide a witness:

""Try 7"".

As such, a digital signature is often called a witness-- because it's the concrete value the satisfies an equality equation for the signature verifier. (In particular for things like EC signatures, the existential claim being proven is trivially true-- a signature for any message,pubkey pair is always possible, but only parties that know the private key can efficiently find a witness (assuming the crypto is secure)).

Sometimes there are many possible witnesses, and they're all equally good at proving the claim. e.g. -7 would also work above.

The notion applies recursively, a block is saying ""I moved all these coins from here to there, and there exists signatures authorizing these moves.""  The signatures aren't all that important except for the purpose of proving the validity of the move... once you know its valid you don't needed to worry about them anymore. They are a witness to the validity of the block. 

Originally in Bitcoin the witness part of a transaction were covered by the hash used to create a transaction ID. This has multiple downsides.. for example if a lite client want to verify a transaction is in the chain it has to check the TXID, but it can't validate the signatures (because its a lite client it doesn't have the scriptpubkeys) ... it cant use the witness data, but you still have to give it to it because it can't check the TXID without it.  Another is that property of there being multiple equally good witnesses means that troublemakers can change one witness in your transaction for another, the transaction is still valid but the ID changed, which means that any subsequent spends of those coins (which are referred to by txid) are invalidated when the second transaction confirms instead of the first.  So what segwit does is leaves the witness data outside of the TXID calculations.  Blocks still contain a hash of the witnesses because its important to know for historical reasons which specific witnesses were used (and also to prevent a number of DOS attacks).

If Coinbase gets hacked, or the government seizes their property, they will be unable to hand over your coins. Users of their other ""Wallet"" product have made the decision that they would rather Coinbase hold their funds - they see Coinbase as better than holding the coins themselves. This is a free choice, not everyone will have the technological means to securely hold their own.

2) Coinbase is not just a bitcoin wallet. They integrate with the legacy banking system, which forces them to adhere to onerous regulations tracking users and with the possibility of seizing the funds they control. If they didn't adhere to these they would go to prison and Coinbase would not exist. Without Coinbase and other companies integrating with the legacy banking system, it is very difficult to onboard customers to bitcoin.

3) Coinbase is open about the rules they follow, they are not pulling the wool over your eyes. You can take out small cash deposits from the ATM, meet up in person through Mycelium, tumble your coins through Shapeshift to Monero then to Bitcoin if you want privacy.

Say we take the current block reward of 12.5BTC. What would that look like in fees? Well, at $900 per coin, that's $11250 per block. Say we're making all simple 1-input 2-output transactions--we'll fit about 4000 of these in a block. $11250 / 4000 nets us $2.81 for a basic transaction to achieve the same amount in fees that we currently get from the block subsidy. You can adjust these numbers to find a number of things. Like, say you want to make 5 cent transactions yet still pay the same total subsidy--this would require **56.25MB** blocks.

What's the point of this? I guess it's to say that using Bitcoin is *expensive*. If we want Bitcoin to stay at least as secure as it is now as the mining subsidy decreases, then transaction fees are going to go up, or the costs on nodes are going to go up (probably a combination of both).

We should ask the question how do we make SegWit more attractive to miners? Notice the difference? 

I believe SegWit is in aggregate neutral to miner revenue. At best it will relieve congestion and fees will go down in the short term. If the blocks become full again (the 1MB part most likely will sooner rather than later) which with rough estimates means double the volume has come online, they will probably be looking at fee revenue that is roughly equivalent to what we have now just spread over twice as many transactions.

I believe SegWit would be a positive thing for the ecosystem but what is not clear is if it will be a positive thing for miners. 

Will they ever make more revenue with SegWit and no other blocksize increase? A blocksize increase beyond SegWit is dubious. There is no trust that such a thing would gain support once SegWit is enabled. 

It's quite simple to me. Make it obvious that SegWit is a revenue positive change. Increase the blocksize along with it. Reduce the risk that comes with very complex soft fork gymnastics. 

Hard Forks are not that scary. The time we've spent preparing SW SegWit and arguing about it was plenty of time to line up and perform a hard fork safely.

dd0jlzq,JezSan,45,"Your assumptions are all the wrong way around.  You say mining inflates the price?  you say more miners will drive the price up?  

it'd help if you could appreciate the economics of mining a little better.

Miner's have to buy hardware.  this is paid in fiat, on the whole.  especially when asics are involved.

Miners have to buy hosting.  or build data centres.   these are paid in fiat.

miners have to buy electricity.  lots of it.  electricity is paid in fiat.

now, once you can appreciate that almost all of the costs of miners are paid in fiat, yet all of their revenue is received in crypto (ETC, ETH, Bitcoin, for instance)... this means they have to sell most of the coins they've mined, just to pay for their hosting, their electricity, and their systems costs.   this is constant selling pressure.   miners can't afford to hoard much.  sure, they have profits they might retain, but its not always profitable.  dips in the coin price cause them to dip into their reserves (and sell them).

sure, they provide constant liquidity which can be useful at times but miners don't drive prices up on the whole.. their constant selling pressure drives prices down.  its simple market forces.. supply and demand..  if there are constant sellers, the price has resistance to rising.   Look what happens every time bitcoin has a halving and less bitcoins are mined.   Less mining isnt just less inflation.  Its also less selling pressure, which helps keep the price stable, or allow it to rise.

next, you fail to appreciate whats wrong with Proof of Work.

take a look at the granddaddy of PoW.  Bitcoin.

Do you think the Proof of Work in Bitcoin is working?

When mining was a cottage industry and well spread out, and most users were also mining, it was great for bitcoin.  it was empowering, and it was everyone being a miner as well as a user.  truly decentralised.

Whats happened in the last couple of years is that the incentives of mining are broken.   Miners should not be the only people who have a say in what software is run by the network.   All nodes - all users - all businesses - all stakeholders in the ecosystem - should have an equal say.   Yet in bitcoin the miners have taken over.  the developers of software have no say in what software is being run and the miners, now centralised and run by mostly one man (Jihan Wu), are deciding what software upgrades everyone else is allowed to use - or they wont mine blocks.   Instead of the Miners working for the network and being rewarded for it, the miners have taken over and the network now works for the miners.   This wasn't the intention, and its gone wrong for a few fundamentally broken reasons.

1.  Miner's main cost is electricity, which is unequally distributed around the world and sold at different prices.   People who live in the right place and have access to electricity at low prices have an advantage over people that don't.  You can see this has now happened everywhere.  most people in the world can no longer afford to mine (profitably) because they live in places where they can't afford to pay the electrical cost compared to the people in cheap places  - who can afford to do it at an industrial scale, and they do.   Is this decentralisation!???

2.  the skill to create systems at the right price/performance is a difficult problem, and in bitcoin's case, the skill to design mining asics is very specialised.  not everyone can build mining systems that are cost effective.  in fact in bitcoin, we are down to only two companies.  bitmain, and bitfury.  and bitmain is winning by a huge margin (they own or control or supply more than 50%!).   and no one else is competing in this marketplace.   Is this decentralisation!??

3.  Capital requirement.   In Bitcoin, it costs tens of millions of dollars to design and prototype an asic, and tens of millions more dollars to buy the wafers and build out the systems, at scale.  this limits the mining capability to those companies who have access to large amounts of capital (bitmain and bitfury have such capital).  few others.  21 inc raised almost $150m then squandered it designing bad asics.  Proving that SkillSet is as big a requirement for successful mining as capital raising.  Mining asics arent normal asics.  They are hand laid out (full custom).  They run at lower voltages than the fabricators thought possible.   They use funky string architecture to save on power conversion cost.  The fact that only handful of asic designers in the world know how to design mining asics is a real problem.  Is that decentralisation!??

Thus... With the centralising effects of both Cost of Power, Capital Requirement and Skill Set... Bitcoin is now mined very centrally and the initially democratic ideals of Proof of Work have been lost (possibly forever).  This was purely caused by the incentives of Proof of Work being wrong (in the first place).  When Satoshi designed PoW he didn't know the outcome.  We only know now because we've tried the experiment over a number of years and its come to its logical and unsatisfactory conclusion.   We didn't know how well you could cheat PoW with asic optimisation.  We didn't expect that unequally distributed cost of power would force centralisation.  We didn't predict how much it would cost to design asics and systems favouring those with access to huge mounts of capital.  All of these things made economies of scale important to mining profitability and disabled most people's democratic ability to mine profitably in the rest of the world.  mining  - and Proof of Work - became forever centralised.


Proof of Work needs fundamental fixes (that no one knows how to do), to insulate it from Cost of Power, Capital requirements and Skill Set specialisation.

Sure, you can tweak things a little, with asic-resistant algos.  But that doesn't go to the heart of the problem.  That proof of work favours people who have access to cheap power, and encourages economies of scale, which shift the balance of power and is the very definition of centralisation?

Its for this reason that i hope that someone somewhere will solve Proof of Something Else.   Cos Proof of Work, aint working!!

dd0c4l6,greed_is_bad,33,"Any thoughts on the recent edition of Bitmex's crypto digest, in which they suggest that after mid February sell pressure will be lifted from futures as all loans will expire by that time?

Here is the relevant portion:

""What can one do with Bitcoin after it is purchased? If you don’t use it as collateral to gamble or place speculative trades, most Bitcoin lies dormant in a wallet. Bitcoin as a means of payment is still in its infancy.

Holders constantly search for ways to earn a return on their Bitcoin. No sovereign governments, banks, or companies borrow in Bitcoin yet. Therefore there are no “safe” fixed-income Bitcoin products.

To meet this need, savvy entrepreneurs have set up funds that pay a guaranteed daily rate of interest if you invest Bitcoin. These funds are based purely on trust. They are especially popular in China. Figures well known in the industry would leverage their personal brand to get holders to invest in their funds. I commonly saw 0.01% per day offered.

Depending on your personal network, you could also borrow Bitcoin from large miners or holders and pay them interest as well. If you are able to take down a large size, you may borrow cheaper than 0.01% per day.

What safe investment pays out a daily nominal return in Bitcoin over 0.01%? Prior to this week, I assumed that most funds invested in mining operations. But now I have another theory.

The major Chinese exchanges (BTCC, Huobi, and OKCoin.cn; aka The Big Three) operated popular P2P margin platforms. Users lent each other Bitcoin and CNY, allowing the exchange to offer margin trading. The lenders would earn a healthy return without taking any Bitcoin price risk.

The most profitable trade was lending CNY. Speculators going long borrowed CNY to purchase Bitcoin. Interest rates averaged 0.10% per day.

Investors in the fund gave Bitcoin, and the fund operator paid them 0.01% in Bitcoin per day. This is what the fund operator did next:
Step 1

Sell a portion of the Bitcoin for CNY. I will assume 50% of Bitcoin assets are sold.
Step 2

Use the 50% of Bitcoin remaining as margin to buy quarterly futures contracts to cover the 50% short Bitcoin exposure. You don't convert 100% of Bitcoin into fiat-cash so that you have sufficient Bitcoin-denominated margin to buy futures contracts. USD denominated futures contracts are the most liquid, so it's likely that most simply bore the USDCNY currency risk.

In the past, XBTH17 and other competing quarterly futures contracts have traded at a premium to spot. Assume that you buy at an annualised premium of 20%, this then means that you effectively pay 0.055% per day. On a blended fund basis (remember you only used 50% of assets), you pay 0.0275% daily.

Your fund owes 0.01% per day to clients, and you pay 0.0275% per day on your long futures contract hedge. Your total cost is 0.0375% per day.
Step 3

Lend the CNY on a margin trading platform. Assume you can lend your CNY at 0.1% per day on one of the big three Chinese exchanges. On a blended fund basis, you receive 0.05% per day.

Your net carry is 0.05% minus 0.0375%, or 0.0125% per day.

If you have 10,000 Bitcoin under management, you earn a profit of 1.25 Bitcoin per day. You can increase daily earnings by increasing the amount of Bitcoin assets sold for CNY. If you sold 75% of assets, your net carry would be 0.02375% per day.
Step 4

After three months, the futures contracts will expire. At that point, you must long roll your contracts into the next quarterly. The spread between the two contracts represents the cost of carry for the next three months.

Redemption

It is necessary to understand the mechanics that fund-operators must undertake when they pay back investors.

Suppose an operator raised 2 XBT. He sold 1 XBT and received $1000. He took the other Bitcoin and bought 1000 XBTH17 (March 2017) futures contracts at $1000.

The price of Bitcoin rises to $2000 and at that point the investor recalls his loan. The operator must return 2 XBT.

The 1000 long XBTH17 futures have a profit of 0.5 XBT: (1/$2000 - 1/$1000) * -$1 * 1000. He is still 0.5 XBT short. He receives the $1000 principle back from the margin loans he made. With that he purchases 0.5 XBT at a price of $2000. He can now return the full 2 XBT.

Inverse Futures PNL = (1/P1 - 1/P0) * -$1 * Contracts

The important fact is that he must sell futures and buy spot, which at the margin causes basis to fall. If too many investors unwind at the same time, the falling basis will move a futures contract into backwardation.

The Great Unwind

From 24 December 2016 to 5 January 2017, the price of Bitcoin went from $800 to over $1,200 equivalent in China. Volumes spiked and bulls were borrowing everything in sight to go long Bitcoin. To satisfy the demand the CNY need to come from somewhere. I don’t believe exchanges were re-hypothecating customer CNY. I believe the increased CNY demand was met by credit whales operating in the manner I describe above. The hedging pressure from credit whales and Bitcoin bulls caused the XBTH17 premium to reach 54% annualised on January 5th.

All of a sudden, the PBOC turned on the lights at the club. In response to pressure from regulators, Chinese exchanges ceased offering margin trading on January 11th. The very next day, XBTH17 entered backwardation. Existing loans were allowed to expire, but no new loans could be taken out.

Margin loans had 2 to 30 day terms. As loans expired, credit whales need to unwind their trades. That meant selling futures and buying spot with released CNY. This helped move the futures’ basis into backwardation.

The Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) surrounding what the PBOC would or wouldn’t do prompted speculators to short Bitcoin via futures. There was no more margin trading therefore futures were the only bearish instrument available. Even today, the PBOC has released no statement as to what policy actions will be undertaken as a result of their “investigations”.

In short:

Margin Book Unwind + FUD = Futures Backwardation

Curve Normalisation

By mid-February all margin loans will expire. Afterwards, selling pressure will be removed.

If the PBOC does not say anything directly pre or post Chinese New Year, it will be safe to assume the exchanges heard and heeded the intended message. The FUD selling pressure will cease.

The basis will slowly creep higher as longs regain confidence and bargain hunt. A violent short squeeze could happen, should one of these three following black swan events transpire before the expiry of March 2017 futures:
The PBOC aggressively devalues the Yuan. Bitcoin will catch a bid again as comrades look to preserve what purchasing power they have remaining.
 
Marine Le Pineapple Pen is polling well in French elections. If Le Pen becomes the favourite, global contagion fears will skyrocket as an EU breakup will look more likely.
 
Trump passes a massive infrastructure spending bill. This is ""bigly"" inflationary and will cause US rates to rise which will exacerbate the pressure on the PBOC to slice the Yuan.

Bitcoin will respond positively if any of these scenarios come to pass. If you believe these situations are remotely possible, it behooves you to begin building a long XBTH17 position and take advantage of the backwardation.""",2017-01-28 14:21:22

In my view, the best way to innovate with cryptocurrencies is to either build a complete new codebase (ala monero, ethererum) or fork and create a new genesis block.

If the new technology offers genuine innovations, eg privacy in monero, then the market can shift to it over time.

But there is no reason to break the implicit contract of users on existing blockchain, eg: bitcoin.

I would like to see the industry move to a model where hard forks are ONLY done with a new genesis block, and users are simply encouraged to trade into the new blockchain, or risk getting left behind as the old one becomes gradually less popular.

I'm sure that thought would need to be put into it as to the best and fairest way to start the new blockchain or else prices might go crazy at the beginning.  But I feel that reasonable solutions could be found, maybe even starting with existing utxos from the older chain.",2017-01-28 08:49:56

2) this is saving face.  By putting the activation so high they can blame the community for not activating SW then later they will try to lower it to make it look better/look like a compromise.  core is not necessarily, malicious just short sighted and greedy (Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity, but don't rule out malice - Hanlon)

SW is just another feature, but it is being given total favortism by changing the rules of what secures bitcoin, moving the fees away from miners and towards the LN hubs that SW plans to use (but not need).

The problem with Segwit's ""size increase"" is that it relies on 95-100% of the network adopting Segwit, which will not take place for years if adopted. This is too slow of an increase, which is why miners wanted the constant value increased.

I'm not sure if this block or viabtc's invalid coinbase txn block is a more interesting failure.

This one is a nice demonstration of what actually happens when someone attempts to perform a blocksize hardfork.

In December Bitcoin Unlimited introduced [a bug](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/commit/eb7db8b15dce186870568c6b0dc156bdb179710a#diff-4a59b408ad3778278c3aeffa7da33c3cL124)-- not reserving enough space in the block for coinbase transactions-- that they recently shipped in BU 1.0 (it doesn't appear that there were any earlier release candidates with it).  The impact of this bug is that in common mining configurations (including Bitcoin.com which AFAIK is run with the direct involvement of BU) this can result in somewhat oversized blocks, even when configured with a maximum of a million bytes. Then, as an intentional part of their design, the BU software will also forward oversized blocks if someone creates one. The change appears to have been made via a direct commit (no pull request) so it doesn't appear to have had any peer review of any kind.

Every Bitcoin Core node happily banned the BU peers that gave them this invalid block, and went on running as if it never happened.  SPV wallet user who were connected to BU nodes may have seen a false confirmations for 24 minutes until 450530 was mined which decisively overtook the invalid 450529. Fortunately, in this case it doesn't appear that SPV miners exacerbated the invalid block fork though several did follow it briefly.

In Bitcoin Core the code in question has a [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/miner.cpp#L118) that explains why it's there; which was added about a year before BU created this bug in their own software.

It's possible that there were more invalid blocks that resulted from this incident, but it's hard to be sure-- because the nodes forwarding them were banned by everyone else any further blocks on that fork would not have propagated well at all, so I simply may not have seen them.

Most Bitcoin sites never showed this bad BU block at all. e.g. it's not in bc.i or smartbits.

Orphaned means the block is reorganized out by a longer chain. This block was flat out rejected as being invalid. It's an **invalid** block, it's not an orphan/stale block as they are calling it.

Bitcoin Unlimited didn't even announce the issue to their user base or the network, a serious bug that could *and did* cause people to lose money. That we even know about this issue at all was because hours after it happened Core developers looking at network logs noticed it happened: the spread of the block amongst Core Nodes was limited because nodes will not relay invalid blocks.

Bitcoin Unlimited has not in fact fixed it, instead they have advised Bitcoin Unlimited miners to mine deliberately smaller blocks so that they don't accidentally go over the limit.

I hope that you will realise that, contrary to **statements from Adam Back and others, the Core team does not have unique skills and abilities that qualify them to administer this network.**

While no-one knows how much Bitcoin could be worth if it wasn't for the 1MB block size limiting the utility, we sure as hell know it would be worth a lot more if more people could use it without experiencing unnecessary frustrations.

Also, it would greatly help fungibility if the user base grew large. Most of us want to use it for legitimate purposes, at larger scale. If that happens, the relative frequency of criminal use will drop significantly, improving the forementioned aspect while making also making blockchain analysis much more difficult for those who are working against privacy.

I know of a bug that Bitcoin Core still has that's remained unfixed since 2010. It's a temporary limit that they forgot to remove for years which is still causing us severe problems. But that bug is in Bitcoin Core's economic code so it's unfortunately invisible to their development team with little to no hope of ever getting corrected. 

Bitcoin Unlimited on the other hand, has already fixed this bug of creating and propagating 1 block that was too large.

The same design also has miners racing to publish their blocks, with miners above 33% hash power having an unfair advantage, which gets worse as blocks get bigger.

Luckily Satoshi coded in the necessary features to create payment channels, upon which lightning network is based on, which is tech that *would* allow bitcoin to scale to a very very high number of transactions.

dd27ajv,chinawat,30,"You have the broad strokes down exactly. As far as specifics, two points are easily seen:  

1) ""Soft"" fork SegWit creates a new data structure that might be construed as a ""block"", but it's different from the block that we've always had in Bitcoin to date which is limited by a single variable in the code (MAXBLOCKSIZE=1000000). After SegWit activates, that 1000000 value limit remains in the same (albeit renamed) variable, but it gets joined *by two more magic numbers* in order to restrict the new data structure -- clearly unnecessary complexity. Almost the entire Bitcoin ecosystem must re-code to become compatible with this new data structure and the new transaction types that come along with it if they want to benefit from its improvements, which means the possibility of new bugs and attack vectors not just for the changes in Core, but for each re-written implementation as well. In contrast, simply raising the block size limit instead would involve almost no such new code in the ecosystem while achieving an instant capacity increase.  

2) The use of anyone-can-spend adds the possibility of coin theft to existing 51% attack vectors, and removes the insurance HODLers have in the event of all hard forks, which is derived from the fact that any chain fork duplicates their funds as tokens on the forked chain. Anyone-can-spend use means transactions can get replayed on a forked chain that does not support the anyone-can-spend workaround, making the funds involved free for the taking.
