Bitcoin's appeal is that unlike credit cards, it's an untraceable currency. This is great for the black economy, as it's no different to exchanging cash, as no authorities can pinpoint how that money changed hands.

The interesting thing with bitcoin is that as it is being used with the black market, those with 1000's of bitcoins can't just deposit that money into their account, as that would be a red flag from the bank, and then they would be questioned as to how they ""legally"" got so much money.

This is making a lot of people hold a limited supply of Bitcoins, increasing the value drastically. Now past the hype, people are using this as investment opportunities, further increasing the demand for Bitcoin, and therefore price.

ds1y14k,KhaosComplex,243,"Not that I've ever programmed for block chains yet (I'm a gameplay software engineer), however from what I've gathered reading whitepapers/Mastering Bitcoin/etc. the main reason RaiBlocks is able to get incredible scalability is that instead of relying on block times and block sizes, we basically relay every transaction as they come.

I think to be more specific, if you're sending someone Rai,  RaiBlocks takes into account your balance and the receivers balance, creates a Delta Transaction (what you lose, vs what they gain) and broadcasts that across the network to get consensus.

So from my understanding what makes it very fast is that transactions are in fact propagated instantly and the only bottleneck is how fast the nodes, hardware and bandwidth wise, can process these transactions. 7000+ is more of a random figure that was tested on the developer's machine, but in theory the number is tied to however fast the nodes themselves can process the transactions. As in, the protocol gives unlimited throughput potential. This however poses some concerns (which like all young cryptocurrencies, this is normal to tackle):

Penny spamming is very possible. Without any fee to deincentivize spam, it isn't too costly to just spam the network. I believe this concern is already well known and being worked on.

dPoS is required in order for a system like this to run (from my understanding). Basically since the system is only as strong as its weakest node, we essentially must vote in which nodes are trustworthy and strong enough to validate the system. This will further enable scaling, at the cost of decentralization (as do all dPoS algorithms). They bank on the idea that voting in a decentralized manner will be secure enough for a system like this to handle, but A. That's yet to be proven, and B. it's technically in every way shape and form LESS decentralized/secure than having more nodes, the argument being there may be extreme diminishing returns for having more nodes compared to real world security anyway.

Smart Contracts have yet to be developed, and quite frankly may pose a bit difficult as the nature of RaiBlocks seems to be very asynchronous. Not saying it's impossible by any means but I believe having time based code may take some time to implement. However, since they are marketing purely for a currency product, this may be unnecessary, yet, I'd still argue that a currency that also enables a world of applications may prove to be a more useful cryptocurrency in a decentralized world. Time is yet to tell.

Those are all the thoughts I have so far, I'm sure there are more security concerns and problems I haven't listed, however the main focus point of RaiBlocks is sound and functional. The dev team is active and the initial mining was one of the most fairest examples I've seen to date. I saw the coin around .20c and had a good feeling about it, but was being ultra conservative as I was just getting into the market. Seeing it hit the price it has despite not having gotten in till much later makes me really happy as I feel this project deserves all the good publicity. It isn't being marketed as a perfect solution yet but they're well on track to making an interesting impact in the market.

And remember, with investing in crypto you should always look at the community behind it as well. I feel for RaiBlocks its fairly open and engaging and I feel less like I'm investing in a product and more like I'm investing in the network itself.

EDIT: Ayy awesome my first gold haha. Thanks to whoever did that! I'm not 100% confident all this information is accurate but I think it's close to the general idea without making any serious claims one way or another :D",2018-01-02 07:35:10

Please don't be one of those people. The highest the marketcap of a single cryptocurrency can realistically grow to in the next few years is around 1 trillion.

ds28gph,arsonbunny,124,"This a continuation in my series of analytical reports for various cryptocurrencies, from a quantitative modelling and fundamental perspective. These are the previous reports:

* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)

Today we will look at  Request Network (REQ), a newcomer to the crypto world and create a quantitative model using the Equation of Exchange to value the preset value of future expected utility. 

If you already know about REQ, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Section A: A fundamental analysis of REQ**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tech overview**

[The initial whitepaper](https://request.network/assets/pdf/request_whitepaper.pdf)

[Technical yellowpaper](https://request.network/assets/pdf/request_yellowpaper_smart_audits.pdf)

[Network mindmap](https://i.imgur.com/BwTQyo2.jpg)

Request Network aims to become the ""Paypal of Blockchain"" by utilizing a core Etherum layer to develop a broad network of interconnected payment gateways that can link to any fiat exchange. Its currently is split into 3 layers. The core layer is based on Ethereum and is used to settle and interlink to various currencies, the extension layer that allows for REQ specific application logic, and an Application layer which will provide APIs and user interface elements. The network will also be build on top of:

* 0x protocol for inter-currency settlement

* Kyber Network for fee conversion

* Aragon for governance guidelines.

REQ tokens are ERC20 tokens which are necessary to participate in the network, and are burned when an advanced Request is settled. The costs expected on the platform are 0.05% to 0.5% of the transaction. 

**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**

One of the major issues with cryptocurrencies today is that they are very much oriented towards the technically literate. Simple things like having to enter a difficult to remember randomized string address to send money (and having the potential to lose money if you enter an address wrong) are really holding it back from mainstream adoption.

REQ aims to drastically simplify and ""idiot-proof"" the cryptocurrency transactional process. It aims to allow everyday people to make transactions using cryptocurrencies with an user-friendly UI, and without having the problem of having to enter a correct address or understand technical concepts. It wants to do to cryptocurrencies what Apple did to computing. Initially the team expects that it will be used for B2B transactions, however the long term target market is allowing people to pay on Amazon using the Request Network in any currency they want, and making this process as seamless and stress-free as Paypal. 

**What is the Development Team like?**

The key members on the team are:

* Etienne TATUR - Cofounder and CTO
* Christophe LASSUYT - Cofounder and CFO
* Vincent ROLLAND - Lead engineer
* Laura GIROD - Lead Data Scientist
* Julien DEVOIR - CMO
* Elliott DENIS - Full Stack Engineer

The team has a tech and finance background, with the two cofounders being behind Monetys and being associated with Y-Combinatron

You should look up the LinkedIn an profiles for each member on http://request.network/

**What current product exists?**

Current we are in the very early development phase. Right now the team has released an alpha testnet called Colossus and is collecting user feedback:

https://app.request.network

In Q1 2018, the first iteration of Request working on the mainnet will be released and you’ll be able to:

* Connect to your wallet with a LedgerNano S, a private key, or a json file
* Create, send, and pay a request in BTC
* Create, send, and pay a request in any ERC-20 token
* REQ fees conversion through Kyber Network
* Offline transactions that are not broadcasted (needed for online payment)
* Add metadata to Request to send formal invoices

**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**

* Currently in very early development, its not clear how much of the broad scope must be cut. A highly speculative investment without a proven track record.

* Heavy competition in this space, even outside of crypto. For example: Venmo, one of the largest P2P payment systems which already has a lot of this functionality they are talking about, and with no fees if you use anything other than a credit card.

* It is build on Ethereum and therefore inherits all of its restrictions when it comes to scalability. With POS changes expected to come soon this will be alleviated, but nevertheless REQ will remain limited by the scope of the Ethereum project.

* It is not clear just how the token burn functionality will work, or how quickly all REQ will be burned.

1. Make your own shitcoin on Coinlaunch or another one of those ""make a coin in 15 minutes"" sites. Make sure to keep 40% float for your ""foundation"".

2. Copy pasta a whitepaper from another coin that looks sciency. Use words like ""peer reviewed"", Reddit loves scientism. Make fancy diagrams with little circles and arrows moving between them. Nobody reads them anyway it doesn't need to make sense, just look sciency.

3. Make a website with those same GraphicRiver graphics packs that pretty much every shitcoin uses. Make an animation with vector graphics on the front page with lots of buzzwords like ""IoT"" and ""Quantum Computing resistant"". Go to a stock image site and search ""Millennial Professional"", buy a few images and make round cutout of the faces. This is your ""expert team"", give them smart sounding names and make up LinkedIn pages. Everyone worked at Visa, Paypal, Google or is a MIT Data researcher! Don't forget to point out how **FAST** and **LOW FEES** your coin is. You can make a youtube video showing how quick it is to transfer between wallets, just a few seconds! And each transfer costs less than a cent! REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY!

5. Get it on a shit exchange and bid up your shitcoin up 500%. Get a friend and go to the rich part of your city, find an exotic sports car parked somewhere and get your friend to pose for a picture with his thumb up. Photoshop the name of your shitcoin onto the license plate. Make a fake social media profile for your friend, spread the image on social media with the caption ""Turned my dreams into reality! 500% profit in a week on [INSERT SHITCOIN]""

6. Go on /biz/ on 4chan and start posting images of hot girls with the logo of your shitcoin photoshoped in, shill it until you reach Pajeet coin status. Now Pajeets will shill for you full time, even while you're sleeping. Join one of the PnD Discord groups there, make a  ticket on Discord and threads on 4chan on the next pumping scheme with your shitcoin. Spread a rumor how your friend overheard Jeff Bezos is considering utilizing your coin on their next IoT ecommerce platform because its so fast.

7.  Now go to Reddit and Twitter and shill your shitcoin to normies. Tell them its only $0.00005, while Bitcoin is over $10,000 so its so undervalued! If someone asks why its on such a shit exchange, tell them it was difficult to buy Bitcoin in 2012 too and look at it now! And unlike Bitcoin, your coin is **FAST** and **LOW FEES**  and will revolutionize the IoT Quantum Computing Digital Economy through Vector Dynamic Transaction nodes and SWIFT integration matrices! Valuation model? What's that?! Look it increased by 500% in just a week, its about to break out and go to the moon don't miss out!

Eventually they cryptos will have an actual use in society when their prices are stable enough for businesses to accept them as revenue (after the big crash). But, as far as we are concerned they’re not going to replace the functionality of any major FIAT, and even poor countries governments may ban cryptos if people use them more than their local tender. And as wealthier economies regulate them, they become less valuable and volatile.

**Quotes I enjoyed from Jameson Lopp**

&gt;I think that over the long term Bitcoin will need larger blocks, but those of us who are more conservative want to try as many other available options to increase the capacity and use the blockspace more efficiently before we simply allow our nodes to accept a greater load with larger blocks

-

&gt;Layer 2 is a tried-and-true method for building efficient permissionless networks, it is in fact analogous to how the internet itself is designed because if you look at the seven layers that compose the internet itself the lowest layer is called ethernet which is this broadcast to all data transmission layer. If that was the only layer that composed the internet then we wouldn’t be able to do what we’re doing right now which is streaming audio across the world because if we only had ethernet, every other participant on the internet would have to receive and relay all of the data from everybody else which just doesn’t scale at all. The only reason we can make use of these high bandwidth applications is due to something called tcp/ip which are routing layers that allow you to send data through the fewest intermediaries necessary in order to get it to the intended recipient on the other side of the world.

-

&gt;If a permissionless network of nodes gets to the point that only large enterprises can afford to run them then it's interesting because it essentially creates an opportunity for those entities to govern the protocol and this means that such a network could eventually find itself in the position where there's insufficient revenue from transaction fees to sustain the hash rate and the enterprises that are governing the protocol may then decide that inflation of the monetary supply is required in order to sustain the system and they could even do this without telling the users because if the users can't afford to validate the rules to which they agree and they're blindly following what the nodes on the network are telling them is correct and some of these rules such as total supply cannot be validated by lightweight clients using SPV proofs

-

&gt;these second layer networks will be much faster than the on chain networks and will eventually end up actually having lower fees because they won't be in this situation of having a high competition over scarce resources and scarce block space

-

&gt;from the standpoint though of like who controls the block space or is there centralized planning happening or is Bitcoin core in control of the Bitcoin protocol I think that that's a result of a lot of frustration of people wanting to have somebody to blame but in fact there are over a half a dozen different Bitcoin protocol implementations it just so happens that Bitcoin core happens to be the the one with the largest group of people who are contributing to it and it's very interesting to see how angry people get about Bitcoin core in specific because this is an open like group collaboration project so anyone who has the expertise and wants to contribute their time is welcome to join Bitcoin core start you know making reviews and pull requests and participating in the process

-

&gt;one side who believes it's very important for full node operators to be able to run a fully validating node at a low cost and then on the other side you have people who believe it's very important that transaction fees for on chain transactions are very low cost in order to continue to drive adoption for these like retail level transactions and these are trade offs that can't really you have to choose one or the other

-

&gt;All-time high fees right now for transactions on the Bitcoin network this is because there's a ton of demand and people are willing to pay a premium for it some people aren't but apparently a lot of people are because that's why they're so high and in fact transaction fees are on track to make bitcoins computational security actually sustainable because bitcoin is deflationary the subsidy that is provided by each block to miners is going to continue to dwindle until there's none left to pay them and at that point miners will either have to work for free or they will need to be sufficient transaction fees for them to collect so last I checked Bitcoin is already about 40 to 50 percent of the way of being sustainable in this regard and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there that have extremely low fees not just Bitcoin cash this is because almost nobody uses them and there's no demand for them

-

&gt;So while some people say the Lightning Network may quote unquote steal fees from miners I actually expect that these second layer networks are going to enable new use cases that add more utility and value to Bitcoin which will result in even more demand for block space because they need to open and close these payment channels and if you consider that a payment channel will enable a user to perform many transactions off chain those fee savings are going to be reflected by users that are willing to pay even higher on chain fees because they're netting and overall fee savings

-

&gt;the only public permissionless networks you're gonna see that have low fees are going to have that because they have low usage low security and thus lower utility and value

-

&gt;allowing a fee market to form when demand for block space surges incentivizes users to be more efficient about their use of block space so as a result the higher value use cases get prioritized and unfortunately the low value use cases may suffer

-

&gt;I've been monitoring the Bitcoin transactions versus the Bitcoin cash transactions over the past week the average Bitcoin cash transaction has been over three kilobytes in size which is more than five times larger than the average Bitcoin transaction

-

&gt;first of all Bitcoin core is one of several implementations and even within Bitcoin core there are so many different supporters who have so many different views it's very very tricky to just you know categorize any large group of people as being one specific thing or another

-

&gt;last I checked like four or five different teams that are working on second layer technologies that want to make Bitcoin as a medium of exchange be an even better experience than say your Visa MasterCard type networks it's just they've been working on this for several years now and we're finally at the point where the technology is going to be ready sometime next year I mean people are already doing transactions on the main network it's just in a beta phase at the moment

-

&gt;I believe that we should prioritize the store value at the moment due to the technological limitations but you know ultimately I think that everybody on both sides of the scaleability debate has the same ultimate goal which is get Bitcoin used by everybody across the world make it a mainstream technology that is easy and basically empowers people

-

&gt;I don't think that there are that many people in this space who don't know about both sides of the debate because of censorship I mean information wants to be free and pretty much everybody who spends time getting into this level of the debate as well aware of like the points on both sides

-

&gt;There are definitely people who are doing dirty stuff on both sides I don't condone any of that stuff I generally try to mute and block as much of it as possible but this is kind of the chaos that you get from a free market

-

&gt;Bitcoin developers are conservative I'm really saying that you know they're extremely adversarial thinkers and they're trying to be careful so that edge cases don't get into the system that can cause it to have problems

-

&gt;yeah in regards to you know Bitcoin as a cash system there there is no way that I can argue there like there's no problems right now there's obviously a lot of problems a lot of frustration we are not able to onboard users as quickly as we would like to if anything I would say that Bitcoin has become popular and mainstream like faster than the technology is really ready for it right now

-

&gt;I have an interesting perspective because I'm in charge of running all the full nodes at bit go and we had this this issue this year with the New York agreement and a lot of company is saying you know what we the enterprises are deciding to go in this one specific direction and I was actually pretty upset about that like that is not the vision that I've been wanting to see and because I was on the inside of one of the prominent companies that was supporting that it created a lot of conflicts for me and it's you know the situation that I never expected to be in before

ds3vavl,OpiumChores,93,"TL;DW Summary:


- Apparently Lightning Network will be the reason why we will never need RaiBlocks. Because Bitcoin is gonna get fixed and XRB won't do jack.

- Plus, apparently, nobody cares about speed that much. He also thinks XRB has low fees, and isn't aware that it's feeless.

- He says scalability isn't a problem... Then immediately says that adoption is the problem caused by scalability... Yeah, I'm not making that up. 

- He mentions that there's faster coins coming out that are better than XRB like Steem. So doesn't believe XRB will be able to compete even in its own niche. 

- He believes that adoption is what makes a good crypto and RaiBlocks won't ever gain the adoption like the big 2; ETH/BTC because nobody is going to pair XRB to other things on exchanges. 

- He expects a pump once it hits Binance and a super dump right after and then none of us will ever talk about it again. In that respect, he does believe it will go up in price at least for the next few weeks.

- Interestingly, he doesn't mention any of the real issues with XRB (bugs, vulnerability to attacks, limited wallet solutions) and instead just attacks the notion that speed and fees don't matter...

ds3hcxl,_chewtoy_,88,"Been awhile since I've posted a longer comment, but I've been busy with the holidays. Anyway, here's what I'm watching:

With this impressive move up through the $14,000s, the market has broken above the only meaningful resistance line we've seen since the drop from $5,000 to $3,000 way back in August/September. Here it is both zoomed in and out:

https://imgur.com/a/J91do

It's a little too early to call this a breakout though, and I'd expect to see some chop in the $14,500 $15,200 range for the next 12 hours or so. But I'm confident this is ultimately going to keep on moving up toward the previous ATH around $20,000. 

That support line I've drawn is also pretty interesting, as it's one that's held all the way from $3,000 to $20,000 — aside from the short-lived drop to $5,500. I'd expect that we'll revisit that line again sometime in the future, but don't be surprised if it's quite a ways down the road. (I say this speaking relatively. ""quite a ways down the road"" in bitcoin land can really be interpreted as a month or so).

All in all, this brief period of consolidation was laughably short-lived in the grand scheme of things. The market was at $19,000 just 18 days ago, after all. And it's possible (perhaps even likely) we could see those prices again before the beginning of next week. 

Ultimately, this bubble is going to burst. But it does not appear (at least to me) that this is where it happens.

EDIT: oh, and for those of you scoring at home who missed my scattered comments during the holiday, I'm long from around $13,700 after avoiding getting stopped out by about $2 when Bitstamp dropped to $12,801. 

Also, just some insight into how I handle my stop losses: I reference Bitstamp for my entries/exits, but I don't actually trade there. I trade on Bitmex futures, but reference Bitstamp because it's less confusing for everyone here to use spot prices instead of futures prices. 

I do, however, manage my stop losses using Bitstamp prices because I can be more confident using spot as a guide instead of trying to divine where futures will be trading when spot hits a particular price. So when I say I've ""set stops"" at a particular price point, what I've actually done is set alarms for myself based off Bitstamp prices as a signal to ""stop everything and manually close your position."" 

Using stop losses on Bitmex is something I prefer to avoid whenever possible, and I only set them to avoid a liquidation.",2018-01-03 06:05:05

ds4pyxe,Brunswickstreet,326,"So the first thing that should probably be noted, is that Cardano has been around since 2015, but since 99% of the holders are from Japan it didnt really set foot here on reddit for a long long time, thus people are a little bit irritated how such a coin is getting up there, that nobody knows. Its not a new Coin that got hyped for their whitepaper and its not some crazy idea (decentraland, singularity). Most people would say Cardano tries to squeeze the best of Bitcoin (store of value), Litecoin (cheap, fast p2p transactions), and Ethereum (smart contracts) into one coin. So thats the easiest description of what they are trying to do. The thing that stands out the most (to me at least) and is why im holding this since 0.06 cents, is the fact that they are delivering on their roadmap time and time again, on time and a lot of times even beating their own deadlines. Plus they have one of the most active githubs i've seen so far. So for everyone telling you its a coin with nothing but promises, yes it is, but only if you dont dig deeper and are unable to see the bigger picture. They are delivering on their promises since this coin started existing. 

So these were just my experiences with holding ADA. Lets get to the shilling:

Its the only peer-reviewd cryptocurrency that is out there for now (where peer-review means, they pay well-known professionals outside of their team to review their ideas and codes). And its still open-source and people are able to review the code themselfs. So one thing doesnt rule out the other.

**Charles Hoskinson**, former CEO of ETH and ETC (if i remember correctly) is one of the founders of this project aswell. 

**Aggelos Kiayias** is chair in Cyber Security and Privacy and director of the Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh and designs Ouroboros, the Provably Secure Proof of Stake for Cardano.

**Philip Wadler**, one of the most influential people in functional programming (including Haskel) got hired by IOHK, which is the foundation that launched Cardano. 

What else do we have? People say Ark has a nice, easy and beautiful wallet, go check out the official ADA-Wallet: [Daedalus.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2edltwUkAAc5dG.jpg) It has fast transaction times with minimal fees. They are updating their roadmap in 1-2 days, thats probably why its going up so much now.

So am I 100% confident that this coin will deliver on their promises? Yes. Am I 100% confident that they will take over the market? No. Depending on how and when Ethereum are inplementing their PoS-System, how the market developes, what Bitcoin will become, what XLM will do blablablabla... Nobody knows anything but the fundamentals are there and in my opinion its a medium risk/medium reward coin. Is it overpriced for what it has to offer right now? Hell yeah, but thats not how investing works. If you only invest into a coin that has multiple householdname partnerships, a fully working blockchain, smartcontracts and minigames on the blockchain, you are too late.

One more point why its going up so much even though people dont know it is the fact that 90% of the volume on the exchanges we use come from Japan/Korea anyway and THEY know the coin and what it might be capable of.",2018-01-04 00:36:39

ds698qb,Catastrophi-,234,"Inserting here post from meegwell from an other forum: 

As a former student of finance at undergrad and grad levels, this whole argument drives me NUTS!  This may have been posted here before (I apologize if so) but it is one of the best explanations as to why comparing coin market caps to real company equity market caps is so ridiculous.  Even more ridiculous is to compare a coin cap to a country's GDP or some fraction of another currency (like US notes in circulation v. US denominated assets).

I know not everyone can always read WSJ articles so I am summarizing my own interpretation in my own words below (quoted when necessary).

https://www.wsj.com/articles/stop-talking-about-bitcoins-market-cap-1513015626

 

First, the underlying conclusion here is that a coins value is a lot more like the ASSET value of a global financial institution...not the value of it's owners equity position.  If you were to look at the books of Ripple, Inc...I am quite sure the company's XRP holdings would be in the ASSET section of the balance sheet.

This is actually something I have been considering writing. It is sooooo spot-on when it comes to the market cap debate. Funny thing is, the article is attacking BTC folks that brag about market cap...it covers all the basis - apples and oranges to compare to a real profit-producing company's market cap.

BTC (or any coin itself) is not a profit producing company. So what if BTC market cap is bigger than Citigroup's - a better comparison would be to compare to Citigroup's ASSETS...which is $1.8 trillion. For VISA, don't compare market cap, compare daily transactions (337k vs. 468 million) at a minimum.

Then comparing a coin market cap to national GDP figures (often done when folks argue a price cant go there) is ""like comparing two random numbers"".

When comparing bitcoin market cap to any established global financial institutions correctly, BTC is still a ""small fry"".

This coin XP is buying votes by shamelessly giving away free XP coins to vote using their twitter handle.

BTW, the same XP coin has a huge pre mine where the development team of XP has over 1/3rd of the supply in their own hands. This is the walled ID of the XP team's developers which has close to 40 Billion XP coins and is also being staked for rewards

https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xp/address.dws?3.htm

You can see that several million coins are earned via proof of stake into their own account every day. 
How is this even fair? No one knows what algorithm tweaks they pull, they are simply inflating the supply of their own coin, and distributing that to voters. This is hardly a community coin, it reeks of scam and a total ponzi scheme. This coin is simply a copy of several other coins which have scammed in the past like ""Ammo rewards"" (just search for this one up, the devs pulled a similar scam)  
  

The original developer of this coin has [sold](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2313170.msg24423688#msg24423688) this coin to the new development team for a price in August 2017, since the ""sale"", the new team has missed several deadlines and failed to deliver anything yet having a fancy white-paper where they promise all kinds of voodoo stuff. Once the coin gets to a big exchange, they will dump this coin and move onto the next scam. 

This is the crypto currency equivalent of a shelf-company used for money laundering. A generic bitcoin/litecoin copy is developed for very little cost, and then sold by the original developer, the new team promises all kinds of development, traps the people into the scheme, pumps the price and then exit scams. 

The developer team has not even disclosed their identities as you can see here: https://www.xpcoin.io/team/
They prefer to go by comical names such as digiwarfare and evangelo .   

Such a coin hardly deserves any mention let alone be traded on a large exchange that allows the anonymous developer team to pull another scam.  

Please look into this allegations of impropriety and also purchasing votes using their own inflated Proof of stake supply which is all staked using their massive pre-mine

And it's not really in their head, the entire industry and financial world around them seem to reflect this number.

Then the execs fuck them in the contract and they're looking at a much smaller number. 5 mil. Plus they get them on the hook to give up more profits (more work for less pay... like Chapelle's bottom bitch story). It's like someone who thought they had $200k in Bitcoin just found out they lost the keys to their wallet, but they already wrote checks and made promises. They've bought that Ferrari. Now they're in debt. And they can't get out of it, they're working their damn ass off just to make interest payments. But in their head they had full accepted that they'd be up nearly a quarter million.

People keep treating them like they're kings. They're still driving that Ferrari and getting envied. But they feel like failures. Like frauds, impostors. Then the psychological problems start.

Those that fight back get Harvey Weinsteined (re: threats, blackmail, blackout, boycott, etc).

Crypto is a lot of 'new money' and people can just afford to park gains from other coins on these newbies for quite a while if they want. 

I have a theory that the big bump in all of these altcoins atm is that people got bored with bitcoin's 'stagnation' (it's pretty tame compared to second-half 2017), people jumped into things like ripple, tron and xp atm, etc. The difference being is that one jump, bitcoin, litecoin, eth, etc. were due to greater adoption by wider audiences with new money, while these alts of late are the result of new wealth generated by the most technologically literate who are making much more speculative investments that generally have no indication that they will be adopted by a wider audience. 

I think that when this influx of money is tapped out, these currencies will level off for a short while before people begin to cash out and we see a gradual decline in most alts regress to the mean, in this case, a big ass decrease. 

Since dec 19th (I take screencaps ever so often for coinmarketcap) there's been a 140 billion dollar increase in total crypto market cap, e.g. half of bitcoin's total value. Is ripple worth so much out of the blue? Is tron? The next few weeks, months will be interesting.

ds898ic,BowserJewnior,353,"How it actually happened:

This is Ann. Ann started her career at 16 when she blew the manager (a creepy pervert who forced her into it, she #MeToos to this day) at the local grocery store so she could immediately get a position as a cashier instead of having to start off in the storeroom stacking boxes ""like some Chinese slave worker"". Ann, who believed in ""treating"" herself for her hard work, did not save any of the money she earned, instead spending it on expensive clothing, fast food, movie tickets, smartphones, and nights out with ""the girls"". Her parents paid the bills anyway, so who cares?

It's okay though, because Ann was able to get financial aid from the government to attend the university of her dreams and study sociology, because ""I'm, like, just so interested in how society works and how white men oppress women and are so racist and stuff, you know?"" It only put her $100K in debt too. ""You can't put a price on the college experience,"" thought Ann. Ann did no research on what degrees were in high demand before deciding on her major and sadly, ""due to the patriarchy undervaluing the so-called 'soft' sciences"" Ann repeated (as her women's studies professor had told her), her sociology degree did not open up as many doors for her as she would have hoped.

Luckily, however, one of Ann's old beta orbiters became the CEO of a new tech startup and, after finally hooking up with him a few times (her little secret from her then boyfriend Tyrone), she was able to snag a position as their chief diversity counselor. ""Good thing that fat black bitch who tried to steal MY job was too full of fried chicken and gravy for any man to want to fuck her,"" she tipsily joked about the only other applicant (always forgetting to squelch her offensive quips when drunk), eliciting howling guffaws of approval from the pack of thonged, dyed-hair hyenas that surrounded her in celebration of her new job at the local bar. ""Bartender, get us another round of appletinis!"" Ann boomed. Cheers abounded.

Life was good, Ann's salary was high, and her mortgage for an $800K home in the Bay Area was approved. Unfortunately, it was eventually revealed that her company's ""enterprise cloud blockchain solutions"" were actually vaporware. It lost its VC funding and was forced to shut down.

Poor Ann had to leave her dream home, accept a lower paid HR assistant position at a boring non-tech company (""They make plastic water filters or something. I don't even know.""), and move into a mere 3 bedroom apartment. ""We're told to save,"" wrote Ann on a piece of paper that she posed with in an image posted to her Instagram, ""but Oreos and Netflix are the only comforts poor people like us have. Don't we deserve nice things too? I AM the 99%!""

Ann's looks are already starting to fade due to ravages of a rough Haagen-Dazs by day/party slut by night lifestyle, and, though she'd never admit it to herself, she can tell that her ""feminine charms"" aren't as effective at creating opportunities for her as they used to be. Things have started to sag that never sagged before and even a Sephora warehouse couldn't get rid of the bags under her eyes. Strolling down the sidewalk, she takes a sip of her daily Starbucks triple pumpkin dessert cocoaccino latte (only $27 and 1500 calories, and don't even *think* about talking to her in the morning until she's finished one). ""I guess there's just no way to escape this male-dominated society where sexist techbros live in the lap of luxury while marginalized people like me subsist on crumbs,"" she thinks to herself as she steps over a homeless man.

Meanwhile...

This is Bob. Bob was bullied by the other kids at his school (such as his childhood crush Ann) in his early years for his slightly odd-looking face. This caused him to retreat into the more anonymous world of the Internet where nobody could know what he looked like. The other kids mocked him for that too, and his parents didn't understand why he'd want to ""waste"" his time talking to people he ""didn't even know"", but he ignored them. It didn't completely cure his loneliness, but it did expose him to ideas and opinions that he would not have otherwise explored. Sure, he may have gone through an embarrassingly self-righteous atheist phase as a teenager, but ultimately he developed into a sharp free-thinker with nuanced opinions.

Bob found out about Bitcoin in 2012 from a Linux forum he was browsing. Already a firm believer in privacy, cryptography, decentralization, and technological freedom in general, the idea of Bitcoin immediately excited him. After carefully considering the economic viability of the concept, he concluded that Bitcoin's deflationary issuance curve and the possible applications of an enforceably scarce digital asset made it a worthwhile and likely quite valuable investment. He thus resolved to accrue as many of them as possible in order to save for his future. He cut down on his favorite hobby of gaming, reserving his GPU cycles for Bitcoin mining and his Steam sale money for buying Bitcoins instead. His IT job didn't make much and his one bedroom apartment was expensive but he always found a way to set some money aside to expand his growing cryptoasset portfolio.

His enthusiasm for Bitcoin was endless, and he wanted to share the positive potential of it with the world too, so he wrote guides, created infographics, and made videos for his YouTube channel about how to buy, use, and mine Bitcoins. Due to his efforts, thousands of people were able to get in on the craze early like him. Parents created college funds for their children. Young adults his age secured their financial futures. Impoverished people in oppressive shitholes learned how to transfer money via their smartphones to avoid their corrupt governments confiscating it. He even endured the eye-rolling and snickering of his family members at Christmas time to make sure that they were all gifted a bit too. ""Gee... thanks.""

The 2013 crash crushed Bob. He considered recouping as much of his money as possible and exiting the Bitcoin world permanently, but ultimately decided against it on principle. He had taken a risk and was sticking to it. He still believed in Bitcoin.

Bob's bet on Bitcoin has paid off. He is now a multimillionaire, at least on paper. Other than a few donations to various organizations, his Bitcoins have stayed in the original addresses they were first put into. After all, he is still prudently considering exactly how to spend and grow his newfound wealth, and since he's now the manager of his company's IT department, his salary more than supports his modest lifestyle by itself, so he's in no rush to ""cash out"".

While trying to chat with Ann on a whim after running into her at a grocery store, Bob mentioned Bitcoin to her in 2012. It made her finally look up from her phone. ""That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of!"" she shrieked. She would know too, she thought, since she's a college-educated woman, unlike Bob who had skipped college because ""government subsidies have distorted the higher education market and lowered the value of a college degree"" (as if using fancy words made him smart like her). Nevertheless, Bob persisted, offering to show her how it worked and even set up a wallet for her. His Bitcoin evangelism could certainly be a bit aggressive at times, but he meant well. He would gladly send 10 or 20 dollars worth to anybody who wanted to get started.

She responded that he was creeping her out and needed to stop talking to her before she called security. Of course she wasn't really going to waste such an effort on this harmless loser, but she just couldn't stand hearing his nasally little voice anymore. He probably just wanted to creepshot her yoga pants anyway. Briskly sauntering away, she giggled to herself: ""How could a file on a computer be worth anything? I could just copy and paste as many 'BitCoins' as I want,"" she concluded, forgetting about the idea as soon as she had first heard of it. Plus, her company was already working with blockchain, which the CEO had told her was the only important part of ""BitCoin"" anyway. ""He has actual money too and not just fake Internet coins so he clearly knows more than Bob.""

Ann took slight notice of the 2013 bubble, but she was too busy moving into her new home then to pay much attention to it. When Bitcoin was hacked and the government shut it down (as Ann interpreted events), popping the bubble, she texted Bob: ""Told ya so."" There was no response. She figured he had probably already killed himself or something. Oh well! She had to get out of her sweatpants and ready for the club anyway so she didn't have time to worry about it. In fact, she didn't have a single thought about Bob again until...

In 2017, Bob once again crosses Ann's mind. The network miraculously revived, one Bitcoin is now worth over 10 thousand dollars, and Bob is almost certainly loaded. She stares at her phone, thinking of how to best break the ice with him. ""Hey Bob I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for some of the things I said to you in the past and how I treated you when we were kids and all. I know this is out of nowhere but I'm just kind of feeling guilty lately soo.... maybe we could meet up sometime and talk about it?? You could tell me more about those bitcoin thingies you we're so excited about back in the day haha"" Again no response comes and she whips her iPhone X on to the bed in frustration. Retrieving it, she switches over to Safari to look Bob up on social media, only to find that he's dating an 18 year old introverted Finnish girl he met online. ""That pervert!"" she gasps as she glances over the girl's milky skin and youthful face. ""She is WAY too young for him. He should want an ACCOMPLISHED, MATURE woman like me. I bet the freak looks at child porn too!""

Her fingers drip with venom as she texts one of her remaining beta orbiters. ""Hey,"" she begins, ""you know how to draw funny cartoons right"" She hits send.",2018-01-06 00:26:59
ds8j65u,guzmalt,320,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

ds8hsod,prettyhappydude,249,"To address a lot of the worrying things I'm seeing in this thread from complete investing newbies...

1. If you aren't prepared for the price to go down, 40, 60, or even 100% then you should not be invested in cryptocurrencies, let alone risky small cap investments. If you want to play in this space you have to be absolutely sure that when you see this happen, you don't panic, evaluate the situation as a whole, and remember what the goals of your trade were in the first place. This is partially why it's so important to invest in stuff you believe in and understand...when the weather gets bad you want to make sure you can withstand the storm because you believe it will end eventually. And if you fancy yourself a day trader, then before you get into a trade make sure you have set goals and stop losses, otherwise your floundering with no plan.

2. If you're putting money in thinking it's just always going to go up. Days like this are normal in all markets, and while it sucks to feel like you're losing money the ultimate lesson an investor can learn is patience. Because it seems to me many of the people who post here have never invested in other markets and expect everything to go up 100% a week. Crypto moves faster than any market, and what seems like a disaster today could be completely forgotten in three. 

3. STOP TRADING TO FOMO. Everyone keeps asking if they should trade all their down alts to go for BTC...WHY? You're trading in your assets at a discount to buy an asset at a premium. Just because you feel like you're missing out, don't chase it. Read this thread or any other to see countless stories of people selling to chase a new coin, only to have the coin they just sold rise 50% over the next day. In crypto, if you believe in the project, hold tight. The majority of active traders lose money.

4. There are two types of people you can be here. For example, in a month when XLM crosses a dollar there is going to be one person saying ""thank god I bought that dip at 62"" and one person saying ""well got in at 1.01, hope this works out"". Which do you want to be?

5. It's a lot easier to hold something if you believe in it. So if you're just here buying coins that you don't understand with no real value, it's going to be a lot harder when you see it go down to sit tight. 

6. You should always have some ETH and BTC in your portfolio. The fact that many of you view them as ""boring"" is extremely worrisome. A stock portfolio returning 30% in a year would be absolutely killing it, but you think that if bitcoin only goes up 100% it's a total waste. If you want to be in the crypto market, make sure you hedge a bit. As BTC goes up, Alts tend to go down.

7. Be careful of the excessive shilling that occurs here and on other forums. Many of the coins are shilled but for good reasons, but many more are people just trying to suckers other into buying because they are nervous they made a bad decision. With that being said, some of the coins you've been reading here a lot DO have a bright future, and can be considered ""Safer"" picks in such a crazy market, i.e. REQ VEN XMR NEO XLM. Do your research on this coins. Research the team, research the product, research the potential use cases and potential amount of users. If you believe it, buy it. 

Anyone just wanted to vent and hopefully help some people from making some bad choices. Just my 2cents.

ds9l5kd,x_ETHeREAL_x,186,"The FUD for ethereum in the early days (mid-to-late 2015, pre-DevCon1) was very bad.  ETH dropped from about a dollar to about 40 cents over those months.  There was a lot of FUD because ETH had no GUI wallet (only GETH or CPP eth) and using it at all required command line knowledge and was fairly technical.  There was a whole lot of financial FUD because the foundation lost so much of its initial investment on bitcoin losses (bitcoin tanked after the eth crowdsale and into the launch a year later) and there was real concern the foundation would run out of of money long before development was complete. I remember Vitalik estimating they could keep going for a matter of months, which wasnt going to be enough to get beyond homestead or to launch MIST and so there was huge FUD around that. The foundation was also paying lots of ETH out to early supposed contributors whose contributions during the development seemed dubious at best -- that was a big deal. Then Steven Tual, who was probably the most visible and well known foundation person back then (other than Vitalik) and was the primary foundation evangelist quit the foundation, which was a huge blow.  In the early days things seemed pretty daunting with huge setbacks seeming to happen a lot. 

It's really amazing how far ETH has come. In 2015 saying ETH would hit $1000 seemed so insanely outlandish. And yet now it seems to still be just the start.  Todays FUD is nothing, really nothing, compared to the real concerns about the future back then. ",2018-01-06 15:39:57

ds8jz2q,ninemiletree,167,"What bothers me most, and what I don't understand, is the mentality people have where, when someone addresses legitimate, well-founded concerns about a coin - *any coin*, be it Raiblocks or XRP or even Bitcoin - a huge number of people's initial reaction is to accuse people of being part of some grand conspiracy whose armies are out to viciously attack said coin and by extension, said accuser's personal financial stake.

And this is reddit, with spillover from 4chan, so of course, that happens.  They get all riled up over one thing or another, and troll *en masse*, either to pump their flavor of the week, or FUD something because someone saw one member of the community in one subreddit say something contrary to the 4chan ethos, and thus, warrant hours upon hours of pointless trolls and attacks.

But, first and foremost, if I address concerns about Ripple's lack of disclosure with their formalized partnerships, I find it absolutely absurd that someone would think I am doing so either as some sort of nefarious plot *to gain money for msyelf* (because how would that even work?) or that I'm ""salty""' because I didn't invest earlier, and apparently the catharsis for missed gain is to point out concerns with existing coins? 

That's ridiculous.  I'm here to make money.  Spreading FUD about a coin I *didn't* invest in *doesn't make me any money*.  If I raise a concern about a coin, *it's because I have a stake in it and want answers*.  I want to gather information to inform my selling or buying.

There is absolutely both FUD and pump happening on a regular basis.  Most pump is *obvious*, and *is* financially motivated.   Coins will either hire marketing teams or have in-house talent infiltrate social media and make mostly harmless ad-posts with identical formatting touting the virtues of said coin.  It's a known industry practice, but it really isn't as insidious as people make it out to be.  It's advertising.  They do it for good and bad coins.  If one catches your eye, do your own research, and the validity or invalidity of said coin should be easy enough to determine.  

And if you *don't* like said shilled coin, the easiest thing to do is just *not buy it and stay away*.  *Not* to viciously spread counter-FUD because you're terrified of some insidious invading army out to threaten your way of life.

 Most baseless FUD is *also* obvious, but is motivated more by the troll instinct of children or child-like adults, rather than any sort of coordinated strike.  These, of course, *do* happen, but more rarely.  It's more common with stocks, because the prices are more directly correlated to the perfromance of one company versus it's direct competitor. 

But coins are **not** companies, and they are **not** stocks, and there's far less incentive to spread coordinated FUD except for emotional reasons, because *harming* the price of one coin isn't necessarily a guaranteed method to *raise* the price of what is perceived as a competitor coin. 

If there's only two fish companies on the market, Fucking Fish and Frolicking Fish, spreading FUD about Fucking Fish *can* make the stock of Frolicking Fish go up, because by default, if Fucking Fish's business deteriorates (people stop buying Fucking Fish's fish), demand for fish is still steady, so people will buy *more* of Frolicking Fish, and thus, stocks go up. 

But that isn't the same for coins.  Spreading FUD about a privacy coin does *not* necessarily mean people will simply just buy a *different* privacy coin.  Companies have products that they sell, which generate profit, which affect market prices.  They can also innovate and enter new industries.  Coins simply don't *work* that way - you can spread FUD about BTC all you want, but it's simply a store of value at this point.  Who cares if it doesn't send data as fast as it should - the people who own a lot of it are rich, and the people who don't *want* to be rich, so they buy BTC.  

You just can't compare stocks and companies with cryptocurrencies because they don't work in a totally analogous way.

And at the end of the day, baseless FUD should be easily dismissed by your own research.  And if you *can't* sismiss the FUD with simple googling skills, *then you may want to pay attention to it because it may be raising a good reason for the doubt*.

But if there's a post, full of genuine insight into potential issues of *any* coin, either *ignore* it, because you think the claims are unfounded, or *address* them with rational rebuttals or responses. 

Because honestly, as an investor, if someone posts a critique of one coin or another, and the entire thread loads up with children whose only response is ""FUD"" or ""Salty"" or any other meme lingo, that makes me extremely worried - because that's the hallmark of an emotional investor.  They have no valid responses, but they don't have the emotional strength to simply ignore a critique they disagree with.  Instead, they react out of pure emotion, and begin screaming meme-lingo at someone attempting to tackle a rational problem. 

Now, sometimes moneyed interest spreads FUD about a coin to make people drop it so they can buy it back at a cheaper price.  This happens far more rarely than most people *think* it does, but it still does, on occasion 

But, again - if a moneyed interest really wants that coin, and is willing to spread FUD to get it, either that FUD can be easily addressed with *rational and sourced responses*, thereby disproving it, or it can be ignored.  If they're willing to spend time and effort to FUD a coin so they can pick it up cheap, it's probably a very good coin, with solid foundations - which again, **can be easily determined by a little research**.

ds92skp,CummyBot2000,87,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

ds8kkxt,Rehrar,81,"I speak only for myself, but I will be speaking perhaps an unpopular opinion so I preface with that disclaimer.

I think Monero sliding down the charts in market cap is one of the best things that can possibly happen to it. Why? 

Bitcoin started out with a vision to take an element of human corruption out of one of the most human corrupted spheres (finance) by replacing trust with cryptography. Unfortunately, it did not innovate fast enough (continuing to replace areas of weakness for human corruption) leading to the current political divide of BTC/BCH right now. This divide is, at it's core, the struggle to control the human elements of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is the highest in market cap and worth the most, the powers that be do the most fighting over it.

Should Monero magically rise to number 5 or so, more eyes would be on Monero in how to take it over, leading to the same problems Bitcoin is having. But if we keep our heads low, continue to innovate, and continue to remove points of centralization, failure, and human elements, while the higher cryptos come under fire by the powers that be, then by the time the world realizes the real usage of Monero, it will be too late. The powers will have few areas of attack because Monero has innovated itself into a cryptographically-resistant-to-human-corruption project.

That's the ideal, anyways. There will always be human elements. But we shouldn't waste this valuable time of being outside of the spotlight. We need to innovate while we can.

That's not to say that we shouldn't get better UX and design and stuff. That stuff is fun, and one thing I personally like to do. Just to say, I think the path we're on right now is a good one.",2018-01-06 03:37:36

dsbcjlm,ultrasuper3000,94,"I'm bullish about crypto in general, but can someone explain this to me; it just seems the math doesn't add up for this market to not crash.

At the moment we're seeing explosive growth, everyone buying in expecting big returns, and for the most part seeing it. These returns are coming from the marketcap increasing in general - fiat coming in and swelling the whole thing. This fiat is brought in by new users, so everyone's gains today are supported by those who are buying in tomorrow. At the moment there are so many people buying in there is no problem for those wanting to cash out - the exchanges can afford it, even for those who have 100/10x their money.

Surely at some point there will be a slowdown of new users to the point where the influx of money can't support those cashing out, and the whole thing will come crashing down?

With bitcoin and a few of the earlier coins the end game was never to cash out, as the end game was to use the crypto itself as a viable currency. The endgame now seems to have changed, with 90% of people buying in to go for the ride and then cash out at some point. The cryptos themselves have changed with many coins being utility coins built upon introducing the blockchain to an industry in a novel way - not to be used as a 'traditional' currency. For people investing in these its only every going to be about cashing out.

This is a layman's understanding - I don't know much at all about finance or investing - but I just can't understand how this won't crash.  Still bought in because this seems to be the era where nothing makes sense.

TL;DR
Everyone seems to be buying in to cash out with gains supported by the influx of new users with new money. When the new money slows down and the people cashing out increases, surely the whole thing crashes? ",2018-01-07 19:00:07

dsa3zt2,AllDay028,90,"MarketCap is a metric used to compare companies EQUITY VALUE. It's simply the expectation of future profits that will be attributable to equity holders times the number of shares outstanding. Bitcoin (or other coins that attempt to be currencies) have no equity value, or cash flows, or profits. It's a currency and has a certain value because of the total supply of that currency and what you can buy with it. The trading of a currency (or a commodity, if you want to use that Gold example) is not comparable to that of an equity. If you consider the coins that are meant to be currencies (BTC, LTC, etc), the better comparison would either be to a currency (M3 money supply) of which it is dwarfed by top fiat currencies (USD has an M3 of $13.7T). Or even a commodity (if you like the gold comparison) of which there is a supply of $8T. Meaning, the ""currency"" cryptos are still nowhere near actual currencies in terms of value. 

But even more importantly, you can't compare individual cryptos to each other by marketcap (XRP and BTC comparisons by market cap are asinine). It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what the different coins represent and how they compare to each other. MOST coins are not meant to be a currency, they are meant to be tokens that are used within a broader technology. Which means their addressable market is VASTLY different than the currency coins (or utility coins in other projects in other industries). For instance, the total addressable market for XRP would be in the trillions of dollars PER DAY if it was to achieve everything XRP owners hope for. That's because it would be used as a coin to facilitate all transfers of money, not to be used as money itself. This is true for IOTA, BAT, XLM, XRP, OMG, etc etc. 

So not only is marketcap useless for comparing these to companies/fiat currencies, it's also useless to use it to compare them to each other. ",2018-01-07 02:10:17

Using your computer to perform math that validates transactions, and in return you are paid the transaction fee. The speed that your computer mines at is called your hash rate, which is measured in the amount of hash functions (math problems) your computer can complete each second. It's important to note that multiple people can be mining the same transaction, but the first one to finish (likely the one with the higher hash rate) is the one who gets paid. However, there's another way to get paid. Multiple transactions are stored in 1 block, each block of which makes up the entire list of all bitcoin transactions, the block chain. If you are the first to complete the last transaction in a block, the bitcoin protocol creates a bitcoin reward (this is a new amount of bitcoin which you are the first owner of) which is paid to your wallet. However, the protocol has a rule that this reward decreases over time until the reward from finishing a block is eventually decreased to 0, and no new bitcoin is created. The difficulty of completing hashes also increases over time, making mining alone is extremely hard. People with better hardware than you will finish first, and you'll make jack all. This is where mining pools come in to play. Basically, in a mining pool, people join the pool and mine under the pool organization, and all the miners are combined into one huge effort, increasing their chances of gaining rewards. All rewards from the miners that make up the pool go to the organizers of the pool, who distribute the rewards fairly among all the miners depending on how much power (hash rate) they provide.",2018-01-08 14:04:37

EDIT: Ok guys here's my crack at it. The ledger is this giant blockchain. In order for transactions to make sense, it all has to balance in this ledger because if something is off it breaks the chain. The bitcoin or whatever token is a by product of this blockchain getting bigger. The bigger the chain, the more tokens are available for transaction. In order to get more tokens and make the blockchain bigger, you need smarter and faster computers that can solve the hash's that will allow the blockchain to balance correctly and allow a transaction. This process gets harder and harder as more and more spots get taken until eventually you reach the limit of possible tokens in the chain which in the case of bitcoin is somewhere around 20 million.

dsdfe17,raix_jaydubs,828,"The 'short' answer is that RaiBlocks is a different technology with different limiting factors that traditional (mined) coins do not have. Exchanges are used to dealing with the norm, which RaiBlocks is not.  Exchanges are generally used to having only one large 'hot wallet' per cryptocurrency along with a cold wallet for offline storage of excess funds. XRB is a completely different technology that does not scale for individual accounts in the way a regular blockchain does, and that's where the majority of the problem lies when you're dealing with sudden surges of deposits and withdrawals.

I want to make something ***very clear***: the XRB protocol still scales. It scales *massively*. Just not for individual accounts. A single account can do no more than 6 transactions per second with the best hardware in the world. That is by design.

While it's true that there have been software issues in the node such as crashing, desync, and lagging behind, the majority of them have been fixed. The core team has been working their ass off. But again, **these are not problems with the XRB protocol.** They are growing pains. Simple implementation details.

*So, how am I solving these issues then?*

There are two variables in scaling RaiBlocks to the level of transactions that exchanges do:

1. The number of nodes you run
2. The number of accounts you store your funds in

The benefit of increasing the number of nodes you run is obvious. However, the number of accounts may not be. The reason for needing more accounts is because, as I said earlier, a single account can only do (in theory) 6 transactions per second at best, and more around one transaction every 2 seconds for the average cloud server.

However, combining these two things introduces extra problems that primarily stem from the fact that two nodes very rarely ever have the exact same ledger. With coins like Bitcoin everyone's data is updated at the same time in 'blocks', whereas on XRB every account has its own chain that can update independently from everyone else. For something like an exchange, having data that isn't strongly consistent is a big no no.

As such, you have to have a consensus model. You need to wait until all of your nodes have the exact same set of data on an account before you can **reliably** transmit further data out. You could just firehose it and hope for the best, but that's shown to be a bad idea. This is not Bitgrail's fault, but that's what they were running into at one point - a node would *think* it broadcasted a block but the broadcast failed. As such, every block after that was invalid and their entire withdrawal system would fail until they fixed it manually. You would see 'invalid block' in the explorer. This bug has since been fixed.

Assuming your control software isn't singlethreaded and running on a single server, you're going to have to put in a ton of extra work to make sure everything has safe concurrency. Read locks on the data, synchronous writing, and fair queuing to ensure no single request ends up being blocked forever. You also now have to implement automatic systems for internal ledger balancing.

All in all, it requires a lot more work on the software side to ensure scalability but also data integrity.

That's the gist of it.",2018-01-09 02:07:59

If someone offers to pay you a whole lot of money to work from home, and they send you funds and tell you to buy something with part of the funds (like office equipment, or bitcoin, or shipping labels), it's a scam and the original funds deposited in your account will be reversed.

dsewnv4,the_snook,592,"I think this situation is like the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" dilemma. You know how that show goes? They ask you questions, and each time you get it right you double your winnings, but if you get one wrong you go home with a rubber chicken or something. The dilemma is whether you bet and go for another question, or fold and take the money.

I always thought that being on that show would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and so you should only take the money and leave if it's a *life changing* amount. $10,000? That's a lot of money, and would hurt to lose, but if you have a steady job and are not on the cusp of bankruptcy or losing your house it's probably not life changing. So you'd bet that. If you lose it, you won't really feel like you lost anything except a chance at that million. Gambling $500k and losing it though? That would have to hurt. You know how much of a difference that would have made in your life. Probably almost as much as the $1M you bet for and lost.

Now, you have $100k (before tax). That's getting into serious money territory. By which I mean, clear your student loans, pay down your mortgage kind of money (or down-payment on a place if you're in a HCOL area). If taking that money now would make a *significant change in your life for the better*, then gambling it and losing it all is probably going to feel worse than passing up a chance at a million. If, on the other hand, life *with* that money would just go on more or less the same as before you invested in Bitcoin you might regret cashing out if it continues to rise, because you'll feel that you didn't get enough benefit to outweigh the lost opportunity.

dseok8u,Nooku,121,"#Factoid of the day: The DAO (2016)

The DAO was the prequel to the ICO. 

It failed due to a contract bug.

After the end of The DAO, the ICO hype began.

#**Here's the story:**

The DAO was a contract that collected huge amounts of ETH from people who wanted to see this invested in great projects. A project would then knock on the door of The DAO requesting funds for its project. A community vote would then be triggered (automatically organized) to decide how much percentage of the collected ETH would go to this particular project.

Unfortunately, an obscure bug was found in the contract and exploited by Black hat hackers. They drained the contract and prepared for an exit-strategy (the funds were locked inside the contract by a timer). This went on and on and turned into a cat-and-mouse game, where every decision they made was with the intention of doing maximum harm to Ethereum and its community, prioritizing harm above personal value maximisation. 

**15 % of all ETH stolen (temporarily):**

Because 15 % of all ETHs in circulation were sent to this contract, 

and because this amount of money was meant to be invested in the growth of the eco-system,

the Ethereum community **decided it was vital** for these funds to be recovered to the rightful owners. 

The community decided to fork these attackers out by replacing The DAO contract with one that cut off the hackers access, and give the access back to the rightful owners of these invested ETHs, so they could withdraw the funds. This worked.

**The Bitcoiners attack:**

In an attempt to kill off Ethereums upcoming success, 

the Bitcoin community, under the lead of [Barry Silbert](https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/757628841938472961?lang=en) and the Bitcoin moderation team, 

started a trolling campaign where they started to promote the abandoned fork, **claiming the funds now rightfully belong to the black hat hackers**, and tried to get this abandoned fork onto the exchanges, where it became to trade under the name ""Ethereum Classic"". That's how Ethereum Classic was born.

**End result:**

Despite these attempts, Ethereum recovered from the bear market that dragged it from its ATH of $20 down to $6.27 at the lowest point, to then recover and explode to the $1200 it is today. 

Also, all of the funds were recovered and returned to the rightful owners, who then went on to invest it in the ICOs in 2017, placing the crypto-market in a full-on bull market.",2018-01-09 16:09:16

dsg09o1,mylaptopisnoasus,186,"&gt; In August 2017, Bitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically different paths.

&gt; Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. While it may still have high trading value, as a mere collectible of curiosity, the Blockstream fork of bitcoin is not part of building any future financial infrastructure, which is what Block Explorer is about.
A currency of the future has subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The Blockstream fork of Bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy"") is at $20 usage fees and rising, with no end in sight, and can take days to confirm, despite unfulfilled promises to the contrary on both points when Segwit activated in what can only be described as a community fistfight. We are therefore making the decision to consider the Blockstream fork deprecated, and support it as legacy technology only.

&gt; Rather, we have made the decision to support the only bitcoin fork with a postive utility momentum, which is Bitcoin Cash. We took an early decision to deploy a Bitcoin Cash block explorer and will continue to roll out related services. We are also deploying tools for other cryptocurrencies we find on a positive momentum path, such as ZCash, which have increased privacy value.
We will not add future support for the Blockstream fork of bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy""), and will be deprecating it entirely at some future point in time to be determined. Developments have revealed it to be a dead end. At such a time, we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only, but will make some effort to not break API calls by changing URLs of legacy automated systems.

.
&gt; https://blockexplorer.com will be switched over to displaying Bitcoin Cash data.

&gt; https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com will display Bitcoin Legacy data.

&gt; https://blockexplorer.com/api will continue to serve data from Bitcoin Legacy for now until we feel confident we can deprecate it, in which it will then serve Bitcoin Cash data.

&gt; https://bitcoinlegacy.blockexplorer.com/api should be used immediately to use the Bitcoin Legacy API.

&gt; https://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/api should be used for the Bitcoin Cash API for now, until it is switched over to https://blockexplorer.com/api",2018-01-10 09:30:00

&gt; “We’ve restored bitcoin as a payment option in our store after working with our provider to ensure lower bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers,” she said.

And based on [this blog post](https://blog.bitpay.com/microsoft-chooses-bitpay-to-power-bitcoin-payments/), that provider is BitPay.

Now remember that BitPay was going to [stop processing payments under $100](https://blog.bitpay.com/minimum-invoice-update/) in December before [backpedaling two days later](https://blog.bitpay.com/invoice-minimum-change/).

Maybe they started pulling the plug on Bitcoin payments when Bitpay first told them about the new minimum, then were pissed off when Bitpay bailed on that two days after the public announcement.

It's hard to say exactly what happened, but there's a 100% chance it was related to BitPay since Microsoft's reason for re-instating bitcoin is that they ""worked with their provider"" to allow lower bitcoin amounts.",2018-01-10 11:19:39

By niche I mean technology. We had the original vanilla bitcoin/litecoin/simple transfer niche. Then we had the smart contract niche. Then we had the privacy niche. The most recent niche is the transfer speed/low fee niche. This is why you saw coins like ripple, lumens, xrb, and iota rise an insane amount.

The second layer is the back and forth between alts and bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up, alts go down, people sell at the high on bitcoin and buy the low on alts. Rinse and repeat.

I have heard so many people trash talking bitcoin and saying it's going to zero and better technology would replace it. Every time I ask those people how long they've been in the space, they always say less than a month.

Guys, shut the fuck up and buy the fucking dip you fucking idiot. You ALWAYS buy the dip on bitcoin. You think tech matters right now? No, it doesn't. Nobody is buying bitcoin or any alt coins right now to replace their fiat, because you can't spend it hardly anywhere.

bitcoin's progression is fundamentally about disintermediation, and the progression of a business is fundamentally about entrenching its role as an intermediary. businesses only create value as a price-of-entry into a position which they will then seek to dominate. for this reason businesses will inevitably have an adversarial relation to the progress of bitcoin technology.

this is why giving power to businesses in shaping the course of bitcoins development is deeply misguided.

dsm59lt,barthib,157,"Interesting that this marketing infographics ""forgets"" to mention that Lightning faces huge issues with routing, security and... scalability. Here are facts from the developers themselves:

Lightning has serious [scaling issues](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/74ss0w/another_all_time_low_achieved_the_blockstream_cso/do0voa8) because millions of users imply that tons of changes per second must be broadcast and tons of routes recomputed every second, which is [impossible](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7n00gv/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2017/dryqkxc).

Participants need to leave their computer [on permanently, with private keys on the hard disk](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l5bqj/the_best_thing_that_you_can_do_to_help_ensure). That is against the security basics of Bitcoin: it makes massive hacks and thefts easy.

Using it requires [complicated, expensive and slow actions](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7nomn8/reasons_why_lightning_will_not_work).

If Lightning could work, it would anyway kill Bitcoin's point: *a decentralised network for censorship-proof transactions* (each person would open only one channel with a central hub that everyone connects to and transacts through, instead of peer to peer channels, because two transactions are needed to open and close a Lightning channel, which are very expensive).

So, among censorable networks, PayPal is clearly safer and simpler to use for everybody (and it can scale up).",2018-01-13 19:19:50

Da gibt es schon jetzt genügend andere Alternativen, die günstiger und schneller sind (Litecoin, RaiBlocks, Ripple, etc.).

TRON is a EC-20 token, with the idea of creating a decentralized network where people can create and consume content/data. The point of having such a network is because content creators can get paid directly, without having large margins taken away from middle men (think Youtube for example). Creators of content will be paid in TRX, which can then me exchanged real world currency. 
The TRX tokens (or other tokens that have been created on the tron blockchain) represent a certain fiat value. 

The reason why TRON is so special and unique, is because it is the only serious coin focussed on the entertainment industry. As you know, each coin has their own focuspoint (ripple and banks, bitcoin store of value, cardano/stellar as quick payments etc). Only TRON is the one for the gaming industry and the content industry. 

In China for example, mobile games are absolutely huge, and if there would be a widespread adoption of the TRON blockchain (and with that the TRX coin) the price would rise significantly. This is why I think TRON will make it. Especially with all those major partnerships that have been established in such a short period already.",2018-01-13 09:52:49

dsnpha2,duncast,862,"Copy and pasted from [here](https://medium.com/@stufffromsam/bitcoin-is-not-a-bubble-its-just-bitcoin-36b3f7f68b05) , interesting thoughts on the future of crypto:

1.) Enthusiasm starts in Wallstreet and becomes a bubble when the regular Joes get into it. Joes are the final bagholders, the last ones to get in. And with the Joes come volatility and unsteady and inexperienced (weak) hands—going from stable to volatile to pop. If Bitcoin is a bubble, it is the reverse of most bubbles, starting from the Joes first (already going through volatility and shaky hands) to Wallstreet and stability and attempts at regulation. A lot of the worst parts are behind us. Yes, we'll see corrections and drawdowns, but Bitcoin has already been around ten years and survived Mt. Gox (where 850,000 Bitcoins were lost) and Silk Road (an online open market for illicit goods). We've seen Bitcoin drop from 19,000 to 13,000 in a matter of days. $6,000 sounds like a lot of money, but that's only a 32% drop. In its early days, Bitcoin survived 95% drops. The mainstream is just opening their eyes to Bitcoin but most of its worst days are behind it. There are children now who have never lived in a world without Bitcoin.

2.) If this is a bubble, it's a very responsible one. In most bubbles, average investments are very high (consider the last three: real estate, dot-com, and automobiles). With Bitcoin, most people just want to know where to buy it, not how much they should put into Bitcoin. There are some accounts of people taking out loans to buy Bitcoin, but that's mostly clickbait. Most people getting in are putting in a few hundred bucks, maybe a few thousand. I would say half the people I know only put in fifty dollars. Someone putting in fifty dollars wouldn't make much of a story worth clicking on.

Everyone is scared of Bitcoin; they liken it to gambling, which somehow makes them more reasonable. They set a very small limit they won't go over, an amount they wouldn't care about losing. It's their ""let it ride and let's see what happens"" money. That's not how people are with houses or with cars. That's definitely not the attitude during the dot-com era. In fact, there are minimum buy-ins for most investment vehicles. Bitcoin has no minimum, regardless what the price of one Bitcoin is, you can still buy one dollar's worth. In past financial bubbles, regular folks were putting in $100,000 and above. But if you're only putting in fifty dollars and it goes to twenty-five, it's a lot less painful than if your 100k goes to 50k. You're a lot less likely to pull the remainder of your twenty-five dollars out. (Which is why Bitcoin has consistently rebounded from drawdowns.)

Most Bitcoin owners are called hodlers. It's crypto slang for someone who will never sell no matter how much it drops. This culture of holding (hodling) makes Bitcoin robust. No other asset has an attitude where the majority of its owners will hold it no matter what. This is why Bitcoin is the only community who has a term for being a holder. For Bitcoin to go to zero, all the hodlers must sell; otherwise, it will correct back up again. This is unlike anything we've seen before (refer to my ""What Bitcoin Can Tell Us about Our Evolving Politics"" post). In my opinion, what can destroy Bitcoin isn't a financial collapse but rather better technology, something better than blockchains. Or perhaps it's an energy shortage. (Or perhaps artificial intelligence.)

3.) People say it's a bubble because it has no real value but that's a binary statement—if it has no real value, even at one penny, Bitcoin would be a bubble because it's still above zero. So understand when people say bubble, they don't mean it will no longer be a bubble if it goes down to 1k but down to 0. Do you believe it has no value? If you do, then any price is too much. If you do believe it has value, then what do you believe it is? And is its current price above or below the number you came up with? And if you come up with any number above zero, don't listen to anyone who says it has no real value. Even one dollar is infinitely bigger than zero. You might believe it's overvalued, but that's completely different from no value.

4.) Bitcoin is not dangerous because it's a bubble but because it's Bitcoin. It is always real value and but its real value is always fluid. This fluidity is what makes it dangerous. It can be a calm sea or a tsunami. That's the nature of fluidity. (Think of ""be like water"" from Taoism, introduced to the West by Bruce Lee.) You don't need to call it a bubble to understand its dangerous. (It actually makes your thinking less precise.) It's dangerous because it's Bitcoin. A revolution is dangerous because it's a revolution, not because it's a bubble.

Dot-com and housing were scary because it went up so much, but most of the money that pumped into it was domestic (localized and unsustainable). Bitcoin has been going up, but it's been going up for ten years, and it's not domestic, it's absorbing money from the globe (and still has a lot more to go). If you consider people from every country is putting in a little bit of money and have been doing so for ten years, Bitcoin's current price doesn't seem that high. In fact, many speculate, with all this in mind, if it is the world's store of value, it is still heavily underpriced.

5.) People keep referring to Tulip Fever when bringing up Bitcoin, where supposedly the Netherlands went crazy for tulip bulbs, which led to the bankrupting of the whole country; however, according to the Smithsonian and most historians, there never was Tulip Fever. (It was a very localized incident that lasted for about a week, and the prices were high but not Bitcoin high.)

To assume this many people for this long have been enthusiastic about something and not have it turn into a real thing has never happened. At this point, Bitcoin is already real. (You know what also used to get compared to Tulip Fever? The internet and the whole tech industry, especially startups. These are the same people calling Bitcoin a fad.)

Here's another thing people forget about bubbles, the housing market crashed, but we're still buying houses. Dot-com crash came and went, and the internet is still here, and we have more dot-coms than ever. A crash doesn't mean the end. It just means a crash, then life, so far, has gone on.",2018-01-14 17:22:55

dsmfzg0,emansipater,256,"Lots of misinformation and confusion in this thread and around this topic in general.  Let's try to improve the general knowledge base around channels a bit.

First, people get all tribalistic on things like channels because they see them as some sort of competitor to on-chain improvements, which is ridiculous.  They are complementary and each benefit the other.  Channels, sharding, plasma, they are all different points in the tradeoff matrix and we want *all* of them working well and working together to get the best overall experience for users.  One of them isn't a ""mistake"".  They are all just tools that should be applied in combination as appropriate to the context of whatever you are trying to accomplish.  **It's not channels vs something else.**  Let's just be clear on that.

Now, what *are* channels about?  They are about significantly reducing cost, decreasing latency, and improving user experience.  They are *not* about changing fundamental scaling curves, making transactions free, or solving certain classes of problems (i.e. [cryptokitties](https://twitter.com/technocrypto/status/938931332436152321)).  It's fine that they are limited by the underlying blockchain's capabilities, and by the amount of available capital.  The whole point of channels is that despite those things they are useful anyways because they greatly reduce fees and they make stuff happen right away without having to wait for confirmations.

Let's start addressing some of these specific claims.  First, ""millions of users imply that tons of changes per second must be broadcast and tons of routes recomputed every second, which is impossible"" is simply a false claim.  It's *hard* to make things work at that scale.  But all the linked sources are talking about is the normal things that any developer would run into when starting to build a system this big.  Broadcasting and routing are indeed significant challenges to resolve, but there is absolutely no way that they represent any kind of fundamental barrier.  Those comments are just about a particular implementation.  Just like scaling up any website or service, broadcasting and routing will have to be gradually redesigned to be more and more local and less and less global in order to handle increased load.  But in fact what the linked simulations demonstrate is that the existing approach is already close to sufficient for handling the maximum capacity Bitcoin's underlying chain could support anyways.  Which is **impressive**.  It means that Lightning will allow many more transactions to work on Bitcoin than Bitcoin would otherwise be able to do, at lower prices, and with those transactions not having to wait for confirmations.  And that is literally all that channels are trying to do.

Another claim:  ""If Lightning could work, it would anyway kill Bitcoin's point: a decentralised network for censorship-proof transactions"".  This is so weird.  People seem to have gotten really confused by this.  Just because there are hubs doesn't mean that the hubs have any *power*.  **Channel hubs are trustless**.  These hubs are not at all like banks that can take your money.  They are (at worst) entities who can force you to (briefly) use the blockchain.  Big whoop.  We're using blockchains anyways.  That ""worst case"" scenario is just the existing state of affairs for normal transactions.  Paypal has the ability to **permanently take your money**.  PLUS, you don't *have your choice of many different competing Paypals* that anyone can spin up in a heartbeat, anywhere in the world, like you do with hubs.  How do people not see that this is extremely different?

So, having something like Lightning on Ethereum is definitely a plus.  But why stop there?  Ethereum channels have the ability to do many things directly superior to what's being described here.  Examples:

&gt; Participants need to leave their computer on permanently

Nope.  Can easily make it so that you require a maximum of one person somewhere in the universe who has a copy of ""your side"" and wants free money.  Pretty safe assumption imo.  Or, contract directly with someone who has to pay you back if they fail to stand up for you while you're away.  Again, totally safe.  But even without those techniques you get to choose the interval of how long you can be completely offline for while still remaining totally safe, even on Lightning.  So you definitely don't have to be online all the time.  That's just false.

&gt; with private keys on the hard disk.

Again, nope, especially not for regular users.  Not only is it possible to use hardware wallets with channels, you can also have the full hot + cold wallet approach as well if you want.  Even hubs who are constantly active and don't want to manually authorise each routing attempt can have elaborate policies that prevent them from losing significant funds if their online machine is compromised.  Furthermore (thanks to zero knowledge proofs) we can route payments through people who are offline without needing access to their keys.  This *will* take a ton of work to build out for channels (just like it takes to build it out for on-chain the first time), but there is no sense in which using channels necessarily exposes you to higher risks of getting your funds stolen.  Channels are more complicated, but they're still able to be just as safe.


There are waaay too many errors and issues strictly limited to Bitcoin in that linked reddit post for me to address, but just hitting some of them:

-You don't necessarily have to be online to receive a channel payment  
-Hub fees are still going to be waaaay cheaper than on-chain transactions  
-Hubs can be based anywhere in the world with an internet connection.  They're not any more vulnerable than bittorrent trackers, nor do they require more resources to run, and bittorrent has been able to resist censorship just fine  
-On Ethereum it's easy to prevent someone from locking up channel funds at no cost to themselves  
-On Ethereum you definitely don't need to keep the whole history of the channel, just the latest ""active"" part of the state  
-Refilling/rebalancing doesn't inherently require on-chain transactions unless your channels are very badly designed

etc.

**There is no reason for a technically astute person to be anti-channels** in any form, even if Ethereum channels are way more awesome than Bitcoin ones.  Stop hating on channels, people.  They're cool!  As are shards!  As is plasma!  **More than one thing can be cool!**  I swear, if I knew half as many people *working* on channels as criticising them, we'd have amazing channel setups already.",2018-01-14 01:14:50

It's either written by people who have no clue what's going on, or people with an extreme stake in whatever they're secretly or not-so-secretly trying to sell you on. The former are usually informed by the latter.

The most compelling stories you can tell about bitcoin are the ones where someone made an extremely unlikely or risky bet and won big. Once people start seeing these stories they want in themselves, some people make big bets and win (and some people who made those bets lose, but that's not sexy so whatever), and the cycle continues.

The result of this intersection of new technology, social media, and irresponsible journalism makes bitcoin/cryptocurrencies look like some crazy new-age tech cabal of geeks making tons of money out of nothing. However:

&gt;Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg.

This is not true.

&gt;The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. 

I'm sure groups like this exist, but calling it/them 'the cryptocurrency community' is laughable.

&gt;some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners.

It's almost impossible to accurately estimate something like this. A lot of those coins are likely ownerless, thrown away back when they were worth basically nothing (or actually nothing).


I've been involved in bitcoin since 2011, and to me the story of bitcoin is a story of scammers. Before bitcoin was worth anything, people like pirateat40 and those around him found ways to make 'investing' in bitcoin look attractive by running a ponzi scheme. As bitcoin grew in value and prominence, the new scam was to create pointless bitcoin clones-- think dogecoin-- and convince people to buy them, promising the same success that bitcoin had seen previously. Now that that scam is slowly petering out (or becoming established as a legitimate way to 'daytrade crypto'), scammers are moving on to ICOs which are pretty much just a new class of ponzi penny stocks. Semi-anonymous people are trying to establish themselves on social media as cryptocurrency experts, even sometimes selling their 'advice' through patreon etc, all so that they can convince the people they're fleecing to buy or sell whatever will make the scammer the most money.

 The tech behind bitcoin is incredible and revolutionary, but it's in its very early stages. And most people interested in cryptocurrencies now aren't interested in the tech, they're interested in the 'moon', 'hodl', 'parabolic', whatever meme is going around to convince people they'll get rich without even trying like the lucky early adopters.

...so the result is that all the visible people in the crypto space are basically just showing off their wealth as much as possible to attract more people to keep the bubble going. The couple paragraphs at the end about the housekeeper is heartbreaking to me. People like her are almost certainly what's behind bitcoin's recent meteoric price spike, and people like her are going to be the ones who're financially destroyed when the markets finally realize that bitcoin basically doesn't even work yet.

The best move here is to basically ignore cryptocurrencies. If you're into risky investment, buy some realizing that it's very likely to completely collapse in value in the near future. There's no point in worrying about people who're heavily incentivized to brag about how much money they made from crypto (whether or not that's actually true). ",2018-01-15 06:26:06

dsp1d6t,AusIV,84,"Ethereum allows for open ended smart contracts. Some examples of things that can be done on the Ethereum chain that can't be done on bitcoin include:

* Token contracts - many ethereum based systems issue their own tokens. One neat example is the DAI stable token, which uses some complex logic and a system of price oracles to create a token that is pegged to the dollar. Right now, something like 30 of the top 100 coins on coinmarketcap.com exist on the ethereum block chain, and thus are all secured by the same hashing power. I know bitcoin has colored coins and the omni protocol, but those aren't quite as robust as token contracts can be.
* Exchange contacts - With numerous different tokens on the same chain, exchange contracts have cropped up to let you trade those coins on completely decentralized exchanges.
* Domain Name Registration - the ENS system allows you to create an auction to register your own domain name with no central authority.
* Crypto Kitties - someone wrote a set of contracts that lets you breed and sell digital cats on the blockchain. Maybe not the most useful thing, but it illustrates how non-fungible digital goods can be represented on the blockchain.
* More complex multisig rules - bitcoin has N-of-M multisig, but with ethereum you could allow one account to spend a certain allowance over a period of time without requiring signatures from the others. You can dream up all sorts of rules for how to distribute funds to the participants of the multisig wallets.

Aside from the things you can do with contacts, there are also some neat enhancements to the blockchain protocol. For example, ethereum includes a Merkel hash of the state trie in every block, which allows for more secure light clients, and allows faster syncing of nodes because you don't need everything in the block history to have a secure node at the latest block.

Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,

Highlights

• Suspicious trades on a Bitcoin currency exchange are linked to rises in the exchange rate.

• A single actor likely drove the USD/BTC exchange rate from $150 to $1000 in 2 months.

• Trading volume on all exchanges increased greatly on days with suspicious activity.

• Unregulated cryptocurrency markets remain vulnerable to manipulation today.

Abstract

&gt; To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.",2018-01-16 22:06:22

Everything is in red, and many coins are down -40/50% today.


---

**There are several factors that have caused the crash.**

---

1) **Bitconnect going under.**

Bitconnect was a website that was heavily advertised throughout social media platforms such as: Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. This website allowed people to put their money in a ""Trading Robot"", which supposedly was able to produce returns better than the average daytrader. 

This trading robot at the beginning was making returns of ""1% daily"", which others advertised to their friends. Friends put their money into Bitconnect, under the impression that the bot would make them money, would convince others to join the bot. 

Then when Bitconnect had around ~$3B USD worth of capital, their website suddenly shut down. They announced that they were shutting down their lending platform and any balances on the website would be refunded in a currency: ""Bitconnect Tokens"". Bitconnect Tokens were tied to the value of how the trading bot was doing. But since the trading bot had just been shut down/never existed, Bitconnect tokens effectively had 0 value. People started to realize this, they sold off their share, resulting in the value of Bitconnect Tokens dropping 90% in less than an hour. Many people lost everything they put on the website, causing mass selling of assets.

Worth noting that the ""trading robot"" never existed, and it was essentially a ponzi scheme.

---

2) **South Korean News Story**

A story went viral about South Korea banning trading of Cryptocurrencies. This caused people to sell their assets because they felt that without South Korea's presence in the market, prices would tank so they wanted to be the first ones out the door. This story was false, but by the time it was corrected the damage was done.

----

3) **Influx of New Money**

When people saw coins falling in value, they started to cashout. This is because they believed the coins would fall even lower. And with more people panic selling at a loss, this caused the price to drop even further. Therefore, more people panic sold because they believed the price would drop even further, repeat/etc...

Due to the massive growth in crypto over the past couple of months. Many people are entering the market and are new here, so they have not experienced this level of volatility and are not used to the price crashing. When the price went downwards, they had no idea what to do in order to minimize loses, so they just sold their portfolio.

---

4) **Bitcoin Futures**

The expiry date of Bitcoin Futures is coming soon, this is a contract that allows people to sell Bitcoin at specified price in the future. So profit booking is expected, causing the price to tank.

The end-game for a ponzi scheme is that at some point, when no more people come in and investors start demanding money, they go bust. But not before the people who created it all siphon away all the money they can.

The way this worked here was that people bought the BitConnect coins with BitCoins, and then ""lend"" it to the BitConnect platform. At the end of it, investors wouldn't get back their money in BitCoins, but the BitConnect coin - which is pretty much worthless everywhere else. 

So what happened was that BitConnect grew so big that it attracted media attention, and people rightfully called it out for what it was. (Edit) Due this and the recent bitcoin crash, they decided to close their platform, presumably keeping a lot of the BitCoins that people gave them for their worthless cryptocurrency.

dsuzglo,Khriswolfy,235,"Pentru necunoscatori, Bitconnect este (sau a fost) o platforma de tranzactionare/criptomoneda care promitea 1% castig pe zi pentru cei ce detineau aceasta moneda (Bitconnect aka BCC). In mare parte functiona ca o schema piramidala, in care investitorii timpurii beneficiau de castiguri substantiale in functie de banii investiti, dar intrucat banii nu pot sa cada din copaci si veneau de la investitorii noi, evident ca asa ceva nu era sustenabil.

Bomba a picat acum doua zile can Bitconnect a decis sa-si sisteze serviciile de depozitare si tranzactionare a monedei BCC, precum si inchiderea site-ului.. Moneda ajunsese la o capitalizare de piata de vreo 2 miliarde si jumatate de dolari iar pretul fiecarei monezi era undeva la 380 dolari. Ca urmare a acestui demers, in decurs de 2 zile pretul a scazut pe la 20 de euro si evident ca cei care au investit recent au pierdut cea mai mare parte a ""investitiilor lor"".

Patronii au incercat sa minimalizeze/musamalizeze teapa oferind un fel de tokenuri care cica ar urma sa le fie cumparate la acelasi pret de 380 dolari/token, dar e evident ca ei si-au luat banii, au inchis sandramaua si exista sanse extrem de mici ca bani sa poata fi recuperati.

De mentionat este faptul ca se stia demult ca Bitconnect este o schema piramidala si au existat numeroase incercari de a avertiza oamenii, dar evident ca multi au preferat sa ignore avertismenetele pentru ca doreau castiguri masive cat mai rapid. 

In momentul de fata piata criptomonedelor este inca intr-o relativa faza incipienta. Nu exista legi adaptate si multi profita de naivitatea si dorinta de imbogatire peste noapte a oamenilor. Desi exista foarte multe proiecte solide si monede care au potential, din pacate exista si situatii gen Bitconnect.

You think people look at YouTube and say ""wow, look at this magnificent platform, it enables the creativity of everyone and will even reward them for being successful without ever having to struggle with finding the connections or the complex means of reaching a TV audience"". Fuck NO! They look at it and think ""mmmmmmmmmm 🐈 videos"".

Regular people don't give a shit about our tech, principles or goals. All they care about is that there's an opportunity to make a quick buck and honestly it's one of the best things that could have happened to us.

There is a reason simple enough for regular people to care. A concept so simple that they can understand: put money in, get more money out, has better odds than the lottery. Yeah sometimes it bites them in the ass but most times it doesn't. 

This brings far more media and popular attention than our self-righteous goals ever could, and regardless of their motives, they are quickly and efficiently accelerating adoption which is what we need to reach our goals of an international decentralised etc etc. 

And, in the end, if adoption is strong enough, when a government decides to ban or over-regulate, you can also rely on these people to fight back, because they now have skin in the game and will try to protect it, thus resulting in strong opposition.

dsvpjuf,Fosforus,535,"Think of bitcoin as physical gold - if you want to transfer it to someone else, it will take time and money to ""ship"" it to them. Once upon a time, on-chain bitcoin transfers were very fast and very cheap, but as it grows in popularity we're seeing a bottleneck because blockchain space is limited. So fees and confirmation time are getting more onerous.

Now think of Lightning as legal claim certificates for that underlying gold. It's much, much quicker and cheaper to swap these certificates around. Every certificate is digitally signed by the owners of the underlying asset. But now, instead of paying and waiting to ship Alice some of your physical gold, you and Alice can just update a certificate that says ""Of the 2 bitcoin in this channel, 1.5 belongs to Bob, and 0.5 belongs to Alice."" Boom, done. 

These certificates can be redeemed on the actual blockchain at any time. Think of the blockchain as the supreme court - they will enforce the legality of your certificate, and make sure you can collect on your property. So whenever you want your real gold, you can get it. But if you are happy with just using the certificates, you can conduct pretty much all your business without ever ""going to court.""

EDIT: Hopefully this analogy also illustrates the importance of multi-layered scaling. Those who want to scale the bitcoin blockchain itself to handle all transactions are kind of saying ""I want the global supreme court to sign off on each and every coffee purchase I make.""",2018-01-19 03:56:26

A few years before, when Bitcoin was pretty much worthless, a WoW guildmate scammed him into trading several thousand WoW gold for several thousand Bitcoin. As soon as the trade went through he felt like an idiot. Now here he was, a sophomore in college, and he found the laptop. Bitcoin was worth $250 each and he was still had ""several thousand"".

After taking in everyone's comments, he decided to sell 40% and pay off all his college schooling and have a bunch left over to buy a car and a house, and keep the other 60%.

dsxcf5f,Homie_Domie,224,"Hi everybody it's me again. I made a similar post 2 months back and I think it's time to reevaluate the situation at the moment (here the link to the old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7esw3e/correlation_between_transactions_and_market_price/?st=jcm58607&amp;sh=b46c2ead ).

So back then we were hovering around 300$ and I wanted to show that the evaluation of Ethereum follows nicely with the usage of the network. Since then we have seen a massive increase in usage and price followed.

Now let's use this graph again to discuss our situation and ask ourselves: will we repeat June 2017 now? From my standpoint the ether value is determined by the usage of the ethereum network. And while in June 2017 the price increased quickly due to hype. The usage was still only slowly increasing. This lead to a overvaluation at that point which needed a strong correction.
This time we have another situation. The usage has increased a lot due to the first small dapps running and a lot of people joined subsequently. So when we compare usage to price now and assume the same laws as 2 years ago still hold, we have achieved this price in a more organic way this time.

So where will we go from here? Wish I could say that. I can only say the following: if scaling solutions come in this year and the network is able to grow further (which I assume), price should further increase. If on the other hand price drops while usage stays the same -&gt; you got yourself a nice buying opportunity. I know I am still holding comfortably :-).

Bitcoin btw. still doesn't follow any laws and in my opinion the rational market will crash it at some point heavily ( ... but this is just my personal opinion).",2018-01-20 01:41:22

dsxfzdq,Meistermalkav,153,"So. Dann wollen wir mal. 

Schleswig Holstein bringt seinen Zwillingsbruder Kiel mit. Lang, blond, gutaussehend. Beide stehen in der Ecke, seuftzen, und trinken Becks. Höhepunkt der Party: Wünschen sich Schwule Mädchen. 

Mecklemburg Vorpommern bringt den Mett Igel mit, und eine Flasche Polenschnapps. Schwerin bringt noch etwas Lakritze. Steht am anderem ende der Party, und schwärmt für saarland.  

Hamburg bringt ne kräftige Kokspersönlichkeit, und Döner für die ganze Mannschaft. Auf der Manischen Seite ist es links, aufgekratzt, macht kaputt was euch kaputtmacht, auf der depressiven ist es rechts konservativ und findet alles scheiße. Spielt Kicker mit Bremen. Bringt Koks und Nutten, aber nur damit Sankt Pauli auch mal für was gut ist. 

Bremen bringt ne Kiste Becks, und nen Kater. Hat nen guten Vorsatz sich dieses mal nicht ins Koma zu saufen, lässt es aber sein als es den ganzen Fremdländischen Alkohol sieht. Positiv: Kann nach der Party die Kiste Becks wieder mitnehmen. Chronisch Blank, hat aber medizinisches Valium gegen Einschlafbeschwerden. Ist chronisch etwas langsam, aber kommt blendend mit Hamburg aus. 

Bremerhaven und Sankt Pauli: wurden eingeladen, da jeder schon mal von ihnen gehört hatte, sitzen aber den ganzen Abend rauchend beisammen und zocken Fifa über die Konsole. Sind zu klein um was mitzubrigen, aber mal ehrlich, wir wissen alle dass das nicht Oregano ist  was die da rauchen. Abver als Kinder von Bremen und Hamburg sind die ganz ok. 

Niedersachsen: Hat seinen Großen Bruder mitbebracht, Hannover. Hannover studiert BWL und Forstwirtschaft, und hat Neidersachsen ein Poloshirt seiner Verbindung geschenkt. Hannover ist als einziger im Stande autozufahren, da er nach der Party noch ne Vorlesung hat. Beide bringen Buletten und Kartoffelsalat, und Verträge falls jemand mit ihnen mitfährt das Auto nicht vollzukotzen. 

Brandenburg: Derzeit arbeitslos. Bringt Pottsdamm und Berlin. Jeder mag Berlin, also reicht das wenn sich Berlin betrinkt, und scheiße baut. Brandenburg ist der designierte Fahrer von Berlin, Potsdamm ist Berlins Bitch. Pottsdamm ist viel schüchterner als Berlin, und unterhält sich die Party über mit der Hauskatze. Höhepunkt der Party: Kifft sich so weg dass er für den rest des Abends von Sankt pauli und Bremerhaven als Sitzgelegenheit missbraucht wird. Nicht mal ärgerlich deswegen, hofft nur dass er ne kopie der bilder kriegt. Liebenswerter Chaot. 

Sachsen Anhalt: Veterinärmedizin. Hat sich vorgenommen dieses mal nicht zu viel zu trinken. Bringt ne Flasche Wein. Weiß dass Geld etwas knapp ist, bleibt aber nach der Party mit Thüringen, um beim Aufräumen zu helfen. Magdeburg bringt anständige Musik. Versucht krampfhaft nicht mit Thüringen zu tanzen. 

Nordreihnwestfalen.... Erstsemester Jura und BWL. Hat das Geld mit daytrading von Cryptoärungen gemacht. Laut. Bringt den Mittelpunkt der Party. Kommt in ner Autokolonne. Hat Catering für die Ganze Mannschaft organisiert. Ohne sich mit wem abzusprehen. Man hat ja Kredit. 

Sachsen: Hat nen Meister. Bringt Dresden und Leipzig, seine Kunststudentinnen Schwestern. Nach zwei mal am Schnapps riechen sind die eh an allem interessiert was halbwegs männlich aussieht. Oder sich gegenseitig. 

Thüringen: Bringt seine Cousine Erfurt, und organisiert das Party parken. Erfurt ist etwas freundlicher, und leichter zu verstehen, und weniger imposant als Thüringen mit seiner Lonsdale Jacke, und den Armtattoos, aber es ist doch etwas komisch wenn die die Türsteher machen wollen. 

Hessen: Kommt im Selben BMW wie Frankfurt. Viertes Semester BWL. Nach vier Minuten ist Sankt Pauli sein Koks, Hamburg sein Gras, und Bremen sein Valium los. Verbringen den Ganzen Abend damit mit der NRW Clique wetttrinken zu machen. Die bullen können dich nur einmal hoppsnehmen, also wenn du schon betrunken fährst, solltest du es auch mischen. Frankfurth bringt das checkbuch. Nach dem das startup verkauft ist kann man ja auch mal etwas Geld unter die Leute bringen. 

Rheinland Pfalz: Bringt Austauschstudenten. Hat selber nie studiert, aber wird immer rangezogen, wenn man wen exotisches braucht. Bringt weißwein. Hatte mal was mit Bitcoin, hat die Festplatte noch irgendwo.

Saarland: Bringt Boxbeutel die es von Mutti bekommen hat. Spricht gutes Französich, ist sehr technik affin, und kümmert sich um das Sound system. Verbringt die Party damit auf die eigenen Hände zu starren, und sich zurück vor's Keyboard zu wünschen. 

Bayern: Hat gesagt bekommen es soll catering organisieren. Hundsbeleidigt, dass NRW das Catering mitgebracht hat. Verbringt den abend damit auf die schmarotzer zu schimpfen, ohne sich eingestehen zu wollen dass es das freiwillig gemacht hat. Studiert nicht, hat aber einen trustfund. Verbringt den Abend außen beim Rauchen, und am Handy telefonieren. Beschwert sich bitterlich bei Österreich, dass es von niemand gemocht wurde. Österreich sagt dass wenn es noch einmal nachts wachgeklingelt wird es in bayerns gesicht tattoowiert dass es ein Arschkind ist. bekommt einen nervenzusammenbruch und macht einen Aufstand. Nur zufrieden wenn es auf allen Handyvideos der Party zu sehen ist. 

Franken: Kleiner Bruder von Bayern. Angekotzt von Bayerns Diva gehabe, möchte mit allen befreundet sein. Tanzt mit allen, macht jeden scheiß mit. Versteht keinen Spass. Sehr beleidigt wenn ihn jemand als Bayern bezeichnet. Schwört Todfeindschaft. Wird gedulded weil es Bayern zur Tobsucht bringt. 

Baden Wüttenberg: Bringt als einziger Chips und Gummibärchen. Hilft beim Snacks machen. Hat die Location gemietet, das Geld alleine vorgestreckt, und will es nicht wiederhaben, da man sowas für gute freunde ja mal tut. Wünscht sich nichts sehnlicher als dass sich jemand an seinen Namen erinnern könnte. Sein kleiner Bruder Stuttgart geht durch alle Taschen auf der Party, und l""eiht"" sich Geld aus den Portmonaies. Er wird es wieder zurückzahlen, ehrlich... ",2018-01-20 02:38:05

dsyrk8a,thisisgettingworse,136,"Ponzi schemes are any form of cash collection mechanism that offers to pay dividends to anyone who recruits other users.  You also earn a stake in whoever those users recruit and so it goes all the way down the line.

A good ponzi can last for years, and for all the early adopters and most of the midterm adopters the rewards can be life altering.  You only need convince a few people to join, then forget it as they will convince others etc. etc. 

However, BCC wasn't actually a proper ponzi - it didn't offer higher rewards if you talked your grandma into joining (I don't think).  It instead offered some strange method of loaning and hinted (but never stated) a guaranteed return.  In fact, if you read their website it gave itself credibility by not guaranteeing that the same returns would always be possible, but under normal market conditions this is what it has achieved.  It wasn't lying, it did extremely well for a lot longer than most people thought.  

It's a fact of life that there will always be idiots out there.  However, how many of us got into Bitcoin when it was pennies?  How many of us bought ETH at 0.13cents?  How many of us got the free distribution of XRB?  To the outside observer, we are all currently investing in a gigantic ponzi scheme.  If this all falls down to zero (a possibility), how many people will have had their dreams destroyed?  

It isn't about the money.  It's about the dream of escaping the daily grind.  Crypto is for many of us, our one hope of escape.  Most of us may not have invested much capital, but we have given it our soul.  If BTC went down and took the rest of crypto with it, how would you feel?  All your colleagues who never invested, friends who never invested, family who never invested would all think you're a cunt who fell for a pile of bullshit.

dsxc7nm,KrankyPenguin,106,"The description of the show they made actually explains a lot. Adam, Lawrence, James, Elyse, and Bruce were all coaches for the Tiberius Method which was created by Corner Mandingo(I believe that is how you spell it). Their main goal was to have everyone in the audience become better people. 

[SPOILERS] [SPOILERS] I'm not sure how to spoiler tag :/

Another WARNING: I would suggest that you just not read this haha. It was a really cool show, and if they do it again you don't want to be spoiled!!

- Adam taught about becoming beautiful. He brought two people on stage to get makeovers. Brother Lawrence and Brother Elyse came out to give the actual makeover. This makeover included a new t-shirt, a sonic hat, and a spider-man/Tom Cruise face mask.

- James taught about inner beauty(muscles and strength). He lifted 2,000 pounds, brought someone on stage and injected them with steroids to then lift the same weight, brought out Chak(?)(Bruce) who was Corner Mandingo's trainer. Chak pretty much died trying to lift the weight. James started an audience workout routine while they dragged Chak off the stage. 

- Bruce taught about becoming rich with Bitcoin. This involved bringing two people on stage. They each got bitcoins and then had to bet on the live bitcoin price chart. If they were right they get another coin and if they were wrong then they give Bruce back a coin. Adam and James then went into the audience and gave a ton of people bitcoins. Then everyone played that betting game together by throwing coins at Bruce on stage.

- Elyse taught about being a total woman. She brought three people on stage to 'punch' out Trump, Weinstein, Spacey, and Ben Affleck's Batman. BUT it turns out that they were actually four powerful women underneath those masks. BUT it turns out that it was just Adam, James, Lawrence, and Bruce under THOSE masks.

- Lawrence finally taught about how to get laid. He brought two people on stage to sit in a dinner scene. He handed them cards with lines to read. These lines got spicier and spicier. Adam played the chef in the back, Bruce was the waiter, and James and Elyse were having dinner together. Bruce spilled spaghetti on Elyse and then picked up that same spaghetti to serve to the audience members. One of the daters had to eat the spaghetti because his line told him to do so. Midway through the two audience members saying their lines, James and Elyse pulled guns on all of them. They threatened to shoot the two audience members if they said another word. They kept on delivering lines. Then Bruce tore off his waiter disguise because he was an undercover cop. They were all pointing guns at each other while Lawrence was on the ground still giving the audience members lines of dialogue. Adam then came out and spilled spaghetti which caused everyone to shoot each other. One of the daters had to give CPR to Adam who was shot on the ground. Then Bruce went to give mouth to mouth to Adam. Lawrence then froze the scene to show that Bruce and Adam just had SEX.

- They brought out the perfect man Dakota who turned out to be Geoff.

- End of show where they all became their true selves, said that everyone should just be true to who they are, and then thanked everyone for watching their content and coming out.

Hopefully I got everything!

If you're not using money you need, dips and corrections ought not bother you.  This space hasn't even cracked 1 Trillion marketcap yet.  And as it evolves, blockchain technology will be ubiquitous.  So there's a strong chance that at least Bitcoin, and many other top players, will have a long and profitable career ahead of them. 

If this technology begins to underpin the activities of *all* businesses and human endeavors, as there's reason to believe it may, then we are looking at value well in excess of 1 trillion.  You are all early adopters of the next big thing.  Be happy about that, and put money into it you can afford to lose, and **stop chasing the daily highs**. 

A modest investment, invested smartly, will make you extremely wealthy in five or ten years.  But you need to be in the mindset to prepare for that grind.  That's what you're looking at.  Be ready for that.  Be **ok** with that.

So unless you're doing TA for swing-trade analysis, I really *don't* recommend people pay too much attention to the charts and the volatile swings.  It will only lead you to make emotionally impulsive decisions that won't serve you. 

Market will go up, market will go down.  And then, up again.  Pay attention only to actual, legitimate news about potential catastrophic failures in Bitcoin that may lead to its permanent erasure of value.  As it stands right now, no such thing exists.

I have a problem with the initial analysis:  the amount is greatly inflated by the large number of ""mixing"" transactions the network is currently processing...  Each set of mixing transactions accounts for ~200 ETH ""moved"" on the blockchain, and they usually account for upwards of 80% of the total ""value"" in each block.  Some examples: [[1]](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4938476&amp;p=3) [[2]](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4938478&amp;p=3) [[3]](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=4938388&amp;p=2).  The transactions in question are the ones interacting with addresses like [this one](https://etherscan.io/address/0x305cbba69ddbf051f2bf069fa7b59d73881ad46a), where there are always 2 incoming and 3 outgoing transactions whose sum is always 100 ETH.

Granted, it's hard to filter out such activity (as it would be on any chain), but it's certainly reminiscent of a sort of spam campaign like Bitcoin has seen, which artificially inflates the usage number (accounts, value transferred, fees, etc). 

If I could ever get my archive node to sync (fucking parity constantly panics around 1M blocks), I'll run some analysis on these accounts and see just how much of the total transferred value they account for.  I'm guessing it'll be quite high.

There are many other scams out there, but I haven't included them here because many of them are controversial, so deciding with great certainty if some are scams would be much more difficult, and because making this post is already a lot of work. 

I had a list of people here who were promoting some of the above scams on Youtube, but I've decided to remove it at least temporarily as some users suggested. For now, I'll work on adding to the above lists, then in the next few days I'll probably (at least partially) restore what I've removed along with additions that people posted in this thread. If you really want to see the list of youtubers I had here, send me a PM. And for those who have sent me a PM that I haven't responded to yet, be patient, I'm taking a break now and I still have messages that I haven't had time to read yet.

Today I will attempt to value Ethereum, one of the core holdings of most portfolios and the #2 largest cryptocurrency on the market.

**If you already know about Ethereum, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Section A: A fundamental analysis of ETH


**Tech/Asset overview**

Ethereum is a decentralized ""smart contract"" platform, and is said to be the first [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) blockchain. In addition to executing payment-style transactions like Bitcoin, arbitrary code (programs) can be run through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every node in the Ethereum network executes operations within the EVM to ensure redundantly correct execution and relies on consensus to agree on the answer.

Ethereum runs of a token called Ether (ETH). The protocol uses a pricing mechanism called Gas, and this gas limit is paid in Ether. This gas limit is the amount of compute power you're asking the network to run in order to execute your smart contract or transaction. The Ethereum protocol actually defines an amount of gas required to process every single instruction available within Solidity, Ethereum's programming language. 



**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**

Ethereum's ability to run decentralized smart contracts opens the possibility for decentralized applications/organizations. What Ethereum proposes in effect is a global computer that could not only handle store of value transactions but also eventually emulate many of the functions of companies like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Amazon, and Kickstarter, but without the inefficient bureaucracies and the other intermediaries who take a slice of the pie.

Currently Ethereum's platform underlies much of the new ICOs being created. In the future its expected that dApps would run on the blockchain and allow companies to offload much of their processing needs onto the blockchain. In essence its almost like running your organization on a cloud, except its one that its trustless and secured b the blockchain structure.


**What is the Development Team like?**

There are currently 35 developers participating in the open source development process, however the direction is controlled by the Ethereum Foundation:

http://www.ethereum.org/foundation

Ethereum's founder Vitalik Buterin is probably as close as we'll ever get to having a figurehead for the cryptocurrency movement, and his opinion on what's going on in the space is closely followed. He attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, when he received the Thiel Fellowship in the amount of $100,000, and went to work on Ethereum full-time.


**What current product/partnership exists?**

Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by enterprise software companies. Interested parties include:

* Microsoft
* IBM
* JPMorgan Chase
* Deloitte
* Innovate UK (cross-border payments prototype)

Currently Barclays, UBS, Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.

In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members. By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including CME Group, Toyota Research Institute, Samsung SDS, Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Cooley LLP, Merck KGaA, DTCC, Deloitte, Accenture, Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, ING, and National Bank of Canada.

You can see more at:

http://entethalliance.org/members/

**What is the roadmap going forward?**

The Ethereum framework is continually evolving, with a major Constantinople software update expected this year to revolve around moving from POW to Proof of Stake, with the [Casper POS protocol](http://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost). In Casper style proof of stake, anyone can participate in block production by posting a bond. After posting a bond you have an opportunity to bet on which block will be included next to the main chain. The incentives are such that you make money by betting with the eventual consensus and lose money by betting against the consensus. Any crypto-graphically provable misbehavior results in the forfeit of the bond.

**What are the weaknesses/problems related with this cryptocurrency?**

* Ethereum isn't as developer friendly as some of its competitors in many ways. For example NEO has a compiler that supports multiple mainstream programming languages, while Ethereum has for a long time relied on Solidity. Good news is that there are projects in the works to bring full support for more common languages like Java and C++

* Ethereum has a larger ""attack surface"" in that it allows executable code on a distributed system. What do we do when some criminal person (or group of people) exploits a bug in the smart contract?

* Difficult long-term scaling considerations. While cryptokitties brought the Ethereum network to its knees because of the 25 tps limit, the POS migration will hopefully allow an exponential increase in throughput.

The employee was telling him that the 1050 would play ""pretty much any game on mostly ultra settings."" 

So I spoke up by saying ""that depends on what kind of frame rates you expect.""

A brief conversation ensued that ended with the guy leaving empty handed and planning to check out Craigslist, while the blue shirt was giving me the evil eye pretty fuckin' hard. 

Oh well.

I mean that 1050 was priced higher than I paid for my RX 480 new.  Every day that passes, we stray farther from the light.

Edit: alright here's how it went, with as much detail as I can remember. Judge for yourselves. D = Dude, B = blueshirt, M = me.

D: ...i mean I was really looking for a 1070, maybe even a 1080.

B: yeah unfortunately with bitcoin and etherium and whatnot GPU's are in horrible demand and hard to keep in stock. It's like first come first serve if we get any inventory.

D: I see. So is this 1050 any Good?

B: I mean it'll play anything, mostly anything.  On ultra settings, or mostly everything on ultra.

D: really?

B: yeah it's pretty good.

M: Well that kinda depends on what sorta frame rates you expect.
D: (looks at me)

M: I mean how smooth the graphics are.

D: so is this going to be choppy or is it going to actually game?

B: it'll do great for you I'm sure.

M: what are you playing?

D: been out of it for a while, but I'm wanting to play the new doom, the new tomb raider, my kids want to play Minecraft...

B: yeah it'll handle those no problem depending on your settings.

M: yeah it'll be better than your integrated graphics for sure but might not be as good as you're hoping...1080p monitor?

D:yep

M:what's the rest of your pc like?

D:i7 or i5...i dunno. It's like a year old.

B: (just staring awkwardly)

M: I mean...the 1050 isn't a bad card. But if it were my money I might hold off for now and either wait for that 1070 to be in stock somewhere, or try to snag like a 960 or 970 used. 

D: why not get this? 

M: overpriced for what it is. I mean...They're selling the 580 for nearly twice what I paid for my 480, they're basically the same card. And it's better than the 1050 by a lot. And it's almost what they're asking for this 1050

B: (looks ticked off) that's not even the same thing

M: right that's what I'm saying. 

B:....

D: maybe I'll hold off for now. What about used? 

M: I guess a 960 is probably close to a 1050, and the 970 would be better. But ya know, used parts...buyer beware.

D: huh.  We'll it's been very informative, thanks for the info gentlemen. (Places 1050 on the shelf, walks off)

B: huff

M: (looks at rgb drink coasters)

The whole interaction took place in about 2 to 3 minutes. I wasn't  trying to motherfuck the blueshirt by any means, I don't go out of my way to be a pest and/Or a dick in public  (trust me).

dt1lauu,Cobra-Bitcoin,200,"&gt; You should really reconsider and start supporting Bitcoin Cash.

I'm less hostile to Bitcoin Cash than I was a few months back. Truth is it's not *that* bad. You just send a payment, the person doesn't have to be always online like with LN, and you don't have to deal with issues like channel fraud, or opening/closing channels. Just wait for 6 confirmations, and you can be reasonably certain nothing will go wrong, and if it does, it'll be a 51% attack and public knowledge. But with LN, you have instant payments, but there are many subtle ways your channel can get messed with, and you need to always be vigilant. I'd rather be vigilant for those 6 confirmations than have to be on alert for fraud for however long I have my channel open.

It's unclear to me who would use LN. If anyone wants to buy something, it's much simpler with something like Bitcoin Cash. If you want to send really small micropayments, it's also much simpler with BCH because you don't incur fees on opening/closing channels like you would with LN. I think LN will take a very long time to work out all the UX issues, and to be developed and adopted in e-commerce. I wish people would stop hyping it so much and making it seem like it solves everything. Often these people are just hyping it for political purposes. When it comes to payments, the *simplest* tool will win.

The problem with Bitcoin Cash is that it's too centralized and easily changed. Solo developers like /u/deadalnix have way too much power to change the system. This was proven with the whole drama around the DAA algorithm and how he strong-armed his own solution and didn't coordinate with the other teams on a better solution. He also rushed out a hard fork to be adopted in a few weeks. It's very dangerous for the integrity of a cryptocurrency to have one man able to change something as critical as the difficult adjustment in just a few weeks with barely any discussion.

Another problem with Bitcoin Cash is how it's marketed. Roger Ver presents ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" as two separate versions of Bitcoin, it's a confusing mess because he tries to use Bitcoin.com to cater to both, as if they both fall under some sort of ""meta Bitcoin"". There is only one Bitcoin, just stick with that and promote one thing, not two. You can't jerk off two dicks with one hand. If he hates ""Bitcoin Core"" so much, why does he help to promote it? It makes no sense and looks ridiculous. Probably something to do with making more money from both sides, dunno.

The mining on Bitcoin Cash is too centralized (same with Bitcoin), you guys can change the PoW and get much more decentralized distribution of mining and it'll be easier to claim to be ""Satoshi's Bitcoin"", because back when Satoshi was around, mining actually used to be quite decentralized. That and putting more emphasis on running full nodes would be good, ignore frauds like Craig who harp on about how irrelevant full nodes are. Full nodes are important in letting you know that the rules of the system are being obeyed, otherwise you're basically putting all trust in miners. This is even more important when you don't dominate your PoW algorithm, it's very easy for rogue Bitcoin miners to attack you (and likely financially profitable for them too).",2018-01-22 12:12:04

A January slump is normal, but the downturn is also associated with Indian and Chinese governments considering clampdowns on crypto currency. Furthermore, with the advent of other alternative crypto currencies, crypto miners have been buying up graphics cards like crazy. As an avid PC gamer and builder, seeing places like Microcenter and Bestbuy and online retailers having graphics cards perpetually out of stock and / or being sold online for double the price they were last month, it's a bit annoying to say the least for those who want to upgrade their graphics cards, but cannot because the crypto miners are buying them as soon as the stock arrives and are driving up the price and demand big time. Many places have instituted a 1 to 2 card per customer limit as a response. Check out some of the posts in r/hardware, r/pcgaming, and r/nvidia, and you will see what I am talking about...

Still, Bitcoin has a clear and definitive purpose and *will* grow despite being technologically outclassed by its peers. 


1) it's a pool of liquidity. That will probably also change as Altcoins grow, but at the moment, for most cases, you need Bitcoin to get that Altcoin you want so badly(for most cases at least).

2) the power of branding. Cryptocurrencies are still extremely small and we're still all pioneering a new market. Bitcoin is what people mention whenever your friends tell you shit about Crypto. No random stranger will ever approach you and tell you how great of an investment maidsafecoin is. BTC brings people into the sphere, which is exactly what we need, growth. It's a name. 

3) you can deduce from 1) and 2) that Bitcoin will grow in value and it's not going to peak at 30k or whatever. People are quick to write off Bitcoin. Adoption is a slow and time consuming process, in the meantime BTC will server as a store of value and obviously as a speculative investment. 

4) Muh lightning network. Ethereum has scaling issues aswell. The transition from PoW to PoS is going to take time, this is not some overnight issue, where they just snap their fingers and the issue will resolve itself. 


Bitcoin has a clear and definitive purpose and is here to stay along with Altcoins. Obviously the BTC dominance is going to fall as time passes. People here are too quick to judge, simply by phrasing their so dear Youtube channels. Chill out and give the stuff time to grow. That cardano you love so dearly?

**Metcalfe's Law Ratios**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) can be applied to cryptocurrencies as well, as Dr. Ken Alabi from Stony Brook University showed in his paper *Digital blockchain networks appear to be following Metcalfe's Law*. The ratio I'm going to use is simply the market cap divided by the square of active users and transactions. This is a relative valuation metric, and simply is meant to compare to other cryptocurrencies, not give an inherent valuation. 

I will use two different metrics, the peak 1Y active users and total daily transactions as per BitInfoCharts.com:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Price |  $12,867 | $1,159 | $211
Market Cap | $216 Billion | $112 Billion | $11 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 240,919 | 982,588 | 67,033
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions)| 3.72 | 0.12 | 2.45
Metcalfe Ratio (Active Addresses) | 0.17 | 0.10 | 0.04

Under this model Ethereum is relatively undervalued compared to Bitcoin and Litecoin, although Litecoin is cheaper on a active address basis.

#Equation of Exchange Model

Ethereum is actually quite difficult to evaluate because of its breadth of scope. In simplifying into a model we are inherently going to have to place limits on what we think the platform can achieve, even though platform cryptoassets could in theory have limitless use cases as they are simply a launching pad for all sort of other projects build on their own cryptocurrencies. Which makes defining the Total Addressable Market (TAM) a bit messy. Currently Ethereum is used as the underlying platform for most of the ICOs that launch on the market, so it has that as a definitative use case today. However in my model I will consider that a secondary TAM, with the primary TAM being the broad scope of internet applications.

The Equation of Exchange model is very adaptable to any cryptoasset that has an expected future utility that would need to be supported by a monetary base. This model is inspired by by Chris Brurniske's blogpost on creating a Cryptoasset Valuation. It uses the same underlying equation, the Fisher's Equation of Exchange (Quantity Theory of Money):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange

The equation MV= PQ can be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency, where 

* M is the monetary base (market cap) of the cryptocurrency
* V is the velocity of the currency
* P is the price of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction
* Q is the quantity of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction

In order to value a cryptocurrency, we need to figure out the equation M = PQ/V for each year in future, divide it by the expected outstanding float and then discount the entire equation based on the year being forecast. In my model I project the expected utility out 12 years until the year 2030, discounting back to 2018 and adding on a perpetuity for all years past 2030. 

The term PQ is essentially the value of the utility that the ""digital economy"" of the cryptocurrency generates, for example for a cryptocurrency that focuses on being a token for online gaming (like FUN), the total value of the economy would be the total amount bet with. Once you divide that by velocity and assign it on a per float basis, you can discount it back to the present day to get the total present value of future utility. In essence the equation becomes:

*[(PQ/V)/Outstanding Float]/(1+r)^n*

where r is the discount rate and n is the number of years pasts 2018.

The first section (Float Outstanding Schedule) aims to find the number of Ether that will be required to support the fiat monetary base. With the Casper POS incoming likely in 2018 or early 2019 (expected to start at 100 million circulating supply), we will have a certain percent of Ether being essentially taken out of monetary circulation and fixed in nodes and staking pools. Exactly what percentage will be staked is unknown, but the target return rate per year that seems to be speculated on is between 4-8%. Now if we look at other cryptos we can see that POS coins tend to have over 50% locked up in stake, for example [PIVX currently has 63% of the total supply staked](http://pivx.cryptonode.co), so I will assume a 50% ratio. In addition the current POS emission rate will be between 0.5-2% according to Vitalik Buterin, I will assume the lower end of that range for the entire simulation as he also mentions that once they add partial transaction fee burning it may decrease down to zero or even lower. Finally the final mined Ether will all occur in 2018 as its expected that the POS switch occurs once the total supply surpasses the 100 million ETH mark.

For the transactional market schedule I will define a primary and secondary TAM (Total Addressable Market). Today ICOs are the biggest part of the Ethereum network, but I put them as a secondary TAM because over the long term I expect dApps and other blockchain organizations to become the primary focus. That's why my primary total addressable market will be estimated by looking the market for internet services and applications, which could include everything from ecommerce platforms to content stream providers. In order to this I'm taking the total annual revenues of the top [10 internet companies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Internet_companies), which comes out to about $366 billion. This will be the actual market for which the Adoption S-Curve will be applied, while the secondary market will simply increase linearly by a CAGR from its initial size. For the secondary TAM I'm using an estimate for the total ICO market, which I'm assuming to be at $10 billion and growing by 10% per year. This seems reasonable as the ICO market has grown explosively from 280 million to [nearly $5 billion in 2017.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/outofasia/2017/12/18/icos-in-2017-from-two-geeks-and-a-whitepaper-to-professional-fundraising-machines/) and even just the Telegram ICO alone is expected to go to [around $2 billion.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/biggest-ico-ever-is-said-to-grow-as-telegram-targets-2-billion) The short term (up to 2030) growth rate for the primary TAM will be set at 15% because this is such a fast growing segment of the economy however past that it will decline to 5% for the long term.


To estimate future velocity I took the transaction history from CoinMarketCap and currently the [velocity since the beginning of December is 2.1](https://i.imgur.com/mOG7LAe.jpg). However the Casper changes should decrease this, so I'm going to assume a 1.6 velocity. The discount rate I used is 26%, or just a little over 3X the long term expected return on large cap equity (around 8%) since Ethereum is generally as ""safe"" of an asset as you can get within crypto. 

We can best express [the output of this model](https://i.imgur.com/oQdP6Uh.png) in terms of a 2x2 matrix that looks at the sensitivity of the discount rate used for the net present value of future utility (a measure of expectations of risk) against the Primary TAM adoption rate (a measure of implementation success):

Discount Rate / Primary TAM Adoption -&gt; | 1% | 3% | 5% | 8% | 10% |  
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
24% Discount Rate | $1,173.75| $1,651.04 | $2,128.32 | $2,605.61 | $3,082.90 | 
26% Discount Rate | $1,039.36 | $1,433.37 | $1,827.38 | $2,268.91 | $2,182.40 |
32% Discount Rate | $769.18 | $1,005.84 | $1,242.50 | $1,479.16 | $1,834.14 | 


# Conclusion

My base assumption is that Ethereum achieves 5% adoption within the primary TAM by 2030 and that it is risky enough to justify a 26% discount rate for present value calculations. Under these assumptions the resulting valuation comes out to $1,827.38, about 60% undervaluation from its current price. 

Are these assumptions reasonable? The ICO market is likely being underestimated if it continues to grow at anything approaching the current rate. Ethereum has a functioning product and value today as a platform for a variety of cryptos, and hence processes more transactions than all other cryptocurrencies combined (including Bitcoin). This makes it undervalued compared to its big Coinbase competitors. However other platforms like NEO are now also incoming, so ultimately it will depend on whether Ethereum can move beyond the initial utility of ICO platform to launching dApps that threaten to disrupt established internet services. In my model the dApp (Primary TAM) market only surpasses the secondary TAM of ICOs in 2023. By the end of 2030 the dApp market has risen to $100 billion, meaning that the ETH not staked is supporting a digital economy of almost $130 billion. Given the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and just how many companies are interested in this platform, that very well may be the case.

I also like how much downward protection there is. Even in my most pessimistic scenario (1% Primary TAM adoption and 32% discount rate), the valuation comes out to $769.18, which we were at not too long ago. In fact the entire 1% scenario has us at roughly at the present valuation. Personally I suspect that the long predicted ""flippening"" may finally occur in 2018 if Bitcoin's troubles persist and Ethereum has successful dApp launches. Until this target price is reached I plan to continue holding.

*Disclaimer: ETH is currently one of my core holdings. This is NOT meant to be a recommendation to buy/sell, nor is it a prediction of short term price movement. It is simply my own interpretation of how the long term valuation should be arrived at, and uses my own assumptions for the future. Please research for yourself and decide based on your own expectations of future utility. This is more meant to stimulate discussion about valuation of this asset class.*

&gt; Can you point out where he wrote that? I must have missed it.

He wrote it here in rbtc.

He also wrote some other stuff that I will paraphrase here since I agree with it.

This is about to hurt your feelings, so before I do that, I want to reiterate as I have done many times that your contributions to Bitcoin will be recorded for all to see for all time.  Your work here has been invaluable and your legacy will live on.

That said.  This guy pretty much nailed it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp4qfez/

At the time that Amaury selected the DAA to go into Bitcoin ABC you wrote in frustration that the other three teams (Classic, XT, and BU) had already reached consensus on another DAA a month prior.  [That is also what you told me when we discussed it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79s99v/without_amaury_sechet_and_bitcoinabc_bitcoin_cash/dp532n4/)

&gt; We have been working for 3 months on improving deadalnix' failure with the EDA. We have great solutions that were universally seen as ""good enough"".

I will repeat what I told you then.  The three of you sat around apparently waiting for some permission to act, **instead of implementing (merging) the DAA that you preferred**.  That was your (and others) mistake.

If you had implemented your improved DAA a month prior to Amaury implementing a different one then I think you'd find a lot of people supporting your beef against Amaury and / or this would have never come up because we'd all just be using your DAA.

**But you didn't implement.**  You waited for permission to proceed and / or continued to bikeshed when the community needed and was asking for a solution.  (Note: this is why Bitcoin Cash forked in Aug 2017 even though the community split and should have just forked in 2015 and given us a two-year headstart, and hindsight has proven this true.)

Amaury was quick on the scene to blast you and the others for this.  Waiting around for people in authority to tell you it's OK to do what you want to do in a permissionless system makes no sense.

Amaury came onto RBTC at that time and said essentially exactly what I am telling you: it was time to make a change, and nobody else had stepped up and implemented a new DAA, so he did it.  He said at the time he didn't like the way it happened but he couldn't just sit around waiting for you guys to quit talking and start doing.  If you missed his post I encourage you to find it.  If I find it I'll share it with you.

Amaury was right.  If Classic, BU, and XT had consensus for a month on a better DAA than what Amaury implemented (as you previously told me), then it's your own fault for not implementing your DAA first, but instead sitting on it and / or bikeshedding it.  Real leadership does not involve asking for permission or holding hands and signing kumbaya.  Sitting around waiting for a blessing is why Bitcoin Cash waited *far too long* to take the initiative and cause its fork.  Here I agree 100% with Amaury.

Classic, BU, and XT all originated from a culture of ""creating a change then waiting for it to be accepted by the majority.""  This was the Stockholm syndrome situation we had under Core.  That approach failed time and time again.  Amaury is right in his criticism of this.  However, it is very hard to change the culture of a team.  Unfortunately, when it came time to actually *break things* in order to cause change, BU, XT, and Classic were all unwilling, even though people like myself had been rallying for over a year to just fucking fork already.  You guys were all unwilling to be ""that disruptive.""

In conclusion, I would have hoped that XT, Classic, and BU would have learned from what ABC ""got right"" and why that worked, and how, and seek to emulate it, not give up and then take potshots at ""what's working"" because it isn't the way you would have like to see change happen.

I thought seriously about picking up your project when you announced that you were abandoning it.   Although I totally respect your decision to stop developing Classic,  I think it's a crying shame that we're losing one of our implementations.  However I don't want to dev a project.  I just don't.  I don't have the energy, and what energy I have, would be consumed by coding, and I think I have better things to do with my time than code.

I want to reiterate: I admire all of your tenacity and all of your hard work.  I understand and sympathize with your frustration.  And you come across as a decent, honest, and hard working individual.  You are someone I have come to respect, even if we don't always agree.  And so it does affect me to hear you basically attacking Amaury for his actions, which in reality *have helped and advanced the community when others could not.*

I'll add that only miners are paid incentives by the network to build improvements.  As a dev, building a relationship with miners is going to be more and more critical as time goes forward.  I expect that in the future, if this project continues to succeed, devs will generally be paid by miners and the largest users of the system.  This shouldn't be surprising, but instead welcomed.  At least miners have an incentive to improve, not destroy, the network.

I hope that you can find some lessons learned in all of this and that by being blunt I have not offended you.  You're Dutch, right?  Bluntness ought to be normal right?  :)

Again, just in case it isn't cutting through: thank you for your years of service to Bitcoin.  We wouldn't be here without you

Peace.",2018-01-22 22:39:43
dt0ugq8,FookedOnHonics,120,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC. 

I'm beyond devastated. I'm confident that I'm going to end my life over this and I've already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy's brother who killed himself over the same situation. 

I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I'm not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It's not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can't bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could've certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don't have the self respect to turn down donations but I'm also pretty certain that people aren't donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don't deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I've been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards. 

I know somewhere else in the universe, there's a 'me' who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn't start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I'm a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won't. Either way, I don't have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can't stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It's sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin.

I don't even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can't think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I'll be able to buy back in but that doesn't make sense because I don't have $10 to my name to put back in. I'm going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months and really have nowhere to turn once that happens. 

I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher. 

edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn't realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I'm not in immediate danger of anything and wasn't trying to start a pity party for myself.

dt2ou1d,kybarnet,120,"**At $20, transfer fees are nearing 5% or less** (1 Penny over Lightning but less reliably) and less than 1% for $100, over the Bitcoin Network.

---

We just cleared the ""below 50 Sat"" grouping, and are now onto the ""below 30 Sat"" grouping. All Bitcoin transaction requests are placed into a giant pot. The Highest Fee transactions float to the top and get skimmed off, for the creation of each new block.

Around Christmas, the quality of the Fat or Highest Fee transaction was up to $10 per transfer.

Today the highest fee transfers are around $1. Remember, it doesn't matter how many Bitcoins you transfer, all have the same cost, but the cost increases with Speed of transfer. Also, there are about 4 transactions per 'kilo byte' (6 with Segwit) and rates are quoted per Kilo Byte (thus 4x more than the cost of a typical transfer). The actual math works like this :

Bitcoin Value (say $10,000) x (Average Transaction Fee per Kilo Byte / 4 (or 6 with Segwit)) = Transaction Fee

25 Satoshis x 1,000 (Kilo) = 0.00025 Bitcoin / Kilo Byte

$10,000 x (0.00025 / 6 (Segwit)) = $0.42 Transfer Fee in Dollars

---

Today you can send a transfer at a rate of 51 Sat's / Byte and clear Next Block, and 31 Sat's / Byte should start clearing tomorrow Next Block. You can pay 90% of that and expect to clear within 12 hours, and 80% to clear within the day.

So we are expecting ""Next Block"" fees to drop from around $1.50 non-Segwit to $1 by tomorrow, or $0.60 with Segwit - And perhaps lower.

This means that the alt coin argument of Bitcoin being too expensive to use will now only apply to transactions of less than $20 really (which should be conducted over the Lightning Network, if available).",2018-01-23 04:15:51

Here are some actual facts:

- The unemployment rate for college graduates is 2.5%. It is 5.3% for people who did not attend college. Despite the popular narrative, you're more likely to be employed if you go to college. [Source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/unemployment-rate-2-point-5-percent-for-college-grads-7-point-7-percent-for-high-school-dropouts-january-2017.htm)

-  College graduates earn about $1 million dollars more over the course of their lives than people who didn't go to college. Despite the popular narrative of being ""saddled with debt"", unless you took out a million dollars in loans you will probably **make a profit** from your investment in college, not lose it. Average student loan debt is about $30k. Making $1m from $30k is the best investment you'll ever make (except bitcoin, but then you're likely to lose that much the next day). [Source](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf)

- A college degree lasts forever. Even if you want to become a plumber or electrician later, you'll always get credit for your degree if you change careers. A trade skill lasts only as long as you remain uninjured and able to physically function in an efficient way. 

- College graduates are happier, healthier, usually work less physically intensive and less exhausting jobs, better job safety and security, etc. [Source](https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf) 

Now, this is NOT in ANY WAY against the trades. If you love plumbing, or wiring houses, or welding and see yourself doing that day-in day-out for the next 30+ years, by all means do it. Of course, do keep in mind that huge economic swings will impact where you can live and how much you'll earn a lot more (college grads can often move between many white-collar jobs, whereas a welder has to go where welding is needed and doesn't have many options if welding is not needed right now). 

But, if you think the trades are some kind of lifehack to get you to prosperity. Or if you think that college is going to leave you with debt and no options. You are just flat out factually incorrect. 

EDIT: Just to answer a point that a few people had, which is valid: ""Some of these stats compare college grads to all non-college grads, not just tradesmen"". While true, it is also true that ""college grads"" encompasses a highly diverse set of people with widely different pay as well. But, let's just take a few trades

- Plumbers and electricians have a 4.4% unemployment rate. Better than all non-college people, but still much higher than college grads. Also note that most of the non-college ones are pretty similar to the average unemployment rate. 
- There is no lifetime earning data (that I could find) for plumbers and electricians, probably in part due to the point I made about it being difficult to sustain a physically-intensive career for your entire lifetime. However, we could extrapolate. Median pay for both is about $51k per year, times 40 years (the timeframe used for my other source) = $2.04m. This is $228,000 LESS than college grads, not even factoring unemployment, and so still a net profit for a college degree even factoring in debt and interest (not to mention the variety of other benefits I listed above).

EDIT 2: Just a quick note on statistics. An average or median is going to encompass a general trend, not catch every single case. Your major, geographic location, family support, and a million other things will impact your lifetime earnings. Also, just blind luck plays a huge factor. An electrician might invent a new screwdriver and become a millionaire. An art history major might get hit by a bus walking home from graduation.

-=-

Unfortunately, over the past year or so, the number of users reporting issues with Bitcoin payments has been on the rise. Mostly due to slow confirmation times (which has been sporadic), and more recently issues related to high fees (considering it's only a $49 product people are purchasing). 

Our problem is that internally, we all love Bitcoin (proper), the alternatives are confusing, and we're hoping that Lightning and Segwit solve these problems. But the reality on the ground is that Bitcoin in it's current state is no longer usable (some days) for the simple utility of purchasing a $49 product. It's not as reliable as it was a couple years ago from this standpoint.

We've got our fingers crossed though. Hopefully these issues will get resolved soon!

dt4frz6,Neil_Tzedakah,393,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

This is as true for (digital) money as it is for stocks, or property.  Thats why we need banks and stock exchanges/brokers and notaries.  The problem with this approach? The middleman (who has control and can charge fees) and counterparty risk, as anything in that database is by definition an IOU.

With crypto currencies, a database record does not refer to something of value (IOU), it *is* the thing of value (asset). Its like an electronic bearer bond. Therefore you can transact peer 2 peer, without third party, without counterparty risk. Thats what this is all about.

dt6pjsu,YRuafraid,113,"Thoughts: 

- Still bearish, as I mentioned last time, the chart looks weak overall. A bullish case is that there's a giant W bottom forming on the 4hr, plus CME futures expire in 2 days and some think that could cause a bump. Regardless, I see more reason to believe we're in a bear market. We had a bull run for 2 years, the rise to 19.5K from when the bull started was nothing short of spectacular. I'm very happy for that, and it makes $10K look undervalued. 


- Looking back we had a blow off top to 19.5K the first time we went there, hinting at the end of a bubble. Then we crawled back to 19.5K a second time, failed to break it and confirmed a giant double top. The price has been weak since then, instead of dips we have bumps before further drops... that's what happens in a bear market; buying every dip isn't the right answer anymore. We broke out of the parabolic trend as well. Imo the bear case makes more sense to me right now than the price resuming its way to 17K+... if we break 15K with volume I'll change my mind, but I see no reason for that to happen right now. 


- Just because I'm bearish doesn't mean I'm selling... I would have sold above 15K if I was paying attention and following my instincts, but I've been out of the loop. I'm debating if I should sell a bit at $11K and pick some back up when it goes lower... but at this point how much lower can we go? I think there's a high chance of $7K-8K.... but everyone and their dogs are calling for $8K so maybe it won't happen. There's also a good chance we fall below $7-8K, then we're in deep shit, and it will really test the stage of FEAR to the newbies who got in... we are far from fear right now, and it needs to be tested every now and then.


- Still expecting an ATH this year. I don't expect another year-long bear market like 2014, that was an anomaly compared to previous cycles. Now we're in a completely different environment, the crypto has hit mainstream and pandora's box is open. Cyrpto market is still going to become a multi-trillion dollar market, and I believe BTC alone *should* reach a market cap in the trillions. There's too much hype and demand so I'm hoping for a shorter bear market this time, maybe until March or Summer at the latest.


- At the end of the day Bitcoin isn't going anywhere... with GBTC, CME/CBOE Futures market &amp; NASDAQ futures in the pipeline, ETFs in the pipeline (it's happening), Bitcoin trading desk coming at GS, hedge funds warming up to diversifying into Bitcoin, with name recognition and network... the list goes on with how Bitcoin is reaching legitimacy and paving its way into a permanent seat as a new asset class. All of this is happening on the crypto with the most limited supply. Many of the strongest holders are passionate about Bitcoin, unlike any other investment, and with each cycle more long-term holders are being born. The supply is mind-bogglingly limited, as long as Bitcoin lives on (which is likely) the long-term trend should be up. 


- But there's a factor of stupidity in this market. The morons joining crypto now think Bitcoin is ""expensive""; there is a strong unit bias and everyone is searching for the next 100X so they flock to coins like XRP, TRX, ADA... shit that's completely antithesis to a permissionless economy, things that don't even have a working product. On top of that FUD gets spread quicker than ever, I can't believe how many random people I run into IRL, who know nothing about crypto, saying things like ""I heard Bitcoin doesn't work""... ""I heard Bitcoin is doomed because it can't scale"" ....""I heard Ethereum is the future and it's gonna replace Bitcoin"".... Bitcoin doesn't have a dedicated marketing team to worry about that bullshit, but it has plenty of attackers trying to undermine it from all directions. Bitcoin is by far the purest application of blockchain, it depends on nobody, it's controlled by nobody and it is truly neutral which serves everyone equally. But the majority getting in now don't do any kind of critical thinking on what they're investing in. The question then becomes will logic ultimately prevail? I'm still banking that it will but it will take some time.   


- Weiss Report, few things to keep in mind.. it's a rating on investment potential, not overall quality of the security/company/asset... it gave Amazon a C as well... but of course they don't consider anything regarding development, security, liquidity, exchange presence, uptime, history, battle-tested resilience...etc etc etc. Every blockchain has a scaling problem, but of course they only knock Bitcoin for scaling. Of course ETH gets put on a pedestal with a B rating... as always, ETH has no attacks, no FUD, no worries... no Ethereum Classic is the real Ethereum propaganda, just smooth sailing. Must be nice. If these alts got half of the shit Bitcoin got they wouldnt survive. Not trying to knock ETH, it earned its way to a blue-chip hold in the crytpo world imo, but it's no BTC, and it has it easy compared to BTC. Unfortunately Weiss ratings might hold some weight in the financial world, but as always Bitcoin never has it easy.


- Speaking of scaling, we had a 2MB block mined last week. When the devs said segwit would allow 2mb blocks and beyond, guess they were right. Segwit is only at ~12% adoption last I checked, but it's moving along and Coinbase will add it which will greatly help the throughput. Schnorr sigs will help throughput, other on-chain and off-chain solutions will help throughput. Lightning is in the horizon. In the grand scheme I'm not worried about scaling. It sucks to hear news like Microsoft &amp; Stripe dropping Bitcoin support... I'm sure Bcashers love it... but the reality is barely anyone is spending their bitcoin right now. Most people are in this market for speculation, and there's nothing wroth with that. Speculation has to be the first network effect...it gives people incentive to get in and hold the asset, this builds the network; without a network this isn't very powerful nor useful. Once we establish the network, the security, the infrastructure, then it will be ideal for commerce. There needs to be incentive and I think we'll get there soon, but the incentive to use crypto for mainstream commerce isn't here yet. The incentive to use bitcoin as a store of value high value wealth transfer is already here... I can send $1M across the world without anyone's approval for a fee of $20 and expect to receive it within 30mins, I have full control of my wealth... that's something I can't do with the traditional system, that's incentive. I can buy coffee with bitcoin, but I can just as easily use my credit card or spend the $3 in my pocket that I know won't be $5 tomorrow, that's not incentive to use bitcoin to buy coffee. That's not how we grow the network, not by forcing people into a system that's built off incentive. When we have convenient one-click transactions that go though instantly, without the need to enter credit card info, with discounts that get passed on to consumers though the elimination of CC fees, that's incentive.... that's when the masses will start using Bitcoin for mainstream commerce. Take the long term view",2018-01-25 06:16:00

dt6vemo,nootropicat,104,"The fundamental assumption behind this test is wrong. Tether is issued mainly when the effective tether price at usdt exchanges becomes significantly higher than $1, for arbitrage. This happens mostly when btc corrects and everyone escapes into tether. 

So obviously tether issuance *is* correlated with bitcoin's price, duh. Tether issuance for arbitrage *is* an 'organic business process'. 

&gt;and also that Tether injection at Bitfinex creates a significant rise in the price of Bitcoin.

What a perfect example of mistaking correlation with causation. How come bitfinex's prices were usually *lower* than gdax? I have no statistical analysis but I remember that for most of the time bitfinex was lower. ",2018-01-25 07:50:09

*****
&gt; When 50 Cent agreed to accept bitcoin for purchases of his 2014 album Animal Ambition, a unit of the cryptocurrency was already worth hundreds of dollars - but the value of those sales has since skyrocketed, and the rapper&amp;#039;s bitcoin holding is now reportedly worth more than $7.5 million.

&gt; The currency&amp;#039;s value had topped $1,000 in 2013; when 50 Cent&amp;#039;s album came out in the summer of 2014, one bitcoin was worth more than $600. Today, a bitcoin is worth more than $11,000.

&gt; In a unique twist, one partial explanation for that slump - the digitizing of a medium that was once exclusively material - also helps explain why its proceeds are now worth millions, as bitcoin&amp;#039;s value has risen to stratospheric heights.

The reason the price dips before they expire is because people don't understand how futures work. everyone here associates futures with shorting when in fact there is just as much money in long positions. Every short position must be matched by a corresponding long position to make a contract. The money going long is just as motivated to buy Bitcoin and drive the price up as the short positions are to drive the price down. It's much easier to raise capital in USD to buy bitcoin than it is to find BTC to sell. Keep in mind that it is illegal to do this either way, especially if there is any conspiracy between whales.

dtbg3gs,fiah84,199,"that's why I asked :)

a hard fork means that the network is changing in a way that makes it incompatible with the older version of the network. So if you're using outdated software to connect with the network, it will no longer recognize the new version of the network. This is to be expected when cryptocurrencies like Ethereum upgrade their inner workings, the new version has to do things that the older software just cannot understand, which is not a problem as long as everybody knows about it and upgrades their client software so that it works with the new version. That is a hard fork how it is meant to be

a hard fork *can* result in a chain split when people keep using their old software for whatever reason. To be precise, for cryptocurrencies that rely on Proof of Work like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the only way a chain split occurs is when the **miners** keep using the old version of the software. When the miners keep using the old version, their software will reject the new version of blockchain and will instead keep mining the old version of the blockchain, resulting in a split where there are now 2 blockchains. This is a chain split.

The miners don't want to be stuck with useless coins, so they will always mine the blockchain with the coins that they think they can sell later on, which means they will upgrade their software so that it is compatible with the new version of the network. The only reason miners might choose to stick with the old version (thereby turning a hard fork into a chain split) is when they think the old version is worth more than the new version. This is what happened with Ethereum Classic, and everybody who had ETH before that chain split now has ETH *and* ETC, hence the reason you ask if you should buy ETH now so that you might profit from getting free coins.

The reason they thought Ethereum Classic would be worth it to mine was because a part of the Ethereum community disagreed with the hard fork that would undo the DAO-debacle. There is currently no reason to think any significant part of the community will disagree with the changes that the next Ethereum hard fork would bring, therefore there's no reason to think there will be a chain split. If there's no reason to think there will be a chain split then there's no reason to think you will get free coins if you buy ETH before the hard fork.

TLDR: hard forks are upgrades, chain splits only happen when people disagree with those changes.  
No disagreement =&gt; no chain split =&gt; no free coins =&gt; no reason to buy before the fork

3) If you dod it anyhere 10 million you know very well thst you’d have a franed screenshot of the accounting/ecommerce software annual report showing the gross. You’d parade that as a badge of honor.

dtcayhd,onezerozeroone,121,"Same way you hack anything else. The problem is that bitcoin is ultimately stored in a wallet, which is nothing more than two long series of mathematically related digits that go together. 

One is public so people can send BTC to it, the other is private so you can spend it. It's impossible to guess the private key from the public, but once you know the private key, you control that wallet and any BTC it contains.

Usually exchanges with good security practices would keep the majority of their holdings (the private keys) in ""cold storage"" meaning devices physically disconnected from the outside world, with strong physical security (doors, locks, guards, etc)

However, to do any kind of business, some private keys have to be in a database or memory *somewhere* so that the system can access them relatively quickly and interact with the blockchain. That data would also typically be isolated from the external world (such as the internet) by firewalls or other access restrictions. All a hacker needs to do though is find and exploit a vulnerability to gain access to some internal account, machine, or system that has access to those data stores and voila, the BTC is now theirs.

Ideally if you were running an exchange, you would be ""big enough"" that moment-to-moment price fluctuations could be ignored and you could use things like futures to manage that risk. What you would do is simply keep track of the orders and price quotes, and fulfill them later. When someone requests a transaction, they might have to wait a day or two to receive the proceeds of a sale or purchase, but it would be much more secure. Deal with generating keys and the blockchain later, in a more secure, as-offline-as-possible manner.

But you’re wrong. 


It’s called the S-curve simply because of its letter “S” shape. Its defining characteristic is the extremely slow exponential ramp up to the point at which growth “goes vertical”, and super-majority adoption is rapidly achieved. Throughout the 20th century every major mass-market technology that was near-universally adopted has exhibited some form of an S-curve

If one researches Bitcoin for any length of time, one invariably encounters the phenomenon of the bitcoin bubble. The price, after rising slowly but fairly steadily for a length time, suddenly explodes by 5–10% a day for a sustained period of time culminating in typically a full order of magnitude (~1,000%) increase over its previous value. This is known in Bitcoin circles as a “Bull Run”.


Basically, for anything new there is a mad flurry of excitement over potential applications, followed by the realization that most of them don’t work, followed by a slow learning of what does work, followed by sustained progress. Bitcoin is following this path but is also following a fractal pattern.


Fractals are a fascinating branch of mathematics, in which often relatively simple formulas evaluate to infinite complex patterns that repeat themselves over and over again at different orders of magnitude. Fractal mathematics are often employed in technical analysis of Forex markets and by high frequency trading bots.


Though I have not seen any work toward a definitive fractal formula that describes the way bitcoin’s price behaves, I believe there is ample evidence that a fractal pattern is present. It represents itself in the form of exponential bitcoin bubbles driven by Gartner Hype Cycles. I’d imagine there is enough to study in this area for several Doctorate dissertations.


Bitcoin is probably the purest example of speculative adoption humanity has seen to date. It is following a typical technological adoption curve at a rapid pace. The S-curve is made up hype cycles which repeat in a fractal manner. Each fractal repetition is roughly one order of magnitude greater than the one prior. Since reaching dollar parity, the percentage increase of each bubble over the last has been decreasing, even though the $ increase grows exponentially. There are likely 2–3 remaining hype cycles before Bitcoin becomes near-universally adopted.",2018-01-28 02:07:33

I'm not happy with the out of context quote that they headlined. And it's sad to me, that that's the off the cuff statement that they used. 

My point was that the Blockchain industry is so ripe for opportunity. So ripe to change this revolution forever.

That if you don't start a startup in this space sometime in the next 10 years. You're missing out - potentially on millions. Millions that could go to the right causes and great movements.

Crypto-Currency and BlockChain technologies have the power to end Wall Street corruption. For good. 

My father came into the kitchen as my mom was cooking dinner when I was 9 years old. And he said to my mother:

""I think we lost everything""

And we did lose *almost* everything. My parents were more fortunate than some of friends but not by much. We were able to keep our house. Be we had to take out a second mortgage (which was just the half of it).

It was a brutal time for our family. And one that I'll never forget. 

While in the meantime the Wall Street CEOs got rich on the backs of my parents and other average Americans. 

It was during that time that I swore that it would be my life goal to end them. To make sure it never happened again. 

And when Bitcoin and thus Blockchain technology came out. I saw that as my opportunity to strike. 

I spent everyday trying to amass more and more Bitcoin. Till Bitcoin reached a peak where I could sell some off to start an online education business. The goal to provide affordable and eventually free education that's personal and completely customized. 

I sold that company to have more resources to work my way up the ladder to keep working on ending the corrupt Wall Street system. 

And now I'm currently working on a new project to hopefully at least make a dent. 

I'm young, and probably naive. But it's my life goal. And I like to think it's a worthy one at that. 

I want to make sure that no person and no child. Has to go through what I and so many other families went through in 2008. 

I hope that clears things up.

Bob downloads a new LN wallet and opens it up. Alice cannot pay Bob because he has no open channels and no capacity.

1) Bob must connect to a hub who will open a channel with Bob, pay a tx fee to open the channel (which they might be able to recoup later by charging bob), and deposit 1 BTC of their own money into Bob's channel. Effectively locking it up. 

Or 

2) Bob must buy some bitcoin at an exchange. Open a payment channel with somebody using that Bitcoin, pay a transaction fee, then make an outgoing to LN payment to *somebody*. That somebody could possibly be sending the coins back to the exchange to sell them.  Now Bob's counterparty has enough funds in his side of the channel to facilitate Alice's payment to Bob.

Isn't he precisely wrong? You can't compare blockchains to companies.

Edit: If people start getting responses saying that SML is not interested, please post it so we aren't spamming them. And if this becomes the case, let's just continue looking, it'd be great if we could get a European firm.

A foreign (italian) cryptocurrency exchange known as BitGrail has violated their terms of service and frozen all users accounts without notification. By suspending withdrawals they have created a closed market in which they can manipulate the price in relation to other exchanges. The owner then released a statement that all non-European users’ funds will be taken unless the account is closed. This is creating a panic causing the price to drop significantly in the closed market they have created. Normally, they allow users to withdraw any coin in their account. Now, upon account closure, they refuse to release users’ funds in any form except Bitcoin. This does two things: it forces users to pay a fee to convert their coin into Bitcoin, and it allows the company to personally purchase the specific coin at the now steeply discounted, artificial price that they have created. A large exchange (Binance) recently announced that they would be adding this specific coin (Raiblocks) to their exchange. It is obvious that Bitgrail is manipulating the market and accumulating coins in preparation for this release. BitGrail handles 75% of Raiblocks transactions and $30m+ daily. At time of writing (10:36 AM CST), the market price of Raiblocks on Bitgrail is 0.00107 Bitcoin per Raiblocks, while the price on another widely used exchange, Kucoin, is 0.00139 Bitcoin per Raiblocks. This is roughly a 23% decrease in value created by their market manipulation. They are an LLC registered in Florence, Italy and the owner is active on social media (twitter handle @bomberfrancy).

The first major advancement was actually public key cryptography in the 1970s. This was before my time but a necessary step and required significant new math. 

In the 80s the work of Merkle on hash trees is absolutely critical. Hashchains are just a special case of hash trees.

In the late 90s secure audit logs came into use. This is where much of the design for the ledger comes from, and they even use a blockchain format for them. These use a hashchain (blockchain) with periodic public key signatures.

The next major advancement was, believe it or not, spam, specifically classic email spam. It was the fight against spam that led to the development of the concept of proof of work.  It was mentioned at the time that it may be worthwhile as a currency but no one really had any way of figuring out how to use it.

The last major development was triple entry bookkeeping. This is how to use the secure audit log for public auditable systems.

It is triple entry bookkeeping, with hashchains and pki that gives the basics of cryptocurrencies as we know them.

Bitcoin Cash forked off from Bitcoin on August 1st, when a block greater than 1mb was mined.  Segwit activated three weeks later, continuing the original chain.

It also incorrectly claims that Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the original chain.  It isn't, because Bitcoin Cash changed two separate consensus rules.  It changed the blocksize, which makes it incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and it also changed the difficulty adjustment algorim, which also makes it fully incompatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network.

The segwit soft fork didn't split the chain at all when it activated (again 3 weeks after Bitcoin Cash forked).  Segwit is fully compatible with the pre-August Bitcoin network, and is the only continuation of the original chain.

dtghskt,bobloadmire,115,So that's what a Bitcoin looks like!,2018-01-30 18:57:47
dtf6j3j,Ernest_EA,110,"Instead of being pegged to USD like Tether, Oyster is pegged to storage value and will slowly increase overtime. Confirmed by devs that the initial storage peg will be AT LEAST 64GB/yr meaning it could go higher depending on the market in May when Mainnet launches but 64GB/yr is confirmed to be the floor.

#FAQ + Common FUD:

**Q: Will Oyster use 100% CPU to mine PRL?**

A: No, the goal of Oyster is to use the % CPU usage equivalent to amount used to generate ads. By the way, adblock uses CPU power too. Oyster has an aspect called a ""fragile loop"" that will detect the computers performance in real time and reduce the workload or govern it if it is starting to make the browser struggle. It will never burden the users experience.

**Q: Why not use Coinhive, a script that mines Monero?**

A: You're competing with other miners when mining. Do you think multiple CPUs can out perform a GPU? Oyster mining or ""diving"" isn't the same as regular mining, it's DIFFERENT. It's designed to be lightweight in mind and will only utilize a % CPU usage so small. Also, getting rid of ads is just one of the many things that Oyster can do. There is the anonymous storage part and dApp which will be implemented after mainnet. Oyster can also be implemented into apps bringing potential ad-free apps, more screen space for users.

**Q: Will the end user have to do anything special?**

A: No. They probably won't even notice they're mining PRL since as I've mentioned before, the goal is to use % CPU usage equivalent to the amount used by ads.

**Q: Wait a second, does that mean I can have a mining farm to mine PRL?**

A: It doesn't work like that... PRL is designed to use only a small % of your CPU power and is hardcapped, therefore you cannot utilize your hardware at 100%. Good luck reaching ROI in over 9000 years.

**Q: Why create a new coin to buy storage?**

A: What Oyster is offering is anonymous decentralized storage, nobody can hack and view your stuff. It also creates a self sustaining system where site owner can host their site on Oyster and have their visitors pay for their server by mining or ""diving"" for PRL.

**Q: Can anti-virus block Oyster?**

A: **The reason we block CoinHive is because there are site owners who do not ask for their users’ permission to start running CPU-gorging applications on their systems** according to Malwarebyte

Again oyster will have a user consent much like that of the Cookie Law. We also are not """"CPU-gorging."" But ultimately this is up to each individual website. Yes people could block oyster from running in the browser like people block ads. But the website could respond by asking them to pay, or refusing to share your content.

Yes. All scripts can be stopped from running on a webpage. Oyster offers an alternative to ads which could potentially be malicious, and or be visually disruptive to the user. While also reducing storage costs. Oyster allows websites to have their own financial autonomy by not relying on monolithic advertising platforms like Google and Facebook. Any of these platforms can bully a website due to political motivations, whilst the advertisements themselves are rarely assertion-neutral

In the end users have no need to actually block Oyster, it will not impact there experience in any way. Computer, phone, tablet etc. will not be slowed down we have automatic measures in place. If the browser is starting to struggle a bit, the javascript will detect the performance in real time and govern the PoW so that it does not burden the browser or become sluggish

**Q: What is stopping website owners from running ads + Oyster?**

A: Nothing. It's just that you would piss your visitors off when they find out you're a cheap piece of trash and they would go to some other sites. There should also be a pop up similar to a cookie pop up when visiting a site utilizing Oyster. 

**Q: I feel that stealing CPU power is wrong?**

A: So you think having ads all over the place and Google stealing your browsing activity to create a list of ads that would suit your taste is right? There will also be a notice much like the cookie law it will be up to the websites if they want to display that. 

**Q: Mass adoption of Oyster won't happen?**

A: Maybe, maybe not. But what I can tell you is that Oyster can be easily implemented to even apps on your phone. End user doesn't have to do anything special and they won't even notice anything.  Creating an ad-free app certainly gives you an edge over a competing app.

**Q: What stops people from uploading illegal stuff onto Oyster?**

A: Well, what stops people from using Bitcoin to buy illegal drugs? Oyster is just a tool.

I invested what I could afford to lose. That so happens to be 50 bucks per check. This idea that you have to be able to drop big bucks is stupid to me. I know it's bad of me, but I'm glad when I see some folks upset about how they went all in at high and now lost 60% of their wealth. This isn't the stock market. If losing your money will ruin your life then you spent more than you can afford.


Sorry if I am coming off like an asshole. I'm just salty that morons think you need to stay out the market unless you can drop 10k or more.
