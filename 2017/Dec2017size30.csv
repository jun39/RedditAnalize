dqk8lg1,9e7b96475,220,"Some reasons Bitcoin is a bad idea:

* Global Bitcoin mining now consumes more energy than the country of Ireland. Much of this happen in China where coal is still the premier source of energy. If anything needs to be slapped with a carbon tax, it is the mining of crypto currencies.
* Despite all this effort, the Bitcoin network is only designed to process around seven transactions per second. Due to technical reasons, this rate is currently closer to 4 tx/s. Companies like Mastercard and Visa process thousands of tx/s.
* All of this mining (i.e. waste of energy) has to be paid for by someone. Traditionally, this was almost completely covered by the reward for mining, which slowly inflates the overall supply and is effectively an implicit tax on holders of existing coins. As this reward is automatically lowered over time, transaction fees will have to make up for the difference. Add to that the rising number of transactions while the capacity of the network to process them stays the same, and transaction costs can only go up in future. The average transaction already costs more than $7 today and was as high at $19 in mid-November.
* Due to its decentralised nature, the overhead costs of operating the network will always be higher than operating a centralised system. There is virtually no reason for a rational economic actor to use Bitcoin over other payment systems due to the high costs. The only exception are transactions involving illicit activities that someone is trying to keep hidden from the authorities. 
* Any attempts to implement a solution to scaling the Bitcoin network have failed due conflicting interests and the involvement of people in key positions of questionable character and personal motivation.
* There is no accountability or recourse if anything goes wrong. Send coins to the wrong address? Tough luck. Your money got stolen due to a security vulnerability? Not our problem.",2017-12-01 01:00:43

**1 How much did you buy and when?**
I started buying in 2011 at about $4 each, I went to about 50 bitcoin.

I lost about a quarter of them in MtGox, and after the 2014 crash, when it fell back to $200-$300, I started investing heavily

I ended up with about 110 BTC bought at an average of $230

**2 What did you originally buy it for?**
Nothing illegal :-)

I just wanted high anonymity to purchase web services in oppressive countries I was visiting

**3 How easy was it to turn that wealth into real cash?**
Dude. Bitcoin (&amp; more particularly, Bitcoin Cash), IS the real cash!

**4 Do you think the bubble is about to burst?**
I'm rather convinced it will drop significantly in the near future.

But as someone who saw it going from $1000 to $250 and just kept buying, I don't worry. It will rebounce

I fully expect to lose my millionaireship, only to re-aquire it later.

After all, I know hat feeling: I am from Europe (Spain) and in these days I keep bouncing back and forth from millionaireship (in Euros). It's odd.

**5 How smug are you now?**
Reasonably smug. But I haven't changed my lifestyle ad all.

I only sold what I needed to recoup my initial investment of abt $25k, and keep my BTCs. 100% HODLer

&gt;  How much did you buy and when?   

I heard about bitcoin from slashdot in 2010.  Thought it was neat and moved on.  I got in June of 2011 spoke with a co-worker about it.  Bought in for $2000 and also bought &amp; built a mining computer for ~$600.  Getting a new bitcoin exchange account verified and funded (Mt. Gox at the time) was a pain in the ass.  

&gt;  What did you originally buy it for?  

I bought in for about $18 on average, had just over 100 bitcoin.  It immediately [crashed down to $5.](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60zczsg2011-01-03zeg2012-12-02ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv).  Plus I mined with a dual GPU PC for about 8 months until the return on electricity cost was less than half the value of the bitcoin.  Early-ish 2012 I shut off my mining rig, thought about selling all of my coins to cut my losses, but decided ""fuck it"" and literally forgot about bitcoin for a year.  

Seriously, look at [this chart](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60zczsg2011-01-03zeg2012-12-22ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv) and tell me people who bought at $18 for some random internet money are not suckers?  

Read an article about bitcoin in April 2013, figured I would check the price.  [$65 FUCKIN DOLLARS!](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60zczsg2013-01-03zeg2013-05-22ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv) and going up!!!!  Over the next month, I started selling.  Ended up selling about half for over well over $5000 (double my investment) as the price went all the way up to $220 before crashing down to $120.   Bought a new deck, bought dinner to celebrate and thought I was a bitcoin genius - doubled my money in less than 2 years and still had half the bitcoin!  

Then I decided to invest seriously.  Mt. Gox went under so in late 2013 I opened, verified and funded bitstamp.  Again it was a pain in the ass and I wired $40,000 to Bitstamp, the price was going crazy!  I bought in [at $1000](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2013-08-03zeg2014-08-31ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv) and it crashed back down to $600.  Now I was really fucked, losing almost $20,000!  

Again, look at [this chart](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2013-08-03zeg2016-08-03ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv)  and tell me someone who bought in at $1000 isn't a sucker?  I decided to hold again.  

Now in 2017, I had over $1 million in bitcoin.  I sold some at $2500, $4000 and have started selling a tiny fraction every $100 above $6000.  I have ~ $200k out so far and $800k still in bitcoin.  
Have been trying to buy stuff instead of using an exchange to avoid the tax man.  







&gt;  How easy was it to turn that wealth into real cash?  

Bitcoin is real cash.  I buy stuff with bitcoin - flights, hotels, flowers, etc... I don't care about fees because when I take it out of an exchange, I pay taxes.  

&gt;  Do you think the bubble is about to burst?  

Yes, just like the last 2 times the bubble burst.  


&gt;  How smug are you now?  

I am humble enough to know I am not that smart.

I could retire now, at age 31, but I won’t until I feel like I’ve finished what I started at my current gig (a business I co-founded). For me, retirement looks like focusing more on my health and volunteering for / founding nonprofits. Also, travel and eventually raising a family.

I invested $30k in Bitcoin just after the 2013 bubble popped, and another $30k at the very bottom just before the recovery began. I also did some futures trading using the bitcoin to increase my holdings by another 50% or so. (I spent 8 years studying trading as a hobby; it wasn’t something I just picked up). Today, that initial investment is now up 45x after factoring in eventual taxes.

So my liquid post-tax NW is about 2.6M plus equity in 4 companies (2 startups I confounded, 1 angel investment, 1 employee options).

I’ve taken a very deliberate approach while young to try to get as many “lottery tickets” as possible (bets of time or money that I thought had a 10%+ chance of a huge payout.)

Now this happens because they believe it will be worth more tomorrow. Why spend X BTC for something  if Inc's wait until it's 15000$ and spend less btc.  But at 15000 you will wait for 20k then 50k etc.

Basically you will never spend on anything always waiting for the rising price.

Now imagine this same scenario with the USD. Nobody spends today because you can buy more tomorrow instead. This makes people hoard money instead dog spending it. Which means less cash flow through the country and less taxes.

That Jamba juice at the corner? Probably broke because nobody is going to spend any money there today if it's not essential because they'll have more .  What about best buy? And the entire electronics market? Well you don't really NEEEED that Ps4 today, let's wait until next year and I can buy the ps4 plus more games because the currency is worth more.

Basically it can make the economy grind to  a halt in every nonessential market. Also means less taxes because less money being spent.

My story... I started getting interest in Bitcoin in the early days when it was trading at about $80 per coin. I built small bitcoin miner and also ""earned"" small bits on the internet until I had .7 bitcoin. 

One day I came to the conclusion that maybe this magic internet money was nothing more than zeros and ones. So in my infinite wisdom I decided to exchange my zeros and ones for a new Glock.

When you wanted to contact him to join the meetup, he required you to contact him on BitMessage (an anonymous message platform that had no mobile version and required you to download a multi-gigabyte blockchain). After that, he'd give you details of the meetup location, typically in a vague public place, like the running track of a park, or a large food court. (And of course he wouldn't give any identifying information about himself.) Once you arrived, he would visually vet you, and decide whether you were worthy of entering the meetup. If you were, he'd invite you to a table with the other members, while he paced up and down wearing several overcoats. (We're in Thailand, so it's like 35° out.)

One of my friends wasn't so lucky, however. After he got to the appointed location, he waited over an hour for Secret Steve, then tried to contact him on BitMessage, given a phone number for Steve to call him back. A few minutes later, he gets a call. ""I see you. You're not trustworthy. Get out of here, now.

I'd like to propose donating towards research in regenerative medicine. The SENS foundation provides a compelling vision on the different possibilities to cure many illnesses related to aging.


Against heavy odds, founder Aubrey de Grey has pushed his ideas and foundation to a high level of acceptance, gaining some small victories in the struggle.


What seems to be little known, and I'm happy to redact this for privacy reasons, is that Aubrey himself had donated millions to this cause, putting his money where his mouth is. His actions and intentions have been consistently genuine.


Admittedly, many of the research ideas being funded by the foundation are not quite mainstream. It is still important that the foundation supported the more overlooked areas of medical research. Where the are lots of mainstream funding, potential ROI is often lower.

Signatures in the Bitcoin blockchain rely on [elliptic curve cryptography](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/second_edition/ch04.asciidoc#user-content-elliptic-curve-cryptography-explained) which provides a way to do ""one way"" calculations.  For a given private key, it's relatively trivial to calculate its public key, but going from a public key to a private key is computationally infeasible (i.e., basically impossible).

Each point on this curve, when combined with another fixed ""generator"" G yields a unique point elsewhere on the curve given by multiplication.  But unlike arithmetic multiplication, this can't be ""reversed"" by dividing.  Given the second point, all other points seem equally likely to be the original, and they would have to be tried one by one.

dqshv7s,Nathan2055,170,"[Ronald Wayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne) was brought on by the two Steves early on (1976) to handle some administrative work. He ultimately divested only two weeks into Apple's existence, selling his 10% stake for $800 and signing an agreement to hold no further claims on the company for a further $1500. In total, he received about $10,000 in today's money.

Had he retained his shares, as of March 2017 they would have been worth $75.5 billion USD.

I tried to buy $30 of BTC back in 2014 and after an argument with a bank (I was using BitQuick), I ultimately gave up. Obviously that's way different than owning several million shares in Apple in the early days or several thousand Bitcoin pre-Gox, but the same principle applies.

He also mentions that an English soldier in World War I named Henry Tandey at one point saw a wounded German solider through his sights but opted to take pity on him and didn't shoot him. That German soldier's name? Adolf Hitler.

dqsuo9i,nidenikolev,161,"One of the most interesting askreddit comments I've ever read actually pertains to this:

I've met some weird people in my time, but this one guy takes the cake...

I was in the Rio hotel in Las Vegas at the hacker conference DEFCON 20, summer of 2012. I was on vacation with some friends in vegas at the time, and decided it would be cool to go to DEFCON for the day. So they've got this room at the conference where there are a bunch of locks and lockpicks all spread out on tables, and a bunch of people are teaching you how to pick locks. So I decide, ""hey this looks cool"" and grab a seat.

Then I notice the guy next to me. He looks to be around 21 or so, wearing an unmarked black flight suit over what appears to be a bullet proof vest, dark blue welding goggles, an earpiece like this and bright blue hair, wearing transparent medical gloves. He's sitting there picking open a lock about every minute.

So finally I ask him ""Hey, mind giving me a couple pointers?"" he says ""No problem, sonny, name's Jack Florey, pleased to meet you"" (which I found quite odd, I was clearly years older than him). So he shows me the basics of how to pick a lock, and then I make some ""hacker"" small talk with him (I'm a sysadmin). After hanging out for about an hour or so, he offered to buy me a beer, and no self respecting sysadmin can refuse free beer.

So he takes out his ID to show the bar tender, and I notice he has a Virginia drivers license in the name FNU LNU and ""No fixed address"" as his address. He pulls a crisp $100 bill out of his wallet, and tells the bartender ""keep the change"", which the bartender tries to return anyway for like a full minute.

So we get our beers, and he starts telling me about all this government surveillance that's going on - the dude strikes me as a total foil hatter, but smart. Then around 20 minutes passes while we chat, and suddenly he gets a very distant look and I hear his earpiece crackling. He takes a flash drive out of his flightsuit pocket pocket and hands it to me saying ""this will be worth $100,000 within two years, and the gibberish will bring down the government, I need to abscond now, the Jacks need me"".

He then walks out of the bar, and climbs into a rented Lincoln town car limo, I've never seen him since.

So the followup... I have a look at the contents of the flash drive the next day. It was formatted in FAT-32 and contained a wallet.dat file with 100 bitcoins, an encrypted file called ""OPSEC.RAR"" and a textfile called ""thegibberish.txt"" that contained only ""42.360684,-71.093696, 8/8/2015 23:00 come alone""

And then all this shit with Snowden came out over the last year, plus bitcoin actually did hit $1,000; and over half of what this dude said about government surveillance turned out to be true. He also claimed the NSA has already had operational quantum computers for over a decade.

tl;dr went to vegas with friends to get boozed up, some kind of hacker savant gave me $100,000 and a cryptic meeting place years in the future

dqsh4q7,MyBitcoinRunnethOver,149,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand bitcoin. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical economics most of the movements will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Satoshi’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his beliefs- his personal philosophy draws heavily from anarcho-capitalist literature, for instance. The holders understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this market, to realise that they’re not just profitable- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the beauty in bitcoin's existential tagline “Peer to Peer Currency,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

dqu43pg,strange_fate,265,"There was a lot of hype when it hit 1300 in 2013. I thought the same thing. I bought some at 900 but the price kept dropping. I always thought that it would be neat to have a whole bitcoin but i couldn't afford it. Eventually I just let it go but I kept an eye on it. After a couple years of slowly dropping the price was under 300. I realized i could finally buy a whole one but because it seemed like it wouldn't recover i didn't want one anymore. 

I think it is good for people to buy a small amount and then just ignore it. If it tanks then you don't lose much but in ten years it might be a lot higher. If you invest too much then it'll always be a worry in the back of your mind and you'll make bad decisions. 

One thing you can do is to buy a small amount now and then don't buy anymore unless it drops to a certain price like 5000. in your mind this takes some of the stress off. If it goes up you are good but if it drops then you get a better price and get more. Or you can try dollar cost averaging where you buy a small amount no matter what the price. 

The best thing to do is to act logically and not based on the current hype and hysteria. Make sure you are aware of the risks and the emotional costs. I like this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/)",2017-12-06 12:41:53

dqumcpx,taranasus,208,"It's a bit more complicated. Boomers are just collateral damage in this due to their own lack of education. I'll try and explain this to the best of my ability and knowledge and hopefully, this will all make sense.

The Federal Reserve, along with pretty much any other central and non-central bank in the world create money out of nothing. The government issue a request to the central bank to print some currency, let's say 10B usd. The fed gladly obliges and tells the government that they have to pay this money back because it was borrowed out of NOTHING and it needs to be returned to the nothing... WITH INTEREST.

Problem one, since the central bank is the only issuer of money, how can any entity, including the government, pay back interest if they wish to pay back the dept in full? They can't because all the money in existence does not cover the interest that the central bank is asking for, thus unpayable debt is generated. 

But why did the government ask for money to be printed in the first place? Initially it was because we needed some form of exchange and store of value, cool, but why now? It's because bail-outs mostly. The government borrows more money from NOTHING and injects it into massive private banks so they can continue operations and not cause the economy to collapse. Why are the large banks failing? Well, it's because they also generate money out of nothing :)

You see, for every dollar a bank receives, it is allowed to lend out 9 times that amount to whomever they see fit with the idea that the person will pay back that money that never existed WITH INTEREST. Most people do pay back, with interest, but for those who don't that's why that money they just received exists. But what happens if to many people default on their loan or want their money back from the bank? The bank lent out more money than it has so it fails, but the problem is that if it fails it can't pay its debt to the government and in turn to the central bank, and that would cause the whole economic system to break down. So instead the situation gets fixed, for free, by the government by injecting more funds that don't exist. Welcome to inflation!

Crypto aims to solve that by not entrusting governments and banks with money anymore because obviously they can't be trusted. I mean freaking hell they try to make a profit out of money that doesn't exist without caring for the long-term consequences and when they do fuck up (2008) nobody is punished for it in any way. No repercussions, nothing.

Now boomers were blinded to these problems because debt doesn't hurt immediately, it hurts over time. They got their house, they lived their life, they can now sit and watch tv all day but the massive debt they left behind in their own ignorance has to be paid by someone, the millennials to be more specific.

But you see, Satoshi Nakamoto understood all this (him/here/them whatever) and designed a new system, that's completely isolated from this catastrophic mess and gave the debt payers a way out. But this becomes a problem: If the financial system is no longer flowing because everyone wants out of the deflationary currencies of the central bank, it will lock up again and if there are not enough willing parties to set it in motion again (pay debts, lend money to banks, etc) it will collapse. For you see, if you keep your money in a bank account, it's not yours, it's the banks, and the bank can choose how to use it and spend it in order to keep itself going. If you take it out and stick it into bitcoin, then it is truely yours, it's like stuffing gold under your pilllow. The bank can no longer use it to make new loans, it can't pay its debts with it, the system stops and down it goes.

And when that happens, if you don't have any crypto of any kind, you'll be going hungry, because the dollar will become worthless really fast. Those with jobs will probably be okay in a few months, as companies will try and desperately get into crypto-commerce to resume their operations, but those who rely on banks, insurance companies and the government for their income and well-being, god help you...",2017-12-06 22:40:40

dqv6d84,Twilight_Sniper,1581,"**Full text, for anyone who can't read the article (work firewall, etc):**

As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.

In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin. The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of Bitcoin itself drops dramatically.

Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).

At this point, it has become untenable to support Bitcoin as a payment option. We may re-evaluate whether Bitcoin makes sense for us and for the Steam community at a later date.

We will continue working to resolve any pending issues for customers who are impacted by existing underpayments or transaction fees.",2017-12-07 04:58:31

The reason the US ( and many other countries ) went off the gold standard is because one has to match the supply of money to the demand for money in order to maintain stability in the currency's value. 

You can't just manufacture new gold. So, whenever the rate of change in demand for gold differs significantly from the rate of change in the supply of gold, prices become unstable. 

Bitcoin is similarly difficult to create and destroy. When the rate of bitcoin discovery well outpaced demand, prices were depressed and stable relative to national currencies. Now that demand is large and changing quickly, and bitcoin has become relatively hard to discover--prices are driven primarily by demand. Demand is large and volatile, so--so is the price. 

This is precisely why Bitcoin will never be an official currency. It's rules ignore far too many invariant rules of society, power, and the way value works to be a good choice of national currency.

dqysrr9,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,535,"He was right.

The reason why Bitcoin is worth so much is because a lot of people have bought them. But the only reason people are buying them is because they are hoping that they will be worth more money at a later date.

This is what is called a ""bubble"". If the only value that something has is that it might be valuable later then it is worthless. Investing in bonds or stocks have real values because you are actually gaining control of something. A stock buys you the right to vote on how the company is partial ownership of that company. It is partial ownership of all the assets that the company owns, including the assets of intellectual property and the simple organization of the employment structure.

Bitcoin is supposed to be a ""currency"". It is a bad thing when a currency appreciates this way. In fact, another word for a currency appreciating in value at this fast of a pace is called ""deflation"". This means that people will stop being willing to spend the currency because they will believe that the currency is going to be worth more than the good that they are buying, which makes the currency useless as it can't be used for the basic function of being exchanged for goods.

Bitcoin wasn't supposed to appreciate in this manner, and the ability of bitcoin mining is meant to be able to limit the appreciating nature of the currency as more people use it. But it has become clear that bitcoin mining has not worked to diminish the appreciation of the currency, which is itself a bad thing.

And if the currency is suddenly no longer seen as an ""investment"" (and no currency should ever be viewed as an investment), then suddenly the vast reserves of bitcoin that are being hoarded will suddenly be on the market for actually useful currencies. And because the money supply (amount of bitcoins in existence) has been increasing the currency will suddenly and massively fall in value, which will of course push out the rest of the ""investors"". And since almost no one is actually using bitcoin as an actual currency there will be almost no one who then wants to buy it and it will further plummet.

All of this means that the only reason bitcoin has been gaining value is because idiots have been buying it hoping to get rich quick. They saw other people get rich quickly and they want to also get rich quickly. Then there are the people who know all of the points I brought up, but want to invest and try to ride the bubble, meaning buy bitcoins, promote it, and sell off their holdings before the bubble bursts. But these people are also idiots, as there is no real way to be able to know when bitcoin will burst. They are just being suckered by other people who think they are doing the same thing.

The reason why it is so hard to predict if bitcoin will rise or fall is because it is entirely reliant upon the whims of idiots and suckers, and since they are acting in an irrational way by having faith in bitcoin there is no way to guess when they will suddenly decide to lose faith. After all, they are acting irrationally in the first place. And they won't listen to people like me, as they will smugly decide I am jealous of the money they have made.

The people who are going to be hurt by this is the last group of buyers. Unfortunately bitcoin has gone mainstream, so non-techy older people are currently the latest round of suckers. They will be the ones to lose their life savings. I don't care if a 25 year old loses their inheritance, as they can at least build themselves back up. The people I feel bad for are the 60 year olds who are anxious that they didn't save enough for retirement and feel like they need to make a bet in order to get enough money for retirement, but are instead could lose it all.",2017-12-09 05:10:00

dqye0un,Moruitelda,465,"&gt; This is precisely why Bitcoin will never be an official currency.

*Exactly*. The bitcoin fanboys have their heads up their asses on this. 

Bitcoin's only value is as a currency. It's the only thing you can use it for. 

However, to be usable as a currency, it needs to be *stable*. If you think that your Bitcoin that's currently worth $17,000.00 is going to be worth $40,000.00 in two months, you're not going to use it to pay your mortgage, or buy a car, or what have you. You're going to hold it, and see if it goes up. 

Right now, a *lot* of people are doing that. 

However, the problem is that people are investing in it rather than using it as a currency. As much as the Bitcoin enthusiasts complain when you say it, this is *identical* to the tulip bulb bubble of 1636-37. People are buying it because it's valuable and it seems to be going up. 

Eventually, the available interest and capital available to invest will dry up, at some price. At that point, people will have to start using it as a currency, because it's stagnated. And they'll realize that businesses are reluctant to accept it, because it's no longer appreciating and the price seems inflated. So they'll sell. This might happen in a matter of a couple of days. 

The bottom line will be that suddenly, the price will plummet when people realize that it's not actually being used as a currency and that it has no utility except as a target for irrational speculation. 

Now, sure, there's money to be made in the interim, if you want to risk buying at $15K and selling at $18K. That's sorely tempting for me, because I think it's going to go up a fair amount more before it crashes. But I consider the crash to be inevitable, because it purports to be a currency, but it's being treated like a commodity. ",2017-12-09 00:58:29

dr00v0z,mrepper,4254,"Bitcoins are created by computers doing math problems that are so hard and complicated that they cannot be faked, at least into the foreseeable future. While solving the math problems, they are also confirming transactions on the Bitcoin network.



These math problems are bundled together in groups called ""Blocks"". These hard math problems ensure that no one miner could just swoop in and confirm all the transactions for themselves and claim the reward. The math problems are the miner's ""Proof of work.""



When a block of these math problems is solved, Bitcoins are issued to every computer that helped solve the block of math problems. They also receive their fair share of the transaction fees that users pay every time they want to send a Bitcoin.


Right now, each block of solved math problems rewards 12.5 Bitcoins. 


So if 1,000 computers solve a block, the Bitcoins are divided proportionally among them.


If you have a mining farm (a bunch of computers solving these math problems) that solves 10% of one block, you will get 10% of the reward. So, you would get 1.25 Bitcoins if you supply 10% of the power to solve the block. Plus you will get your fair share of all transaction fees that were paid for the Bitcoin transactions in that block.


This goes on and on and on. Once a block is solved and the coins issued, all of the work being done by miners goes into a new block and on and on and on...


Once all Bitcoins are issued in 2140, the miners will only earn the transaction fees for mining.


You can think of this whole process like an automated accountant. The purpose of all this hard work is to:

1) Process Bitcoin transactions on the network.

2) Limit the supply of Bitcoins so that they are not worthless.

3) Serve as the ""Proof of work"" that a miner was actually doing work mining for the network the whole time. So that Bitcoins are issued fairly in proportion to the work done by each miner.

4) To create the public ledger of all transactions that take place on the Bitcoin network.

dr2sntd,SirBastian,4386,"While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

&gt;A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

&gt;It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

&gt;This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

&gt;they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. And in limited ways, Banks are interested - you can tell that there are legitimate wins to be had in this sector, and that something LIKE Bitcoin really could transform the world. But not Bitcoin itself.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replace all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

You as an economist should well realize that monetary policy exists for a reason. It's not there so that the big 'ol Fed can steal 2% of your money every year.

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it was monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.

Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

dr3hgr5,earlzdotnet,261,"My understanding of this bill is the following: 

1. You must report how much Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc you have access to to the IRS
2. This grants permission for the government to more easily find out everything about you if you hold Bitcoin (I think he might have a bitcoin on him that he didn't report, we need to investigate all of his accounts and wiretap him) 
3. The reporting requirements are not limited only to coins you personally hold in your wallet. It also includes multi-sig arrangements that you can access in joint with someone else, and it also includes coins held in exchanges
4. Probably something that can be used by customs to delay you at the border if you hold Bitcoin and don't report you're carrying financial instruments (which could be your laptop, a hardware device.. hell, even access to a coinbase account might count)  ""detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States; and"" 
5. The US wants to make sure it asserts control over foreign banks
6. The writer of the bill is pushing it using the old cliche term ""stop terrorists"" 
7. Every US exchange is now an official money services business (I think this was the case before, but now it's codified and says you must have licenses from each state). Also changing money transmitting business to money services business for reasons? 
8. ""“(i) the term ‘account’ includes any safe deposit box and any account (as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 5318A(e) of title 31) at any financial institution; and"" - Don't keep your private keys or devices in a bank deposit box if this passes
9. Some additional money counterfeiting laws
10. Foreign bank accounts are now subject to civil forfeiture (you know, the thing where you have to go to court and prove your money isn't guilty). This law asserts that foreign banks can not petition the subpoena from the US for their own domestic bank secrecy laws (ie, ""We're the US we don't care about your laws"")... It'll be interesting to see what will happen the first time a foreign bank doesn't bow down the US though. It seems the result would be the foreign bank loses access to all USA based banking networks
11. Also all foreign banks must maintain records on US citizens on US soil (I assume so the NSA has easy access) 
12. This law allows the government to obtain your credit reports for more reasons
13. Danger pay is now allowed to FBI, ICE, Customs and Border, and the Secret Service, without question (previously only the DEA had this access)
14. Further codifying that civil forfeiture now applies to foreign banks based on mere conspiracy to do something illegal, with no proof requirements. 
15. And of course, a big blanket exception for the entire act to US law enforcement and intelligence agencies

I pay my taxes like I'm suppose to with a CPA to handle all the headache, but this bill is complete bullshit. It's only marginally about taxes. It's about making sure the US can seize any asset they want on the rumor of you doing something illegal, and making sure they know exactly how much money you have and where at all times... as well as giving more excuses for them to search, delay, and seize your assets.",2017-12-12 03:39:10

dr5e9za,Irishpersonage,357,"I made a mistake.

Well, I've made plenty of  mistakes, but never one this bad.

It was really bad.

Let me start where these things normally do, seven months ago. I'm nobody special, nobody unique, but I have a certain... set of skills... 

I'm good with computers. Just a thing I can do. Also I'm pretty bored, pretty much all the time.

Anyways, like I was saying, seven months ago it was a dark and stormy night, in mid-June. I was going about my usual online shenanigans, enjoying the digital freedom of the TOR network, when I stumbled across a website, a hit-man website.

Now, I've played Assassin's Creed, I used to airsoft, I watched the Soprano's, and in a moment of monumental mindlessness, I thought;

“Fuck it.”

One sign-up form, two ads for blood-cleaning products, and several minutes wait later, I got a notification.

“John Holden. 554 Olive Boulevard Boulevard, Spokane, Washington. $5,000 &amp; 50/50. Quiet.”

Huh.

I checked my bitcoin wallet. I was $2,500 richer. No wait, $2,600 richer. $2,850 richer. $1,000 richer... shit. Bubbles.

I mapped the address. Not too far.  I began running through the countless mental exercises I had practiced over the years, backwhacks and headshots, 360 no-scopes and teabags...

Wait, I wasn't  really going to do this, was I? Well, this wouldn't be a very entertaining story if I didn't kill him, right?

I didn't kill him.

Funny enough, that wasn't my big mistake. No, I walked from that impromptu assassination with half the money and no consequences. At all. None. Seriously. 

Have you ever ordered a hit? Do you know how? Probably not. That was my mistake. 

I assumed that whoever was on the other end of our little transaction was... well... I don't know, someone like you. It didn't occur to me that somebody with the capital to order hits on a whim probably didn't like being messed with.

“Fuck it.”

So I did it again. And again.  And again. New profile, take a case, take the bitcoin, run.

How much did I make?

Much.

However, like all good things, this too had to end. It was early (for me), and the sun was lancing terrible burning spears through the slats in my shades. I covered my eyes as I stumbled over to my desk. After going through my original routine of checking my bitcoin walled, creating a new account, and logging in, I surfed through the list of new contracts for something lucrative, all the while pondering what I would do with today's haul.

And then I saw it.

My name.

Right there at the top of the list, in bold red font, with an extremely tantalizing number beneath it.  You can tell at this moment where my priorities were misaligned.  

And it wasn't just one listed once. I scrolled through the list, flipping past entry after entry with my name, my address. Thousands, tens of thousands, there was even one over a million, all with half-upfront. There were contracts in a dozen different languages, each with the same charge (as far as I could tell).

So here I was, just an average kid from Washington, sitting on a figurative dragon's hoard of meaningless but very valuable digital currency, dead-center in the cross-hairs of over a dozen criminal organizations. Criminal organizations that were, in a rather misguided approach, hiring hit-men on the internet to whack someone who pretends to be a hit-man on the internet...

Can you guess what I did?

Well, I'll leave the exciting bits out so that they can make a movie out of this some day. Don't want to spoil anything.

The root problem here is the top-heavy nature of society due to the baby boomer generation. They're retiring in one gigantic lump, punching a massive hole in the economy. With productivity decreasing, everyone panics because without that 2% growth, that [$20.5 trillion in debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) becomes a massive freaking problem. We've been printing money and strangling the life out of the younger generations. The elephant in the room is: you have two choices, the debt must be destroyed or the value of the currency must be destroyed. 


There isn't anything we can do but ride it out over the next ~20 years. (As a whole) people are going to have to get used to a drop in standard of living. Quantitative easing [increases wealth disparity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2015/06/25/how-federal-reserve-quantitative-easing-expanded-wealth-inequality/) and creates asset bubbles. Stocks are [absurdly priced](http://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart) at the moment. [NIRP](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/22/investing/negative-mortgage-rates-europe/index.html) punishes savers and the [War on Cash](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/22/investing/negative-mortgage-rates-europe/index.html) is going to pan out much like the War on Drugs - i.e. police raids, only they take your safe instead of your pot. People with any sense will store wealth elsewhere - overseas, precious metals, (cough) Bitcoin, collectibles, art etc.


People are also switching to services instead of purchases: renting instead of owning, bartering, cooking instead of eating out, Uber and a bike instead of owning a car, Netflix instead of cable, delaying marriage and kids, living with five smelly roommates and so on, i.e. a lot of the stuff Millennials have already figured out.


Markets will crash regardless of all these antics, much of this debt will default, the elite will scoop up 'real' assets at bargain-basement fire sale prices, and things will slowly recover. But it's going to be a while.

dr7dfwt,Starved-Nutritionist,140,"""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon,"" the teacher said in a gentle voice. ""You'll be home before you know it.""

I stopped crying. I knew where I was, but as always, I didn't know why.

And so began another long life. I became a doctor this time, but a woman accused me of groping her, a heinous act I hadn't committed in five lifetimes now at least, and I lost a highly publicized trial, lost my license to practice medicine, became an alcoholic and died in a gutter.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

I went the route of professional basketball. I had medical knowledge, remembered the training routines of NBA players from constantly following the teams, and I think you could argue I was the greatest shooter in NBA history. I lived a privileged life. I got inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and I spent my last few years in Miami, still fucking broads who had just graduated high school. I ended up dying at the ripe old age of 89.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

President of the United States? Meh. I tried. It didn't work out. I ended up groping another woman. Maybe it was the same chick from my life as a doctor. I couldn't remember.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

Tried my hands at being an assassin. My first murder attempt, it was a police sting. I shot a cop. 20 cops shot me.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

Invested in Bitcoin. The empire I created fell apart by 2025. I jumped off the tower in New York that beared my name.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

Nice, simple job as a custodian. Groped a woman, though. Her husband shot me to death.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

I decided to actually look for my parents this time. They were never in the picture. They'd been missing since I was 4 years old in my original life, before all the redos. My grandparents raised me. They looked young enough when I was a kid that people mistook them for my parents. We never corrected anyone.

This time, though, I pressured my grandparents to tell me what happened. I never did that before. I guess I never cared. But with infinite restarts comes the thirst for infinite knowledge.

As luck would it have it, my parents were alive, but not well. They were drug addicts. I wondered if they ever tried making contact in my past lives when I became rich...? I always heard rumblings from the ass kissers around me that so-and-so from Boston claimed to be my long lost cousin or some ho from Australia insisted she was my twin sister. Never anything about any parents, though.

I made it this life's mission to find them. In high school, I invented Facebook months before Zuckerberg could. I was a billionaire by my senior year. I invested tons of money into private investigators to locate my parents. Decades went by without luck. I died not knowing what became of them.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

I tried again. This time, I went the drug addict route. I don't know why I never tried street drugs before. I'd been missing out on a lot.

I joined a street gang. They were brothers to me. We ended up murdering my grandmother to get a fix, but it's okay. I'd see her next time and be one hundred times nicer.

I lost grasp of time inside a drug den. Many times I'd awaken in a jail cell, but California had weak laws. They always let me out due to overcrowding in jails.

""It's okay, Billy. Your parents will be back soon. You'll be home before you know it.""

... I don't know what happened. Maybe I overdosed?

Well, time to try something new. No. Never mind. On second thought, that was fun. I'm doing that again.

So I did. This time I skipped the slow introduction via trying weed, then alcohol, then coke, then molly, etc. I just jumped right into acid.

What a trip. I was high as hell. I could've sworn a painting was talking to me.

Wait... It *is*. It beckons me.

I.. I climb into it. Is this present or past? Is it happening now or am I relaying the tale in a new life? I don't know. I can't... tell...

I'm inside a new dimension. What is this? I feel like I'm floating. I am. The ground is waaaaaay below me.

""Son,"" says a voice. I look up. It's a man. Behind him is a woman.

""We gave you finite lives,"" the woman says.

""Mom? Dad?""

""You wasted them all.""

""I don't understand.""

""You wasted them all.""

""But I wanted to find you guys!""

""You wasted them all.""

The problem is that it is set to Bcash by default, even if the home screen says ""Bitcoin"". BCH is confusingly called ""Bitcoin Cash"" and Bitcoin is called ""Bitcoin Core"" (which is a node software, not a coin). The receive tab shows Bcash exclusively and it is not evident at all how to set it to Bitcoin. You need to click on a small arrow in the corner, unfold a menu, and then select the ""BTC"" option.

I'm worried about the newbies waking up to the realization that as a currency Bitcoin is currently severely crippled.

drd6ems,kinoshitajona,143,"You need to know the history of Copay wallet:

1. It was SOLELY for multisig. (a long time ago)
2. Multisig requires communication and cooperation among participants, so to do this they made the multisig participants share an encryption key that was passed via QR code, this shared encryption key would be used to encrypt ALL data sent to the server.
3. Then multisig people could send proposals to the server ie. ""hey, guys, want to send x BTC to address y?"" and the other participants could vote with their signatures. If enough people reject, the signatures are all deleted, but the record of the rejected proposal stays on the server, encrypted, for all the participants to see.
4. This kind of cooperation was the first of its kind. Electrum only added their multisig stuff AFTER Copay did this. It was revolutionary at the time.
5. People asked Copay to support single sig wallets.
6. Rather than create a new paradigm for single sig all together, they derive the encryption key from your recovery phrase using a special path, and all your wallet data is encrypted before uploading.
7. With single sig, the benefits are much smaller... HOWEVER, there are a FEW cool things you can do (but most people don't) with this model.
8. For example, you can give someone a public-only copy of your copay wallet, they can import it and they will be able to generate addresses on your behalf (which other wallets can do) but NOT ONLY THAT they can use the proposal system from multisig and CREATE A SPEND PROPOSAL. (so you could give your secretary the public copay copy, they could create a proposal with a memo saying ""this is the payment to abc"" and since the proposal is signed and encrypted using the ""shared encryption key"" you know the proposal came from someone who you shared the public-only wallet with.) Now all you need to do is click ""approve""... ironically this would have prevented Bitpay's phishing attack problem in 2015... Getting bitcoin addresses via email and trusting that is a big nono, using signatures and securely sending encrypted data via BWS servers is much better.

There's not much physical exertion, so assuming a resting metabolic rate of 1500kcal/day, manual hashing works out to almost 10 megajoules/hash. A typical energy consumption for mining hardware is 1000 megahashes/joule. So I'm less energy efficient by a factor of 10^16, or 10 quadrillion. The next question is the energy cost. A cheap source of food energy is donuts at $0.23 for 200 kcalories. Electricity here is $0.15/kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper by a factor of 6.7 - closer than I expected. Thus my energy cost per hash is about 67 quadrillion times that of mining hardware.

'Old man' advice for the newly Bitcoin/crypto rich ....  
If selling around 10-20% of your portfolio of crypto-assets would give you life-altering money, please consider it seriously   
Life is a marathon of ups &amp; downs, not a sprint. Always think about downsides and protect yourself ... for the future you's sake  
If you've been in Bitcoin/others for &gt;12 months and still have debt, you're being reckless.  Pay it off.  
It is boring, but buying a property should give you peace of mind for life ... i.e. it is priceless security.  If you can, do it.  Be ultra-conservative about any borrowing  
Another 'boring' idea is to have ~1 year of overheads in the bank ... especially if you are a trader or running a startup  
Securing yourself allows you to continue to take risks in life and pursue things that truly excite you. You will be liberated to consider possibilities &amp; options that others can't  
If you are a trader, trading from a position of strength will make you better  
Bitcoin may go to $50k, but that doesn't matter - you will never regret setting yourself up for life  
Enjoy yourself, but try to avoid large displays of wealth. No reason to paint a target on your back or attract the wrong kinds of people  
Avoid believing that your wealth makes you extremely smart. It doesn't. Stay grounded, remember where you started and treat everyone as equals  
If investing outside of crypto for the first time, be extremely cautious and conservative until you build up knowledge &amp; experience  
Invest in yourself (your health, knowledge, etc.)
Your health is your most valuable asset

Ethereum started its bull run before Bitcoin. Heck, during this bull run, Bitcoin was being dumped and Ethereum almost reached the flippening.

drgwa2v,binarygold,204,"I think the world is not black or white. It’s not 1MB decentralized or 1GB centralizes.

The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. Increasing the blocksize slightly over long periods of time is acceptable for decentralization and would resuce the fees and allow more people to use Bitcoin thus increase its value due to increased network effects. 

It is great to have alts testing the waters and verifying in real world scenarios if our assumptions are correct or not.

I opposition to block size increase it was said a bigger blockchain will reduce the number of nodes and user growth won’t compensate for it. This has been proven false by Ethereum. Their blockchain is now twice as big than BTC and the number of nodes is increasing because they also have more users. They have over 25K full nodes visible on the network as opposed to 10K on bitcoin. Thus, we now know that increasing the userbase will compensate for some old nodes dropping off, because some new users will run full nodes to make up for it and more. 

It was also said that larger blocks won’t propagate, create more orphans, etc. BCH tested this for us and we know there are no such issues anymore, either because the internet is generally better and faster. 

Are there any technical issues with larger blocks? I’m not aware of any others that haven’t been resolved so far.

I understand and agree that it’s not a long term solution to raise the block size, but it’s a necessary short term solution and it’s part of the long term solution too.

Core’s scaling plan from two years ago clearly states that at one point the blocksize needs to be raised to make sure user experience and network growth is not limited by this factor. It’s been signed by all who matters. I listen to them and respect their opinion. 

I think the time is now. We need a solution to increase the block size gradually and conservatively in a way that only requires one hard fork to solve it for a long time. I think the miners will give us support. Heck they were 95% behind s2X. It would be crazy not to support an official core blocksize hf that is properly designed and tested. 

I suggest 50kb block size increase on every difficulty adjustment if the blocks are 95% full in the last period. And 50kb decrease if it’s below 85%. This way the most we would get is around 20 (not every two weeks) x 50kb increase or 1MB per year. We would have the segwit part grow similarly to match up the base block. 

This would mean if the block size was increased by the max amount and all blocks were full after 12 months we would have a base blockchain growth of 100GB instead of 50GB. Not too bad. I know my node can easily handle it, including the increased traffic.

The max would be capped at 16MB which we would only reach in 10+ years. 

This would keep the fees at around $1 for the next few years until we have LN ready and adopted to a wide level. At the same time the benefit to move to LN would still be very strong, since the fees on LN would be just a few Satoshis compared to few hundred on the main chain. 

Once we use LN extensively we still need a larger blocksize anyway. At the current block size we can only serve 15M people if they only touch the majn chain once a month, which is reasonable because occasionally you need to rebalance your channels no matter how well developed LN is. Even with additional layers we only get to maybe 100M users at 100% segwit and LN adoption. That’s not enough to serve the world. We need to raise the blocksize to serve LN so it can reach a critical mass where it’s really useful because virtually anyone can pay anyone else.

So for now we would use the larger blocksize to serve users on chain, and later to serve them on LN. 

I hope Core devs can suggest a good dynamic blocksize idea and we can start testing it on testnet soon. Let’s do this folks!",2017-12-19 21:52:29

drga217,px403,187,"Bitcoin maxes out at about 400 thousand transactions per day, and this is how it will be until the end of time.  Ethereum, on the other hand, is flexible, and will automatically scale up as demand increases.  Well, demand has been increasing, and now not only is Ethereum constantly doing more than twice Bitcoin's max capacity, but it has gone over 1 million transactions per day, which is pretty impressive.  This says a lot about Ethereum's utility.  It is by far the most used cryptocurrency in the space, and by a wide margin.

Bitcoin and Ethereum differ philosophically on this point.  Bitcoin core developers have decided that 400k transactions per day is enough, and anyone who wants to be one of those 400k transactions can bid, using high transaction fees, to get their place on the blockchain.  This prices out users who only want to send 10 or so dollars at a time, and ensures that Bitcoin's future will be for financial institutions moving large amounts of money between themselves.

Ethereum on the other hand has decided that when more people want to use it, it automatically (slowly, but automatically) scales up the network to meet demand, and if demand goes down, it will reduce capacity.  This ensures that no one gets priced out of the network, and everyone who builds their infrastructure around Ethereum can continue to use it for the foreseeable future.

He said there should be. ""THERE SHOULD BE"". He knows what he's doing. He doesn't want BTC to exist. He wants BCH to be Bitcoin. He doesn't want BTC to exist alongside BCH at all, because how can BTC exist, if you want the name 'Bitcoin'? It can't.

drizf96,MENDACIOUS_RACIST,409,"When the crash comes, it's going to be spectacular.  Bitcoin exchanges are so much more fragile than conventional financial exchanges.  Even now, it can take an hour for a Bitcoin trade to resolve.  Here's what will happen.

A big player will cash out.  The precipitous drop that results will spike transaction volume.

Under heavy load, transaction resolution time extends from the optimal fifteen minutes, to the often-occurring 60 minutes, to two hours.

Word spreads as the skittish investors who sold at first aren't getting receipts that their trades go through.  People sell from all their exchanges, eager to insure that at least SOME go through in time.  Meanwhile the price is dropping faster as people become more and more panicked that their sell orders aren't being executed even as they watch the price drop.

This is where Bitcoin adds its special sauce: an exchange founder's bitcoin transactions somehow jumps the queue.  Groups start DDOSing exchanges.  False rumors start trending on forums like Reddit, and then Facebook and Twitter.  CNN covers it.  Now even your father-in-law, who got in at 16k, is trying to log into his Coinbase account.  He gets a 403 error and starts yelling at the screen.

drk4izl,JustSomeBadAdvice,378,"&gt; The reason BTC has lost market share in the last few years is simply because there are hundreds more players in the space now each with their own interesting solutions to existing problems and applications.

This was true in 2014.  It was true in 2015.  It was true in 2016.  It was true in early 2017, and it is true in late 2017.

The graph shows pretty clearly what happened when you look at it though: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large

&gt; but I really don't think there's a statistically significant contingent of investors who are like, ""Dude, F these transaction times and fees! I'm going to switch to these other coins that are exactly like BTC but better/cheaper/faster."" 

No, you're right.  There probably isn't that going on right now.  What's going on right now is far, far worse.  Starting in 2015, anyone who disagreed with Core was banned from the forums, attacked and insulted by Core, and they left.

They went to build other coins.  Vitalik built Ethereum on its own rather than on Bitcoin because he was afraid of it creating a conflict with Core.  Now it handles nearly 3x more transactions every day for a fraction of the fees.

They invested in other coins.  They build businesses and communities.

People were again banned in waves in 2016 with Classic.  But fees hadn't risen yet.  Businesses remained.

In 2017 this all changed.  Fees rose to unsustainable levels.  The network became unusable for days at a time, multiple times a month for months on end.  Altcoins suddenly had bigger gains than Bitcoin, and suddenly they were REAL competition in marketcap not piddly little ideas trying to compete with the master.

Businesses began to leave.  First it was [donation links coming down](https://twitter.com/guerrillamail/status/838001194106642432).  It was businesses people [didn't hear about often](https://blog.bitspark.io/bitspark-switching-to-bitshares-for-remittances/) leaving.  Businesses which the ecosystem wasn't reliant on [built things on other coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5xu306/circle_is_building_a_payment_system_on_ethereum/).

But worse, the businesses that the ecosystem was reliant on - for services, for usability, for merchants - began to add support for alternative coins, and competitors sprang up supporting altcoins.  Bitcoin waited nearly 6 years to get a debit card.  Ethereum waited 1.  Bitcoin waited 5 years for a diverse set of exchanges.  Ethereum waited 1.  BCH got both of those things within months.  Bitcoin waited 9 years for futures; Ethereum is poised to get them in less than 3.  The merchant services providers are planning on adding multiple altcoins, something Bitcoin spent 4 years building and 3 years trying to get merchants to actually adopt it.

Then came \#no2x.  2x was popular, it achieved measurable consensus, and it could have prevented the slide we're on now.  Except Core didn't want it.  They rejected it when it was proposed to them and then began attacking it publicly.  As soon as segwit was activated, /r/Bitcoin began banning anyone who supported segwit2x - simply for supporting it.

Where do those people go?  Every single person banned - which is a fuckload - goes to altcoins.  They will never come back.  They have no more faith in Core or Bitcoin under Core.  BCH has a miniscule number of transactions but has multiple well-funded self-organized grassroots groups that are pushing merchant adoption, pushing use cases to come back to BCH after leaving Bitcoin or to add BCH as an option.  Meanwhile the biggest businesses begin to leave Bitcoin - Steam.

So now the banning and refusal to compromise has created an army of very wealthy early adopters (thanks Bitcoin!) who now want to see it fall, and they have the options to push.

Does that cause your ""contingent of investors"" to switch to other coins?  Not right away it doesn't.  But what you're seeing today is the result of the bans and ejections of people who disagreed in 2015 and 2016.  The massive number of people disillusioned with Bitcoin and Core with \#no2x haven't even begun to have an impact yet.  The people and businesses who have been choked by multi-day waits or $65 transaction fees?  Them leaving won't be felt yet.

You can't feel the impact of these things in a bull market.  And it isn't something you can see on a short timeline.  It is measured in the people who don't buy.  It is measured in the negative word of mouth spread by this army of disenfranchised pissed off former Bitcoin supporters.

But it is coming.   You'll feel it in a bear market when other coins break out.  Why?  Who buys in a bear market?  Who buys when the prices of the coin is in the shitter and everyone's depressed.

That's when you need use-cases.  You need the darknetmarkets guys who will buy their Bitcoins to get their fix no matter what the price is.  You need your remittances guys for the same reason.  You need your evangelists who are consistently, day in, day out, telling people that Bitcoin is the future and that it will recover.

But we've lost our darknetmarkets.  We've lost our remittances companies.  We've lost the gambling companies.  We've lost the Roger Ver's.  The big blockers now have a new thing to evangelize.  And so does anyone else who knows the history of this.  Most of the people who have been alienated were die-hard supporters.  In a shit market, guess who you really need on your side?  The die hard supporters.

drm9okx,joeknowswhoiam,246,"You summarized the situation pretty accurately, thank you for being pragmatic in the midst of all these post from panicked *investors*.

I have the same analysis as you and I am also a developer, but I have worked on open-source projects before (not sure if it's your case) and the mentality you describe for tech companies (which I've experienced first-hand too), in my experience, never translates into sustainable *long term* products/solutions in the open-source world. The imperatives of such projects are much different than the ones required to make a startup profitable, developers who give their time in open-source projects often are volunteers or they are paid but could be paid much more doing other projects in more traditional industries.

A globally distributed open-source development team, for a project that is also used globally in production cannot change direction as fast as your usual startup projects. And this situation is also exacerbated because these developers are dealing with their end users money directly, so they have to be even more careful when they take decisions.

While I totally understand that some people want things now because what is described to them sounds really awesome, it is just not possible to deliver it in a hurry. We can't go back and forth continuously on the matter of blocksize for example just because the project is suddenly very popular, it would not increase the incentive to develop second layer solutions quicker (the incentive is already present and implementations are currently in tests). It would also imply hardfork(s) which would increase the workload for the developers of the whole ecosystem (SPV clients, wallets, miners, etc.), not just the core team... This is not a resource the community can waste and expect to renew by throwing more money at them while forcing them to do something they are opposed to in the first place. Finally those hardfork(s), even if they are not contentious, have the potential to split the community even more than it is currently and that wouldn't be productive at all as you can imagine. There is a roadmap, and it is planned to happen at some point, but only when it is considered as safe and useful for all the parties involved, not just when it is convenient for new adopters.

My position is that we have to let time and the market settle this issue (while obviously continuing the development of the currently envisioned solutions). I attribute the recent price decrease to a loss of confidence in cryptocurrencies in general based on the inefficiency of Bitcoin to transact for low fees. But I do not think it is a bad thing. The system is not currently scaled appropriately for all the people who recently put faith in it, not because we do not want to welcome these people but for valid reasons : decentralization/security and sustainability. Since it is a free market everyone was welcomed inside anyways, and unfortunately when they realize that it's not what they expected, they leave the space or move to other coins which can provide them with the instant gratification/services they are looking for because these coins are years away from having the issues Bitcoin currently endure with scaling. We can only hope they will come back when our *house* will be large enough for everyone, but compromising our standards of security/censorship resistance to satisfy them immediately is not and will never be a solution in my opinion.",2017-12-22 23:25:05

For the last year, every day it seemed the crypto market was getting dumber and dumber. This really needed to happen for everyone to wake up. You have forks of a memecoin being worth close to a billion dollars, you have coins that only started trading a few months ago based on nothing more than a 10 page whitepaper being valued over $10 billion, you have a slow, expensive dinosaur in Bitcoin underwriting the entire altcoin market and you have endless naive millennials just pouring money into everything without even understanding what a blockchain is. This bull run was lead by people jumping on Coinbase and chasing FOMO, and getting dumped on by bots and people who know how to read volume/support levels. 

[I created this spreadsheet that draws values from the blockchain API a while ago to give some objective valuation metric to Bitcoin as a transactional vehicle based on mining](https://i.imgur.com/2N4Ltoj.jpg) since the two ways you can get a BTC is either mine it yourself or buy it from someone else, and no matter what mining cost assumptions I inputed I couldn't get anywhere near justifying a price over 10K, even applying generous multiples to that to account for the opportunity cost of lost time. In reality with China dominating mining and their average cost being under 2k, and even applying a super high discount rate and making a 2-4x time value multiplier would put Bitcoin as worth somewhere between 4-8K in a sane market. It's pretty much where the [long term MA settles at too.](https://i.imgur.com/08mjBrB.png)

Everyone who tried to do any analysis realized the thing was a bubble, and all the smart money got out of it after the CME futures started trading. But what percentage of people who invested in the last year performed any fundamental or quantitative analysis whatsoever? I am willing to bet that 90% of people investing have no idea how a blockchain functions and what actually happens to complete a transaction, what a POW or POS is, what SHA-256 or hashrate mean or even whether there is any code in the depository of the latest coin they are buying. I'm seeing vaporware with no product whatsoever and with nothing more than a flashy website filled with buzzwords run up their market cap into billions. People are just gambling on symbols rather than buying assets with underlying utility.

This Greater Fool run by Bitcoin (""It will continue rising, because its run up so much in the past!"") needs to be ended sooner rather than later, because as painful as it may be for some people to accept, BTC really does need to die for crypto to prosper in the long term. Its a terrible transactional vehicle and really pushes people away from crypto who want it to be a useable product that actually solves the transactional inefficiencies in today's system. How can bitcoin ""transform the future of finance"" and ""solve the inflation crisis in Venezuela"" when it costs $40 to send $20 worth in Bitcoin? How is it ""decentralized from influence by a single actor"" when a single private exchange (Coinbase) can cause such havoc in its value? 

Take a  look at the unconfirmed transactions list, we are now nearing 300k:

https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

Take a look at how out of control the mempool is:

https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size?timespan=all

And the median transaction fee is now over $30, and the average is over $50

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html

Visa handles 16,000 transactions a second, Paypal does around 200 a second, and Bitcoin gets bogged down to 4. 

Even worse there is no end in sight, the very core design makes the difficulty adjust to average 6 blocks an hour, with a 1 megabyte limiting the block to around 2800 transaction and with the 12.5 reward being halved every 210,000 blocks, the proportional reward for mining is going to move overwhelmingly towards prioritizing high fee transactions in the mempool, leading to ever increasing backlogs and slower transaction time. The entire system incentivizes the increasing of transaction fees, which means Bitcoin will never be more than a way to transfer money around coin exchanges, which is essentially all its used for today at any volume. 

How anyone thought this would be the future is beyond me.  

What sucks is that there are great cryptocurrencies out there that do actually solve problems, whose adoption is being held back by Bitcoin being the standard bearer and reserve currency of the entire market. Privacy coins have real life demand for those seeking anonymous transactions, and are used in real life for real things that people would prefer to keep anonymous. Smart contract solutions that actually could help automate a lot of tedious work among settlements and payments. Foreign exchange is ripe to be made more efficient and faster with cryptocurrencies that focus on providing a banking settlement layer. As long as Bitcoin is king, we're never going see cryptomarket as a serious long term investment class. 

But nobody cares about how any of this work or whether a coin provides a function solution to a transactional market issue, its just chasing the next thing pump signal on Discord or Twitter.",2017-12-23 01:00:24

drna7i6,leiloca,808,"I have some advice. I've been doing pretty good since I began trading / investing in cryptos a few months ago (averaging 80% - 120% monthly returns). In a lesser scale of course (started with 500 usd), but still I think I've found a good strategy and have a few advices.

- don't daytrade: never, the only people losing money on crypto since 2016 are daytraders / people who think they can make money guessing when something is going up or down.
- the whole crypto market cap is growing, so, if you pick 20 amazing projects and invest, you should see your holdings increasing through time. The smaller the market cap, the higher is the return potential, but higher the risk of the project being bad (because the ""good"" dones are already priced and have bigger market caps). However, as we are so early in the game (i think 2018 will be a wonderful year for alt coins) you can find some golden nuggets on lower market cap altcoins. For instance, I've made 800% on Verge Coin (bought before John Mcfee said something about it on twitter because I believed in the project, team and community). Made 700% on TRX, Tron, what an amazing team, you can see those guys are not sleeping until they succeed. My case is, diversify on small caps with big potential, growing community, uses for the coin / token, great team, great tech, and so on). 
- For tron TRX to give 100% return on my investment it just went up 60 satoshis (from 60 to 120). For Bitcoin to double you need for it to go from 15,000 to 30,000 and that will take some time. Tron took 1 day. This is where the money is. After tron reached 17th place on total market cap, I knew I could sell it, make a profit, and search the ""next tron"".

So, those are my tips for you. 20 coins, small market cap, solid team (please don't invest in coins where there are no ""team"" section with pictures and linkedin profiles of the devs. It's ok to do that with opensource projects / blockchains / currencies, but most altcoins have teams behind it and they must shine. Check the community / twitter / foruns, see what they are talking about. Are the devs available for a quick chat on reddit? Is the community active?
- Ok now you have 20 projects you believe are good and undervalued, there is one last thing for you to do. HOLD but also realize profits. For instance, after Verge gave me 800%, I sold 80% of my Verges to invest on coins I considered my next ""Verges"". Verge is not going up 800% in 1 week anymore, but others are, can you find them? So, basically use the profits you realized from a nice investment on a coin, keep some of the investment, sell some to invest in other new coins. Use money you earn to make more money.

Also, because I like to have fun sometimes, I have a margin account on Bitfinex with a little over 500 usd now. I know, it sucks, and I even margin trade with USDT which sucks even more, but I know I can lose those 500 any time, so thats my play money, I make some swing trades. But I never made money from margin trading. I've got to 3k usd once, lost all my way to 200. I learned I'm very greedy and I tend to allow more risk trades (and many times senseless trades) when I'm winning, and thus I lose). So, I try to discipline myself into using my margin accoun only on very specific trades.

I have a nice one going, I bought BCH at 1,950 during the dip with 3x leverage. I'm doing 120% on that trade since 12 hours ago. I set a stop loss to 60% profits, so if BCH falls while I'm sleeping (in a few minutes) I still get 60%. If it rises, holy shit, that will be a 200% overnight trade. Still, I know I'll lose that money tomorrow on my next trade but I'll get greedy and trade without timing.

Offsss, I wrote too much, using a very bad english, but I hope you get the messages. I really believe you can show your dad your the man.

Also, don't limit yourself to trading. Read books about trading, technical analysis may help you figure out some stuff too (specially trade volumes, those mean a lot when trying to guess long term holds / sells), and STUDY.

Also, with 20,000 usd I would recommend you use 4 exchanges. Never put all your money into a single exchange. They may be hacked and so on. You can move the coins you really believe in to safe offline wallets for longer periods. Leave the coins you will trade profits on the exchanges.

Anyone with experience in markets know they are incredibly irrational. They are not logical. The recent (incredible) bull trend has led to an overvaluation, plain and simple.

I think the biggest issue bitcoin and all the crypto currencies face is mechanisms to securely store and spend/convert bitcoin to other currencies. Most people can't even properly secure their online banking accounts. And all that requires is strong passwords, or if you are a bit smarter, some form of password keychain with 2nd factor authentication.  

This means most people will be dependent on storing their crypto currency with an exchange. If there is one thing I DO NOT TRUST, is proper IT security from most companies. VERY FEW get it right. All it will take is a major data-breach at a place like coinbase, and it is ALL over.

There have been posts that complain about this sub turning into a meme and greed sub. That there is no more discussions about improving the technology or about uniting the community. Now, take a look at the comment I'm responding to and just think about why this sub is the way it is.

The OP (original post) is about the technology and is asking for the community to contribute testing the lighting network. If you haven't already, you should try it out and witness how amazing and real it is. You'll realize that scaling is possible and being worked on. 

This sub is filled with spammers, trolls, and lil FUDsters. It always has been. However, this space has grown and attracted a lot more people. Some new, some good, some bad, some close minded, some short sighted, etc. 

The point of my comment is to highlight the comments/posts that contribute nothing to Bitcoin's progress. Anytime you see some ""alarming"" or ""warning"" or the-sky-is-falling type content, take it with caution. This posts is about advancing the technology and the comment I'm responding to stole highjacked the top comment to sneak in a snarky, obvious remark goes as far as to provide ""proof"".

I'd encourage ground-up alternate implementations knowing damn well that the kind of people dumb enough to work on them expecting to create a viable competitor anytime soon aren't going to succeed. Every time anyone tried mining with one, I'd use my knowledge of all the ways they are incompatible to fork them, making it clear they can't be trusted for mining. Then I'd go a step further and ""for the good of Bitcoin"" create a process by which regular soft-forks and hard-forks happened so that Bitcoin can be ""improved"" in various ways, maybe every six months. Of course, I'd involve those alternate implementations in some IETF-like standards process for show, but all I would have to do to keep them marginalized and the majority of hashing power using the approved official implementation is slip the odd consensus bug into their code; remember how it was recently leaked that the NSA spends $250 million a year on efforts to insert flaws into encryption standards and commercial products. With changes every six months the alts will never keep up. Having accomplished political control, the next step is pushing the development of the Bitcoin core protocol in ways that further my goals, such as scalability solutions that at best allow for auditing, rather waiting until protocols are developed, tested, and accepted by the community that support fully decentralized mining.

If you’ve noticed since the Bitcoin Cash fork a plethora of new forks which have mostly been airdrops and some just plain scams have popped up. This has all been orchestrated to try to fear people until thinking forks in general are bad to try to discredit Bitcoin Cash. 

As we also already know they created this soft fork process to also try to discredit hard forks and introduce buggy code like SegWit making it difficult for any forks to maintain (thankfully Bitcoin Cash devs had the foresight to fork before SegWit was activated). 

There is also a lot of code creep that has been cleaned up in Cash, for example RBF which is a disaster in combination with the new 14-day mempool eviction policy. 

Lastly regarding scalability, we have Lightning (Coming Soonish) which has delayed scaling for ages in the hopes of a working system which will undoubtedly morph into a hub and spoke network that is perfect for auditing centralized players. ",2017-12-26 22:08:47

If you mean lightning network, thats a centralized solution developed by a private company and its not even close to being finished.

""The biggest threats to Bitcoin. I think, Bitcoin isn't just a technology, it's also a community. And, actually probably one of the most effective ways of attacking that community is by spreading disinformation, creating dissent, and [creating] arguments and drama within the Bitcoin community. And I would be very surprised if Bitcoin is the first community—that is an activist grassroots community—that is not *fully fully* infiltrated by a whole bunch of intelligence services, and corporate spies, and bullshit artists who are trying to cause problems. Why? Because historically we know that *every* single grassroots activist movement: the environmentalists, the feminists, the anti-war activists—all of them—the communists, the labor unions, have been infiltrated, have been filled with propaganda, have had active agents creating drama. Reddit, I'm talking about you.

So, my advice is: focus on the technology, the technology is real. The drama isn't real, it's completely fake. Some of it is just idiots. Some of it is paid people who are doing this as a job. And I try to pay as little attention to the drama as possible. That's one of the risks for Bitcoin. Fragmentation of the community slows things down. If the brightest programmers we have are spending all day dealing with trolls on Reddit, they're not writing code. Right?

I ignored bitcoin because it's not what I invest in.  I work in tech and I understand the technical details of blockchain, but I'm a value investor so I don't get too worried about missed opportunities.  I also had zero stress passing on gold in 2008 when ""everybody was buying gold,"" or 2000 when everyone was buying tech stocks.  To me, the phenomenon are exactly the same (incredible shoot up in price, people saying it's a game changer, lots of n00bs jumping into the market like they know what they're talking about).  My guess is I'll go through 4 or 5 more of these and it will be the same every time.

You are traveling through parts of a country with a medium to high violent crime rate. You need to use some of your Bitcoin to pay for something. If every person you transact with knows exactly how much money you have, this is a threat to your personal physical safety.

You are a business that receives a payment from a supplier. That supplier will be able to see how much money your business has, and therefore can guess at how price sensitive you are in future negotiations. They can see every single other payment you’ve ever received to that Bitcoin address, and therefore determine what other suppliers you are dealing with and how much you are paying those suppliers. They may be able to roughly determine how many customers you have and how much you charge your customers. This is commercially sensitive information that damages your negotiating position enough to cause you relative financial loss.

You are a private citizen paying for online goods and services. You are aware that it is common practice for companies to attempt to use ‘price discrimination’ algorithms to attempt to determine the highest prices they can offer future services to you at, and you would prefer they do not have the information advantage of knowing how much you spend and where you spend it.

You sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment.

Monero solves these privacy issues by automatically applying privacy techniques to every single transaction made. You can have confidence that it is not possible to own ‘tainted’ Monero.

There's no reason to be concerned about Ripple overtaking Eth's market cap because the bottom line is Ripple and Ethereum are two different projects with different goals and should not viewed as competitors at all.  Ripple is a pure payment transaction channel developed and targeted for the banking industry, it has a limited scope in what it does.

[And further, we know that bitcoin has approximately 45% of the market cap total.](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

So we can estimate about 50 million people in crypto, assuming each address was one per person. The number is likely actually lower. 


American adult population, + europe bloc, + soviet bloc, + asian bloc @ 5% adoption rate = ~250 million adults not incarcerated or incapacitated. 

If they each threw in only $100 to whatever random currency, the market cap would go up from $550 billion of today to $2.8 TRILLION. 

RECAP:

~5% adoption rate growing from 1% (adoption rate is actually closer to .15% many duplicate address, many with penny balances, several million lost and remade anew, etcetera)

~absurdly low initial investment of only $100 (remember, this is just first world grown ups, no third world or poverty types adopting yet)


With only two basic assumptions that you can't really argue with, it is clear the market will grow 500% and pretty much all coins will initially rise, then newbs will start reading, then everything will collapse into top ten or top 25 maybe. for a period while development cycles complete.

1) Ripple lab's XRP ledger is a blockchain, but each node takes the place of what miners do. So if XRP doesn't use a blockchain, I could easily say BTC doesn't because a trusted network is the one verifying transactions.

1.5) Those trusted nodes select which they trust, and transactions are sent across the shortest path of trusted nodes between one another. So it is like using a trusted individual to act as an intermediary to give funds to someone else, while allowing them to also hand it off to an individual they trust until it gets to an individual the person you are sending to trusts.

2) There is no mining, 100 billion coins is all that will ever exist and currently over half is in an escrow contract meaning that it is frozen for so many months and 1 billion is released monthly...anything that isn't purchased by financial institutions is put back into a 54 month escrow contract. On top of that transaction fees aren't paid to anyone, they are burned into the ether making it a deflationary currency.

3) You are correct in that XRP isn't fully required...but in order to open an account on the XRP ledger you have to fund the minimum reserve which is inaccessible funds used solely for transactions. Nodes can use fee voting to raise or lower this reserve as prices increase making the XRP usable by the account for other purposes.

4) Yes it is somewhat centralized...but it also isn't to a degree as well. The only real centralization issue is when one party controls a majority of XRP...which is an issue with all currencies. Them working with banks to solve real financial problems isn't what makes it centralized. Right now Ripple labs is removing 1 of its nodes for every 2 third party nodes that come into existence in an attempt to not be subject to a 51% attack and has the goal of being more decentralized that bitcoin. Yes it is a goal on paper and may be a false promise so I can understand being bearish about those claims.

4-5) Also, posting a few words and raising concerns isn't explaining how those things are problems...it is showing your lack of information on those matters.

Overall, if you don't like XRP, think it is a scam coin, or just dislike the fact that Ripple Labs is a fintech company working with the banking industry....that is fine...but I personally am bullish on the coin used in a technology intended to free up the 27 trillion dollars locked up in nostro accounts, which would almost double the amount of narrow money available to use globally...because once you add liquidity to banking and ALL fiat currency has the ability to be liquid, every legitimate crypto is going to fair better as it fills in as a substitute for fiat...because right now what good is replacing fiat currency if most global wealth is just sitting around as it is and not moving? In my opinion disliking XRP and Ripple labs is short sighted because what they are doing is the first step in making cryptos actually have the ability to *replace* fiat.

Plus I enjoy having 5 second transaction times.",2017-12-30 15:05:41
drxxq7n,King_Chickawawa,508,"Look, there's a hell of hype now surrounding Ripple &amp; XRP, right now the market cap on XRP is more than every other crypto save BTC and do you know why?

Because it will probably get used more than every other crypto, and I would honestly guess it will get used more than BTC eventually too.

This space, let's be honest, is speculative as fuck. While I love it here and have made a lot of money and hope to continue to do so for quite some time, again if we're honest, this is a really small little world. It is mostly filled with geeks, nerds, tech heads, early adopters who now claim to be investment experts, a whole bunch of people talking shit and an astoundingly large number of complete fucking idiots who have no idea what the hell is going on. Yes the space has gotten bigger, yes it has attracted a bunch more people, and yes there are also the idealists, the visionaries, the genius revolutionaries, and so many incredible minds and awesome people.

I also love the idea that crypto will change the world, revolutionize the economy, bring peace in the middle east and vastly improve my vehicle situation...

But outside of this little world, is the real world. That's where the bankers live, the big institutions, where most people haven't even heard of this world and those who have, have only heard of bitcoin and ethereum and couldn't explain the difference between the two if their lives depended on it. 

Despite the claims, I don't think most cryptos are going to be adopted anywhere near as much as the hype suggests or most people are gambling on, and that's what most of this is, to be honest, speculative gambling. I highly doubt people are going to go to the store and scroll through a list of their BTC, BCH, Dash, Monero, or XVG wallets to see what they will use to quickly pay for their coffee and croissant that is easier and cheaper than handing over cash or swiping your paypass chipped card. Because if we're honest, its not easier. 

Sure many of these cryptos will grow, perhaps some will die, some will get adopted more, and this is the early days...

But XRP doesn't really give a fuck about that idealized, romanticised crypto-fuelled Utopia and has never pretended to. It is a private, centralized company, with massive institutional backing, solving a real-world problem and addressing a real-world need, in a more efficient way than is currently offered. 

XRP is kicking ass right now yes, because of hype. Yes, because of speculation. But mostly because it has real-world uses that are far far greater than this tiny little world. The thing about this little world is that the longer you spend in here, the more important you think it is.

Just my two cents worth... ",2017-12-30 14:13:04

drwsw15,PartTimeTrader,242,"I bought xrp back in september and again during the massive crash before the bitcoin fork. Managed to snag a few thousand for the 15-18c range. In December i got laid off from work which sucks but lucky for me I was sitting on a couple months salary worth of xrp. I sold a big chunk at 50c because I expected a big correction. This did not happen and I ended up selling for about half of what i could have got a couple of days later. Today I sold the rest. I know that if I were able to wait till the end of 2018 i would have seen huge returns but unfortunately my situation did not permit for that. Xrp did however provide enough of a return to let me be comfortable till i can find a new job. I will buy in again when i can fully knowing that i may not see returns like the ones i got already but as far as cryptos go its damn hard to go wrong with xrp. I am thankful for the returns i have got so far and an very eager to get back on the xrp train as soon as my situation permits it. 
For all those holding congrats and good luck to you i hope you can all have a nice story like this one to tell about your xrp holdings ( except minus the getting laid off part lol). ",2017-12-30 00:27:18

dry1pa6,Randomshortdude,92,"This is a dumbass theory for several reasons: 

1) People like me who bought in at 7k sats and are going to cash out soon, will have doubled their BTC. They essentially put MORE BTC in my pocket. This would undermine their plan entirely. 

2) Banks would lose tens of millions on this scheme because of the XRP they sold when this rally began at around 7-8k sats. The value in BTC they hold compared to what they sold would have depreciated 200-300% relative to Ripple at this point. So, if this was the plan, they really did a shit job of execution. 

3) The trading volume of Ripple currently is 44k BTC back and forth. Even if the banks somehow were acquiring ALL BTC and ALL ETH in EVERY single trade being made, they wouldn't even put a dent in the ownership control of either coin. 

4) Even if this half-baked theory were somehow right, it doesn't explain what the fuck the banks would do about the 500+ other currencies in existence - 25+ of which have fairly massive market caps. 

Conclusion: Bitcoin + Eth's market cap combined isn't even a fraction of the value of gold or the S&amp;P500. Banks aren't panicking as much as you think they are. Bitcoin's market cap is 25% of Apple right now. APPLE. That's ONE company. The entire crypto market isn't even 4% of the S&amp;P500. You also haven't factored in that 50 billion of XRP was escrowed the other month. That's half of the circulating supply right there. So there's not even enough XRP available to leverage this plan with any level of impact. 

I don't care about either coin. I don't have a dog in this race. But this is an asinine theory at best and one a post I felt compelled to respond to, and I don't do that often.
