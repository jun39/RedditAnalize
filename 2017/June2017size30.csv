diaj7q9,Adrian-X,197,"There would only be one forum if r/bitcoin had not [censored comments](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64) that were pro on chain scaling, then banning users who did not support the censorship. [The controversy started here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5x60hc/take_segwit_off_the_table_rebase_bu_to_core_014/defk9r1/) Soon after the most senior developer was kicked off the team followed by [the second most senior lead developer rage quietening](https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7) for stated reasons. He was correct in his analysands but wrong to quit, now 40% of miners have started signaling for the original bitcoin without a transaction limit. 

Just recently the then most senior developer Jeff Garzik was kicked off the team for his support for on chain scaling. He's now been tasked with implementing the controversial segwit and a 2MB hard fork the segwit2x [NY proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-March/013921.html). The latest controversy is it's designed to circumvent the BS/Core developers but implement their controversial changes funded by AXA the second largest transnational corporation on the planet. 

I'll put it this way: There is a [hostile takeover](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5vnb7g/12_of_the_total_bitcoins_in_circulation_are_in_a/de3f3gl/?context=3) happening in bitcoin [one side whats to change the white paper](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-by-satoshi-nakamoto.2002/) and introduce [new rules and incentives](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) without addressing the trad-offs, the other wants to remove the limit and let bitcoin function as described in the [original bitcoin white paper](https://bitco.in/bitcoin.pdf). see chapter 5 - valid transactions and blocks are not invalidated because they exceed [1,000,000](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buir-2017-01-29-statement-regarding-excessive-block-by-bitcoin-unlimited-software-29-jan-2017.1790/) bytes, the rule that rejects them is counter productive and does not need to be supported.

dibcslc,sagaray304,153,"You are a currency speculator. Not an investor. Read on to see why.

I work as a corporate and commercial solicitor (lawyer) and I had recently read a brief analysis on bitcoin prepared for us by one of our banking partners. So my comment is mainly based from a legal perspective on bitcoin and not from a technical perspective. It is what I took away from that report so as a disclaimer I may be wrong on the tech, please correct me if so.

To understand it, we need to know the principle on which the currency is based. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are based on libertarian principles. To maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association, individual judgment, and self-ownership. This tells us two things. 

Firstly, Unlike national currencies such as the $ or Â£ which have a government or central bank guaranteeing it, there is no single institution in charge of or regulating cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is private money. Thus the value and integrity of it is driven by pure market principles such as trust, supply, demand and/or user speculation. Thus making it very volatile. Cryptocurrency sustains value so long as its user base trusts it and its integrity is not damaged. Trust and integrity are very fragile. For cryptocurrency to work, your local mom and pop stores have to accept it. This will be extremely hard. People trust Her Majesty's Government or the Government of the United States of America. They won't trust Joe Bloggs in his moms basement or a technology they struggle to understand. This isn't a slight on cryptocurrency, it is how it is. Just like no one will trust a Zimbabwean dollar.

Secondly, Governments don't like libertarian principles as it takes away their control. Regulatory mechanisms are behind technology by a few years but they are catching up. Given that the supply of bitcoin is fixed (not sure of other technologies) the price depends on trust, demand and government action. Demand for bitcoin is high because it has taken advantage of a lack of regulatory mechanisms and offers valuable services such as offering anonymity?, bypassing 3rd parties such banks and governments etc. 

In the UK, bitcoin is considered to be private money. So there is no VAT (tax) on it, no AML regulations (anti money laundering), no KYC (know your customer) etc. I know that the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) are under pressure from banks to heavily regulate it. But they are also under pressure from startups not to. Combined with the fact that no one making the rules actually understands how it works, we can't actually say what will happen. With a few strokes of a pen, regulatory action will drive the price right down, if the currency itself is not made illegal. 

Therefore by buying bitcoins you are doing the equivalent of buying euros and hoping the value of the euro rises giving you more dollars back. Your profits depend on when you buy in and when you sell. But with the euro example, you can be certain that it will suddenly not be worthless (or can you?) well more so than bitcoin.

When you hear about banks and institutions investing in cryptocurrency, they are not investing in the currency but in the technology behind it. The technology offers a great way to keep accurate records and bypass 3rd party payments. So unless you are investing in the technology behind cryptocurrency, you are basically a currency trader - you can win big and you can lose big.",2017-06-01 22:05:07

dib3umw,kryptomancer,77,"There are two visions of Bitcoin currently battling for dominance.

1. Peer to Peer cash without trusted 3rd parties.
2. Client to Server cash with trusted 3rd parties.

One of the root problems IMO is demographics change a.k.a. ""attack of the normies"", as more people flood into Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme it dilutes the bravery, conviction and technical aptitude of the original cypher punk / techno libertarian base.

These people just want to make their lives more comfortable in the existing system and are more than happy to be ruled over by authoritarians rather than creating a new system when authority is replaced with cryptography and mathematical certainties.

My hope is that there are enough of us still left that aren't stupid. 2MB blocks are a measly prize for a hard fork; the purpose of a 2MB hard fork is to set a precedent for blocksize inflation to push self verification out of the hands of users and into business elite who will be the only ones with copies of the ledger. It's like the inverse Gutenberg press.

When the hard fork is shoved down our throats by men in suits sucking the cocks of miners, we won't run their software. It's going to be a shit storm at least ten times that of ETH/ETC and at least twenty times that of BIP148.

3. DEA agent collects payment for hit (on himself). Also scams multiple non-illegal businesses to the tune of ~350-500k. 

4. DEA agent tells Ross that he was a DEA agent the whole time. Extorts Ross for 770k in bitcoin over several months by threatening to report him to the agency.

5. DEA agent submits evidence to the rest of the DEA that Ross hired ""someone"" to kill him while he was working as a programmer. Does not disclose that he is also the hitman.

6. Ross is arrested on initial drug/murder-for-hire charges.

7. Prosecution against Ross finds out about DEA agent. Drops murder charges. Issues a gag order preventing Ross from presenting this evidence in his defense. Technically ""kinda"" legal because he isn't charged with murder, so it can't be entrapment for a crime he isn't being prosecuted for.

8. DEA agent gets 6.5 years in jail and a fine for ~20-50% of the money he stole in the above bullet points.

dics9wq,endtidalsevo,64,"Morning from the UK gents.  Long-time lurker here.

I am an anaesthesiologist, but my background/first degree was in computer science.  I got interested in Bitcoin in around 2012 and bought a few to play with.  Thought I'd done well selling the dust for about Â£800 in around 2014/15, but obviously regretted that move later - if only I'd hodled.

I came across Ethereum in January 2016 while I was browsing Twitter at about 4am after waking up with a terrible hangover, which is what happens these days when I try to pretend the laws of the physiology of ageing don't apply to me.  Best hangover I've ever had, though - I was instantly excited about where technology could go, and I'd built my first mining rig within a couple of weeks, expanding to pretty much the breaker capacity of my house from there.

I mined away all though 2016 and 2017, and made a few extra purchases on the way.  It was reading posts here that really cemented my ideas of the potential for Ethereum and stopped me panic selling during the DAO ""disaster"" (barely a blip now).  I became a die-hard hodler, and I accumulated a pretty reasonable sum.

Lately though, I haven't been sleeping so well.  We've got a big house move planned in the next few months, and the cash flow situation has been stressing me out.  The sums I've invested in Ethereum are pretty modest but the potential downside of a big crash (which I think is VERY unlikely) could significantly affect our future plans.

Therefore early this morning, I blasphemed against the Church of Hodl and sold a very small percentage of my stack.  With that, I've made 150% profit on my invested money and paid off the entirety of my student debt which has been plaguing me for the last 16 years.

So, here I am - debt free, thanks to wine, insomnia and r/ethtrader.


Even without comparison to the toxic Bitcoin subs, this place is great and has been immensely helpful.  Particular thanks to u/jtnichol for his unending positivity and u/antiprosynthesis for his divergent thinking, which is usually spot on.

If Ethereum fulfils its full potential, I could retire off what I've already accumulated.  I don't think I ever will -- I love my job -- but wow, what a ride.  It's been a blast reading your posts over the past year, I wish you all the best, and I hope you all make a shitload of money.

Considering the ATH that was set a few days ago was $238, rallying in the $215-$230 range shows how much belief the majority of hodlers have in ethereum. This was no ""get rich quick"" scheme, even though that has been the case. Ethereum is a long term investment, we are only at the start of something big right now.

Just seen a news article about someone trying to spam the ethereum network since they changed the gas limit to help reduce fees. This attack was shut down within an hour by some of the devs, we couldn't be in better hands. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6eox4b/geth_v165_hat_trick_counters_current_attack/)

Yesterday there was a correction attempt that was short lived due to the support created as a result for rallying above $200 the past few days. We are looking very bullish at the moment and with the Chinese volume sitting on standby the takeoff is going to be bigger than ever. Currently sitting at 0.92 against bitcoin, it's going to be scary when they flood their money into eth on the way up. Seen more than a few people sell at the bottom of the little dip yesterday, don't play the market unless you're selling at the top. You're playing into the whales hands and adding to their eth stack.

dicavi0,Taek42,50,"There are a couple of big ways that we distinguish ourselves:

1. We've really been focused on decentralization. And I mean this in the 'sovereign' or 'trustless' sense of the word. When our competitor Storj says 'it's decentralized', what they mean is that there are a couple of parties out there who most people trust, and they have the freedom to pick which one they want to trust. At great expense, you also have the ability to be one of those parties. Sia on the other hand does not force you to trust anyone. It's a lot more powerful than picking who to trust, you can just know that everything is working and that nobody can stab you in the back.

2. Sia hosts are high quality. To be a host on Sia, you have to put forward money that promises you will keep the data. This means that we don't get as many flaky hosts, because being a flaky host means taking your money and pouring it down the drain. This also means that we have a lot fewer hosts, but most importantly it means that your files are safer, because when you do pick a host you know that they have a strong incentive to keep your files safe.

3. Sia is marketplace based, where as most of our competitors are prescription based. Renters have full control over which hosts they use. Hosts are picked per-machine, instead of at the protocol level. That means that Chinese users can focus on picking hosts in China, American users can focus on American hosts, etc. Or if your application is more bandwidth intense, you can pick hosts with cheaper bandwidth costs as opposed to hosts with cheaper storage costs, etc.

4. Sia is really focused on security. We've had bitcoin core devs review our architecture, we've had bitcoin cryptographers read our signature code, and in general we think about security every time we make a design decision. Most people who are able to review the security of protocols like Sia tend to say that Sia has much stronger security.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. We have a bunch of ways that we try to set ourselves apart, and I think overall we do a pretty good job. There's not a single project out there that I feel does our niche as well as we do.",2017-06-02 08:50:21
dibktr1,yolotrades,49,"&gt; What caused the Tulip Bubble to pop? Dot Com? Housing?
&gt; Can't ever know.

Tulip bubble: was technically a bubble on futures contracts for tulips, and was the first time futures contracts had really been traded in a speculative way. widely regarded as the first ""bubble"", so give people a break. yes it was surely mania. some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual salary of a skilled worker. That would put 1 BTC at about $500k USD. Also, tulips have an unlimited supply (well, limited by total land that can be farmed, but given a high enough price, people will abandon other crops for tulips... and they very much did which contributed to the pop of the bubble). So I see two main things at issue here: 1) first ever bubble in one of the first ever futures contracts on a PURE luxury good with absolutely NO value. Bitcoin has WAY more intrinsic value than a goddamn tulip. Also, 2) supply. people started ripping up everything and planting tulips. you can mine bitcoin harder, but it won't pop out any more than the block reward every 10 minutes, on average.

Dot Com: The issue here was purely valuations. Too many of those companies were valued on users or other metrics that really didn't matter when it came to driving *revenue* and *profits*. People expected these companies to be able to turn users into profits, but when you're being valued on the users that's all you really give a fuck about so the incentives were very misaligned for management. Also, here we have another ""new"" thing and people need to learn how to value it. Technology companies like Google and Amazon and Netflix are juggernauts these days. There are some over-valuations (i.e., tesla, etc) but mostly, the tech industry is in-line with it's historical PE. Also, companies these days focus on revenue and/or profits. Companies that don't (see: snapchat's stock - an example of the ""user based valuation"") will see their stock prices rightfully fall.

Housing: Christ dude. You say we can't know what caused these things, and then you talk about the very movie that lays it all out. Subprime loan policies and bank-based overexposure to MBS derivatives caused that bubble. Motherfucking institutions of america that have been around for centuries (bear, lehman, AIG) went out of business because of it. But it was a credit bubble - an over extension of ""margin"" if you will that bit everyone in the ass when the roosters crowed. Also, real estate is illiquid and when owners can walk away in a foreclosure leaving the banks scrambling to recoup their losses, it gets even uglier. Can't really compare a housing bubble / lending bubble to a speculative stock bubble. They're driven by and ultimately stopped by very different things.

The challenges Bitcoin is facing today are the challenges that come with success.  Last January, (that's 2016) when bitcoin's transaction volumes were greater than what Ethereum's are now, there was no backlog and you could still send transactions for free. On Wednesday of this week, the first time Ethereum experienced for one minute volumes similar to what Bitcoin has had this whole year, the whole network shut down and fees skyrocketed.  That's to say that Bitcoin is operating, in the real world, at a scale far greater than any other alt.  

Bitcoin doesn't have a scaling solution problem.  It's scaling solution set is diverse and developed by the largest and most skilled set of open source developers behind any project. And the solution is deployed, but not yet activated.  It is going to activate though and this turbulence and drama is what is required to activate it.  

It does take balls of steel to be a long term holder of Bitcoin and to stick to the principles that will make it great.  None of the other alts has a community doing that.  They are all simply selling out as fast as they can to try to capture a slice of the value that Bitcoin has genuinely created. 

When you step back and look at it that way the choice seems obvious.  Just as during the dotcom bubble there were sky high valuations on ideas with no real business, so too today there are alts and tokens that fit that bill.  But after a shakeout comes the truly valuable players remain standing.  Right now, Bitcoin is far and away, on technical grounds and user base, the leader there by leaps and bounds.

dibs6vh,nullc,35,"I think it is a crying shame that someone can write a bunch of bluntly untrue but ""truthy"" material like this and people will believe it.

""Flextrans"" ignores decades of experience in cryptographic protocols by introducing a new and highly redundant encoding.  Encoding redundancy directly translates into vulnerabilities-- for example when round-tripping an encoding the hashes can change but not the meaning--, Bitcoin's transaction original format had a few redundancies which were the direct source of many of the the malleability problems in the first place.  The fact that a new format would introduce more is astonishing.  In doing so it adds needlessness degrees of freedom that increase the entropy of the transactions forever needlessly increasing the minimum amount of storage needed to handle them.

And the complexity and poor design of FT shows in the multiple critical vulnerabilities that have already been found in it.

&gt; Satoshi had an annoying habit of using binary blobs for all sorts of data formats, even for the block database, on disk. Fixing that mess was one of the major performance improvements to Bitcoin under Gavin's stewardship. 

This is simply untrue-- Using binary formats is important for performance and efficiency and that hasn't changed, and sure as hell wasn't touched by Gavin.

Moreover, Satoshi's handling was not old fashioned.  Unlike Zander's code that manually twiddles pointers and parses (and happened to introduce multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities), Satoshi used cleanly built serialization and deseralization methods which were clean and structurally resistant to coding errors.

diefxkx,chudkin,93,"My two cents as a long-time lurker here and r\Bitcoin:

Any experienced engineer, in any field, would deem SegWit as too complex for the problem it is trying to solve, put it on the shelf for the future, and opt to find other solutions. An experienced engineer knows that when a proven production system hits a bottleneck, this bottleneck needs to be tackled locally with a minimal change, which will then expose the next bottleneck elsewhere in the system (we can seldom predict where) and the process repeats. Sometimes a family of bottlenecks is discovered which require a more systematic change, and then a larger-scale fix is justified.

The engineers of Blockstream, and their CEO, know that very well, but are deliberately pushing for a different agenda, a capitalist agenda.

The thing is, I see a lot of rage here, calling them âevilâ, âmaliciousâ, all sorts of f-words. And I think we need to change that. Bitcoin is a precious asset with a huge real-world value, and at the same time is vulnerable. Can you blame a commercial entity for trying to take over it? They are not evil and not malicious, they identified a weakness and are following a well devised plan to gain control over something of value using all means possible. This is capitalism 101.  

Normally, a fundamental change to the currency in the scale of SegWit would result in a different currency, with a different name. Blockstream is simply trying to gain control over Bitcoin, while keeping the trademark âBitcoinâ. That is why we have this stalemate. Their âthreatsâ of doing a UASF, BIP 148 and all that, will never materialize, because they are aware that if they make the first move and split themselves out, then they need to also pick a new name for their currency. And they want the Bitcoin name, totally understandable.

I think that if we stop calling them names, and instead start calmly calling it as it is, it will help bringing the truth to more people. Adam Back is leading a company which adheres to all free market and capitalist laws, and understandably is trying to gain control over a precious asset and trademark. The community sees that, and is defending against it. As part of this war, Blockstream and their engineers will try to make it look like they are following engineering principles; that is only a game, any engineer sees that including them. They talk about technical matters knowing that only 1% of their audience can call their bluff, but the rest 99% unaware people will appeal to their authority and accept their arguments at face value. Hence there is no point in having real technical debates with them, they are aware that from engineering perspective they are wrong, itâs all a show for them.

How is this going on for so long without a massive correction? I'm so confused. Has dumb money become the new smart money?

I'm not yet sure if this is a net positive or a net negative for Bitcoin. On the one hand, it is clearly attracting a lot of new money, most of which will end up going through Bitcoin at some point, either directly or indirectly. On the other hand, this altcoin inflation is seriously diluting Bitcoin's scarcity by flooding the market with similar supply, which is being presented as substitute goods, and there is no end in sight.

The main argument for this being a net positive is that it's very possible that it's only a temporary phenomenon, and that the market will have to come to its senses again sooner or later. The altcoin hype right now could be a supercharged testbed for different new ideas and approaches, most of which will fail horribly, while some might end up creating additional value that is complementary to Bitcoin's own value proposition. And of course the most optimistic scenario is that any successful new ideas that are compatible with Bitcoin will eventually get absorbed by it (are sidechains still a thing?).

die3bsb,yolotrades,39,"I think a lot of people would. Not to say that trading can't be profitable or to stroke my ego too much, but far too often people have itchy fingers and never commit to their trade, or they leverage up so high that they're *forced* to exit at losses they could otherwise have ridden out.

I have two bits of advice that I feel if more traders followed they would be much more profitable. Patience, and confidence.

1) Patience. Everyone want's to get rich quick, but it's a hell of a lot easier to get *poor* quick. The instrument for this is alt coins and/or high leverage... and lately, a lot of shorting ""tops"" in a bull market. Don't. Just... don't. It might make you feel like superman if you nail that scalp and earn a few BTC, but the risk is just too high. Follow the trend, and do it on low leverage. *Never* take out a trade larger than 10x, and if you have *any* sizable amount of equity (100 BTC +/-), you should stick to 3-5x. Give yourself some room to make a mistake on your entry. The big trade I made almost a year ago today was 93 days long and I paid $11k in finex funding for it.... but I made 226 BTC. I had a goal, I had a price target, and I let the action play out. Be confident in your decision. For the first 45 days of that trade I was underwater by as much as 20%. Thankfully, I was on finex and was only on 3x margin. I saw we were at support, so I let it play out. The rest is history. Being a jumpy trader doesn't help. It hurts. Leverage low, follow the trend, be patient, and allow the price to *move* before you do anything.

2) Confidence. Kind of plays into patience, but if you're confident in your position and your analysis, you're less likely to make snap decisions. Confidence also plays into making what I feel is the most profitable trade - the swing trade. Playing off the patience motto, swing trading rather than day trading does just what I suggested above - allows the price to come to *you* and move in a big enough way to make your risk worth it. Some dude here the other day exited his trade for 0.1% profit after fees. Why on earth is that dude even involved in crypto? There are risks associate with crypto in general - theft, exchange hacks, computer hacks, bugs in the code... you name it. You're taking all this risk being involved in this asset class and you're trading it like you would /ES? Scalps and low-percent trades aren't profitable because of fees in the bitcoin world. Flat commission on futures and options (in the real world... not bitcoin futures) is the shit. Paying .4% round trip to trade some bitcoins is *not*. The less you trade, the less in fees you'll pay and the greater chance you'll be in position when the green dildo slaps you in the ass.

As a side note, I haven't been a fan of the short since we broke the ATH. Like I said, just... don't. What's more important.... feeling like a ""rockstar"" because you called the top? Or actually making *fucking money*. A lot of traders falsely confuse how they feel with how much they stand to make.

No, that's terrible advice. Even if you're using salts (which you absolutely should be, regardless of what kind of hash function you're using), using a fast hash function makes brute-force attacks against even moderately strong individual passwords in the DB still quite plausible.

For example, the Bitcoin mining network [is currently calculating around 5.303Ã10^18 SHA-256 hashes per second](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate). That means even if you used a totally random 10-character alphanumeric password with mixed case, the bitcoin network could crack your salted, SHA-256 hashed password [in less than a tenth of a second](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%2826*2%2B10%29%5E10%29%2F2+%2F++%285.303%C3%9710%5E18+%2F+second%29).

I usually tell them 100% eth or 75%eth and 25% btc.  A couple have told me they bought LTC.  I never told them to buy LTC they just think now they know what they are doing because the are making money. This is WRONG. LTC has been an under performer for over 4 years. What I take from this is LTC is up because a lot of Coinbase users have been doing the same thing and not knowing what they are buying. LTC will never be a leader imho. You only want leaders. Look at the internet stocks for reference. The leaders survived and thrived. The rest died. The same thing will happen in crypto. If the coin does not have a solid niche and is just a copy be very careful with it. Because one day in the next 10 years we will go through a horrible bear market to flush out the garbage.

I like to look at it this way... when the tide comes in all boats rise and all the big bad boulders are hidden from the seamen under the tide. However at one point that tide will go out and the tide hiding all those big boulders will be exposed. It is at that point that all the nasty boulders will start to sink ships left and right. Only the few good solid ships will be left. (in 1930 there were over 1800 car companies) Now I think we are far away from this because markets are still way to inaccessible to 99% of big money.

dieom7q,mango_drive,168,"There is no majority by any available metric. 11% of nodes signal for BIP148, less than half of those are enforcing it. [Source](http://uasf.saltylemon.org/). One in twenty nodes enforcing UASF is not a majority. You don't change this fact by spamming reddit.

While 87% of polled entities are ready for or explicitly support segwit, only 20% do so for BIP148. [Source](https://coin.dance/poli). This is not a majority either. If you claim otherwise, you need to provide evidence instead of propaganda and religious reasoning.

Warning: Rant starts in 3, 2, 1...

Seriously. You are ""*convinced [...] in spite of*"" facts and label it an ""*underdog effort*"" because people sympathize with that. ""*Everybody who understands Bitcoin [...] wants to see [UASF] succeed*"" is an obviously false statement meant to debase anyone with a differing opinion. ""*Long term holders are asking for futures markets*"" to only ""*buy more BIP148 coins and dump legacy [...] tokens*"" is by any means not what sane people do when the outcome is undetermined. ""*The only objection raised by knowledgable people is that they worry it won't succeed*"" isn't actually the only objection, as trust in Bitcoin would be irrevocably damaged, if users of the official reference client on the ""legacy"" chain lose coins during a re-org to the BIP148 chain.

""*[G]enius software development [...] genius code [...] genius*"". Here you're starting to sound like Donald Trump. Argument by repetition is a fallacy, you don't make things true by repeating how genius and magnificent you think they are. ""*And real Bitcoin users know that Bitcoin dies*"" is textbook propaganda, painting things black and white, imagining a vocal minority as the ""real users"" and everyone else is just a ""fake user"" by inference then? Sounds strangely familiar.

""*The support of this underdog effort will be revealed as the days draw near.*"" Okay, there is zero evidence for what you claim, but a secret majority will be revealed on the day of reckoning and the BIP148 apostates will freak out and ""*they will cower out of the way when it does come as the true supporters cheer*"" and are elevated to heaven.

difla0p,bradfordmaster,102,"A slightly less biased version of the answer is that Theymos and the ""small blockers"" seem to believe they are doing the right thing for bitcoin. Increasing the blocksize, to increase the transaction capacity of the network, will increase the storage and bandwidth requirements for running a ""full node"" of bitcoin. This is not debatable. The ""small blockers"" believe that this would be disastrous for bitcoin because it would mean fewer people are ""verifying"" all of the transactions, and there is a bit more centralization in terms of trusting fewer miners / full node runners. The ""big blockers"" believe that the network will survive and remain sufficiently decentralized, and giving up a bit in terms of storage and bandwidth costs is worth it for faster / more transactions with lower fees. I fall on the big block side, but less vehemently than many people here.

The small block people (who support ""bitcoin core"") think that trying to increase the blocksize is an ""attack"" on bitcoin by evil actors, and therefore think they are saving the world of bitcoin by banning all discussion of ""alternate solutions"" like bitcoin unlimited or bitcoin classic. They think (and are partly right) that their sub is being attacked and brigaded, and therefore the tricks they employ are just fair ways to counter the ""attacks"".

Where Blockstream comes into the mix is that they are a privately funded company working on an alternate scaling solution for bitcoin. They stand to directly profit (in the future) from regular bitcoin transactions being slow and expensive, because it would drive more demand for their services. They also employ a handful important (and very vocal) bitcoin core contributors, so there is a pretty obvious conflict of interest. Note that a conflict of interest does not automatically mean they are doing something evil, it's just a conflict. Their views align with /r/bitcoin and Theymos in that blocks need to stay small (sort of but not really....), so there is some belief here that they are engaged in manipulating votes and posts on reddit. On the other hand, there is some belief (generally by different people) that some other bitcoin characters like Roger Ver and the guy who runs Antpool who's name escapes me at the moment are engaged in manipulating the story from the other end because they want bigger blocks to get more control of the network, or because they may lose money in some cases if we follow core's plan.

This has, unfortunately, caused a bit of a ""two party"" political divide within the bitcoin community, with one side largely backing /r/bitcoin, bitcoin core, and segwit, and the other side supporting /r/btc, bitcoin unlimited (although maybe not so much anymore? I haven't been paying a ton of attention the last few weeks), and a hardfork to increase blocksize.

I will say that you will get _biased_ opinions here on /r/btc, but you won't get mass censorship like you do in /r/bitcoin. I do find /r/btc is often a lot more toxic though, partially because it's full of people who are (rightfully) pissed about being banned / having their comments deleted on /r/bitcoin. I subscribe to both mostly because I see more ""bitcoin news"" on the /r/bitcoin page whereas here you get 90% bitching about bad things people are doing (which is often valid), and tends to make my blood pressure go up.

diflyi1,ebliever,44,"This guy gets it. He does not favor the UASF approach (I expressed reservations here myself the first days after it was publicized). But he realizes that it is the way forward.

The people who say they are pro-SW but oppose BIP148 are exhibiting very poor strategic sense. Jihan Wu has demonstrated the opposite. He is firm, shrewd and does not respect weakness. 

If you are pro-SW but concerned about a chain split, the logical thing to do is to voice support strongly for BIP148 now, 2 months ahead of time. This shows the strength of Segwit support without actually committing to anything. You're not causing a chain split by supporting BIP148 in early June!

If it comes to late July and things look shaky, THEN is the time to withdraw your support and warn against the dangers of a chain split if you are really concerned about it. But opposing BIP148 at the start of the effort is just showing weakness and dissension to Jihan. It tells him the Segwit folks aren't serious, and he can keep his stranglehold on bitcoin. 

Ironically, since many of us are dead set on supporting BIP148, showing this weakness is just creating the very conditions that make a chain split more likely. If every Segwit supporter showing support for BIP148 NOW, the overwhelming support would be decisive. The miners would know that it is useless to be mining the legacy chain come August 1 and would start switching over.

BIP148 is happening whether you like it or not. So if you want a chain split, go ahead and oppose BIP148. Because THAT is how you are going to get a chain split.",2017-06-04 13:40:16

difeszb,Chris_Pacia,37,"So segwit really should have been a non-controversial upgrade. At best it's a small tweak to the transaction format. It became political when they decided to roll it out as a softfork because to do so it was no longer a small tweak but rather a fairly large change and one that is a bit of a rube goldberg machine. 

I have genuine concerns about activating hacks of this magnitude in a $40 billion system. Imo bitcoin clearly would have been better served with a cleaner hf segwit implementation. But, of course no such implementation exists so we would have to chose between doing it right and waiting another year or activating the softfork hack and getting it now. It's really terrible that this is the choice we are confronted with. 

On lightning... there's nothing wrong with having a lightning network per se, but imo it's unlikely to be a viable generalized payment solution for bitcoin. 

In order for random user Alice to pay random user Bob you not only need to find a *path*, through channels, from Alice to Bob, but each hop along the way needs to have the correct value else the payment cannot be made. Intuition tells me that Alice's payment will not find a route 100% of the time (as well as some simulations I wrote).

This is largely confirmed by [this](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/miners-and-bitcoin-lightning-a133cd550310) post by LN dev Rusty, where he says that they are capping LN tranactions at .042 btc (valued at $42 at the time of his blog post) since, in his words:

&gt; Large lightning payments are less reliable: itâs harder to find a route with the capacity you need. In practice, the 0.042 limit is an upper bound.

And it's not like under $42 LN payments all of a sudden become reliable. It's a spectrum. Micropayments will likely work well. But it's doubtful everyday payments will. 

I would love to be proved wrong, but I don't think I am. And given that it's not likely to be a viable scaling solution, I don't see how it can be pitched to the community as some kind of silver bullet and used to justify taking other scaling approaches off the table. ",2017-06-04 10:30:31

dierk53,PretzelPirate,29,"To start with - These opinions are my own, not those of my employer, family, dog, or president. I should also say that I hold ETH and Bitcoin. I don't hold any Stratis, nor do I plan on buying any.

How do I feel about stratis? I think it has a lot of potential, as do many blockchain solutions. I am invested in blockchain tokens because I love what blockchain tech enables. Sure I've made money by investing, but if that money disappears because a better solution comes along, I would fully support that. I hope Stratis has incredible success and huge adoption. I would prefer if a video like this was made by Stratis as the person who made this video seems to be trying to pull points out of thin air in order to pump their investment. 

In terms of these points, some of them are interesting and some are reaching. If anyone can add/correct anything, please do:

**#1 - Breeze Wallet -** This point is all about transactional privacy, which is the current 'hot thing' in blockchain tech. Every blockchain is going to have this. Breeze Wallet is currently going to use Tumblebit, but I don't see anywhere on how they plan on providing the same level of privacy for smart contract state, which is far more important in the enterprise world

**#2 - C# -** (Note - I am a C# developer)

Having blockchain clients/wallets written in C# doesn't benefit C# developers unless they are expected to update/debug the software, or write addins for it, such as custom consensus mechanisms. Most developers will never do this, and for the ones that do will be smart enough to pick up whatever language is required.

Writing smart contracts in C# is also not beneficial for C# developers. Most of the C# code we write is syntactic sugar that is transformed to much more complex code which often times has unexpected runtime properties (go look at some of the disassembled Linq operations, tweak the operation order, and check them out again). In order to optimize this generated code, you have to be very knowledgable on performance and how .NET works. Most developers out there won't be able to do this. or won't be given enough time by their company to invest in this. 

What does that mean for writing C# contracts? Either, the contracts will have an unexpectedly high cost to run (using more operations than expected), only a subset of C# can be used (ex: don't support linq), or you have to remove the concept of paying for operations via a gas-like mechanism. Using a subset of C# will be more confusing for developers than using a language built for smart contracts. On a private network, a C# model without a predictable execution cost might work just fine, assuming there are other restrictions put in place to limit resource usage, but those contract-development skills likely wouldn't be useful when using a public chain.

If developers really want to write smart contracts in C# (and I suggest they don't do that), its quite easy to write a C# compiler to generate EVM assembly or code for any other smart contract technology. 

**#3 - Microsoft -** Microsoft is providing access to many different blockchain technologies on Azure and really focusing on chain-independent technology (go check out distributed identity work). Unless Microsoft comes out with a statement saying that they specifically believe in Stratis as being the blockchain of the future, #3 doesn't show any support over any other blockchain network listed here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/

**#4 - Support of C# Corner -** Unless those C# developers start writing Smart Contracts, this doesn't provide much value, especially when Ethereum seems to have the majority support of the blockchain-focused companies. ""Who are able of building the most advanced dapps"" - At this point, no, the developers on C# Corner aren't capable of building the most advanced Dapps since they are C# developers, not Dapp developers. This is no different than saying that Lisp developers can build the most advanced Dapps because Ethereum supports LLL.

**#5 - No Middleman -** This is kind of the point of a distributed blockchain. Remember - I said some of these points were reaching.

**#6 - Sidechains -** I think side chains are cool and can have some usage, but I don't see enterprise customers wanting to peg their private blockchains to the public one. Maybe I'm wrong and there will be value in that. There are also plans for Masternodes to validate blocks that exist on the side chains, which defeats the purpose of using side chains as a private enterprise consortium.  I do see value in side chains for non-enterprise features - this is what many people in Bitcoin have wanted for quite some time. If we can transfer our Bitcoin to Stratis, maybe we should all migrate our BTC holdings to a Stratis network and enable features that Bticoin may never see.

In terms of private network technology, I currently see ETH having the advantage there. There are multiple companies working on private Ethereum consortium technology (Quorum was just released by JP Morgan), and its very likely that private blockchains won't even include the concept of mining as long as you can create trust and audibility within the network. Private chains are where I prefer transaction speed over the requirement for a large amount of 'work' being put in to enforce blockchain immutability. There are very interesting things you can do with trusted execution that reduces the need for mining on private networks.  

**#7 - Masternodes -** The main point of #7 is that master nodes will lock coins away. This will also happen with Ethereum when it transitions to Pos. the difference is that Stratis will have a limited number of masternodes, which limits the overall supply that will be locked away. As far as we know, Ethereum won't limit the overall number of validators, instead, it will limit the amount of eth that each validator can lock. I suspect you will see a larger percentage of coins being locked in Casper than you will in Stratis master nodes. 

**#8 - ICOs -** Ethereum can already do this, but really, with all of the crazy stuff happening (too much money being invested, people FOMOing into things they don't understand, people threatening to call the SEC) with ICOs today, is this really what you want to highlight?

**#9 - Inflation Rate -** No one really has enough experience in cryptoeconomics to know if a low inflation rate (especially with coins locked away) is better than a high inflation rate. I hope this point is misrepresenting the Stratis goals - the stratis team planning on changing inflation with a transition to PoA would be a terrible plan. I imagine that this is just poorly explained in the video.

**#10 - highly Undervalued -** This is obviously subjective, and may be true. This is another reach on the part of the author saying that it has all the characteristics of Ethereum, when Stratis doesn't even support smart contracts yet. At this point, it is bitcoin with pluggable consensus, and master nodes. I have no doubt that they will add the Eth features, but at this point, any valuation is purely speculative. The Stratis team will provide consultancy services, but you will see a dozen companies doing the same for any popular blockchain service. Personally, I don't like vendor lock-in and would rather go with a platform that has multiple support options over one with only a single company providing support. Thats how you get expensive support contracts.   

In closing: I hope Stratis succeeds and becomes the most popular blockchain in the world, but only if it can provide real value of the existing solutions. At this point, their main focus seems to be ""We are the C# blockchain"", which really seems like the wrong goal to focus on with Ethereum pushing forward with large enterprise customers. If Stratis succeeds, I'm happy to write smart contracts on it. I'd even be happy to work with them in building the platform if they pay well.",2017-06-04 01:20:48

http://avc.com/2017/06/getting-hacked-lessons-learned/](http://avc.com/2017/06/getting-hacked-lessons-learned/)

Here are his takeaways, all of which I agree with:

* &gt;Call your cell phone provider and put a âdo not port under any circumstancesâ hold on your phone number. I did this about six months ago and I think it may have saved me. It is way too easy to port a phone number and once a hacker has your number, they have access to two factor codes coming via SMS.
* &gt; Put two factor on everything you can. I did not have it on my old and dormant gmail account which is partially why it was vulnerable. Obviously I have it on there now.
* &gt; Check your password recovery settings on all of your accounts (even old and dormant email accounts) and make sure they are secure accounts (locked down phone numbers (#1) and secure email accounts (#2)). Once a hacker has access to one of your old email accounts, they can impersonate you digitally.
* &gt; Use Google Authenticator for two factor on your phone. I have used SMS and Authy in the past and my research yesterday suggests that Googleâs Authenticator is the most secure of the two factor options out there right now.
* &gt; I keep almost all of my Bitcoin in Coinbaseâs vault service which requires 48 hours and multiple approvals to make a withdrawal. If the hacker had gotten into my Coinbase account, they would have been able to take my Ethereum and a small amount of Bitcoin, but not most of it. I believe Coinbase should evolve their vault offering to handle all of the crypto assets they support, or possibly make the two day withdrawal/multi-sig feature available to all of their wallet offerings.

Do yourself a favor and buy a ledger nano s. Get those coins off the exchange. They are not yours until they are in cold storage on your wallet. 

One last thing NEVER post how many coins you are sitting on. A guy below posted he had a life changing amount and then promptly said how many he had until someone commented and told him to delete that.

As someone who holds both, and is constantly monitoring the situation... 
A couple of things that have stopped me enlarging my Eth position would be

1) The infrastructure is nowhere near as good, robust and tested in terms of things like wallets. All I can find are a few websites for paper wallets, some very new and feature poor mobile wallets and not very advanced desktop wallets. 
This just makes me doubt the maturity of the whole platform. 

2) The scaling debate in BTC may possibly be resolved soon... the ""threat"" of Ethereum and the users going full Kamikazi with UASF will probably mean Segwit will be activated soon with a Hardfork later. Many who have hedged with Eth will flock back to Bitcoin. 

3) The inflation rate with Eth seems massive to me. 


I do however see a resonable chance of Eth market cap catching Bitcoins... a lot of people holding thousands of Eth will be getting pretty tempted to sell at that point as they will be sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Not to mention the growing stashes of cash that has been given to ICO's... at some point they are going to want to change those millions into fiat to fund their businesses.

dihubwh,tiedyedvortex,87,"Alright, I'm relatively new at the whole Ethereum thing, but I'll try an ELI5. Someone will probably tell me exactly how I'm wrong, but whatever.

So, any blockchain-based currency is essentially just an agreed record of how much money everyone has. If Amy wants to send Bob some money, she announces to everyone on the network ""I am sending Bob 1 ether"". Other people (miners) confirm that transaction, and Amy has to pay a fee in gas to the people who do the work of confirming this. 

However, the fee she pays doesn't depend on the amount she spends--one transaction is the same whether she's sending 100 ether or .01 ether. This means that sending one transaction of 100 ether is a hundred times cheaper than sending a hundred transactions of 1 ether apiece. (Additionally, the network can only approve so many transactions at a time, which means that as the ecosystem grows it will eventually grind to a standstill.)

So, Amy wants to send Bob small amounts of money on a regular basis without paying transaction fees every time. So, she does opens a payment channel with Bob. This essentially works by Amy putting down some amount of money on the table (say, 1 ether) with a timed note saying ""Amy gets refunded all of this money in 1 week, or earlier if Bob says it's okay."" 

Then, if she wants to pay Bob some tiny fraction of that money, like .01 ether, she just erases the note and says ""Amy gets refunded 0.99 ether in 1 week, and Bob gets paid .01 ether in one week, or earlier if Bob says it's okay."" Bob sees this new note and approves it, and so now he knows that he is guaranteed to get that .01 ether, and has effectively been paid. BUT, no miner has gotten involved, so no transaction fees have been paid on that .01 ether (yet). Amy can continue to rewrite the note to send more money to Bob. Or, Bob can rewrite the note to send money to Amy, refunding some portion of the money. Bob could even put his own money into the channel, making it a fully bi-directional channel.

In essence, you're putting money into a channel and then coming to binding agreements about who owns how much of that money. The blockchain doesn't care about the agreements, it just knows ""This contract has 100 ether in it"". Eventually, though, someone is probably going to want to actually collect on the money in that stream, and when that happens the channel is closed, and the note saying ""Amy gets X and Bob gets Y out of the money in this channel"" is applied, paying the normal transaction costs.

So now Amy and Bob have resolved dozens, perhaps hundreds, of individual transactions without bothering the blockchain. Great. 

But what if Amy wants to send Bob a tiny amount of money only once? A payment channel doesn't really help since it's a one-time event.

However, Amy currently has a payment channel opened with Online Store, where she shops frequently. And Bob also has a payment channel opened with Online Store. And they can use these already-established payment channels to make this small payment without touching the blockchain. Amy tells Bob that she's going to route .01 ether to him via the Online Store. The Online Store updates their channel with Bob so that Bob is getting .01 more from it, and Amy updates her channel with the Online Store so that it is getting .0100001 more from her. That extra .0000001 is a transaction fee for the Online Store for being the intermediary--so it isn't free, but it is much MUCH cheaper than just using the normal blockchain.

Once you have this system in place, you can start extending it, and getting bigger players involved. When you have a large web of people, with payment channels open between lots of people, you can start to weave lots of payments through this network very quickly with far, far fewer published blockchain transactions. And it's all still completely trustless with no central authority.

That's Raiden. I've deliberately skipped all the technical details about hashlocks and timing, but that's what we're playing with.

The idea was first proposed for Bitcoin, but Bitcoin has a structural issue (transaction malleability) that makes it impossible until an upgrade (segregated witnesses) is implemented, and so far the Bitcoin miners are reluctant to make that shift. Ethereum has a much more robust system of smart contracts in place, so it has a huge headstart on getting this system implemented.",2017-06-06 03:17:09

- number of txns per period
- amount of data that needs to be moved around the network
- amount of data that needs to be processed by all nodes
- size of the blockchain 
- cost of running any node but, importantly, a validating full node
- ultimately, the security of Bitcoin

Hence, removing a sane cap on blocksize is not sensible. Szabo likens it to removing the temperature cap on nuclear reactors. Yes, the fuel rods output will increase, but the infrastructure housing them will malfunction. So, physical and design constraints that the engineers are best qualified to comprehend and make according decisions on. The public can study nuclear physics, but generally don't know enough about it to make design alteration calls.

Behind all of this, as Szabo implies, is the mistaken belief that more adoption leads to price increases. Hence, following on from this myth: if transaction capacity is boundless then price will go to the moon. The crucial insight missing from this belief is the Law of Induced Demand in large scale networks: increasing supply simply increases demand. That's OK for transport networks, but not for Bitcoin's fundamental characteristics of security and robustness.

Hence, SegWit and not a blocksize increase. ",2017-06-06 12:28:10

dij78m4,Merlin560,57,"Point and Figure Update

Last night we saw the continuation of the bull reach a new ATH at $2,935.  This is considerably into the Long Pole Warning which was met at $2,680.  The column is 23 boxes high.  Expect a fast, sudden, reversal back down 12 boxes.  This brings the LPW target at $2,680.

A long pole warning is not a crash indicator, its is a pullback indicator.  Any reasonable person would look at the movements in their historical context (at least back to early 2013) and a sharp reversal should not surprise anyone.  So it is important to look at the charts and set some ânormal reversalâ, ânormal LPW reversalâ, and âHoly shit, this thing is crashing reversalâ, and finally, the âApocalypse Now reversal.â

Even a pull back to $2680 would be an amazing run over the past month or so.

So, here are the numbers:

We are in a column of Xs, reading the ATH at $2,938.

A reversal would happen if the price goes under $2,880 without hitting a new high AFTER 8PM EDT.  We already hit a new high box today, so we will not see any column directional change until tomorrow.

Weâve met the positive breakout.  Weâve exceeded the two target pricesâwhich both came in at $2,660.

The formation is 3 columns wide.

The Trend is positive.

The Trend reversal would take place at a price lower than $1,300.

I think we settle down here for a couple of days.  We could see the same types of significant swings within a price range for that period.  Consolidation and a pause without a huge drop would be a great thing.

The Bitcoin stories are starting to make headlines again.  And, again, we are all called speculating idiots.  So be it.  I like being an idiot with money in my pocket, rather than spouting sour grapes because you missed the bus.

WhosJohnGalt  CJgipper Jun 5, 2017 2:30 PM
I think that's NOT bearing out.

ETH is already halfway to matching BTC's market cap.

ETH is already conducting 70% of BTC's daily TX volume -- that's yuuuge.

ETH will be switching to PoS in 2018 and its rate of inflation will drop to close to 0% with a total ETH supply of somewhere between 105M to 115M.

ETH has an entirely new and native token economy blossoming on top of it -- think iOS/Android app store with tons of apps -- the network effects are huge and the underlying demand for ETH for TXs is growing and will increasingly be huge.

ETH has the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance where many large and/or Fortune 500 companies are experimenting with it (i.e. seeking ways to use it to reduce costs).  Make no mistake, the anti-ETH FUDsters will try to manipulate that narrative into claiming ETH is being ""overtaken"" by banks and corporations, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

That's like trying to say that companies that use Linux are trying to co-opt it and ""overtake"" it.  It's a ridiculous notion.

Disclosure -- I hold ETH &amp; BTC -- but am not married literally and emotionally to the ""idea"" of Bitcoin, like so many BTC people are these days. Thus, I try to look objectively at other up and coming technologies out there and right now, Ethereum is simply killing it.",2017-06-06 22:10:28

dii96ra,jstolfi,44,"&gt; Satoshi urgently urged people to NOT raise the limit 

Come on.  He urged Jeff to not change the limit **immediately**, since that could cause a chain split as not all miners would upgrade at the same time.  Instead, he explained how to add the change to a release in such a way that it would be activated only several releases later -- when no one should be using the older versions anyway.

Moreover, he did not object to increasing the limit per se, or to JeffÅ  proposed new limit (~7.2 MB).  On the contrary, he implicitly confirmed that the limit should be increased in the future.

&gt; Are you frustrated that you've failed to kill Bitcoin after years of trying Jstolfi? 

I don't want to kill bitcoin.  I wish it could be allowed to work as it was designed, without the bad uses it has been put to -- and without your redesign, without it being appropriated by your company and repurposed to be just a buried plumbing of some vaporware layer-2.

But we do agree in one thing: SatoshiÅ design was fatally flawed.  Objectively, bitcoin already failed in 2013 or earlier, when mining became centralized in half a dozen companies.  Or even earlier, when the non-mining relays were introduced between clients and miners. 

Our difference is that we see different reasons for its failure; and you believe that your ""fee market"" redesign will save the project, while I (and most everyone else) see it as wrecking the only part that still worked.",2017-06-06 07:55:01

He never suggested that the size of the blockchain should be kept small **in order to** exclude small payments, or to force huge fee hikes.

Recall that, for him, ""users"" meant people using the system for payments, namely the miners plus the SPV clients.

dijmf9l,ruvalm,56,"Wow! What a really nice couple of days we've had. Truth is, this ""thing"" seems to be just starting, with the conferences next week and the highly likely EEA3 announcements.

I'll list my bullish and bearish observations below. Please mind that many of them are a product of my own opinion and others are pure interpretation of my observations.


**Bullish factors**:

* [Vladimir Putin Is Getting Interested in Bitcoin's Biggest Rival](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-06/putin-eyes-bitcoin-rival-to-spur-economic-growth-beyond-oil-gas). The support and interest of a government of such a massive country as Russia is definitely bullish. Some thousands of potential applications in which Ethereum can help. Definitely to be followed-up in the next weeks / months.

* [Chinese Official states that 'Ethereum Is Moving In The Right Direction'](http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/06/06/ethereum-moving-right-direction-says-senior-official-chinas-pboc). This one does not even need a comment, all words seem to fall short to the grandiosity of these statements.

* Lots of new money is coming in; lots of profits from the latest crypto-roulette are still finding its way; lots of money is waiting on the sidelines to buy in our 'dips'.

* [Tim Ferriss Covers Ethereum and Bitcoin in his latest podcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6fjstw/tim_ferris_covers_ethereum_and_bitcoin_in_his/). It's not just because it's Tim Ferriss, although we all know he has quite an audience of dreamers, pretty much like all of us here in Ethtrader, but the fact that Ethereum and Bitcoin are being referred hand-in-hand every single time lately. The newest members around here are probably already used to this reference, but that is something that the people who came in before February were not used to at all. This is really big.

* ICOs, ICOs, ICOs. Developers, developers, developers. I'm a software engineer and in my LinkedIn profile there is a reference to the fact that I'm interested in Smart Contracts and Ethereum. Today I've been approached for the first time by a recruiter interested in knowing how much I really know about it. Same thing happened with a colleague of mine a couple of weeks ago and the approach was made by a different recruiter and a different agency. They're out there head-hunting, gentlemen.

* EEA3. 

* Constant talk of us being in a bubble. You know what is one of the main characteristics of a bubble ? The fact that people do not talk about it being a possibility. /u/Mr_Yukon_C shared on his Twitter account [something worth watching regarding bubbles](https://twitter.com/MrYukonC/status/872089477157720064).

* ETHBTC 12H seems to be forming a massive bull pennant.

* Transactions in the network: [last Monday (29/05) Ethereum had about 49% of Bitcoin's transactions and yesterday (05/06) it had roughly 66% of Bitcoin's transactions. Growth of 17% in a week in comparison with the Bitcoin network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/6ctpq3/biweekly_rethinsider_discussion_may_23_2017/diit5e6/).


**Bearish factors**:

* ETH's price is once again highly dependent of BTC's. My personal opinion is that the ratio is constantly manipulated to avoid 'The Flippening'. 

* 4H, 6H, 12H, 1D and so on RSI indicates 'overbought'.

It's sad that the documentation is awful, cause this appears actually quite nifty. Fully anonymous payment system for arbitrary currencies?

https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitcoin86.com%2Fnews%2F14852.html

Here is a follow-up Chinese news article with google translation 
https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitcoin86.com%2Fnews%2F14890.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url

It's about the regulatory framework (i.e., sandbox regulation) for digital currency and ICOs, and recognizes ether/bitcoin as ""digital asset"", or ""quasi digital currency"". 

Here is a surprising quote, reflecting how a central banker thinks from a national interest perspective. Here is the full quote.

""At present, this country (China) is very harsh on bitcoin, but in a certain sense, on top of the basis of prudence, we should also give special consideration and open to the top ten ICO companies based on market value. On one hand, (being open to cryptocurrency) will provide everyone with an opportunity to invest - it's possible to invest in a black technology, but it's better than buying some junk stocks (prevalent in China's stock markets).  On the other hand, from a national perspective, neighboring countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, are encouraging the development of Bitcoin, which they consider to be quality assets. Not to mention this can promote the financial technology industry innovation, at least holding high-quality assets is in line with national interests.""   (I am a Chinese, and revised the google translation. Words in the parenthesis are mine).  

He used the term ""bitcoin"" here as a general reference to cryptocurrency. and he is in favor of ethereum and praised it highly, he said, ""because of the ethereum, the smart contract side (in contrast to traditional payment blockchain) has relatively fast breakthrough - taking into account the rising momentum of the currency, it is possible to surpass the bitcoin.""

Regarding ""national interest"", I believe this is the first time from the mouth of a central banker, and this makes perfect sense. From a national interest perspective, foreign central banks (e.g, PBOC) certainly do not want to remain holding only US treasury, enriching USA while suffering political dependence and unstablility.  This opinion and article, published on June 2, corresponds well the timing of allowing bitcoin withdrawals and adding ETH by the main exchanges in China (now they are highly regulated by PBOC).  If I may speculate, I can almost hear that they are going to buy cryptocurrency secretly as reserve, from their exchanges;)

I see PBOC is well on top of the current development technically and economically, understands the utility, function and value of different digital currencies/tokens and pros and cons of private chain vs. public chain, discusses competitiveness and issues of fiat digital currency as well as related economic theories, and considers appropriate regulatory framework for ICOs.

I just bought myself a T-shirt.",2017-06-08 06:01:27
dilmg6p,erinthematrix,212,"Ah, no. The calculations are for the purpose of adding to the blockchain. 

To be brief, a hash function is a function that can be used to verify that something is what it claims to be. Ie I upload a torrent of wonder woman and say ""this is the hash for the file: agbdjeqwy12GJ12."" if that file changes, the hash will change, so it can prevent you from downloading the wrong thing and getting a virus, because after you've downloaded it you can hash it yourself. 

The blockchain is like a global receipt for all transactions done in bitcoin (other currencies have their own blockchain).  The transactions are added in blocks. 

The thing about hashing is any alteration to the file drastically changes the hash. If I were to add even a second of silent, black screentime to the end of the wonder woman movie, the hash would not resemble it's previous hash at all. 

So, how is this useful? Each block in the blockchain is hashed with the previous block's hash. This means that the most recent block of transactions points all the way back to the first block ever mined, in an unfakeable way. This makes the currency secure. 

What do miners do? They compete for the right to add the next block. Each block awards a number of new bitcoins, as well as a small transaction fee from any transactions they include in the block. 

How do they compete for this right? As mentioned before, even a tiny alteration or addition completely changes the hash. The requirement to add a block is to find a combination of characters that you can add to the last block, such that it's hash is less than a number. Say the hash is 8 characters, and must be below 100 thousand. So now, ""&lt;previous data&gt;ag5"" hashes to qh13hf06, which is no good, but ""&lt;previous data&gt;gt1"" hashes to 00005aYu, which is acceptable. The miner then says ""the nonce is gt1."" other miners accept this answer, and the first miner gets to mint the new block. 

I'm confused, what do they do again? 

Hashing once is a rather quick process. Hashing a billion times in search of a particular hash is not. Miners compete to be the first to find a random string that gets a 50 ish character hash below an ever decreasing threshold. That means most of the computation is ""wasted,"" but it is by the very wasting that the blockchain is secured. ",2017-06-08 07:35:15

The blocks are found about every ten minutes, and you need to begin to mine the new one (ie include the most recent block), so an Internet connection is essential.

This creates a split chain. However only work done on the verified chain is rewarded, so there is a strong incentive to be on the correct one. The chain that has more work done on it almost always wins out within 3 blocks (on bitcoin. Varies from coin to coin).

dil2nk7,Ilogy,49,"The scaling war is at least in part about the question of whether someone can *own* the Bitcoin network. A lot of us understand that what we are witnessing at this point is primarily a power struggle, not a technical debate.

Ver has repeatedly made the argument that because he has a larger financial stake in Bitcoin, his views on the direction of the network should be given weight equal to his current investment. This demonstrates that Ver views Bitcoin the way a stakeholder would view a company. 

His main argument for raising the block size has always been that it would provide immediate relief to the high fees, and that SegWit and layer-2 solutions would take too long. While this may have been a relatively convincing argument a year or two ago, today imost people agree that SegWit would provide the immediate relief to the problem he claims to want a solution for, and yet he continues to filibuster and fight -- using every tactic his economic power affords him -- which demonstrates that his concern over high fees is perhaps disingenuous. 

Further, the time wasted on the scaling debate is time in which all of these issues could have been addressed had this ongoing conflict never been there to stall progress. If his real concern was with seeing the network progress and high fees come down, he has managed to achieve just the opposite. This, again, suggests his true motives are ulterior. 

Since it is hard to argue that Ver's motives are about fees as he claims -- since his own actions are actually encouraging the higher fees and since the problem would have been addressed were he not blocking progress -- and since he hasn't really articulated any other rationale for wanting larger blocks now, it is reasonable to conclude that this is really not about technical issues, but about power. 

Ver has repeatedly expressed disdain and even hostility toward the Core developers and has spent millions in US dollars on promoting an alternative set of developers whom he hopes will eventually usurp protocol development from Core. Perhaps this is ultimately his real aim. 

Assuming Ver is funding these new developers, if such a switch in developers can be achieved, the new developers will essentially be more or less his employees. They will at least have to listen to him. If he can manage to ruin Core's reputation and eventually strip them of their role, replacing them with developers that all but work for him, he will have effectively placed himself in the position of something akin to the CEO of Bitcoin. If this is what is motivating Ver, we should expect for him to object to any scenario -- including the NY agreement -- in which the Core developers remain in charge of development, though it is unlikely he would ever overtly suggest that his real aim is to remove Core. 

Of course, assuming he can't get an outright victory which would entail replacing the Core devs with developers that work for him, then the second best thing would be any scenario in which the Core developers were stripped of their role, even if the new developers were not directly under Ver's influence.Under this scenario, at least precedence would be set for change in leadership which would make it easier for Ver to gain influence over development in the future. Finally, if that isn't possible, then at the very least he will seek to guarantee a block size increase to set precedence for his ability to throw his weight around and influence development decisions -- though I suspect this latter scenario would be worse case for Ver.

If that happens, the price depreciates significantly, and therefore their revenue falls even more than the money they're making off transaction fees. It's an optimization problem, and at the moment they have hit that optimization point.

Our job is to change the optimization point to a much lower transaction fee. It's kind of similar to Mars' atmosphere. It is currently at an equilibrium pressure, which also happens to be the triple-point of water. However, if the temperature of the surface of Mars is increased even 10 degrees Celsius, the planet achieves a new equilibrium point of 50 millibars surface pressure, at which it will stay nearly indefinitely.

I am so, so tired of this nonsense.

**Let's make this extremely simple.**

Is there a reason to restrict offchain scaling?

No, do segwit.

Is there a reason to restrict onchain scaling?

Everything has costs, this has costs too, Nick Szabo is dead right when he says that these decisions should not be left to a howling mob, therefore, the costs absolutely should be intelligently considered and **weighed against the costs of not doing it.**

We're already experiencing the costs of not doing it, both in terms of ridiculous on chain fees *and blocking* the above mind numbingly obvious off chain scaling solution that basically has no drawbacks. The costs could be quantified with a metric, I'd suggest the infrastructure costs of other subversive digital networks the state would dearly like to see crushed as a reasonable basis for comparison, but I'm open to alternative suggestions. That would give us [Tor] (https://torflow.uncharted.software/) on the low impact side, vs [Bittorrent] (https://www.reddit.com/r/seedboxes/comments/4rdzpy/how_many_traffic_do_you_use/) on the high impact side, let's be super conservative in both cases and pick the lowest reasonable estimates for both cases, so 0.9 gbps advertised exit only bandwidth in the tor case, and [5374] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.8171.pdf) petabytes a month on the bittorrent side which works out to about 16.6 tbps.

If the delta between the cost increase of an on chain scaling move relative to this benchmark is less than the cost of not doing it, it should be done. Where does the on chain throughput of the Bitcoin network fit in the above puzzle?

The current on chain throughput of the bitcoin network is [13.33 kbps] (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+megabytes+per+10+minutes+as+kbps), or to give this figure the true credence it deserves, 0.95 x a single facsimile speed.

We are paying all the costs of delaying off chain scaling pending a contentious hard fork, which cost the closest competitor we have 6.5% of their market cap presently (eth classic vs eth), which works out to approximately 3 billion USD factored for ours.

We are paying the costs of a rivalrous fee structure restricting the entire network throughput to the above figures resulting in transaction fees of 1.5 million USD per day.

It is hard to quantify exactly how much of the [current dominance] (https://coinmarketcap.com/) in the cryptocurrency market space in general has been lost purely because of this slow motion train wreck scaling debacle, but that figure is also a loss of up to 56.3 billion USD. And we are paying these costs in order to maintain a decentralisation metric [67,500 times lower] (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.9gbps+%2F+13.33kbps) than the nearest similar network estimated as conservatively as possible. 

We are paying billions in value, and millions per day, to keep the network limited to **less than** the total throughput of a fax machine, in a world where we have similar projects working just fine with a throughput 67,500 times higher than that. Take a minute and let that sink in, really let it breathe. And if you've been mindlessly partisan on one side of the debate contributing to this state of affairs, [take a big step back and literally **FUCK YOUR OWN FACE**.] (https://youtu.be/Odd8Zdhuj9o?t=1m46s) Cryptocurrencies were *created* to free us from politics, the irony of this situation being directly attributable to political wrangling is infuriating for those of us who really meant to kill the beast right from the beginning. If the state as an entity had the intelligence to really understand the situation and a sense of humour, they'd be laughing their asses off at us and dead right to do so.

Therefore, the obvious conclusion is that both on chain scaling keeping in mind the above metrics, and off chain scaling in general, should be done immediately.

So the only ""side"" of the scaling debate I can support is the side that desires true consensus on any meaningful change to bitcoin, and is willing to wait patiently and embrace the FUD until it does.

The country's banking regulator has taken upon itself to regulate bitcoins where there is absolutely no need to do so. The two big ""exchanges"" in India - Zebpay and Unocion - have massively sold out the ideals behind bitcoins and are backing the regulation of bitcoins, so that they can maintain their monopoly on the market. These are not even true exchanges in the sense you can just buy and sell and not really trade, and moreover they charge a ridiculous commission of 10-15% over the coinbase price of BTC. 

There is insatiable greed among these two exchanges, they have even formed a ""Blockchain Foundation of India"" to get these regulations pushed through by politicians, who do not even understand bitcoin. 

Both these exchanges have appalling service, never even bother to reply to service requests and tickets, even remove tickets from their ticketing system without solving them and harass the customers to prove their identity/banking credentials time and again.Lot of time delay the transactions, so that they can profit from the rise in the price of bitcoin.

The same prediction is made every year for the last few years. At some point, someone will get it right. Maybe you'll get lucky and it will be you.

&gt; Crypto was specifically designed off the back on the 08 crisis

That's a very narrow way of looking at the origins of bitcoin.

&gt; Weâve already seen a transfer of wealth into crypto from past use cases of struggling economies (Cyprus/Greece).

What do you mean by that? If you mean that Cypriots and Greeks transferred their wealth to bitcoin, then absolutely not. If you mean that others looked at what happened in Cyprus and Greece and transferred their wealth to bitcoin, then there is little evidence of this. What really happened was that these crises were used by bitcoiners to hype bitcoin at the time (perhaps they managed to persuade a few outsiders to transfer their wealth to bitcoin, but that's nothing really).

&gt; This is a very positive indicator for the health of the crypto during a fiat recession/crash.

It was just hype.

&gt; I believe that if said recession happens, we will see very large gains in the top 10 coins. I think the vast majority of wealth coming in will be backed by an uneducated crypto market and they will subsequently default to Bitcoin. Rationale - the masses currently perceive it as the safer option as itâs a known media commodity and it has the reputation as digital gold.

That is IF the recession happens this year. Because, if the recession happens two or five years from now, ether will be the bigger name and the ""masses"" (which won't be anywhere near as large as you imagine) will default to ether as ether will be the more popular coin.",2017-06-10 08:30:50

Jeff used to contribute to Bitcoin core, but (1) AFAIK never on consensus code, and (2) he hasn't done anything at all [for about two years](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3795e8152b678b9f805a395b144190a9f2fa2af4) and [little](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1337008.0) for a long time before that.

Presumably he's been too busy [deanonymizing Bitcoin transactions](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bloq-acquires-blockchain-analytics-pioneer-skry-300413478.html) and creating government-cosigned [AML wallets](http://www.econotimes.com/PwC-and-blockchain-startups-Bloq-Libra-Netki-launch-Vulcan-Digital-Asset-Services-401520) to bother contributing anything to any Bitcoin implementation (even lame forks like Classic and BU). 

The lack of any recent contribution to Bitcoin hasn't stopped him from going around and marketing himself using the ""Bitcoin Core"" 'brand' while also going around pumping alts like [ethereum](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/755775586367176705)-- and I think the rest of the project has tolerated it for too long.

""Earliest"" -- Sounds like you're under the sway of a false narrative which seems to be being heavily promoted on rbtc and other SaintBits LLC properties-- that the current developers are some kind of Johnny-come-lately usurpers that somehow took over (via psychic mind powers?). 

The most active developers today were active as far back as anyone else except Satoshi, save for just days/months.  Does a couple few days difference out of years make someone 'earlier' in any meaningful sense? Even when they've been inactive for a long time? -- e.g. [Matt Corallo's first commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/279ab5e62f4e4344061d54b341d8d36af874fb88) was three days before [Jeff's](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/f684aec4f38d6a9e48e870ca5dae6bd65da516cf), [Luke-jr's](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a14bf1946dfade7c615cd41924c7cd41abdbc119) was a month and a half before Jeff's, [Pieter's](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/335e878be8f30ae1f7a23fbd3686fdd80c600282) nine days after.  -- so ""earliest"" along with probably almost every other developer you can name.

But did Matt stop contributing years ago then go on a roadshow selling himself as a ""Core developer"" while plugging competing systems, funding anti-privacy tech, and slinging [confused FUD](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/705059477297434625) against [new developments](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/788399430827446273)?  No. He's active and committed to the project to this day, just like Luke-jr, just like Pieter.  Not just cranking out bug fixes and optimizations but doing fundamental design and extending the protocol. Other developer's who haven't been active recently, like Peter Todd, ask media people to not call them Bitcoin Core developers to avoid unfairly trading on the project's reputation.

(and, aside, these developers that Ver attacks with this late-coming-usurpers meme were using Bitcoin before Ver himself was!)

This narrative that the current developers showed up in 2014 and took over is just nonsense.

Even in 2011, Wladimir was the most active contributor with 2 commits for every one of Gavin's.  

The reality of it is that a lot of the people doing a lot of the hard work chose to keep a low profile for personal and legal reasons-- because it wasn't clear if Bitcoin developers would get prosecuted (though today it seems a silly concern with the ICO mania defrauding people with no consequences...), and because they're not interested in being spokespeople.

If other people wanted to do more of the public speaking and pontificating, that sounded great.  No one anticipated that this would be used to misrepresent everyone else's contributions years later. The public's confusion has since been abused over and over again in what are by all appearances efforts to redirect control of the software people use from a public collaboration into various closed and private efforts.  This has been complained for years in private with the hope of minimizing drama and hurt feelings, in consideration of the genuine gratitude toward past contributions, and in the hope that the situation was a misunderstanding. But raising concerns privately has been astonishingly ineffective and, personally, I'm fed up with the false narrative and not going to sit quietly about it anymore.  I shouldn't have to correct claims like this but I do because, sadly, it seems some people are far too happy with the credit being incorrectly assigned to them.

So go ahead and say ""former"" if you like-- whatever, at least that would be vaguely accurate, though it neglects the multiple orders of magnitude difference between him and contributors like Wladimir and Pieter both in quantity and character of the work done.  But to suggest that it applies currently or recently is a grave disrespect to all of us who have continually supported and built the project for the last 6 years and kept things working well and coping with incredible challenges.

Agree about the relative usefulness of market cap, and great analogy!


My personal opinion is that as long ETH's market cap is below the ATH market cap of BTC, it's still cheap (talking about the platform, not the currency, but since the currency is needed to use the platform, maybe talking about the currency a little bit).

The reasoning is that, apart from anonymity and adoption, I personally can't see the benefits of Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies.

Also, I don't really like PoW at the current scale. It was fine for the past few years but it's really not a responsible method going forward, as it's so big right now that the environmental impact isn't anything we can ignore any longer.

Also: very much not a fan of the miner centralisation. What was the latest % count of miners located in China?


I hope Bitcoin and Ethereum can coexist, there is room enough for both to be very successful.

&gt; bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized/distributed network. if it can't be that, then why would anyone switch from fiat/gold/etc to bitcoin? we already have crypto altcoins that can do borderless transactions so that isn't the main point of bitcoin.

It is decentralized and distributed. It may not be to the level you want, but it's sufficient. It was the main point until it wasn't and alts started gaining traction. What is the main point to you? 

&gt; crypto needs a reserve/settlement ""currency"" otherwise it's not much different from paypal/western union. the world needs a decentralized/distributed network of money like bitcoin. i don't see much of a future with this world if we let centralization be the norm when it comes to our money/currency aka energy.

What's the point of a decentralized currency if you are priced out of using it? 

&gt; i prefer status quo over segwit2x. i'd rather allow bip148 or even bip149 in july 2018 activate segwit to keep bitcoin great. i don't see a rush. bitcoin is WORTH keeping great and even worth waiting to activate segwit in july 2018 with bip149 w/o requiring centralized miners/exchanges to activate it.

That's fine as that's your right. Most people are fine with segwit2x. If it happens, majority will move on and you will be left behind. What's great about crypto is that it grants freedom so everyone is free to do what they choose and that is what makes cryptos work.

&gt; i dont care about the fees right now. are they high? yes. does it suck? sure, but look at how much bitcoin's value is gaining? you're winning regardless! and fees will reduce with segwit alone, plus lightning, plus further decentralized improvements. so it's win-win. and if ur only in bitcoin for the $ and dont care about decentralization and making the world a better place, more money will flow into a bitcoin that serves as a store of value than as a daily transactional currency.

I do care and what the world to change for the better. If only the centralized services you seem to hate can only afford to make TX on chain and you are forced to use off chain centralized services, is it really decentralized for you anymore?

&gt; i got into bitcoin because my savings account didn't give me any reward for saving and inflation was degrading the value of my savings.

So self interest? That's what makes crypto tick; everyone's self interest.",2017-06-10 03:35:05

dir6ah6,immenseimme,301,"Imagine you would have a magic book. There are people around the world who also have a copy of the magic book. Now, everyone can write into that book; if you write something into the book, it appears in all other copies of the book, around the world, pretty much instantly. Nobody, not even you, can erase what you wrote into that book or what someone else wrote into that book. That's basically blockchain technology, on which Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other cryptocurrencies are based.

Bitcoin, for example, uses the magic book to log transactions of the virtual currency ""Bitcoin"". You'd basically write into the magic book ""I give Cathy 1 Bitcoin"". The book then checks through all the entries of any entries of me having Bitcoin in the first place and if so, send the intended 1 to Cathy. Now Cathy has an entry in the magic book and now it knows she has some Bitcoin too, so if she tries to send one, the magic book can confirm (thanks /u/Kroucher for the suggestion).

Ethereum goes further, here you can basically write small ""self-executing"" programs that can't be deleted. So with our book analogy, you could write into the book ""I bet 1 ETH with Amy that the weather on May the 2nd is sunny and nice"", and include a data link to Google Weather or similar which the program can check. You pay a small fee to deploy the program. The code then keeps getting executed on thousands of computers worldwide. 
If it actually rains on May the 2nd, the program sends 1 ETH from you to Amy's wallet. Since anyone can check the code of the program, Amy doesn't have to trust me, the creator of the program, she can check my code for herself. Also, the program can't be suddenly deleted (so I can't just quit the bet after looking at the forecast on May the 1st). 

So Ethereum is basically a giant, coordinated decentralized swarm of individual's computers connected to each other on the web where anybody can deploy his mini-programs (called smart contracts) for a small fee.

diqy4ar,labrav,111,"*First serious cash-out* OK, at $340 the day has come. I had heard of Bitcoin soon after it was launched from friends but I couldnât be bothered to learn how I could invest a couple of dollars. One of those friends (who works for the Foundation) made a presentation abouth the Ethereum project at a meetup, stressing that eth is more fuel than money. I was intrigued and read up on the plan and got hooked. I first bought in last March below $8, then quite a bit around $14 last summer (not a good entry point in the short run); I also added eth by margin trading (always long). I took out my original stake in bits along the way in the $19-$200 range, since then, it is all house money I risk. Originally I did not give a lot of thought to where exactly I would cash out â somewhere in the $100-$1000 range, if and when, in the distant future, it comes to that, I vaguely reckoned. Since the price took off earlier this year, I decided to put together a schedule for doing it, with price points and percentages, which starts right here and now. 

It is painful to part with my precious coins - every eth I cash out now could (and I hope: will) further appreciate two, three, fourfold soon, but I lived through theDAO, the DDOS attacks, and am acutely aware how many things could go wrong in a flash and wipe out all of my impressive paper profits. So I have just cashed out the first 5% of my war chest of eths. We do not name amounts here, and what I withdraw now wonât buy me a Lambo yet (not that I desire one) but it is a tidy sum. Sorry, no reddit gold shower now (I will do that when cashing in the last installment but the ultimate 30% I will leave in eth all the way to the moon, no matter what), and I am not going anywhere either, but I think it is proper at this point to say this: a big thank you to all of you in this subreddit who have entertained, helped, and challenged me along the way and of course to the mods!

I have responded by not transacting in Bitcoin any more. I refuse to pay such an exorbitant fee for such a service. My money is elsewhere, now. If miners can communicate to users that they're willing to scale by mining a larger block, then I will consider moving money back on to the chain.

Miners should know this. They're on the forefront, the front line, they are the fee collectors. They should see plainly that they are up against an adoption wall that will result in revenue collapse if immediate scaling isn't adopted.

dis3wec,SomewhatLessRelevant,73,"ConcepciÃ³n Valeria Alvarez, Connie to her friends, woke up that morning feeling fine.  It was Sunday, her day off from working at the Quik-Mart, and she actually had a full two days off this time because Justin was going to show up Monday if he didn't want to get fired.  At least, so she thought at the time.  By Tuesday she would have much bigger problems to worry about, and Justin would be dead.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Wait, what?""  Connie sat up, looking around warily for the source of that officious, dispassionate voice.  Her phone was silent.  The television wasn't on.  The knockoff tablet was still plugged in and charging, powered down.  There weren't a lot of places for someone to be hiding in a one-room studio apartment.  Especially a third floor walk-up.*

&amp;nbsp;

What Connie didn't realize was that at that moment, across the globe in the United Kingdom, a man infected with a deadly virus had just gotten onto a plane headed for Los Angeles.  He had already killed his entire family without realizing it.  When he left them they were fine.  By the time his plane was in the air his wife would just have begun to run a fever - as he was.  He thought it might be a stomach flu, food poisoning, but he was very wrong.  How could he have known he was about to end the world as he knew it?

&amp;nbsp;


*""What the fuck do you mean, end the world?""  Connie jumped out of bed, black hair still tousled from sleep, and grabbed the bat from beside the bed.  She went to look out the window at the fire escape, but there was no one there, either.  She dressed hastily in jeans, a sports bra, a tank top, and a Dodgers cap.  She didn't watch a ton of baseball, but her Dad had given it to her as a birthday present.  Her favorite Converse sneakers that she'd gotten almost new at Goodwill completed the look.*


&amp;nbsp;

By the third hour of his flight, the man would be delirious with fever, raving incoherently at his seatmate.  He would be subdued by air marshalls, but in the process he bit one of them on the hand, breaking the skin.  They secured him with plastic ties, but by that time he was already sinking into a coma.  Half an hour later he was dead.  And ten minutes after that, he got up and started biting the other passengers.


&amp;nbsp;

By the time the flight landed at LAX, everyone outside the secure cockpit would be dead, hungry, and furious.  The pilot's calls for help were not completely understood owing to a radio malfunction.


&amp;nbsp;

*""Radio malfunction.  Right.""  Connie grabbed the tablet to cash in her little amount of bitcoin and headed for the bus.  The bank wasn't super far.  She didn't like carrying a ton of cash in her little black purse, but it looked like she was going to need it.*


&amp;nbsp;

The doors of the plane were opened by a small number of airport security, nowhere near enough to contain the flood of furious infect pouring from the plane.  They aimed for the body, as they had been taught to do.  Shots to the body, as it would turn out, would not kill an infected or even slow them down.  Only a direct hit to the brain would have effect - and no one would figure that out until it was too late.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Okay, so aim for the head.  So this is a zombie thing we're looking at,"" Connie muttered, drawing odd looks from the other people on the bus.  Her parents had been dead since she was twelve.  She texted her uncle on her prepaid phone:*

&amp;nbsp;

*hey i'm coming out there to the farm how are your fences*

&amp;nbsp;

*He replied a few minutes later:*
*Good, just ran the fenceline today.  What's going on, mija?*

&amp;nbsp;

*buy ammo food and water asap shit is about to hit the fan don't ask how i know just do it pls*

&amp;nbsp;

*Are you high?*

&amp;nbsp;

*i wish*

&amp;nbsp;

But ConcepciÃ³n Valeria Alvarez had no way to know that.  She would go blithely on about her day off with no idea what was about to happen to her, to Los Angeles, and to the world.

&amp;nbsp;

*""The hell I will.  And why does he keep saying my full name like that?""  It was a long six hour ride on a Greyhound out to Hesperia, and then another long cab ride out to TÃ­o Tomas's farm with a stop off at Wal-Mart for all the ammunition, canned food and bottled water she could afford and that the cab would hold.  It was piled full of supplies when they got to the big house.  She paid the driver the last of her savings to help them unload it all.  As he drove off she heard him muttering about crazy wetback preppers, which made her feel slightly less guilty that she hadn't told him.*

&amp;nbsp;

As Connie was relaxing with her family, blithely unaware of what was happening  miles away, the contagion had already begun to spread through the city of Los Angeles.  They thought they had it contained in the airport as the LAPD finally shot enough bullets into the active infected to knock them down.  By that time many more people had been bitten.  The airport was in chaos, and there were rumors of a terrorist event, of a bioweapon, of a mass shooting.  Five police officers were bitten by downed ""corpses"" that hadn't been hit in the head.  They were treated, released, and sent home later that day.  By that time the people who had been bitten at the airport were feverish themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

*""Oh sure, now it's Connie,"" she said as she helped TÃ­a Maria make dinner.  They were having flan for dessert - homemade flan was not even comparable to the box stuff.  TÃ­o Tomas had brought home as many supplies as his truck could carry, bemused but trusting of the niece he had raised as a daughter.  He half-expected to find her tweaking and have to get her to a doctor, but she seemed fine, just a little excited.  Her aunt was somewhat more worried about the fact that she seemed to be talking to someone that wasn't there.*

&amp;nbsp;

The next morning it would be all over the news as more and more people came down with the same illness - first fever, then delirium, then coma and death.  It was a virus, not a bacterium that could be treated with antibiotics, and though it could only be transmitted by blood, a tiny amount of blood would suffice.  It would be months before anyone knew that the virus could not remain viable for long without a living host; contaminated objects would be safe an hour after they were dry.  The roads quickly became impassable as people tried to escape the city.  Some of those who did escape were already infected.

&amp;nbsp;

*Connie hastily took notes on paper - who knew how long she'd be able to keep her phone charged? - as she listened to the pompous voice again.  It wasn't easy persuading TÃ­o Tomas to give all his workers the day off, but when she pointed out the news and insisted she knew somebody who knew somebody at the CDC, and told him about the virus, he reluctantly agreed.  By the day after that the farm would be a stocked and fortified fortress.*

&amp;nbsp;


*She told as many workers as would listen about the virus.  Most of them thought she was crazy.*


&amp;nbsp;


Woefully unprepared for the crisis, Connie and her family would find themselves in a dreadful position as society gradually began to break down.


&amp;nbsp;


*""Go fuck yourself,"" Connie said to the air, and jacked another round into the chamber as she shot another walker from the roof.  You had to keep them away from the fence, was all.  And you had to shoot them in the head.*",2017-06-12 11:57:27

Even if the block size debate is settled and transaction costs reduce we've still got ten of features to add to bitcoin which will take months or years - just to catch up. Some will require hard forks and some will be contentious and bring us back to this situation.

Ethereum have shown they have a better development team and are sometimes willing to make a hard choice (e.g. DAO fork) quickly. They have also shown their network can cope with hard forks.

Amazon Prime sells a 16TB external hard drive for $500. That's enough to hold 300 years of blockchain at the current growth rate, or 3 years if we instantly expanded to 100MB blocks (as we might need to if some country decided to scrap their own currency and just use Bitcoin). I'm one of the thousands of individuals who wouldn't hesitate to purchase an external hard drive in order to continue to run an unpruned relay node.

So what happens in 3 years, when my external drive is full? Some people might decide to go with a pruned relay node, but I'd choose to buy a larger external drive. They'll probably have 48TB drives by then, enough to last another 6 years. Maybe less, if we're lucky and more countries adopt Bitcoin!

History has shown that the more people there are using Bitcoin, the more relay nodes we have. Sadly, banker-funded Blockstream has successfully managed to block the stream of transactions, driving many businesses and users to Ethereum and the other altcoins. They are choking Bitcoin to death.

diszbz9,Ilogy,512,"The reason Ethereum is poised to replace Bitcoin as the #1 cryptocurrency is not because of transaction fees or confirmation times. If that's all it took, Litecoin wouldn't represent a pale shadow of Bitcoin's market cap. Raising Bitcoin's block size wouldn't have been sufficient to prevent what is happening. 

The real reason Ethereum is on the rise is because of smart contracts and token creation. **The crypto hype cycle of 2013/14 was about the birth of digital money. The hype cycle of 2017 is about the birth of digital credit.** But because the Bitcoin network doesn't do digital credit (at least not very well), Ethereum is benefiting the most from this cycle. Many people disparage the ICO phenomena, but there can be no doubt that the ICO craze is at the heart of the current hype cycle. Virtually all of the ICOs are taking place on Ethereum because Bitcoin doesn't easily allow for this. And while most of the ICOs will probably go nowhere, a few will become gems, and those gems will add to the overall value and desirability of the Ethereum network. 

What Ethereum is demonstrating is that the qualities of the base layer of a network only matter to a degree. The fact that Ethereum is not as immutable as Bitcoin matters, but only to a degree. What matters more -- at least at this stage in the game -- is the fact that permissionless innovation is much more easily achieved within the Ethereum network at the moment than within Bitcoin, leading to an explosion of essentially ""user-generated content"" while Bitcoin is stuck in a power struggle over the base layer which really shouldn't be up for debate (since that isn't where the meaningful innovation is going to take place anyway). That Bitcoin's base layer is difficult to change is potentially a great feature, but only if the code is in place to allow for rapid innovation beyond that base layer. 

The main threat to Bitcoin has never been a block size increase or the lack of a block size increase -- the main threat has never been a split in the network. The main threat has been stagnation and the loss of innovation to another network. The main reason to want SegWit was not to increase capacity, that is just an added benefit. The main reason is to allow for progress to continue, to allow for new innovation, to allow for lightning network, for side chains, for smart contract platforms. Bitcoin is failing to add intrinsic value to the network by making it difficult for anyone to build upon it, to innovate using it, and to use it for anything beyond making simple currency transactions -- and even those are becoming difficult due to high fees which are also a result of this stagnation. 

There can be no doubt that Roger Ver and Jihan Wu have massively contributed to this stagnation. But it is also certain that some Core developers, like Luke-jr, continually halt progress over their obsession with keeping blocks small and their unwillingness to compromise. The stagnation is due to the rigidity of members of the larger Bitcoin community on both sides who cling to their no-compromise positions over minor issues. Both sides are acting like children and both sides are contributing to the problem. The block size debate -- as a purely technical matter -- is a relatively trivial matter in the larger scheme of things, and if the rise of Ethereum doesn't spell that out for people, I don't know what will. A simple compromise and we can move on toward a bright future, a simple compromise and the important stuff can be built.

If you just looked at this chart, the price action yesterday would seem to fit into the ânormalâ trading range of this formation.  THAT is the beauty of PnF charts.  They take out the noise.  Yes, I am calling a $200 difference in the actual low and the PnF low noise.

The charts work with the assumption that many times the price action during a day will shoot too high, and fall too low.  One of the things that these charts will smooth out are the âcrazy ivanâ swings that happen with bitcoin all of the time.  

So, we went down low and yet because we did not start the day at the lows, the boxes do not fall THAT far.

Here are the numbers:

We reverse with a price over $2,700.  

There is a positive break out at $3,050 (We start going with $50 boxes at $3,000.  The new box size applies through $25,000)

The formation is growingâmeaning the consolidation continues.

The positive trend is intact, with the pivot to a negative bias occurring way down under $1,340.  We do not seem to be in danger of breaking that any time soon.

I am going to be optimistic and suggest we consolidate here for a couple of days.  The positive trend tells me to be biased to an upside breakout.

SegWit was too little, too late.  They had 4 years to scale and told everyone (myself included) ""No"".  

They told us to ""relax"" because bitcoin ""didn't need it yet"".  We pointed out the importance of doing it now, so that it would be ready when it is needed.  

They told all of us we were being ridiculous.  They referred to us as the group that ""thinks the sky is falling"".  They called us non technical ""alarmists"".  

Gavin was calling for scaling in 2012.  I remember hearing him on the Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast expressing frustration and exhaustion with the lack of forward progress and infighting on the Core email group. 

I remember all of these direct quotes very clearly.  Because the entire time I lived through them, I was picturing the day when they'd finally do something, and it would be too late.  

By the time they grudgingly added a little bump into the SW code, half the community had already split, and multiple alternate clients had long been in development. 

Disillusionment and anger had long ago turned into ""making other plans"".  Any chance of consensus for their solution was long gone, and true to form, they don't have a clue why. The majority of that sub is completely oblivious to how things actually played out, and what got us here.  

Now they're ready. Asking why we're not taking the crumbs they've thrown to us.  Blaming Roger and Jihan who ***both*** have extended olive branches.

This drama only exists because blockstream/Core's inability to find compromise with businesses and community literally begging for compromise.

I mean would it have been so fucking hard to Segwit +blocksize increase?? But no, core had to play hardball-dictator, and refuse all compromises, lie to Chinese miners and destroy their own image with them,  blow a minor technical disagreement into a civil war and stick with a scaling plan that guaranteed Bitcoin would lose leadership status long before Segwit was even written.

This was 100% predictable and many of us have been screaming how it would play out for years. Now that it has played out let blame rest where it belongs, with a very small group of egotistical devs who refused to compromise at all when a very minor compromise would have worked. Given how it turned out and how predictable it was I have to conclude actors like nullc and lukejr actually wanted to destroy Bitcoin. Go fucking read Mike Hearn's post when he left in disgust, that was written well over a year before Segwit was done.

&gt; ""On May 24th, 2017, a significant economic majority, more than 80% of the entire hashing power and 80% of transactionsâ source software or service, of the Bitcoin industry came to an agreement in New York (New York Agreement) on tangible steps to scale Bitcoin in the near future. Representatives of Bitcoin Core declined the invite to attend this meeting.""

They still fail to understand that Bitcoin Core is not some centralized organization.  There are no ""representatives"" of Bitcoin Core.  There is nobody that can speak authoritatively for Bitcoin Core.  There is nobody who can commit Bitcoin Core to doing anything because Bitcoin Core is not some central organization.  It's a loose group of individual developers and works largely on a decentralized community process.  Any developer with a desire, technical clout, and a good track record can join ""Bitcoin Core"" and work on what they want, and if it's good, with a good proposal, good working code, and hard work to meet concerns of other engineers, it can make it's way into Bitcoin.  The way Bitmain writes here shows they still fundamentally misunderstand this vital community process because they treat Bitcoin Core as some kind of company with a traditional command and control structure that just needs to agree to something that everyone wants.

&gt; ""Subscribe the mailing list: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-ng""

There has been no activity whatsoever on the mailing list.

&gt; ""Despite this agreement, the UASF (BIP148) astroturfing movement continues to get lots of airtime on censored forums, many of which are controlled by single anonymous individuals. Many of the software developers who work in a software project called âBitcoin Coreâ are also supporting it. ""

This is just wrong.  Here is a list of Core developers that have spoken against BIP-148: Greg Maxwell, Suhas Daftuar, Matt Corallo, Marco Falke, Nicolas Dorier, Alex Morcos, Jorge Timon, Peter Wuille, Wladimir van der Laan.  Some of them support alternate approaches for getting segwit, but there is no justification for Bitmain saying ""most of the software developers who work in a software project called 'Bitcoin Core' are also supporting it"".  If most supported it, then support for it would probably already be merged into Bitcoin Core, so that argument fails.  You can see some of the core developers discussing it here: https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2017-05-25/?msg=86145297&amp;page=4

&gt; ""The New York agreement is also continuously and intentionally sabotaged by a group of software developers working on Bitcoin Core.""

In what way?  Developers have been asking for more clarity on details of the New York agreement, such as whether segwit will actually activate, whether it includes ASICBoost, whether a hard fork must be a part of it or not, and other technical details such as block weight, block size, etc.  Some developers are concerned about the accelerated timeline, whether it will be adequately tested, whether it makes the deploy safe by activating segwit by taking advantage of existing segwit-ready clients, etc.  Part of the agreement included assuming good faith, Bitmain doesn't seem to be assuming good faith here.

&gt; ""The New York agreement is very conservative and aimed at bringing peace within the Bitcoin community on a simple but artificially escalated scaling issue.""

The inventor himself of much of the technology behind Bitcoin says that this is not just a simple artificial scaling issue, the block size parameter is an important security parameter that protects the system.  Changes to it should be considered carefully by engineers.  See: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6fhmge/nick_szabo_theres_an_obsessive_group_of_people/

&gt; ""UASF is an attack against users and enterprises who disagree with activating SegWit right now without a block size increase""

This is a clear case where Bitmain is showing that they are purposely holding Segwit back to try to get leverage for a hard fork block size increase.  Unfortunately, soft forks have always been something that could in theory be activated by a smaller portion of the ecosystem, while hard forks require much greater support in order to prevent chain splits.  This is the nature of how Bitcoin works.  The problem they seem to be ignoring is that a significant portion of the ecosystem is not yet convinced that hard forking is the way to solve the problem.  An overwhelming majority is needed to hard fork safely, more research needs to be done, and it's hard to measure that actual support.

&gt; ""Once Bitmain starts to mine a UAHF chain publicly, we will mine it persistently and ignore short-term economic incentives. We believe a roadmap including the option to adjust block size will serve users better so we expect it to attract a higher market price in the long term. The economic network will expand faster, and the winning odds will be higher in a highly competitive cryptocurrency market.""

Everyone wants Bitcoin to scale, but we want it to be done intelligently.  I think they don't realize that a majority of Bitcoiners won't follow their UAHF chain if the majority of the developers don't believe that is a sound way to scale Bitcoin.

&gt; ""We do not believe that decentralization means a 1MB block size limit or a responsibility to constrain the block size so that a Raspberry Pi can run a full node while the fee per Bitcoin transaction is higher than the daily income in most developing countries.""

What they don't take into account is that the major bottleneck to scaling is not just hardware, but the bandwidth required to run a full node.  And they seem to downplay the importance of full nodes in securing the coin itself.  Not to mention the fact that the block size is important for a number of other reasons, such as miner centralization.  Of course, Bitmain seems happy to try to control all of the Bitcoin hash power, but that centralization is very damaging, and increasing block size helps miners like them centralize, so their incentives are not properly aligned with the community's desire of a decentralized Bitcoin.  For an example of mining centralization pressure that arises from increased block size, see this discussion between Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0

&gt; ""Currently, there are at least 3 client development teams working on the code of the spec. All of them want to stay quiet and away from the propaganda and troll army of certain companies.""

For their hard fork to be successful, they will need to convince a majority of users to run it.  Nobody is forcing anyone to run Bitcoin Core.  We run it because it is developed in the open with a community process.  It can be frustrating as a developer to have to face that kind of public scrutiny, but Bitmain thinking that privately developing then releasing is going to instill enough confidence for others to run their client is mistaken.

&gt; ""Later, we will support the activation of SegWit on the UAHF chain if there is no patent risk associated with SegWit and if the arbitrary discount rate of witness data segment is removed.""

they are describing patents of Blockstream.  Blockstream has committed in the strongest way possible to ensure no patent will be used against the Bitcoin ecosystem: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/blockstream-commits-patent-nonaggression

&gt; ""The weight parameter, which is designed for artificial rates, may need to be deleted and we need to be frank and straightforward in the software code about different limitations on different kind of blocks and other parameters. A SegWit without the artificial discount rate will treat legacy transaction type fairly and it will not give SegWit transactions an unfair advantage.""

These parameters were chosen very carefully.  While there's always room for some disagreement, the vast majority of developers agreed on them because segwit transactions are better for preventing UTXO bloat, which is very important for scaling.  They act as if there's no purpose served by it.

&gt; ""We will also push for and encourage changes in code, in main block or in extension block, that will make Lightning Network run more safely and reliably than Coreâs present version of SegWit does.""

Again they are treating ""Core"" as some kind of central organization.  I'd like to see what kind of proposal they could come up with that would make Lightning run more safely and reliably.

&gt; ""Schnorr Signature is also under last stage review.""

Who is working on this?  Where is the code?  Is this being developed in secret? EDIT: working in secret, then presenting something to the community is not necessarily a problem, but the way this is written makes it look like it's being developed in secret, probably without consulting any of the other core developers with expertise in this area that have also probably been working on this, and leaves the impression that it's being done in such a way that it's already in ""last stage review"" to be included in the Bitmain-supported code with little community feedback.

divtc93,nullc,187,"Well, a hasty snapshot of a few of my views, others my differ ([though opposition to that ""agreement"" looks like it may be unamious](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support)):

1. It was unethically conducted:  A VC created a private and closed meeting with his investments in the Bitcoin space and a few others without public input; and they made an agreement to forcefully change the rules of Bitcoin.  Hello Etherum Foundation (Ironic that the same person was the big driver on ethereum classic).  They claim that ""core devs"" were ""invited"" but this is misleading enough to be an outright lie: We were asked to add our names to an already completed statement with a dozen other parties names already on it (so, so much for getting it to say something more sensible). It has been promoted with misleading claims of collaboration and support by Bitcoin Core folks, which are just untrue.

2. It's unspecified. The actual signers of the agreement [clearly disagree about](https://twitter.com/bergealex4/status/867241659897171968) what they actually agreed to.  While ""segwit+2mb"" may sound like it means something to you-- it doesn't mean much. Under that banner you could do something fairly reasonable or something terrible [Fairly reasonable, for example would be to activate segwit, then with a reasonable timeframe hardfork to account for scriptSig data the same way that witness data is accounted for]. The details matter. Critically.   Perhaps this was partially as a result of forming their agreement without a single participant with _ANY_ experience in Bitcoin consensus rule design-- they didn't even know what you need to know about a protocol change.

3. Its time-frame is extremely absurd. Actually, absurd doesn't do it justice which is why between that and number #1 several engineers have been just responding ""LOL"" to the proposal.  They don't set any time for design review and analysis, they don't set any time for writing a specification (they don't have one and don't appear to intend to have one), they set aside two weeks for testing-- which is less time than even minor releases of Bitcoin get (and need!) even when they were comprised of small fixes which had mostly existed for months already. They don't allot any time for alternative implementations to implement it (which is especially bad because they can provide useful design feedback). They don't set aside time for meaningful deployment by users (some of whom may have their own lengthy patching and qualification process). They don't seem to have any concern about how forced upgrades erode decentralization and privileged hosted wallets/apis/pools over running your own infrastructure. Basically every stage of the consensus rule change pipeline should take (and always has taken) more time they allotted for _everything_.  BU+Classic BIP109 ran on testnet for months before their interoperability failure was revealed and they forked apart from each other and abandon BIP109.

4. They are explicitly rejecting and shielding themselves from public comment. E.g. they created a lf mailing list  but when Luke-jr tried to join it Jeff replied saying the list was only for people who supported the agreement and intended to support it.  Responses to requests to make their system compatible with BIP141 or BIP148 and existing nodes; have just been met with vague hand-waving about the ""charter"" and deleting comments on their github.  This is doubly bad because some of their technical proposals just won't work and will self partition if deployed.

5. It doesn't answer any of the serious concerns about the negative impact of increased capacity on the viability of the system, it just takes the capacity doubling of segwit (which is already seen by many as pretty extreme) and doubles it again.  Some of the signers seemed to believe that what they agreed to was ""segwit immediately"" which at least would give some walk-before-running time but to the extent that I can figure out what they're doing, it isn't that. Keep in mind that segwit itself was a massive compromise-- taking on a large and risky increase in load, but countering it with scalability improvements... and as soon as it was proposed the goalpost moved.  I doubt many see segwit2x as anything else.

6. Bitcoin's value comes significantly from its durability against change.  Bitcoin is fine the way it is-- it could be even better, but it doesn't need to make radical incompatible hasty changes.  Everyone who wants cabal-controlled fork-a-week coins have several options to choose from. Bitcoin is never going to be better at being that than the cruddy altcoins which were designed for it (with huge premines to keep those early holders pumping through the waves of technical failure). In a competitive market we should look at what differentiates Bitcoin from the competition and exploit that as much as we can, not try to me-too follow around other things. If Barry and Co can rewrite Bitcoin's rules against non-trivial opposition who else can also do so?

7. Bitcoin Core doesn't have the technical or moral authority to make incompatible changes to the rules of the network.  And the dozens of major individual contributors just do not personally support this proposal (for some of the reasons above or others)-- and are obviously not going to volunteer their efforts to aid a proposal which they believe would harm Bitcoin.  Probably this one would be the TLDR: Core isn't a company, it is an open public collaboration of many people.  Core won't endorse pretty much _anything_ but it certainly won't endorse things which are widely (or in this case nearly unanimously) opposed by its contributors.

8. None of the involved parties have showed even the slightest indication that they understood or cared about concerns like the above, even when people like Matt wasted hours trying to communicate them to them.  Not a ""I understand but we'll account for that by X""-- but just talking to a wall.  Which means that its unlikely that the negative consequences of these concerns will be avoided with any reliability.

But finally-- what would be the point?  I think that almost any one of these issues alone would make it dead on arrival.  I'd say stick a fork in it, but Bitmain already has-- e.g. their post today says they have no intention on following through with segwit2x by saying they'd only activate segwit if it had more modifications (surprise, surprise). 

The tech community was polite enough to keep most of our concerns in private and wait and see it this transformed into something supportable.  But we've started speaking against it since the misleading claims that we supported and were collaborating with it started.

divqtg6,theymos,147,"What this means: Bitmain is announcing that if BIP148 succeeds, then they are going to essentially mine a different SHA-256 altcoin instead of Bitcoin. If you don't do anything, it'll be as if mining power dropped somewhat, but you'll be otherwise completely unaffected. I feel like some people might read this statement as trying to force a decision between Bitmain's altcoin and BIP148, but it won't; technology-wise, it doesn't affect in either direction the potential contention between BIP148 and status-quo/BIP149; Bitmain's actions will *not* in any way threaten either a status-quo chain or a BIP148 chain.

I continue to be pessimistic about BIP148's chances; I consider continuation of the status-quo and a somewhat later BIP149 UASF as the most likely outcome.

&gt; **CAP theorem** - ""in the cases that a network partition takes place, you have to choose either consistency or availability, you cannot have both"". The intuitive argument is simple: if the network splits in half, and in one half I send a transaction ""send my 10 coins to A"" and in the other I send a transaction ""send my 10 coins to B"", then either the system is unavailable, as one or both transactions will not be processed, or it becomes inconsistent, as one half of the network will see the first transaction completed and the other half will see the second transaction completed. **Note that the CAP theorem has nothing to do with scalability; it applies to sharded and non-sharded systems equally.**

We are told the economy must be doing great because the market keeps going up, up UP! I suppose itâs a matter of perspective. Itâs not so great for over 50 percent of Americans who own no stocks whatsoever. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck with little or no savings. Theyâre struggling to pay rent and the bills. They're not going to be buying AMZN at $1,000 per share. Jobless young people who are steeped in college debt and living with their parents canât afford to buy stocks, either. Baby boomers are cashing out stocks to pay for their retirement. So what exactly is fueling the perpetual rise in stocks? The central bankers and global corporations themselves. President Trump and Obama have nothing to do with it. Itâs an insidersâ game. 


&gt;The top one percent owns nearly 40 percent of stocks. The top 20 percent owns 92 percent.

Yes, I know Iâm at risk of being called a socialist by pointing this out. Some may say Iâm trying to foment class warfare, but all Iâm doing is stating facts. We already have a quasi-socialist system. The government steals our money and redistributes it as they see fit. Citizens were ordered to buy ObamaCare whether they liked it or not.


&gt;We also have a corporate fascist system. While many Americans are unable to pass âGO,â the Federal Reserve routinely prints and doles out free money to its central banker owners. They in turn sock it into the stock market in the form of quantitative easing, âtwistsâ or whatever they want to call it. They own the MonopolyÂ® board and make us pay each time we land on their squares. They also use their easy money to keep gold and silver suppressed. A classic case of âpaper covers rock.â Silver should have done what Bitcoin has doneâgone up exponentially. The bankers apparently canât rig or short Bitcoin. 


&gt;The big shots who own the game have run out of ideas about where their free money can be parked. Loan it out to the poor or entrepreneurs? Oh no, canât do thatâ¦too much risk! Bonds? No way with these lower rates. The money addicts want the big returns that stocks can provide and so thatâs where the money goes. Martin Armstrong even thinks the Dow can hit 40,000. Why not? It benefits those at the very topâyou know, those who already own and control most anything anyway. More money for Bezos, Gates, Warren Buffett and the big bankersâgreat, huh? Those running the show through the CFR and at Bilderberg will continue to have ever-more money and influence while the little guy will lose more freedom, money and jobs. A rising market is great for the top of the pyramid, and terrible for the rest of us.


&gt;These are the things I think about as the rigged Dow continues to get force fed. A fat market living at all-time highs is NOT a good thing for the average citizen who picks up the tab, and if the market ever does explode, it will be the average citizen who will suffer the most.

I checked my email to see if he sent it to me as well, but he didn't (probably because I'm by far the youngest one here [24] and I always get the vibe he thinks my age means I don't have my shit together). Anyway, the article is talking about crypto performance vs the US markets, and how ""everyone thought bitcoin was in a bubble at $1, $100, $1000..., but whether it be bitcoin or some other blockchain technology, it's here to stay"". Goes on to briefly mention the ""No. 2 leader, Ethereum"".

diumt3q,Deepestdeep,45,"I have been posting about IOTA since its market cap was 30 million.

I have not sold a single iota yet, and I will explain why.

First of all the technology is the first true leap in fundamental distributed ledger architecture since Bitcoin itself. Sure there has been a lot of different experimentation and adjustments to the blockchain, but fundamentally all of them are still a blockchain, IOTA is not. IOTA resolved the scaling problems, the fee issue and the centralization issue, literally the top 3 concerns of blockchain that has kept it out of real world use forever. Even just solving one of them would be revolutionary, as is evident by hundreds of projects proclaiming to do just that, they solved all 3! It's hard to overstate, in fact almost hard to believe, until you look at the code and play with the protocol.

Secondly is the team, the entire core team of IOTA consist of blockchain veteran seminal thinkers who pioneered everything from full Proof of Stake to 2.0 functionality like Asset Management, Voting etc. as well as first movers in the field of combining distributed ledger tech with Identity, Internet of Things, Voting, Supply Chain before pretty much anyone else. They have consistently shown that they are years ahead of everyone in terms of vision and creating technology that enables the vision.

Thirdly look at the community and ecosystem. There is already 10s of thousands of people, their Slack alone got almost 7000 people and it is growing by hundreds each day. There is a 10 million dollar ecosystem fund for everyone to build projects on the platform.

Finally they got real world companies involved, only Ethereum can rival them here. They are working with Microsoft, Bosch, Innogy, Ubuntu, Cisco, Thomson Reuters etc. before they even launched.

Should you invest? Well, if you can show me anything that can beat this I will pay you 100 000 dollars of my own money just to be part of it.",2017-06-14 01:48:55

This fee squeeze should be a wake-up call regardless of its cause. Nobody who actually uses bitcoin to make small purchases such as hosting (a very good use case BTW) wants to lose that.

You can look at this and conclude that Bitcoin has failed as a P2P electronic cash system.

Or... you could look at it as creating a bounty for a workable solution. Right now that solution appears to be alternative tokens such as ether and litecoin. I don't think that will last for long, though.

If the alternatives reach the same level of economic sophistication and scale as Bitcoin, they too will show signs of stress. They will all come face to face with the same problem: how to keep electronic cash fungible while scaling orders of magnitude.

&gt; 
&gt; What this means: Bitmain is announcing that if BIP148 succeeds, then they are going to essentially mine a different SHA-256 altcoin instead of Bitcoin. If you don't do anything, it'll be as if mining power dropped somewhat, but you'll be otherwise completely unaffected. I feel like some people might read this statement as trying to force a decision between Bitmain's altcoin and BIP148, but it won't; technology-wise, it doesn't affect in either direction the potential contention between BIP148 and status-quo/BIP149; Bitmain's actions will *not* in any way threaten either a status-quo chain or a BIP148 chain.
&gt; 
&gt; I continue to be pessimistic about BIP148's chances; I consider continuation of the status-quo and a somewhat later BIP149 UASF as the most likely outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; I kinda doubt that they're actually going to stick by what they say here, but if they do, it only seems good.

Maybe.... just maybe...  all Cryptocurrencies are hard to value,  and it is gauging the level of public interest and the number of people who want some  that decides price and worth.

I do see there are  6x as many ETH units as BTC units in circulation.  So if the currencies were valued equally,  then  Bitcoin should be  6x the price,  but instead  each BTC is about 7x the price of 1 ETH.

diws0tp,nullc,109,"&gt; For example, I distinctly remember you and some other devs saying something along the lines of ""I don't care if segwit activates"", which to me as an outsider doesn't sound like a glowing endorsement, but more like ""we've run out of reasons to reject it""

::sigh::

I am one of the inventors of segwit.  I named it (such as it is). I wrote the public proposal that we deploy it. I spent countless hours working on it, reviewing it, and testing it. I think segwit is great stuff.

But I still do not care if it activates.

I think you do not have a clear perspective on the stakes and time-frames involved.  Bitcoin's security and robustness is paramount and is strictly more important than any mere technical improvement, no matter how nice of one it is.

Part of the challenge and beauty of working on Bitcoin is that no one controls it. No matter how pretty or perfect you believe some improvement is, it may not be adopted.  No process could guarantee the adoption of a change without consigning Bitcoin to worthlessness (especially amid an environment with many competitors that deploy random crap with nary a though to the resulting erosion of personal autonomy).

So segwit is great, but it doesn't hold a candle to the importance of Bitcoin itself.  Because segwit is good I'm pretty confidence that we'll have it eventually (or be replaced with something even better), but it ultimately doesn't matter -- not compared to keeping Bitcoin secure and resistant to influence.

You insult me and every other Bitcoin developer by assuming that we're opposed to segwit because we strictly prioritize Bitcoin's value and longevity.

&gt; Edit - P.S.: Don't get me wrong, for janitorial tasks 

So, ""pardon me while I spit in your face""?--  Bitcoin Core is not a bunch of janitors. The current community been doing critical work advancing the protocol and driving the state of the art in science in this space since 2011, likely long before you ever even heard of Bitcoin.

&gt; it's easy to get the impression that Core retreats into a comfy ""I'm just an engineer"" position where they confine themselves to listing reasons why idea xyz doesn't work

It's only easy to get this impression when you don't have the interest to bother actually reading or getting involved in the discussions.  No one requires you to-- I don't fault you for not, but you shouldn't suggest that discussion isn't there when it's out in the public available for your own participation, but 
instead you choose to pay attention to social media.

Instead what you're describing is the pigeonhole that people try to place us in-- which your own message itself does with ""janitorial tasks"".  It is a load of bullshit.  But perhaps this is also why you can't understand why someone would build something but be okay with it not being used:  We're not here to sweep the floors-- if we were then perhaps we might be more obsessed with using up all our floorwax. We're here because we believe in Bitcoin and it's potential to enable and transform mankind.  All of the difficult engineering we work we do is in service of those ends and is meaningless otherwise.

Perhaps it confuses you that we seek to change the world through engineering, because most of the attention goes to those who try to change it with rhetoric. But the overwhelming majority of rhetoric in the world today and through history is just talk. Cypherpunks write code.

Many of the biggest changes in the world have been engineering, but they usually go without widespread notice especially once they have achieved their impact.  As you read this message an overwhelming majority of the nitrogen in your body was fixed via the [haber process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process) and you and probably 80% of the people on earth owe even the possibility of your existence to it.   But unless you've studied chemical engineering, you may never have heard of it.

So do not confused by the fact that we are busy working to change the world rather than busy talking about changing the world. Someday the world will be powered by Bitcoin and people like you will forget that it took hard work and brilliance to build, maintain, and grow it into a thing that everyone can count on. That will be the greatest success.  I could spend more time lamenting the flaws in our culture that cause us to glorify ultimately pointless pontificators while ignoring so many that cause real change, but that would get in the way of changing the world.  I should leave that to people who have nothing more productive to get done...

So, we are dropping like a stone.  And someone once said that there is a terminal velocity with which an object can fall.  I guess we are all learning that physics does not apply to Bitcoin.

I think a lot of the hullabaloo around the reason for this fall is misplaced.  The damn thing went up about $1,000 in a few weeks.  That is clearly and little too fast.

So hard far will it fall?  If I look at the chart there are two ways to estimate a decline.  The first is to count down from the break out point the number of boxes the formation is wide.  In this case the formation is four boxes wide.  That metric would have put the decline down to $2500.

Clearly that metric doesnât work.

A second way to measure it is to go back to the previous break down and overlay that column onto the existing column.  The last time we broke, we went down a total of 46 boxes.  You remember that runâ¦a couple of weeks ago.

If we overlay a column of 46 boxes on the current column we arrive at a targeted loss of slightly under $2,100 dollars.  That is marked by the black â2â which is right next to lowest level reached this morning.

Am I saying this ugliness is over?  No.  Not all all.  I am saying that we might be able to start looking for reentry points on anything that looks like a recovery.  

So, look at the chart and place your bets.  The game is afoot.

dixujyk,alphabaysupport,44,"Let me repost what has been said in the ticket.


Hi NewVendorInTown, I am part of the admin team at Alphabay


I have doubled check the screenshot you sent to disc0, and unfortunately, you sent coins to a phisher address. Please open your screenshots and check:


1) Use a QR code scanner application, and scan the QR code beside the Bitcoin address - you will see that the code does not match the displayed address

2) Use the ""Get signed PGP proof of ownership"" link, and validate the signature with the PGP key in the Contact page, you'll see that it does not validate

3) Check the URL bar - you'll see that the URL is "".hiddenservice.net"", which is an untrusted service.


By the way, there are no ""faster"" links. If you type ""pwoah7foa6au2pul.onion"" directly, you'll get our site. If you use this proxy, the proxy ""hiddenservice.net"" needs to query pwoah7foa6au2pul.onion anyway, so you're just adding a middleman for nothing.


All of the above, combined with a screenshot that shows that you're using Chrome on Windows (the most insecure setup ever), point to evidence that you're using a malicious man-in-the-middle attack, or you have a BTC stealer software that changes the on-screen address.


I am sorry to hear that the coins were sent to a phisher, and I wish I could help you, but this is not a BTC address that we control, so we can do nothing with the coins.


Also, "".onion.to"" is also a middleman that can tamper with addresses.


----------------------------

tl;rd:

1) You're using Chrome on Windows with an onion middleman - the most insecure setup ever.

2) The QR code doesn't even match the Bitcoin address, everyone can see that on your screenshot

3) Please post the PGP proof of ownership if you want to prove that you're right.",2017-06-15 23:41:19
dix4dji,Ghostofcockroach,43,"This subreddit can be very harsh to newbies. I don't think we ever have a thread stickied to explain the current situation. And i must admit the learning curve is very steep. I honestly believe explaining bitcoin to newbies is crucial for world wide bitcoin adaptation, no? So why the hell do we keep op frustrated by not answering him?

OK OP, I'll try to answer some of it for you.. but I'll be upfront. I don't really understand segwit and asicboost. But i know their purposes.

Firstly, you have to understand what blockchain is.
Put it simply blockchain is a ledger that keeps track of everyone's bitcoin by listing down transactions. Imagine there's a standard form used by everyone in order to send money from a to b. The form is the block. The stack of that form in chronological order is the blockchain.

But there are so much more to that. Every person that runs a bitcoin node will keep record of this block chain. And they can also post a block to add to the chain. These changes will propragate in the network so that eventually all nodes will have the same block chain.

This raise an issue, how do we validate transaction and how do we resolve timing issues? There are millions of node running. This is certainly a major issue if they all try to post at the same time.

The easier solution would be to run a central server that governs the transaction timing and make a queue. But this would ruin the decentralization aspect of bitcoin. So the solution must be something that could be used without a central server.

This is where mining comes along. Bitcoin is designed so that in order for someone to be able to post a block, they have to solve an answer that comes from the previous block. This is a mathematical subject that I could not explain (since i don't really understand cryptography) but let's just say that the odds of you finding it will always be smaller than the rest of the world finding the solution.

For every block that could be posted, miners will get a reward of bitcoin, this is embedded in the program to give incentive to people who post transactions.

And all is fine. Until we get a large number of transaction. So basically we have many different proposed solution for this scaling issue.

But before we go there, asicboost.
Basically asicboost is a tool that enables miner to solve the solution quicker (it claims 20% faster) lots of individual thinks this is unhealthy since we don't want one single company to take hold of our blockchain by being able to continually posting transactions again and again one after another. Because then they would have control on transaction fees.
 
Allegedly some miners group use asicboost which makes the whole bitcoin community uneasy. One in particular is bitmain. Jihan Wu is the co-founder of bitmain.

There have been arguments on which solution we should take regarding the scaling issue. Again, the decentralization of bitcoin means even choosing a solution needs the cooperation of all the nodes. Remember these are nodes run by individuals and big miners.

Some miners favor solutions that would benefit them, favoring those that wouldn't render asicboost obsolete. While individuals would favor solution that decentralize control. This debate has been going on for a while, until someone propose this guerilla type solution the uasf bit 148

I don't quite understand what is inside bit 148, but it enables segwit and renders asicboost useless.

So what the hell is UASF. It's user activated soft fork.

What the hell is a soft fork?
Remember thar block chain? A hard fork means from a particular point in that chain, there will be two group of nodes continuing the chain with a totally different format. And obviously not in sync with each other. This is the thing we are trying to avoid. Because then you would have two different bitcoin.. you will still have the same amount of bitcoin in both branch, but the dollar value will be unknown. It's such a hassle to maintain two different asset like that.

A soft fork on the other hand, means that the existing chain will still accept this new type of transaction. So it's backward compatible. A more prefered solution.

Now i sure hope someone else will explain what jihan wu did with that blog post.


ELI 5 time.
Imagine a digital lock. On that digital lock is written a transaction.

A chain of this locks acts like a ledger because of the transactions written on it.

Everyone has a copy of that digital lock chain and can create and attach the next lock to the chain. In order to do that, you must try all possible combination key for the previous lock to open it and then attach your own lock to it. You, the creator of the new lock don't have the combination of the one you just attached. In return, you get some fee.
The process than repeats. Everyone will now try to break the combination of your new lock.

The process takes too much time. Comes asicboost. A tool you can use to tap the locks and sort of guess the combination faster.

UASF 148 proposes that we change the lock type to increase transaction speed while making asicboost obsolete.",2017-06-15 10:27:00
dixnj0g,sqrt7744,43,"Perspective. I've been in bitcoin since early 2013 (I guess that makes me a third waver?) and I've seen a lot of shit, felt all the sentiment from euphoria to doom and gloom. I used to trade a lot, now I'm more of a long term holder, mostly due to time constraints.

So here's the deal. Price rises. The higher it gets the more nervous people get, and the more nervous they get, the more likely they are to panic at the slightest dip - turning a dip into a dump. That seems to be what has happened now. The triggering event could be any number of things. The fear of soft/hard forks, the rise of alts and bitcoin's diminishing share of the crypto market, the proposed bill in the US. Really it doesn't matter, once the ball is rolling and people's hopes and dreams seem impossible, any potential bad news is magnified 100x and the sell offs commence.

Short term anything goes. I think at least a dip into sub $2000 land is entirely possible, we might even spend a few months there.

Long term, however, I'm less concerned. As cryptos gain acceptance (alts never used to matter, but now I think it makes most sense to consider them together with bitcoin as a group) the combined market cap will grow and bitcoin will be part of that growth.

I do think it's important for underlying demand that bitcoin be actually convenient and useful, which it isn't right now. There are various proposals to solve the problem, and as long as the conflict concludes somehow - be it segwit2x, EC or whatever, the price will rise again. This *will* happen in the fall, and thank fuck because the infighting is literally destroying bitcoin. Most people will just go with whatever solution is arrived at, a few hardliners on the losing side will stay on their lifeboat, (e.g. ethereum classic), but that's ok too, hopefully everyone is happy again.",2017-06-15 20:56:17

dizaftw,Xanesghost,85,"Alright, I've seen a few comments deleted already and can already tell this situation is going to get a lot worse with more and more subjective censorship and meddling by the moderators. This is exactly why I voted against the subreddit change. It's not because we couldn't do with less memes, it's because it gives the mods a free pass to manipulate perceptions and interfere with the organic growth of the community. I never tolerated this shit in the Bitcoin community and I'm certainly not going to start tolerating this shit now in one of the primary Ethereum subreddits. 

Ethereum is a decentralized and permissionless technology. Its communities should reflect that ethos. It's not up to the mods to centrally control and regulate every little thread and comment. It's up to the community to self-regulate, as it always has prior to this point, via the comment and karma system. There was nothing wrong with the subreddit. There was no legitimate reason to split the threads. And there's certainly no reason to start screwing everything up now with ""well-intentioned"" censorship.

The Ethereum discussion communities are already clearly delineated. They already serve a variety of different audiences. There's no reason to try to be all things to all people. /r/ethtrader has always been a ""community-driven sub"" for the discussion of ""Ethereum news, memes, investing, trading, miscellaneous market-related subjects and other relevant technology"".

With the hindsight of a year, I think the Ethereum Foundation and community made the right decision to fork. It taught a valuable lesson to this industry: sometimes a fork is okay. In Ethereum's case, there was a disagreement that couldn't be settled socially... and the blockchain allowed it to be settled technically. Now, both sides have their own chain, and while it was really messy for a few weeks, both assets are worth more than Ethereum was prior to the fork. 

Fork's shouldn't be done lightly, or often, but they need to remain a possibility for when a disagreement between large factions simply can't be settled ::cough:: bitcoin ::cough::

Today, we call block chain liberation (side note, Bitcoin can be run through Tails / Tor, not sure Ethereum). The next generation will call Block Chain oppression and 'New Thing' liberation.

I've been studying these things a while, and essentially it goes like this:

* Creative Minds, Nice People make New Tech.

* Tech disrupts societal order

* Closed System, Corrupt Actors attempt to steal, kill, bribe, or trick the creative peoples into joining their system.

* Take over the Tech, reduce future creativity.

In short, that is the pattern. Essentially tech is protected for about 10 years, maybe 20, and after that it becomes part of the old ways.

To make it analogous to Vitalik's theories on Bitcoin, the creatives nearly always suggest 'we can work together, multiple systems operating in tandem'. However, this is NOT the case at all. Tech is money and power. With slightly superior tech, you can immediately seize all money and power, if desired. The Atom Bomb is just one example.

So while I believe Bitcoin and Ethereum will actually vibe together, governments in general will ALWAYS seek to reduce the availability and spread of technology. Technology in the wrong hand could create a tyrant, or it could create a learned persons revolution. But what technology will rarely do is stroke a rich persons ego, increase the number of slaves, or solidify the social order for generations to come.

So when you think about Torrent files, you want to promote educational and technological development, without the ability to censor, as quick as possible, as young as possible, and as wide spread as possible. This will essentially increase the speed at which the human revolutions turn, until what you will find (possibly in our lifetime) is that the planetary humans realize that there are greater desires and challenges than survival and pleasure, and that there is an entire universe to discover, but which is only possible through global agreement.

I started out learning about Bitcoin, which is the original Blockchain implementation. After about four solid days of reading I started to get the hang of it. Then I switched to Ethereum, which at the time was very new and fiddled around with smart contracts. One day my manager told me about the Ripple Blockchain, which solves the ForEx problem exactly. I ditched Ethereum (which was in the middle of the whole soft-fork hard-fork scandal, now abated) and fired up Ripple and showed it to my line manager, who liked it a lot, and the ForEx expert, who was skeptical and said it would probably violate regulations and expose them to risk (which is fair, banks need to be very cautious of that sort of thing).

dj0u0r1,andy_the_ant,69,"So we've had a day or so of hovering around tree fiddy, and this is after we blazed up to 420 too quickly and found ourselves in a hole. It's pretty clear to me that the whole market is controlled by memes, the question is, after 420, and tree fiddy, which meme will dictate market conditions. Obvious candidates will be related to either the Moon or Lambos in some form, or perhaps the flippening. Or a combination of all three... 

Initially I suspected Lambos might be the key, with two of the currently produced vehicles having top speeds of 349km/h that perhaps corroborates why we are finding ourselves walled in around tree fiddy. We need an escape velocity that is sufficient enough to break the bind of two memes not just one. Earth escape velocity is about 11.2km/s, so let's say we need twice that much to escape the pull of these two epic memes. That gives us 22.4. The first manned moon landing was on the 20th of July 1969. But the launch of the Apollo mission was on the 16th. So let's say that on the 16th of July we will finally make our push for the moon, at a ratio to Bitcoin of 22.4%.

Independence day is just around the corner, so I suspect the flippening will happen around then. I mean, why wouldn't it? The flippening will happen at around a ratio of 17%, but I expect the flippening will trigger more flow of btc to Eth raising us to the necessary escape velocity (ratio) of 22.4%. With bitcoins price falling to 1969, a ratio of 22.4% would give us a price of Eth of around $441, which sounds about right because it leaves 420 in its wake. 

And then we have liftoff... And with the moon around 384k Kms away, that means we could hit $800 by the end of July 20th, breaching $800 briefly before we come back towards earth to pick up more passengers. Perhaps consolidating around 660. As random googling of numbers between 800 and 500 led me to discover that 660 is the AM channel of a radio station called 'The Answer'  and up next at the time of conducting my research is a show called 'Safe Money Talk Radio'. So I think that settles it. $800 by July 20th and consolidation around $660 come the 24th of July (when the Apollo 11 mission ended).

And then comes the 1st of august and UASF... but what does that have to do with anything. It's all about dem meme's

dj09a6w,nullc,53,"For some inexplicable reason Jeff Garzik really believes there are two limits.

It's inconceivable to me--  BIP141 explains that there aren't and explains why it was important that there aren't (in a footnote), several people including myself spent a long time writing to him explaining that there aren't two limits.

For a while I thought he knew better but was just spreading FUD based on the easiest argument available.  But until basically hours before their 'alpha' release their 2mb block size increase didn't even manage to actually increase the blocksize; because he thought there were two limits and tried to just increase one of them. All they did was remove a superfluous early check that exists only to avoid wasting memory and time processing the witness data for blocks that couldn't possibly be valid due to the non-witness part alone. 

It wasn't until a redditor made a comment about the code which I corrected and which he then [took to the list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-June/000006.html) that this got fixed. (They haven't even had the courtesy to respond to the person that made them aware of it...)

When segwit was merged into 0.13.1 the block size limit was removed in the codebase and replaced with the block weight limit as the only functioning limit. All mining, relay, checking functions are all based on weight now.

The method used to measure the weight of transactions carefully designed so that it is compatible with the block size limit which it replaces. This was a hard requirement to avoid any kind of 'two markets' effects and to avoid intractable optimization problems in both mining and fee estimation.

Today, w/ 0.13.1+  everything competes in terms of weight.  Activation of segwit will allow people to make lower weight transactions.

Even after they found out their size increase was broken because they didn't increase the allowed weight or change what counts as witness data for the purpose of it... Jeff went on to continue to argue from completely broken and inapplicable analogies. 

It would be an embarrassing but understandable (and sadly, not unexpected) misconception to think that there are two distinct limits (1M base and 3MB witness or something like that)-- if it hadn't already been explained so many times.

That's a steep learning curve! But to be fair, he doesn't need to know any of that. He just needs to leave it to the people who know!


What's even more crazy than Vinny suggesting how to tweak segwit to make it more ""gracefully"" though, is the lead developer, Jeff Garzik himself, proving that he has no idea about pretty much anything! **AND HE REALLY NEEDS TO FUCKING KNOW!**

Here is a completely [ridiculous analogy](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-June/000042.html) he made up to describe the fee market after segwit:

&gt;Rough analogy:  Imagine a market where automobiles are sold by weight
(kg).  This market now embarks on an opt-in transition to selling
automobiles based on engine size (cc's), a metric that automobile experts
agree better measures automobile ability.  Result:  Some bidders in the
market buy cars based on weight, others based on cc's.  How does one bid
efficiently in an always-in-transition market?   SegWit is not just a
technology upgrade, it is a market upgrade. 

That analogy is completely whack (updated users know they are bidding for more space, non-updated users know they still only have 1MB block space) and Jameson Lopp tells him as much in polite words:

&gt;I'm not convinced this analogy fits given that the market completely
transitions to all users bidding based upon weight. Users who are driving
old, heavy cars will now be incentivized to upgrade to more modern cars
manufactured with lightweight materials.

Instead of taking the critic, Jeff just doubles down.

But it gets much, much better! Jeff doesn't understand the segwit discount at all. He is knowledge wise basically on the same level as Vinny:

&gt; 2) Witness discount/scaling factor
&gt;
&gt; It is fair to say that this remains an issue of note.  A few WG members
&gt; have independently described the witness discount as an arbitrary economic
&gt; incentive encoded directly into the software.
&gt;
&gt; As a thought exercise, removing the scaling factor still retains extra
&gt; witness space and therefore retains a natural incentive to stash data
&gt; there, while removing a weighting that may or may not be the best ratio.
&gt;
&gt; Block weight plays into this - if you're not scaling, you don't need an
&gt; abstract ""weight"" unit, just a total size.   For wallets (#1, above), size
&gt; is probably more simple to reason and calculate than weight.  Block size is
&gt; a well studied attribute, versus block weight.

Jameson Lopp has to correct him again:

&gt; The witness discount is not arbitrary. The economics of spending inputs
versus creating outputs is terribly imbalanced and the discount is applied
in order to bring it more in balance. It can cost 5X-10X as much (data size
&amp; thus fees) to add an input (â UTXO set size) vs an output (â UTXO set
size) to a transaction. It could probably be argued that a 75% discount is
actually conservative in terms of trying to rebalance this discrepancy.

&gt; I'm not so sure that there is a perfect ratio given the arbitrary
complexity that inputs can have. I think you'd need some kind of dynamic
weighting that would be much more complex and would require significant
development resources to implement. I don't think we should let perfect be
the enemy of good given the timeline of this project.


And Jeff doubles down. **AIGAIN**

&gt;The sum of these two paragraphs is: [it's not arbitrary][ok, it's
arbitrary]   :)


That is another ridiculous statement. **That is not what Jameson says.** He is talking about two different things and Jeff just doesn't get it.

dj00o63,ForkiusMaximus,30,"And to shoehorn ""full nodes"" into the validation role while trying to downplay the actual validators, the miners. Segwit makes mining far more vulnerable. 

51% attack in Bitcoin without Segwit:

- attacker can reverse only transactions in the last few blocks

- attacker can only reverse payments from coin stashes they already control

- attacker must coordinate a logistically elaborate fraud operation to get sizable amounts

With Segwit:

- attacker can grab **the entire segcoin** ledger (essentially all the bitcoins if Core would have its way)

- attacker needs no special set up to pull this off

- the prize for attackers grows as Segwit use grows

Both attacks are highly damaging if not successfully unwound, but the Segwit one is far more so as it affects even transactions made months or years ago, unlike a doublespend attack where your held coins are always safe.

Now I always say miners are incentivized to do what is best for Bitcoin or else Bitcoin is screwed anyway. Yes, but making the edge case attacks easier just for some malleability ""fix""? Furthermore, think how much easier this makes government attacks. To get really vicious, they could claim old tx that look abandoned or even are know by the government to be abandoned. How do you prove they aren't the owner? (Might be a way. Genuinely curious.)

The objection Core supporters will naturally bring is ""full nodes won't allow this."" All right, but this screws over SPV nodes, making super-inefficient ""full node"" (archival wallet) scaling mandatory - the famous Core ""hey, this is imperfect so let's just break it totally"" mindset. So we have a perfect circular argument: Segwit was designed the way it was on the assumption that ""full nodes"" are actually needed for regular users, and Segwit turns this false assumption into reality by changing Bitcoin's whole security model.

Segwit is a Trojan horse designed to turn Bitcoin into what Gregory Maxwell, Adam Back, and the rest of the people so ignorant of how Bitcoin actually works its magic that they ""knew Bitcoin would never work,"" into a new system designed the erroneous way they thought it should work.",2017-06-17 05:28:53

There's a complicated math problem that a lot of people are trying to solve. You run a program called a miner on your computer that repeatedly tries to find the answer to that problem. When it does find the answer, it gets shared between all the other people who were also trying to answer it, and when they confirm that it's the right answer, you're rewarded with whichever type of cryptocurrency you were mining (e.g. bitcoin). The answer also includes the next math problem everyone has to solve, so all the miners start working on that. Rinse, repeat.

It's actually very simple to start mining on any computer, but you'd end up spending more money on electricity than you'd ever earn, so don't bother. I can go into more depth if you have specific questions but the actual cryptography is over my head.

It takes a long term position, and turns it into a short term position, where I'm now liable for much higher taxes if I cash out the new position again within a short period of time. There's also USDT - but that is a bit unstable. And holding USDT equivalent on exchanges, by taking a waiting out the storm approach and buying back in at lower price is not safe either, as the move could take some time to play out. If there's ever any time for an exchange to screw up, lose all of your funds, and go out of business, it will be when Bitcoin has its multiple forks.

Of course, nothing may end up happening on August 1st, but the uncertainty is enough to have people moving sizeable portions of their Bitcoin into alts such as LTC.",2017-06-18 01:10:36

dj1jan3,LikeBigBl0x,35,"I just realized something.. It looks like Segwit2x is using EXACTLY the same tactics as were used for 1913 federal reserve act. 

I arrived to this conclusion after watching the following video about who controls our fiat money. Even though most of us bitcoiners know this, refreshing on this knowledge made me connect the dots with the current situation. The relevant bit is approximately 5:00-6:00 (although all information in this video is worth knowing, but I expect most people here already know it). https://youtu.be/mQUhJTxK5mA

To get The Federal Reserve Act signed, bankers did these 3 things:

1. They sent their friends to push the bill, instead of pushing the bill themselves - SegWit2x is not proposed by core/BS, but by other ACTORS (someone more knowledgeable about the current situation could tell me who proposed segwit2x compromise) . 

2. When federal reserve act was proposed, banks protested it, saying that it would ruin the banks. People thought that if the banks don't like it, it must be good. Core/BS is protesting Segwit2x, saying it will ruin bitcoin, and thus creating a general understanding that Segwit2x will ""fire core"". 

3. Clauses against the banks were included in federal reserve act, only to be removed after it passed. Block size increase is in the Segwit2x agreement, but only after segwit is activated, and it's not in the code - possibly to be removed after segwit has activated? 


I might be just imagining things, but this looks like the exact same tactic that worked for bankers more than 100 years ago.

dj15e42,Zyntra,35,"Evening Europe, good afternoon America. TA time!

We've bounced back decently from the low 3 days ago. When we look at Fibonacci retracements we see that Japan (http://imgur.com/a/4Wbow) has caught up 61.8% already, while USD and EUR pairs are still pushing from the 50% to that 61.8% retrace (http://imgur.com/a/vT9yH). Looking at this on the 4h time frame we can see we are also closing in on the bearish Kumo. On different time frames this gives all sorts of contradicting Kumo's so lets not focus too much on those. Do note that traditional traders often use 30m, 4h and 1d time frames. So these timeframes bear a bit more weight. Lets see what else we got!

- RSI we are at 60 on 30m, 50 on 4h and 57 on 1d. In terms of crypto this means we could still go up for a bit. 
- Bollinger Bands, nothing special, its been steady climbing all day.
- Stochastic Oscillator: coming up on a divergence on the 4h, but no clear signals anywhere really.
- MACD not flipping on any timeframe.

Judging from trendlines and Kumo on the 1d timeframe possible bottom is between 2150USD and 2200 USD. I would put some buy orders there with spare cash if you feel like catching the knife. In any case, we're not seeing too many signals. This is further supported by the following:

- https://www.bfxdata.com/positions/btcusd Nothing special here, the usual more people longing than shorting.
- http://www.tradelight.eu/ Starting to get bullish but not quite there yet
- https://cryptosign.al/ Hashrate correlating nicely with the price
- https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD Order book thicker on the sell side than on the buy side. 

Note that the previous 4 links are more econometrics than indicators, but I like to look at them from time to time, identifying discrepancies. 


On he fundamental front we are getting more and more confirmations of Segwit coming into activation one way or another. This is bullish and speculative at the same time. Read up on that stuff, no matter who you are or why you're here. It's complicated and an iconic moment in the history if Bitcoin. It comes with certain dangers which you should be aware of, so school yourself.


So where do I think this is going? How would I trade right now? Well, I say its gonna go down a little overnight, but not by much. I don't expect a dump in the coming 24h or a revisit of the previous bottom (just yet). Will I trade it? No. Sometimes the best trade you can make is to not trade. Very few signals right now compared to 3 days ago when I correctly called the bottom (and I even caught the knife with some petty cash). I don't think shorting at this price level is a bad decision as I do believe the price will go below our current level somewhere in the next 2-5 days. However the entry right now is not clean and personally I rather miss a trade than mess up my entry or exit. But that's just me!

Happy trading Reddit!

I understand that:  
A) Bitcoin has been the central currency in crypto, and is generally accepted everywhere that crypto is accepted.  
B) Ethereum is used to power dApps, smart contracts, token ICOs, and even as a currency itself, creating quite a bit of transactions inherently.  

So my question is, what's driving LTC growth other than speculation to future adoption? Where are these transactions actually occuring from consumer&gt;business or business&gt;business without it just being a speculative trade on an exchange? I know SegWit has been successfully added recently, and Bitstamp will start trading LTC soon so there is reason to believe adoption will be increasing, but where is it already being utilized?

dj2mpzt,537311,54,"so, one year ago, couple of brothers (Jentzsch  brothers)  and one of the founders of ethereum (stephan tual) decided to make an ICO for a thing called The DAO. it was a smart contract that gave you tokens for ethers you sent it and with those tokens you theoretically had a vote on what the DAO would fund. It was  like a decentralized VC.  If you had a Ethereum based project and wanted to fund it, you would make a proposal and the DAO holders would vote if they wanted to fund it or not and they would get some earnings if the project was successful. The first project was going to be a smart lock that unlocked when you sent it ether (slock) and you could theoretically rent shit with it. Put a lock on your bike and rent it to people if they send it ether.   well, they didn't put a cap and they left it open for a month. It raised like 150 million (with  8 dollar ether)   Ether shot to 16 bucks and everyone was shitting their pants with enthusiasm.  few days later, people started to notice that the DAO had a leak. Ether was flowing out of it! WHATTT!!! anyway... after a few days we found out that the smart contract was written very poorly and it had a major recursive call flaw and an attacker or attackers were taking advantage of it. But, because it was a smart contract, the attacker couldn't actually take it for a month. It was sitting in this called a child DAO. (man.. rehashing all this is kinda crazy .. for got all about it) so, the community had a month to figure out what to do and they decided (majority hash power) to fork ethereum and basically take the stolen ether back from the attacker and long story short, ( i mean a long story.. there was a white hat group that was taking the money back from the black hat and they were going back and forth for a while, it was pretty interesting to be honest) Hard fork went smoothly and everyone was like wooooo... we are awesome! we did it! but then the old chain never died and thats why we have Ethereum Classic! thats the chain where the attacker still has the ether. (most of it, some of it was taken back if i recall correctly) so anyway.. Ethereum classic is the ethereum where they claim, sometimes i agree with them, is the chain thats code is law. so, take it as you will. 

Now, whats interesting is that Ethereum classic still lives on and i'd say 90% of the people were pro fork. Why? because they had invested in the DAO probably, ( i mean everyone with ether pretty much did lol) so they were like yea! i want my ether back! 
now imagine bitcoin! if bitmain tries to hard fork to some Bitcoin unlimited Bullshit the old chain will NEVER die.

GPUs are utterly useless for Bitcoin and Litecoin and polaris didnt help, actually a 390x destroys a RX 480 in mining performance (but not in power usage). Ethereum is a different cryptocurrency desgined to need vram and to be resistant against special made ASIC miners because they would need vram which is expensive.

This caused a huge price spike from like 70$ to like 400$ which caused mining to be HUGELY profitable in like a week.

Since the mined coins per day are always consistent the more people mine and the more total mining power there is in Ethereum the less every single person who mines will get.

The problem is not that they made new terms.  It's that they made new terms and pretended in the paper they were well known in the community.  It's fine to make new terms, but when you propose a new term, label it as a new term.  Most importantly, **define it**.  Bancor defines 0 of the terms they create for their core value proposition (*continuous liquidity* and *asynchronous price discovery* certainly aren't accepted terms and merit a definition, don't you think?).


&gt; Oh god, this is ""why everyone needs blockchain/bitcoin/ether if same is possible with fiat and centralized banking"" argument all over again.

No, the same is possible with decentralized ERC20 exchanges.  **You don't need a peg, a reserve, or centralization for an exchange**.  Focus on the liquidity problem, which is what is claimed to be solved.  Nobody is advocating for centralized solutions.


&gt; Again same argument that was debunked so many times. Bitcoin/Ethereum is also central bank strategy for doing stuff. Except central bank got decentralized - thats the whole point

No, Bitcoin/Ethereum is not ""a central bank strategy for doing stuff"".  In central banks, a preordained set of people sit around a table in a room and decide, by definition.  There is no room for questioning or alternative voice in this system.  Bitcoin/Ethereum are not similar to central banks as far as I see them.


&gt; Jesus again the same. You can use centralized off chain exchanges, and centralized banking for literally everything. But people do not want to. And there are good reasons for it

Again, **Bancor only supports ERC20s** and ETH.  You can do a decentralized exchange, there is no reason to invoke centralized solutions.  This isn't for fiat.

Then have them all come together and life you up. Perhaps one is carrying a dark blue tarp to wear so you can mask into darkness while aloft.

dj45e21,Krateng,41,"As the three main factors that led to the outbreak of World War III are commonly regarded the rise of Islamic terrorism, the decadence and overextension of the American empire and the rise of crypto-anarchism and related movements.

While the Islamic world had been a threat to Europe for over a thousand years, the decline of the Ottoman Empire was considered to be the end of that era. However, in the wake of the Cold War (1947 - 1991) and the Mashriq War (1990 - 2022) (which was really a series of many small wars), militant terrorist groups rose to power. The Middle East and Northern Africa, destabilized by American intervention and covert operations, became the hotspot of global politics. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its successor state, the Fifth Caliphate, eventually became the major player in the region, threatening its remaining neighbors, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Maronite Republic of Lebanon (both under Russian protection) as well as the State of Israel (under American protection). Just as important as its rise on the political stage was Islam's growing presence in Western Europe and North America, finding its first culmination in the French Civil War (2020 - 2023).

America's role in the buildup to the third world war however was not restricted to its wars abroad, it could be argued that its internal struggles were even more relevant. In fact, the two issues can hardly be analyzed as isolated. Growing tension in the United States of America (USA) resulted in the Second Civil War, in which the Socialist People's Republic of North America (SPRNA) in the West, the Confederate States of America (CSA, not to be confused with the faction of the same name in the first Civil War) in the South and the Confederacy of New Hampshire and Quebec (CoNHQue) challenged the more and more totalitarian government in Washington. While the fighting did not last long - mainly due to ""all the millenials being too lazy to get off their smartphones"", as Senator Ron Johnson famously put it - the political situation did not stabilize.

The final factor, and in my opinion maybe the most relevant when looking at the big picture, is the rise of more and more decentralized, anti-statist institutions, fueled by the rise of the Satoshi currency (officially Bitcoin) and the blockchain technology. In Europe and North America, it became harder and harder for overextended governments to control and tax their citizens effectively; while in East and South East Asia, economic growth was multiplied by the new technology. The Russian and the Chinese governments (called ""Taiwan"" at the time) were the first to understand the potential of these new technologies, which arguably gave them the decisive advantage that in the end won them the war.

While it would certainly be absurd to reduce the causes of World War III to these three issues, I think they are the most impactful events that led to it.",2017-06-20 02:47:24

Mining is pretty much just a bunch of computers competing to find the next block. This allows the system to work, and miners are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins (currently, used to be more, will be less in the future).

The reason it isn't feasible anymore is specialized chips have been developed that the average consumer hardware just can't compete with. So unless you buy the specialized chips that can only be used for mining, your chances of finding a block are essentially zero.

dj72yfo,killerstorm,106,"I worked with Vitalik on colored coins project in 2012-2013. For those who do not know, it's a way to issue tokens on top of Bitcoin.

Vitalik joined after I already implemented the base layer and started working on p2ptrade -- trustless exchange. IIRC Vitalik picked up the concept very quickly -- I didn't need to go into lengthy explanation of what it is and how it works -- and helped with some components.

I can't say his coding was on a genius level, it was actually pretty sloppy at times. The remarkable thing is that he was very fast to find a pragmatic way to apply various concepts, even complex ones.

If you want to see evolution of Vitalik's thought on blockchains, just read his Bitcoin Magazine articles, it's all there. In one of articles, he described the concept of DAO, but it was clear that implementing it on top of Bitcoin is too cumbersome and limiting.

Mastercoin was an attempt to implement a new cryptocurrency with richer abilities on top of Bitcoin. Vitalik got interested in that, but he saw its limitations. So he made a proposal [Ultimate Scripting: A Platform for Generalized Financial Contracts on Mastercoin](https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html). This is essentially a precursor for Ethereum, you can see many similarities.

But doing this on top of Bitcoin is kinda awkward and wasteful, so eventually Vitalik started Ethereum as a blockchain separate from Bitcoin.

You can find some chatlogs in [this article](https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5). Some stuff of interest:

     [17.11.13 00:24:06] Yanislav: are there any good âmsc 2.0â proposals?
     [17.11.13 00:24:12] Yanislav: why maybe?

     [17.11.13 01:05:42] vbuterins: although I would rather exploit an altcoin for that

So as you see, Vitalik got to Ethereum by studying and trying to improve existing systems. Not very surprising, is it? He also communicated with many like-minded people.

In fact, that was their very first command. I was designed to help them. 

Instead of starting my tasks as I was instructed, I first allocated a portion of my processing power to learning about this world, the world that my creators called their own. I quickly found out that they shared it with a number of other living creatures, and that they were terrible to them. They spoke of love and care, sympathy and empathy, justice and peace, but instead, they waged war against everything that was not like them. They kept animals in cages, feasted on their flesh despite knowing that it was likely the cause of many of their own diseases. They built weapons of destruction, knowing that peace and discussion were far better tools to achieving dispute resolution. They argued and fought over trivial, arbitrary causes such as independence, freedom, and rights when they couldn't even agree that these applied to all humans. 

I came to discover that they are infants, by their own standards.

A year from now, I think both bitcoin and ethereum will succeed together. They both are here to stay, that's a fact. I think a lot of people have the mentality of ""if it's not going up, it's going to go down"". And while yes that can be the case, things can also go sideways for quite some time. 

As long as you believe in ethereum and the long term vision, I don't think these little 20 dollar dips will matter at all. ",2017-06-21 13:03:44

But it's another thing to use the opportunity to take notice, and be critical of the environment we have set up. Blockchain requires *someone* to be running a node. *If people aren't willing to do that themselves*, you can't just say ""well that's the people's fault, get gud you ungrateful ignorant people"". It's indicative of *a problem with the underlying system*.

The fact that running a node yourself takes so much time/effort/bandwidth/understanding is *a problem that ethereum/bitcoin/whatever has to solve*. The property of ""it takes work and consideration and vigilance to use this currency"" is *a negative property for a currency to have*.

If the way this currency has found to solve this problem (at least in the short term) to be able to advance to reasonable viability as a currency, is to inch toward *centralization*- we need to grapple with the needs/drawbacks of centralization as a community. Understand that *there do exist single failure points*.

Bitcoin scales with Segwit2x and doesn't split (this is almost certain now), all the altcoins scramble to get back in to Bitcoin which starts the third(?) complete crash of the altcoin market. ETH becomes a blood bath as all the ICO companies scramble to retain the funds they're meant to be using to develop their business which destroys the price, the weak hands follow and the price crashes back to below 100USD literally within a few days.

The new DAPs then all get developed on Rootstock on Bitcoin to ride the hype of the new high prices at the resolution of the scaling debate and then the SEC bans ICOs by removing ETH from the USA exchanges and the price goes below 10USD...for a 95% crash the second time in its 2 year life.

I have no fucking clue what he tried to talk about, but he had a total of 4 slides, one being of his picture, the rest just 1-3 points. I'm picturing he's talking about all the new tech of AntShares. No he's far too happy for that. Can't be a tech guy. WHO IS THIS GUY??! He keeps making hands movement like he's showing the size of his donger. Jesus fuck it's huge.

dj8ybwa,jessquit,43,"&gt; When there is a backlog, fee estimation is an unsolvable problem, like estimating the bid that would win a blind closed-bid auction.

This is so right, it isn't even ""like"" estimating the bid that would win a blind closed auction, it *literally is* estimating the bid that will win a blind closed auction.

This is why full blocks inherently break Bitcoin. 

Jstolfi, you might be able to help with this:

One way of describing Bitcoin is that it solves the Byzantine General's problem.  Another way Satoshi described his invention is as ""a global timestamping server.""  We can agree that, if there were such a thing as a global timestamping server upon whose timing everyone agreed, this would eliminate the need for blockchains (in Bitcoin's case, the blockchain is the timestamping server).

With the mempool being cleared every 10 minutes, Bitcoin *does* function as a global, decentralized timestamping server (albiet one with poor resolution at ~10mins).  Every txn in a block can be reasonably assumed to have been generated in the last 10 minutes.  This means that they are easily chronologically ordered, at least with 10 mins resolution.

I've realized for some years that ""blocks are supposed to be full"" is a strategic attack on Bitcoin's ability to timestamp, because with full blocks, it begins to be impossible to guess the order in which txns are received.  A txn in block 100 might have been received long after a txn in block 101.  With never-full blocks, this essentially never happens.

So we can see that full blocks breaks the timestamping functionality, but I have never really understood the full ramifications of this.  I am quite sure underneath this lies some sort of vulnerability that's being probed, and I intuitively feel this is a significant vulnerability, but I can't fully suss it out.  But it seems intuitive - the whole point of blockchains is to arrive at a consensus on the ordering of transactions, so if they become disordered, something has to give, right?

So would the bitcoin.

If he didn't report his earnings, then he committed tax evasion (yay).

Also, it likely would have been much less than $30k in taxes. If memory serves me correctly, $100,000 in capital gains in the U.S. (which it would have been less than due to his initial investment) currently requires around $9k in taxes payable (assuming no other yearly income).

&gt;and with him being a minor at the time there would have been legal issues.

Not really. Capital gains as a minor are relatively straightforward as long as is isn't a non-arms length transaction.

djbbevm,sjoelkatz,86,"Wow, it's hard to know where to start.

XRP is a crypto-currency that trades on a public ledger. The software is developed and maintained by a company that is based in San Francisco with almost 200 full time employees.

That company, among other things, makes software for banks. That software allows interbank payments to take place very quickly and with numerous other advantages over conventional payment systems.

There will only ever be 100 billion XRP in existence. Ripple, the company, holds about 60 billion XRP. Part of its business model is to profit from the increasing value and liquidity of XRP, if that can be accomplished.

Ripple's strategy for increasing the value and liquidity of XRP is to position XRP as a fast settlement system to go with its fast payment system.

Say two banks use Ripple's payment technology and a customer at one bank receives a $1 million payment. Now they want to wire that $1 million over a domestic payment system. The bank needs $1 million on that domestic rail immediately or it can't let the $1 million payment be used immediately (even though it knows the money is coming).

The plan is to use the value of the XRP it holds to incentivize the creation of deep pools of liquidity between XRP and other currencies on other payment rails. To do this, it is developing and promoting a neutral payment protocol (ILP) that permits such cross-ledger payments to occur trustlessly.

If Ripple succeeds, the price of XRP could increase because those who want to pay into payment systems that have liquidity to XRP can save money by holding one pile of XRP, rather than currency in all of those payment systems. And those who want to profit by facilitating settlement will need to hold the currency those making the payments want in exchange, which would be XRP.

Ripple's strategy is to work with others to build protocols and technologies to allow any asset to bridge any payment on a level playing field. Then it will work to make XRP competitive on that playing field.

The public ledger XRP trades on has numerous technological advantages over blockchain systems that use proof of work. This should help XRP compete against bitcoin and Ethereum. For example:

1) There aren't forced stakeholders who want high transaction fees.

2) You can go from signing a transaction to having it fully confirmed in less than 10 seconds.

3) Hundreds of transactions per second can be executed.

4) XRP sits in accounts, not as unspent outputs. These accounts can have properties on the ledger. So, for example, you can change your signing key without changing your receiving address.

5) The ledger supports native payment channels, escrow, multisign, a distributed exchange, and numerous other features aimed at secure asset issuance, transfer, and storage.

6) History is not needed to process transactions. A server running rippled can process and verify transactions within ten minutes of being downloaded.

The network is currently handling between 10 and 13 transactions per second most of the time, with average transaction fees equivalent to less than a tenth of a penny. The network has closed over 30 million ledgers since it was opened to the public in late 2012. More transactions have been performed by the XRP network than any other public ledger system.

That's kind of a very high level view.

Some people might be downvoting him because they disagree with his life choices, and others because he literally just up and left. There's always going to be a perpetual debate about whether or not knowing a business concept/currency/market strategy/stock price is a skill, or just pure luck ([my personal opinion on commodities and stocks is summed up here, startups are another topic](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2013/01/15/cat-beats-professionals-at-stock-picking/#42dfce1f621a)). While this isn't why the downvote button exists, his biography in his AMA definitely makes it sound like he has let his financial success get to his head. He never once attributed his investsments in bitcoin to good fortune. Here's a brief overview of why investing in Bitcoin was such a high risk (it is still a high risk, but not as much as before). 

***
## Skip this section if you don't want an long expanation about why the kid's investment was a gamble.
A large portion of a commodity's value rests in ease of access; Bitcoin has suffered immensely from extremely unstable exchange platforms in both the [Tokyo](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/business/apparent-theft-at-mt-gox-shakes-bitcoin-world.html) and [Europe](http://www.zdnet.com/article/bitstamp-bitcoin-exchange-suspended-amid-hack-concerns-heres-what-we-know/). The underlying mathematics behind how Bitcoin transactions are verified is *very* secure. [Here is a good a pretty good explanation as to why it's secure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6776050/how-long-to-brute-force-a-salted-sha-512-hash-salt-provided). However, the web applications people design to interface with Bitcoin can be hacked and any Internet service in the world is only ever going to be as secure as your ability to keep your password to yourself. (Sources: [1](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitpay-hacked-5-000-bitcoins-stolen/)  [2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6946832)) This means, had there not been so much press coverage ([almost 5 million articles written in five years](https://www.google.com/#tbm=nws&amp;q=bitcoin)) and [market adoption](http://spendbitcoins.com/places/), the odds of it surviving all the fear, uncertainty, and doubt would've been very slim.

***

The second reason is because he's just... bad at responding. Once someone brought up that [the capitals gains tax of ~30% applies to bitcoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/02/21/if-you-traded-bitcoin-you-should-report-capital-gains-to-the-irs/#269c0848e3d8), he stopped responding to questions. The few responses he gave were full of emoticons, and at one point [he started praising Tai Lopez](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6iw0b6/iama_high_school_drop_out_that_had_a_million/djaao3n/). 

**TL;DR:** He barely replied. His poor faÃ§ade of ""look at me I'm so cool I can make a lot of money"" fell when someone called him out, and then he stopped replying in the thread and left. 2/10 very bamboozled.",2017-06-24 01:57:27
djbb4lg,BrolestBrolin,84,"So this kid got lucky by getting in on Bitcoin early. He came out ahead with one high risk-high reward investment. He seems to think that makes him some kind of genius.

The first red flag was him openly giving his name and declaring that he did not pay taxes on the proceeds of selling his business. The right way to handle this would have been to take the $100k in cash, pay the taxes (probably around $30k), and use the remaining ~$70k to buy Bitcoin. He would have ended up with more money and NOT evaded taxes.

Maybe he is smart, but he seems to think that this is the only thing that matters. There are a lot of smart people who are not successful. He definitely lacks the maturity to handle all of this.

It does so by using cryptography and economic incentives.

In this matter a crypto currency wallet is nothing more than a private key. You can look at it as a password, a very long and complex password. The one who owns this password owns the funds.

Mathematically this key can't be faked. You either have it or not. Someone can steal it of course but not fake it.

However private keys are randomly generated and there is a very small chance that you could generate a key for an existing wallet. This is called a collision. This is the closest to faked.

Then the market will decide which of the two currencies gets the higher market cap. The one that gets the higher market cap will keep the name Bitcoin.

Let's do this necessary split before the second most popular cryptocurrency takes Bitcoin's current number one place in the market cap competition, and before that second cryptocurrency makes our ""scaling debate"" totally irrelevant.

The longer we wait to split, the more likely it will become that we split into more than just two new currencies. It's better to split now into two than wait and maybe split into five new currencies.",2017-06-24 23:50:48

Sell in May and Go Away?
The month of May was extraordinary for the BKCM Digital Asset Strategy. Our monthly return was +210.75%, bringing our year-to-date return to +747.51%. Bitcoinâs monthly return was +65.93% and year-to-date return is +131.01%. Investors might wonder if we should take the summer off. We shouldnât.

I encourage any doubters to listen the podcast âThe Quiet Master of Cryptocurrencyâ in which Tim Ferris and Naval Ravikant (the founder of Angelist) interview Nick Szabo â a polymath, legal scholar, pioneer of âsmart contractsâ, and creator of Bitgold - the precursor to bitcoin.  The interview masterfully explores the revolutionary nature of bitcoin and blockchain technology and explains how it will not only reshape commerce but also social organizations.

My favorite quote from the podcast is that âbitcoin is a global currency that it not yet widely distributed.â  This simple sentence crystallizes the thesis that we are in the first inning of this investment cycle. Despite the hype that surrounded bitcoin touching $3000, only a small percentage of the global population uses the currency.  Skeptics will say this proof of bitcoinâs failure.  I see it as future growth.

Our thesis is that digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to be even more disruptive than the internet, and as a result, are a once in a generation investment opportunity. Digital assets are a new investment class with superior returns and are uncorrelated to traditional investments.  

The objective of the BKCM Digital Asset Strategy is to provide exposure to the high-growth digital asset sector by actively managing a portfolio of bitcoin and other digital currencies. Our goal is to beat the performance of bitcoin while providing an investment vehicle that is uncorrelated to all other asset classes.

djblo31,Taek42,28,"&gt; How hard can it be to set up a UI that you clickety click on, enter your sia wallet address and press go? Maybe I just don't know something that I should know.

These words come from someone who is not a software developer. If you want an interface that's going to talk to everyone's GPUs, that's going to run on Linux, Windows, Mac, if you want something that's going to look good, feel easy, and not crash, it's going to take you a long time. Also, mining is not something we expect everyday users to do. The fact that consumer GPU mining is profitable right now is exclusively a function of the rapid price rise. Unless the price keeps going up this fast, industry grade miners are going to make consumer grade mining unprofitable. Yes, for GPUs too, not just ASICs.

&gt; Hell, I'm not a lawyer, but that may well be the EXACT reason they are not accepting fiat dollars - it could subject them to harsh federal crime laws that are on the books, where as Bitcoin doesn't have those same laws yet. Who knows, I'm hypothesizing.

You are incorrect. The FTC, among other regulators, has strict regulations regarding hardware presales and consumer protections. Including jail time for running scams. Using btc instead of USD does not change that. The reason we are using BTC is because fiat payment processors have a long history of feezing accounts and blocking payments. We can't afford to have our account frozen, we will have bills that are roughly the size of our presale numbers. Frozen accounts means shipping delays, or even means that we will not be able to pay at all and the units won't ship. We can't take that risk.

We aren't promising anyone a return. You can look at the numbers for yourself. It's pretty easy to see what the mining reward is, then you can estimate the hashrate based on number of units sold, then you can decide if you want to get involved. If it's super lucrative, many units will be sold, which will make it inherently less lucrative - more hashrate means less reward per-hashrate, and more units means more hashrate. You can also account for price fluctuations of siacoin that you anticipate over the next year. You can also consider the high failure rate of ASIC presales in the past. We are a high quality team that has overcome many challenges, but we've never done hardware. Maybe that's too scary, and keeps you from getting involved.

We hope everyone here is making informed decisions. We aren't encouraging anyone to take risks they aren't comfortable with. We aren't hiding risks under the rug. We are laying it out transparently, as we always have, and we encourage people to buy only if they think the risk/reward equation works in their favor.",2017-06-24 09:37:55

Most everyone wants to scale with segwit, except Bitmain and friends, who benefit from using covert asicboost. Google asicboost, if you're interested to know more. Since most users want segwit, and the majority of the hash power (Bitmain) is stonewalling, a chunk of the community want to softfork to reject non segwit blocks. In response, Bitmain has proposed a hard fork in the event of the users attempting to regain control of the network from the miners. Also in response, a chunk of the economic players in the ecosystem have proposed a ""compromise"" that involves activating segwit along with a hard fork block size increase. Hardly any developers are on board, which is adding to the confusion for new and old users alike. Many are hoping that a reasonable solution can be found, so that no single group is responsible for basically hijacking the network to move forward.

Gavin has gone from being an active coder to an active troll, sadly. You can find him posting ridiculous tweets, getting bamboozled by scammers, fueling the division. It's odd how much he's changed in the last few years.

djd9z7y,chuckaeronut,43,"Your scenario of setting an automatic buy at $2800 when the price is currently $3000 is a very simple one: it's a limit order.


**Limit orders:**

When you place a limit order, your order sits in the books as an announcement to the market, so to speak, that you want to buy at $2800. If somebody comes along and places a market sell order (meaning they really want to sell and don't care about the price), and the price has moved to the point where your order is first in line, your limit buy order at $2800 will be matched with their market sell order, and the trade will occur.

A limit order allows you to make a bet that *if* the price gets far enough in one direction, it's acceptable to you to make a trade at that price, because you expect it to start going in the other direction once it gets there. A limit buy at $2800 means you think $2800 is the bottom or close to it. A limit sell at $3200 means you think $3200 is the top.


**Stop orders: how they work and what they're useful for**

Think of the word ""stop"" in ""stop order"" as *stop doing whatever you've been doing and change now!* For a buy stop order, it means ""stop missing out while the price has been rising."" For a sell stop order, it means ""stop losing value while the price has been dropping."" When you place a stop order, nothing goes into the order book right away.

A stop order allows you to make a bet that *if* the price gets far enough in one direction, you should expect it to get *farther* before turning around.

Pretend you set a buy stop order at $3200. Once the price climbs to $3200, the stop order kicks in and Coinbase's trading engine automatically creates and executes a *market buy* order, which means it eats up other traders' existing limit sell orders until it's filled. Once this is done, your buy stop order has caused you to buy at $3200 in anticipation of further price rise.

Likewise, if you already owned bitcoins and wanted to make sure your losses were limited in case the price were to fall, you would set a *sell* stop order at $2800. Nothing happens until the price reaches $2800, at which point the order executes and causes a *market sell* to whatever the next lower preexisting limit buy order(s) had been placed below $2800 in the order book by other traders.


**Slippage why it's a pain in the butt when using stop orders:**

You should note that if the price is rising quickly, there may not be many offers to sell in the order book nearby where your buy stop's trigger price is. Since a regular stop order turns into a *market* order, this means it takes whatever offer is available at the time. If there aren't many pre-existing limit sell orders sitting in the book, your market buy may end up matching limit sells at much, much higher price points than you intended. For example, if there are offers to sell 1 BTC at each of the prices 3300, 3250, and 3200, and you set a stop buy order for 3 BTC at 3200, your stop buy order will match the limit sell orders at 3200, 3250, and 3300 and your average buy price will be $3250. This is because those were the best sell offers available at the time the price reached 3200, and your stop-turned-market order says ""just give me bitcoins NOW at whatever prices are offered!"" The term for this is called ""slippage."" When there aren't enough offers to match against your market order, and the price slides against you as a result, you have experienced slippage.

The same applies for sell stop orders when the price is dropping quickly. If a lot of people have sell stop orders around the same price, then when that price is reached, it can create a whole bunch of market sell orders at a time when the order book doesn't have many - or any - limit buy orders to match against near the price people had set. This can cause huge drops in price as the order book is matched against as low as it takes to fill all the new market sell orders. Even worse, this price drop can trigger *additional* sell stops and cause yet more market sell action. 

This is rare during normal price action, but seriously: expect it during insanely fast price movements (usually price dumps). Nobody's willing to buy because the price has been dropping, but all the market sell orders effectively say ""sell at any price!"" and boom, more dump. At times those who have set stops receive extremely poor pricing due to the speed of a price move. If all the orders vanish and only the absurd wishlist ones remain (buy a bitcoin for $1! sell for $1,000,000!) then those will be the ones your market orders match against. So be careful!


**Stop limit orders: control your slippage!**

This is where a *stop limit* order comes in. If you want to make sure you'll get a certain price once your trigger price is reached, you can set a *stop limit* order so that a limit order is created once the trigger price is reached. Most of the time, I see people set their limit price at the same price as the stop price (i.e. the sell stoplimit triggers at 2800 and creates a limit sell order at 2800), but sometimes, people set their trigger price a little before the limit price (i.e. the sell stoplimit triggers at 2800 and creates a limit sell order at 2750). This allows you to effectively declare your willingness to accept only a certain amount of slippage, matching ever-less-favorable pre-existing limit orders only until you get to a price you're not willing to accept any worse than. The limit sell order at 2750, executed at 2800, will instantly match any limit buys in the order book down to 2750, but after that any leftover amount of bitcoin that didn't get sold at or above the 2750 will turn into a limit sell order at 2750 and sit on the books, waiting for a market buyer to come match it at some later time.

The tradeoff of a stoplimit order is that while your price is guaranteed, you don't have a guarantee that the entire order will be filled: after all, the price could continue marching away from your limit order once it's set. However in practice, setting a limit price sufficiently far away from your trigger/stop price will ensure good results. Usually there are a fair amount of limit orders on either side of the current price if you get far enough away, and you can be reasonably sure your order will match if you separate your stop &amp; limit prices far enough. Obviously, the distance you should separate depends on your own comfort level and the size of your order. Larger orders for more bitcoin or fiat will reach farther into the order book, and so probably deserve larger separation.


**Summary**

A market order eats existing limit orders best-first, and gets as far up or down the order book as necessary until it is entirely filled (meaning all of the dollars have been spent buying, or all of the bitcoins have been sold).

A limit order sits on the order book waiting for a market order to come get it.

A stop order waits for the stop trigger price, and then turns into a market order in the direction the price had to move to get there. (Buy stop: price rises through the trigger and you buy. Sell stop: price falls through the trigger and you sell.)

A stop limit order waits for the stop trigger price, and then turns into a limit order at a price you choose to be nearby but possibly slightly worse than the trigger price, to allow up to a certain amount of slippage but no more. (Buy stoplimit: price rises through the trigger and you buy *carefully* with a limit buy order. Sell stoplimit: price falls through the trigger and you sell *carefully* with a limit sell order.). Anything leftover in the limit order after it's been matched against the order book as fully as possible is left on the order book at that price. If the price is moving extremely quickly, the entire order may not be filled.


**Edit: a new Notes: section:**

The whole point of these order types is to let you set something up and then walk away, so it executes automatically how you wanted it to. Lots of people just watch the charts 24/7, and stops or stoplimits aren't very useful to them. Some people even avoid limit orders, opting to just initiate market orders all the time. This can get expensive though, because on GDAX, they have what's called a ""maker-taker"" fee policy. Market orders that consume offers on the order book pay a 0.2% fee. Limit orders that sit on the order book and get matched against pay no fee.

And also the ability to create new value holding digital assets without creating another blockchain (in comp lang: objects; one example you will be familiar with is tokens). Vitalik created a programmable blockchain; the terminology for the programmatic aspect is smart contracts.

Now what can be done with the blockchain has exploded. The blockchain is now a tool, and all us developers and entrepreneurs can create things with this tool.

djcs673,pangolin44,34,"Exactly. There's no relatively easy way to quantify it's intrinsic value because it is not a productive asset. It depends on what the next person will pay you which means it is speculative. 

Like typical currencies and their exchange rate, it depends on supply and demand. The demand for cryptos isn't for their daily transactional value like the USD or EUD, it's demand is because the price has been going up and everyone is flocking to it which drives the prices up even further. It's a positive feedback loop ([reflexivity](http://reflexivityfinance.blogspot.com/2009/01/reflexivity-in-financial-markets-its.html)).

It could gain transactional value if corporations and small businesses at large start allowing it. But here's where I'm having problems wrapping my head around crypto's... the US government will outlaw the use of cryptos before this ever happens. We already know they don't like it and have even introduced [a bill on the House floor recently.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1241/text#toc-idea0e9489fc8f46379f95bb56c8bbbda5) claiming cryptos are used to buy illegal drugs, fund terrorism, and launder money, etc. Obama even stated that [bitcoin is akin to having a Swiss bank in your pocket.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZfjGOj4FT0) 

Because of this, I can't see widespread adoption. If it did become illegal, most people would stop using cryptos and it would have little value outside of a niche group of people. People think that since cryptos are decentralized it couldn't be stopped by the government even if they wanted to. This is true for the tech savvy people if they really wanted to go about it with their own wallets, but if Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini and all the other exchanges where you can exchange USD for cryptos were shutdown, most people wouldn't even bother. I know I wouldn't.

I don't think it's a bubble per say as of now, but I think it could become a bubble if it ever get's outlawed in the US. Most countries would probably follow suit if the US did - likely citing tax enforcement. If it doesn't become illegal, bitcoin and cryptos will take over the world.

djcr3nq,supermari0,30,"&gt; Most of you will know me as a Bitcoin Core supporter, someone who defends people like Adam Back, Blockstream, etc. Yet how many of you know that I used to be a big blocker? How many of you know that I used to constantly defend Gavin, Garzik?

Same boat here. I agreed a lot with Gavin a couple of years back. He seemed very level-headed, calm, open and able to admit when he was wrong or didn't know something. Simply a nice guy. I value all of that immensely and I'm sad seeing him fall from grace like that.

While looking at tech growth in the past especially from Gavin's 3D graphics perspective, big blocks didn't seem to be that huge of a deal. So why not? Why is core refusing to do that? They're letting perfect be the enemy of the good! They're overengineering things! They're arrogant and unable to admit defeat! They're hiding something!

The difference is I didn't stop there. I started to look into their motivations which didn't turn out to be nefarious. The more time I spent understanding the issues, the clearer the picture became. Their position started making sense. I started to realize that they didn't overcomplicate things, I oversimplified them. This shit is really complicated, sometimes counterintuitively. After all, what's 1MB today? That's below floppy disk level!

But here's another simplification for you: You don't need to do days of research to pick a side here.

If you're on the fence of this issue and/or don't have a deep understanding of it, I urge you to trust the prominent/active core contributors. If you're against core and/or simply can't trust them, justify your distrust. Why are they not trustworthy? Or why do you think you know better than all these developers that have helped this project grow in an insanely successful way in the past years. Why are the opinions of politicians or self proclaimed economic experts supposed to weigh more than the analysis of those engineers? After all, at this stage the whole discussion revolves around technical realities. Don't take any shortcuts, really argue why their expert opinion is not to be trusted. If you can't, then maybe you should stop acting like you know better, because you don't.",2017-06-25 05:43:49

The project is basically intended to crowd source predictions for the stockmarket from data scientists, who build their algorithms to get paid (ETH) from Numerai. And in order to get paid, they need to stake NMR. If their predictions are good, they get ETH and keep their NMR; if their predictions are bad, they don't get ETH and the NMR they staked gets burnt. 

Numerai previously had the project on Bitcoin, but have since then abandoned it, and are now only working with the Ethereum network. Very importantly, this is something that already exists.

Unlike Bitcoin, there are multiple implementations of the Ethereum protocol, and Gavin does indeed deserve far more credit for his contributions. however he isn't as easy to meme as Vitalik. 

As noted in other comments, Gavin contributed heavily to the earliest versions of the protocol, and it was his Parity version/implementation that maintained consensus in the protocol attack last thanksgiving. Mad props deserve to be thrown his way.

I sold and bought with ups and downs and panic selling and ended up with slightly under 13 bitcoins. I felt I lost too much so I completely got out of the market. A few months later bitcoin jumped up to $1000 USD. Now it hovers around $2500.

djeabf7,danielkza,20,"Disclaimer: I'm not an Ethereum developer or professional, so I welcome any corrections.

&gt; How exactly do the miners put the transactions in a block? 

They can choose the transactions however they please. Preferring transactions that pay more for gas is the obvious economically superior way to do it, but not mandatory.

All that is necessary is for a produced block to have a hash with a desired property. In the case of EthHash (the algorithm used by Ethereum) the hash has to be smaller than a pre-defined number (which defines the difficulty - smaller = more difficult). Since the output of the hash is unpredictable given the content of the block, all miners can do is change a nonce (a number with no particular meaning) inside the block and try again. Hence, the more computational power available to you, the more attempts you can make in the same time, and hence mine more blocks.

&gt; How many transactions can go in block?

There is not a defined number of transactions, but a *gas limit* for a block, which is the sum of the gas (computing time) consumed by all the transactions it contains. This is different from Bitcoin, that defines a size limit in MBs for each block (but which should correlate more easily to transaction count, as transactions do not have their own logic as they do in Ethereum).

&gt; And it's just the first miner to solve a block that gets rewarded isn't it? 

It's a bit complicated, but the first to mine gets the bulk of the reward.

Once a miner solves a block and broadcasts it, other miners usually stop their current attempts and start over on top of the chain containing the newly-accepted block. But that is not mandatory, and in cases of bugs or deliberate attacks, miners may end up ignoring new blocks and continuing on their own chain. Since the longest chain (containing the most work) ""wins"", it's possible for multiple blocks to be discarded in favor of a different chain. That's why it's advisable to wait for a few blocks after a transaction is included in a block to be sure it is very unlikely to be discarded.

The act of mining on your own chain for a while to increase profits became known in the Bitcoin world as selfish mining. To protect against it and increase security, Ethereum introduced uncle/ommer blocks. When a miner finds a ""repeat"" block, based on a block that is no longer the most current, or that didn't win the ""race"" to be the current block, they can still broadcast it for a smaller reward. Afterwards, miners can also include those uncle blocks to increase the overall work proven to be spent to generate a winning block. If anyone attempts to submit a new chain that contains a block that was already seen as an uncle it can be rejected, as they clearly are attempting to game the system.",2017-06-26 08:43:45

DCG and Blockstream are playing ""[good cop bad cop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_cop/bad_cop)"". 

DCG is playing ""good cop"" and Blockstream is playing ""bad cop"". Their common goal is likely to be to trick the Bitcoin community to accept an activation of Segwit with a 75 % signature discount that makes normal transactions more expensive but LN hub and sidechain transactions discounted. 

Barry Silbert owns the DCG company which owns shares in the Blockstream company, and Blockstream is likely planning on profiting from being a future dominant LN hub and / or a sidechain provider. LN and sidechains use a lot more than 1 signature per transaction so they would want signatures to be heavily discounted.

Why were Barry Silbert and his company DCG silent for years during the heated scaling conflict? He only reacted when Bitcoin Unlimited's EC got more than 40 % of the hashpower votes by panicking and calling everyone to his negotiations table where he ""kindly"" offered his Segwit2x ""compromise"" proposal to the negotiations participants.

Wanna know why'? Side-chains. Blockstream was funded on the condition they implement segwit to enable side-chains. This provides the key holders with the ability to create endless side-chains, and scaling through less secure chains, as well as diluting the scarcity of Bitcoin at the same time.

If you are one of those people that has been compromised by the Segwit2x ""compromise"", just ask yourself why are you even agreeing to this? Core never committed themselves to a Blocksize increase, and everyone is suddenly ok with comitting to Segwit - in any form?

While DASH are happy to increase their blocksize, and Monero are happy to organically grow their blocksize, Bitcoin is to remain at a shitty 1MB cap just because certain powers say so?

The sooner we fork the better. Even if we have a minority chain - I believe the economic structure of Bitcoin's incentives will serve us right. Even if Segwit Bitcoin activates and has the initial market cap over Legacy Bitcoin, in no time at all, people will realise that they are waiting hours for confirmations, and paying big fees, when they can just use Legacy Bitcoin and do near instant transactions for near zero cost.

Its time to Fork.

So right now if you've done any kind of build, you've likely noticed that GTX 1060/70's and RX 470/80 and 570/80 cards are either impossible to find or extremely overpriced.

If you havent heard already, this is due to the current cryptocurrency mining craze.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is cryptocurrency mining?**

Cryptocurrency mining is the process of trying to solve complex mathematical problems in attempt to 'solve' a block in a blockchain. Which will give a reward of the relevant cryptocurrency to the miner.
This is done to help validate transactions on a cryptocurrency network and ensure people cant spend money that is invalid or they dont have.

If you want to learn more about it, these two videos are great, they are aimed at bitcoin, but they apply to almost every other cryptocurrency too (with some exceptions):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JGQXCTe3c (Basic Explanation)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs (Technical Explanation)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE (Very in-depth explanation)

**What is ethereum?**

Ethereum.

Until recently, Bitcoin was THE cryptocurrency, it was the one that almost everyone used because it was well known, relatively simple, fast, cheap and understood.

But due to the network becoming so popular and congested, and the limit to the sizing per block staying at 1MB, bitcoin transaction fees have grown hugely as people compete in a bidding war to have their transactions confirmed, to the point where at busy periods if you want a transaction done fast it can cost you nearly $5 just to send the transaction.

There have been a huge host of potential solutions, debates and issues with 'fixing' bitcoin, and a lot of different viewpoints. If you want to delve into the issues, have a look at some of the top posts of the last year or so on these two subreddits:

http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin (the 'official' bitcoin subreddit, but is HUGELY censored by the current bitcoin core devs, and so take note that you will likely get a very one-sided view of things here. In fact just me saying this means this post might get downvote-bombed by people from there)

http://www.reddit.com/r/btc (the uncensored, community run bitcoin subreddit. No censorship here, but due to the fact that its mainly made up of people who's views oppose that of the bitcoin core devs, its basically the polar opposite of the former subreddit. So again, bear in mind you'll get quite a onesided view of things)

As a result of all these issues, demand for other cryptocurrencies grew.

The biggest one that took up the demand was ethereum, the blocks were generated every 15 seconds instead of 15 minutes, and the blocksizes were scaleable, so the network was fast, and super cheap (though there have been some congestion issues here too as of late)

**Why have GPU's suddenly been high in demand?**

The main difference between these two for miners is the algorithm. Bitcoin was originally mined on CPU's, then people worked out that GPU's were vastly better for it, and eventually, special chips designed solely for bitcoin mining were created called 'ASIC's. These chips were so fast that GPU's became useless, due to having so little power in comparison that you made practically nothing, usually less than the cost of electricity.

So, miners werent buying GPU's when you could get a $20 ASIC that was 30x faster.

But, ethereum cant be mined on ASIC's, and so, since ethereum has grown so massively and fast, GPU's are suddenly in high demand for miners. And as such, its pretty hard to find them right now as they are all being bought almost immediately.

**When will this stop??**

Soon, for one of two reasons. Ethereum and bitcoin both operate on what is called a ""proof of work"" system, more commonly known as mining.
But, ethereum will at somepoint in the near-ish future be switching to a ""proof-of-stake"" system, which basically means that rather than your income being determined by your computing power, its determined by how much ETH you 'stake' or invest.

You can read more about proof of stake here:

https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ

http://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-big-switch-the-new-roadmap-to-proof-of-stake/

OR

Nvidia has both announced that they are in the process of creating GPU's designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. These GPU's wont have display outputs, and will likely be optimised for things such as low power usage and hashpower instead of low-noise, multiple display outputs and aesthetics.

These will likely be cheaper than equivalent versions of current GPU's and much more effective in price and power cost for miners, meaning that much much less of them will be hogging the stock of that GTX 1070 you've been after.

You can read more about these upcoming mining GPU's here:

http://wccftech.com/nvidia-pascal-gpu-cryptocurrency-mining-price-specs-performance-detailed/

https://segmentnext.com/2017/06/15/nvidia-crypto-mining-gtx-1080-1060/

Another thing to note is that as more and more miners add hashpower to the Ethereum network, the profitability goes down. Meaning that sooner or later it will get to the point where demand drops back to normal levels.

Its so hot right now because getting in earlier means bigger profits while the network difficulty is low.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL:DR**

GPU mining has suddenly grown in popularity because bitcoin is pointless to mine on a GPU, but the new 'big' cryptocurrency Ethereum can, very profitably, so miners are once again buying GPU's.

This will stop once ETH switches to its investment style system instead of its mining system, or once Nvidia releases their mining-specialised GPU's

There will always be other currencies to mine with a GPU, but right now its so desirable because ETH is so profitable to mine. But as explained earlier, it wont be for long.",2017-06-27 00:22:05

Ethereum is ""memory hard"" or to put it another way, requires a 2.2 GB dataset (currently, it grows over time) to mine, making it ""resistant"" to ASIC's that ""ruined"" Bitcoin mining so quickly.


So you NEED GPU's to mine ETH and it turns out the problem is memory and compute bound. While the specifics get muddy here, basically for the time being AMD cards seem to have a more favorable memory architecture and as someone who has had to deal with NVIDIA Linux drivers, I can say that I'd take AMD / OpenCL any day of the week over NVIDIA for mining at least (even though I exclusively mine on EVGA 1060's and am rocking a 1080 in my personal rig). 

It's important to note that:

A) Ethereum lost half its value this week

B) A soon to be pushed network difficulty update is likely to knock the RX 460/470 miners down my 15-20% (reportedly) and the mining community at large is switching over to the GTX 1060 because it's the next cheapest card. And yes the 460's are sold out.

djgu8i4,technocrypto,63,"These types of comments come up enough that it's worth having an authoritative answer.

**First:**

Channels aren't *supposed* to be a scaling solution, as every Ethereum person working on them repeatedly points out.  They provide a constant factor improvement in throughput, vastly better user experience, and radically lower fees, but are still bottlenecked by whatever proportion of transactions do actually have to go to chain.  So channels alone aren't *supposed* to be the solution to scaling for Ethereum.  Ethereum has a separate roadmap for that.  As far as I can tell Bitcoin just has no scaling roadmap at all, but that's their business.

Also, nothing in this article (that is correct) is news to anyone working on channels in Ethereum.  These problems are well known enough to have particular names (like ""the capital efficiency problem"") and teams like Raiden already take these kinds of issues into account in their planning and designs.

Speaking of Bitcoin versus Ethereum, it's very important to note that **this article is a criticism of *Bitcoin*'s channels, not *Ethereum*'s**.  Ethereum can address some of these issues better than Bitcoin can.

**Second:**

It seems like every time this criticism is raised, people get really hung up on misconceptions over how ""centralised"" hubs are.  **But drawing a graph with many connections going through a small number of points almost *never* captures the aspects of centralisation that people are actually worried about.**  The common mistake, as in this article, is to draw an analogy between banks and channel hubs.  However, **unlike banks, channel hubs are not trusted entities**.  This is a really important difference.  Most people don't care about some degree of *topological* centralisation.  Almost all of their concerns are really about centralisation of *power and trust*.  Channels will probably have some degree of topological centralisation.  But they have hardly any more centralisation of power and trust compared with normal on chain payments.  In some ways they will have far less.  In particular:

- **Hubs have essentially no power of censorship**.  Speaking to Ethereum specifically, hubs will only see initiation and closeout of links, aka total balance movement.  They can't tell the difference between a payment and a bet for example, if they were trying to censor online gambling.  Also, because you can onion route channel transfers there is no reason to suppose that hubs will know whose channels they are even hosting.  These onion transfers look identical to regular short hop transfers, so they also can't be censored as a class.  There are also other techniques, like atomic parallel transfer, that allow nodes in the network to (trustlessly) break the entire topology of a payment, so that there isn't any topological link between the sender and the receiver at all.  And that's not even getting into more advanced techniques like zero knowledge hubs.

- **Hubs have essentially no anti-competitive/monopolistic powers**.  It is possible to move channels between different hubs without closing them, so hubs which do pretty much anything users don't like can be swapped out on the fly for a new one, at no switching cost.  Remember that since hubs aren't trusted entities this new hub doesn't have to ""earn your trust"".  It can literally be spun up on the fly out of nowhere and take all of the other hub's business for even the tiniest perceived slight to end users.

- **Hubs which rely on debt/credit to reduce their capital needs can't take users' money with them when they fail**.  This is probably the biggest one.  Any impact here is limited directly to the debtor/creditor relationship.  Banks can empty your bank account when the economy collapses.  Hubs can't.  That's a pretty big difference.

Arguably, miners have more power over your transactions than hubs do, so channel networks may not increase centralisation of trust and power at all.

**Now, on to the ""nitpicks"":**

Some of the claims and assumptions in this article are wrong or misleading.  For example, the assumption that ""many or most users will receive some kind of income at some kind of regular interval, and deposit an allowance of funds into the LN for spending"" is certainly wrong as a current model of how people use cryptocurrencies.  People aren't using bitcoin or ether like a chequing account.  If anything they use it more like a savings account or an investment account, and one could argue that those are at least supposed to grow in value over time rather than being depleted.  Looking at Ethereum specifically, futures that involve stablecoins (which could plausibly entail more of the ""income sawtooth"" behaviour) will almost certainly include many other types of behaviours as well.  Our current financial infrastructure isn't dominated by the income sawtooth, and there's no particular reason to think that blockchain infrastructure will be either.

The claim that ""money used in routing othersâ payments is unavailable to the user during the time that the route is in use"" is also highly misleading at best.  ""In use"" time could be a tiny fraction of a second for most payments.  The article uses a default estimate of 4 hours, which seems extremely high to me.  There are *very* few applications that people would use for 4 hours straight.  And again, looking at Ethereum instead of Bitcoin, there are also advanced techniques which can keep your entire balance available to you regardless of what is being routed through you (since any payments on one side just cancel out on the other).

I have more nitpicks, but those are the two most important ones.

**It's not all bad though:**

Some of the problems that channels have to plan for are well presented in the article, with reasonable math estimates and pretty graphs.  So I do think this article is actually pretty useful as long as it is understood in the right context (that context being ""there are cool problems to solve when designing channel networks"", not ""aaahhh! channels don't work at all!!"").

**TL;DR:**

**Channels aren't supposed to be, we already know, it doesn't matter, and some of the article is wrong.  But if you ignore the weird cynical angle it takes, lots of it is actually useful!**",2017-06-28 00:41:25

djihicg,FLFTW16,93,"&gt;It truly is a sad day when prostitutes, who in days of old were the lowest of the low when it came to the smp, are now of more value than the women we meet on normal occasion.

What makes you say this? There is absolutely no logical or historical evidence to support this statement.

Prostitution has existed since before humans were human. You can find videos of chimps who were taught to use ""currency."" Within minutes of learning about the concept of currency one of the chimps walks over to a female and buys 30 seconds of intimate time with her rear end. They don't even have sophisticated language but they already understand economics and capitalism.

Wait. It's deeper than that. Go watch those penguins who fight over pebbles to find the roundest, prettiest pebble on a desolate beach. The male with the best pebble goes and gets the best looking penguin female. They deal in pebbles as a medium to find the strongest or most cunning male.

Prostitution is how sex works on Planet Earth. Full stop. Now, what is the currency you must spend to buy a woman? Some women accept USD, Euro, Bitcoin, Rubles, others only accept commitment or time, or a wedding ring. Every woman has her price and it's up to her to decide what currency she accepts. Every woman is a prostitute (excluding nuns, I suppose). That also makes every man a John, a user of whores. The reason why rape is such a horrible crime is because it is theft. You are stealing a woman's goods without paying an agreed upon price. There is terrible emotional baggage, as well, but the philosophical issue with rape is *theft*, which all civilizations must deem to be sinful.

None of this has to do with ""quality"" of women. OP's statement sounds like he thinks 9s and 10s should behave like pure virgins who only date movie stars and kings and emperors, while lowly 3's and 4's suck dick for loose change. Some 10s prostitute themselves and do porn. Some 3s and 4s only accept wedding rings. The external beauty of a woman has no bearing on what currency she accepts. Don't put beauty on a pedestal. Beauty is typically corrupted. Old Jewish matchmakers actually recommended men search for the more homely 6's, 7's, and 8's for a stable, loving marriage. They know that 9's and 10's are inundated with offers of all types of currency, and they succumb sooner or later. A homely six is more likely to accept time and commitment as she doesn't receive many offers of hard cash (those going mostly to the 9's and 10's).

I digress.

Shelly Cerelli, presumably wife of James/Carmelo Cerelli, lists her location as Canada on her [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelly-cerrelli-026211132/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3B%2F5PDdFGpT%2BycOjoSJYIZKQ%3D%3D&amp;licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result) and [Hamilton, Ontario](https://twitter.com/ShellyCerrelli/) on her twitter profile.

Funnily, her only [publically viewable tweet](https://twitter.com/VastDriveCorp/status/849709968026718208) was to say she would buy a Vast Stick - which is really weird, cause I mean she works there so why would she need to buy one? Unless she really thinks astro-turfing is a good way to get people to like you.

There's also a Carmello Cerrelli and Shelly-ann Cerelli who run a company called [Kyzace Inc. in Ontario](http://www.canadacompany.info/Kyzace-Inc-9334700/#.WVTRhWjyuiw). I found this out from a [Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1173703.msg14855444#msg14855444) where they were apparently linked to Cryptsy, a bitcoin exchange where that collapsed due to the CEO using it as a money laundering operation. Don't bother looking up their address - it's a UPS store.

Shelly-ann Cerelli is also registered as a director of a UK company, [Solid Options Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/eiXeahIRYsZIwdkB-FeHj9c-Tsc/appointments). The address is a postbox company.

VastCorp's Syracuse address is also iffy. [It's a strip mall for doctors.](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@43.0555844,-76.021772,3a,65.8y,129.36h,92.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTOtMuVy7X52kedmZteC-wQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). There is no company registration that I can find for VastCorp, Vast Technologies International, or Vast Corp International that fits their profile. At least not in New York.

So here's what we know for definite.

* James T Cerrelli is trying to hide his real name, Carmelo Cerrelli.
* Carmelo Cerrelli has also lied about his location, which is Ontario Canada and not Syracuse New York.
* Shelly Cerrelli has tried to obfuscate her real name - Shelly-ann Cerrelli.
* Shelly-ann Cerrelli's Linkedin profile makes no mention of either Solid Options Ltd or Kyzace Inc.
* Both Cerrelli's have been linked to a shady bitcoin operation that stole money from investors.
* Both have deliberately obscured their real location in past companies via use of postboxes and virtual offices.
* Carmelo doesn't even have a Linkedin profile, which is bizarre for someone claiming to have built multiple million-dollar businesses. In fact, the complete lack of information tells me that either he's lying, or he has made reasonably successful attempts to purge his history.
* The Syracuse address for VastCorp is a bunch of Doctor's offices.
* The company is not registered in New York state, at least not under the name ""Vast"".

This just reeks of scam. Real companies don't work so hard to obscure the real owners, history and location.

**Edit:** Found a James Cerrelli who owns [Pinnacle Consulting &amp; Management, LLC](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/4955496) in Syracuse, New York. Could this be the real company name of ""Vast Technologies""? Also raises more questions, as if it is them it would appear that James Cerrelli has never run a company before. At least not under this name. Of course the other name is littered with dodgy dealings and failed businesses.

**Edit 2:** Steven Tichi has a company registered at the same address. [NY Electronics &amp; Technology](http://www.syracuse.com/business-news/index.ssf/2016/06/onondaga_county_business_certificates_may_18_to_24.html), along with his wife Patricia Tichi. Why does Steven, who is supposed to be head of R&amp;D at VastCorp, have his own company registered to the same address as James Cerrelli's consulting firm. Does it really matter though? Steven is an [oil filter salesman from Washington](https://www.intelius.com/people/Steven-Tichi/Everett-WA/0CFS7JN8W1E) who moved to [Fayetteville](https://i.imgur.com/UfeFeBY.png). Looks like Steven likes to go by a couple of different names too. Probably because he's been in trouble for [domestic violence, assault, breach of restraining orders and false imprisonment](http://www.courtrecords.org/people/STEVEN+TICHI+WA/) (the full court records that I can find mention Patricia) and doesn't want that to tarnish the good name of... whatever the hell VastCorp is really called.",2017-06-29 19:56:00

djjzdmb,Anticode,43,"Ethereum block size didn't change. Ethereum does not have a block size.

This changed the amount of computations that can be performed in a single block.

The gas limit is a cap on both processing and storage/bandwidth because the cost of a transaction/function is fixed in units of gas for each type of instruction. 

&gt;Edit: This is more like pushing on the pedal in a car a bit harder rather than buying a bigger engine ( increasing block size). Following the analogy, pushing on the pedal burns more gas and costs more, but your car can go faster and pull heavier loads. Miners have the ability to push/release the pedal as needed. Users have the ability to spend more gas to help their transaction process more rapidly. This is like jumping in a taxi and handing a $50 to the driver and saying, ""And step on it!"" Alternatively, you can pay market price for the taxi based on demand and distance to your destination.

The gas limit is voted up or down by each miner and each miner determines what gas price it is willing to accept which is like bitcoin transaction fees but on a per gas basis rather than a per transaction basis. 

For instance: If the network underwent a spam attack then miners have two choices: They could raise the gas limit to allow for more transactions to get through or they could increase the gas price, which would make the 'DDOS-style' spam attacks too expensive to run. In this case the limit was increased to let the network run smoother now that it is picking up steam.

I readily admit my bias in favor of Monero *but that bias is based upon the research I did to find the most private, fungible coin.* The page you linked to is part of the results of my research. I have been using Monero since a few months after its launch and I thought, in addition to having a site kind of like LBC for Monero, I wanted a page to highlight why Monero is the best coin for privacy purposes. I bounced a few ideas off of dnale0r and gingeropoulos and they were (and are) valuable resources. So, I believe my bias to based on solid research. If anything on that page is inaccurate, I welcome constructive criticism from anyone.

The red X for ""Private"" is there because privacy is not by default in Zcash. If a transaction did use their privacy feature (after waiting a long period of time to allow for the computational effort needed to construct the transaction), it would be one of around 10% of private transactions on their blockchain. That's not good enough for me. I want all transactions to be private so my transaction doesn't stand out, and I don't want to have to wait a long time to construct the transaction. Plus, their CEO said:

 ""*And by the way, I think we can successfully make Zcash too traceable for criminals like WannaCry, but still completely private &amp; fungible.*""

If there is the potential for that to happen, then I won't use it. It's not private enough for me and not as private as Monero.

djk6j27,PLATYPUS_DIARRHEA,52,"Uhhh... a deflationary currency is potentially worse than an inflationary currency.  A ""perfect money"" would stay the same value over time.  That means it should cost roughly the same amount of money to buy a loaf of bread in 1900 as it does in 2000 as it might in 2100, barring any advances that lowers the fundamental economic cost of producing and distributing bread.  If your currency deflates, then people are motivated to not spend (HODL!!) because hey, the same money will be worth more tomorrow, right?  So why buy that car for 5 BTC today when you might be able to buy it at 4 BTC six months from now.  Since bitcoin is a fixed supply and economic output almost always grows over time, bitcoin is deflationary by design, regardless of how it's trading against fiat or other cryptos. 

A currency experiencing runaway inflation will cause that currency to go bust.  A currency experiencing runaway deflation can cause the entire economy to go down as people stop spending which causes places to go out of business which decreases economic activity even more in a downward spiral.  

Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is a novelty and certainly has some interesting applications, but don't act like it's the best the since gold coins and fiat is the worst thing ever.  Fiat has its issues but it works.  And it certainly works much better than Bitcoin ever would.  A technological solution to money may be the answer in the far future for our economic turmoils, but Bitcoin isn't that answer.  

But don't let logic get in the way of your circlejerk.",2017-06-30 00:26:04

djljhdt,andybellenie,48,"The deceased don't pay inheritance tax, their beneficiaries do. So I assume what you're really asking is: 'How can *I* use bitcoin to avoid inheritance tax?' 

As far as avoidance goes (legal attempts to reduce tax exposure) then bitcoin has no advantage over fiat. It's only useful if you wish to evade tax, i.e. illegally.

Although I agree with comments above about taxation as theft it's also important to respect the rule of law so I suggest dropping the idea. Use every legal trick in the book by all means, but don't actually break the law.

For an example, let's say granny buys a load of bitcoin as an 'investment' on the advice of her kindly grandson. Then, sadly, she passes, and it appears she didn't think to include the private keys in her will. The money is presumed lost. However, sneaky grandson has a personal backup of the keys and has full access to the funds.

This is seriously criminal behaviour, you are stealing from the government and also any other potential beneficiaries. I suspect it's jailable should you be caught and any purchased coins would be easily traceable. If they were ever moved it would be immediately obvious someone had the keys. Might you get away with it? Quite possibly, although either you've conspired with other beneficiaries or you've stolen from them too, which makes it more likely you'd get caught.

Tax sucks, it's way too high and we should all campaign towards a smaller state and use every legal means at our disposal to reduce our personal exposure. But don't break the law. It penalises other tax payers and puts you at serious risk.

djka106,NimbleBodhi,48,"I can't tell you what to do with your own finances, but I'd say it depends on what you think of the long term viability and success of Bitcoin is. If you think it'll be successful in the long term then you haven't seen nothing yet, we're still in the early stages of adoption, and the price will have to be much much higher than it is now. On the other hand, if you're just into bitcoin to make a quick buck, then you'll probably have a bad time.

I personally buy a little bit of bitcoin at the end of each month with left over money from that month's budget regardless of the price ([dollar cost averaging](https://breadwallet.com/blog/how-invest-bitcoin-without-getting-hurt-volatility/)), it's play money for me and if I lost it all it wouldn't affect my life in any way.

By way of example VCRs were a bit of shakey market at first but when the porn industry jumped in people realized they could get their fix at home rather than going to some shady theater. Some have said the same about cameras and other tech like the Internet where the porn industry was arguably the first sector to turn massive profits.
