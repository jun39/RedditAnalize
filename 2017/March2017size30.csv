It got to the point where they gave up trying to argue since he countered them so deftly.

Whenever someone says ""lets just agree to disagree"" that means they cannot produce evidence to the contrary.  Johnny did this to Jake in frustration to his argument citing the history of Bitcoin and how there is actual evidence that miners will not destroy themselves for short term gains.

And huge thumbs up to the guy who asked clueless Trace ""Umm.. if miners were to abuse fees why didnt they do that when blocks were 100k?""

He just sat there internally stuttering.

The main issue most BU supporters have with Core is the zero effort put forth to solve the *immediate congestion issues* (Segwit doesn't solve the immediate congestion issues). But then again, in that interview, Johnny states that he thinks constantly full blocks are *required* so that fees are higher, to compensate miners once the block subsidy drops.

From what I observe, BU supporters and Core supporters have a fundamental difference in viewpoint of how miners should be paid in the short term and long term.

He was privately discussing Programmable Money and Smart Contracts in 2010 with Mike Hearn. ([click for proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA))

Fast forward to 2017, Ethereum is now fulfilling a lot of Satoshi's dream and keeps developing at an astonishing pace.

Too many people just aren't realizing yet that the development on the original Bitcoin chain has come to a stop and the community has forked. The forked chain is Ethereum, created by the Bitcoin developers from &lt; 2014

Oh yes, Satoshi's dream is more alive than ever. People just keep looking in the wrong direction, to that silly old chain that doesn't move, not even when u poke it.


**EDIT:** To the down voters, there is no denying that Ethereum resembles Satoshi's vision more closely and more accurately than Bitcoin. That's just an objective fact that you can observe if you do your homework. It also means that ""Bitcoin"" itself has succeeded.

BEFORE NOON:
*****
&amp;nbsp;


Jeremy Millar (EEA Board Member)
&gt; In the longterm, the only difference between a public or private blockchain would be comparable to a firewall configuration

- **No differences in protocol between the public and private chains**
- Having interoperability is beneficial for both sides 
- Interconnectivity is of the utmost importance
- Shared roadmaps between EEA and the Ethereum foundation 
- We will be working on more than one codebase (referring to Pythereum/Geth/...)

&amp;nbsp;

Andrew Keys (ConsenSys)

- possibility to swap out 'modules' and set up custom blockchains (for example with other POW/POS mechanism)
- zk-SNARKS to be implemented in the next 12 months 
- **the number of participating companies is expected to double in the following months**

&amp;nbsp;

Vitalik 

&gt; Let's work together and build great things!

- Main goals: **optimization, safety (solidity verification features), scalability, privacy**
- Ethereum is part of Web 3.0 together with Whisper &amp; Swarm. *For example, storing dAPP user interfaces on Swarm, and peer-to-peer messaging on Whisper.*
- EIP86: ability to send to not-yet-existent contracts, more flexibility for who pays for the gas
- zk-SNARKS: privacy-preserving transactions. *Some spooky math. Could be extended to private chains.*
- Public (permissionless) chains must be accessible to a user with a consumer laptop, while private (permissioned) chains can have higher bandwidth (faster finality, tx/s, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

Joe Lubin (ConsenSys)
&gt;We launched Ethereum before there was an ecosystem. It felt like we were building the Xbox without any games.

- Instead of companies building internal systems, we will see whole industries building shared systems.  Think of collaborative databases in a decentralised global cloud. 
- We need to enable everybody to use the system, including banks.
- Our business model: built platforms on top of open source, permissionless infrastructure.
*Mentions the token launch of Gnosis (prediction market) coming up.* 
- In 2 to 3 years, Ethereum will have robust scalability and privacy.
- **It does not make sense (to me), to use another blockchain** where the factors have changed to a point where you can never have a public blockchain doing this stuff. *Referring to Bitcoin and/or others.*

&amp;nbsp;

Marles Gray (Microsoft)
&gt;This is the tip of the iceberg.

- We will start seeing more (smaller) consortia, and collaborative business.
 *Mentions interest of pharmaceutical companies*
- **Quorum (= the first implementation of EEA) is now available on Azure.**
- The question will change to ""How fast can you deploy X?"", instead of ""Can you?""

&amp;nbsp;

Sandra Ro (CME, derivatives exchange)
&gt; We need to collaborate more, not less.

- **Good to have a frank and open dialogue, including with regulatory bodies.**
- Guiding principles are going to be collaborative

&amp;nbsp;

Matt Spooke 
&gt; There is a need for these different perspectives. We need each other. 

- We can built proprietary platforms on top of open source code, to take it to the next level. *Compares it to Red Hat in the linux context.*
- **We have shown we can do it relatively quickly** in an Enterprise perspective. 
- Focus on what our collaborators want NOW


&amp;nbsp;

Amber Baldet (Moderator, JP Morgan):
&gt;  There is a long way to go. Having access to the people of the core technical community, is crucial for this. 

- Change does take time
- We are building intranets, with the goal of connecting them later
- The infrastructure is already there
- Once the system is up and running on one machine, it can easily scale up and get running around the world
- The focus should be on bringing better service to the clients
- **It is not a top-down governance model**


&amp;nbsp;

*****
AFTERNOON:
*****
Tyrone Lobban (JP Morgan) - talking about **Quorum**
&gt;Privacy with data integrity

- We want **one chain** with both the public transactions and private transactions
- Quorum has **the ability to handle institutional levels of transactions**
- All build on Ethereum and open source

&amp;nbsp;

Quorum demo (JP Morgan, Santander, Microsoft)
&gt; Demonstrating private transactions between banks

- Private transactions that remain **transparent for regulators**
- Quorum is available on Microsoft Azure marketplace right now

&amp;nbsp;


Bob Summerwill (ConsenSys, Lead Architect)
&gt;Build roadmap to EntEth 2.0 in 2017

- The plan is **accelerating the existing public Ethereum road map**, and build the pieces which are unique to us to develop Enterprise Ethereum
- Real-world **compatibility** is key
- We are not building a specific product - but focus on specifications, allowing multiple vendors to produce their own products.
- Main development on Python client, but also contributing to others
- An enterprise client **should be able to run on the public chain too** *if desired by the client*
- For now it is about replacing parts of one database, not replacing everything at once
- We look forward to having open mailing lists

&amp;nbsp;


Ethan Buchman (Tendermint)
&gt; Standard ethereum needs tweaks to work in an enterprise setting

- The goal is being as modular as possible
- Important to **test the technology in a public, hostile environment**
- Future: interblockchain communication to move tokens back and forth

&amp;nbsp;

John Whelan (Santander)
&gt; We want to take the cool things we are doing in the lab, into production.

- For now: avoid adding too much complexity
- **Deploy our own applications** of the future
- The public Ethereum chain can be tought of as a decentralized internet, an uncensorable computer for the world.
- Whatever we will do now, is playing catch up to the public chain
- Some of our private applications might be **migrated over to (parts of) the public chain**. *(in the long term)*

&amp;nbsp;

Shahan Khatchadourian (ConsenSys, Lead Architect)
&gt;Privacy is a key component (for legal and regulatory compliancy)

- It is possible to **implement privacy, in way that it can be integrated into the public chain.** *(With the hash of the transaction being stored on the public chain)*
- Also other signature schemes next to zk-SNARKS to improve privacy
- We need to better understand the Enterprise use cases, so a formal standard can be put out.

&amp;nbsp;

Yorke Rhodes (Microsoft)
&gt;The last two years have been really interesting

- There has been a ton of testing.
- We are **ready to bring enterpise deployment into practice**
- There is a huge opportunity to secure internal corporate environments *via encryption, identity, etc.*

&amp;nbsp;

Julio Faura Enriquez (Banco Santander):
&gt; We first tried to modify stock Ethereum (by reducing difficulty and gas price) but ran into roadblocks. Then, we switched to Quorum and joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

- I don't think we are here to disrupt. I think we are here to make the world better
- The long-term vision is to **replace our enterprise infrastructures (incrementally)** with this technology
- For this we need privacy, scaling and immutability
- The job of technology is to do the integration with legacy problems (80% of the problem)

&amp;nbsp;

Vivek Kohli (BNY Mellon)
&gt; The technology is driving collaboration

- Imagine what **real-time settlements**, that happen instantly and globally, are worth to us.
- The technology is also giving us what we need to comply to regulators

&amp;nbsp;

Toon Leijtens (ING, Dutch Bank)

- Developped a Docker network on Ethereum, to connect banks together
- oil trading as *proof-of-concept* 
- Important to only use blockchains when they offer advantages over a regular database 
-The goal is to **improve the user experience**: reduce waiting times, etc. *User here = oil trading companies*

&amp;nbsp;

Patrick Schmidt (Insurance industry)
&gt;The insurance industry is looking for ways to reduce costs.

- Personalization and **cost reduction** as the main focal point
- Looking to develop a *proof-of-concept* soon


&amp;nbsp;

Ramesh Babu 

- We also worked on **retail use-cases** (preventing counterfeiting), etc.
- Enterprise Ethereum is the first step
- Ethereum has the advantage over other blockchains

&gt; Since miners already have the protocol level right to select whatever transaction they prefer (and not mine those they don't), it would be better if a miner could chose to not participate in triggering activation of something they won't use, but, without being a veto to the process (and all the ire they may have to experience as a consequence).

[...]

&gt; A user activated soft fork is win-win because it adds an option that some people want that does not detract from other peoples' enjoyment. Even if only 10% of users ever wanted a feature, so long as the benefit outweighed the technical risks, it would not be rational to deny others the ability to opt-in.

ded30y4,kaif_veenis,28,"&gt;On Thursday, February 11, 2017, a Potsdam Regional Court heard investigators explain the case of a successful darknet drug dealer. The story varied only slightly from that of any other such drug dealer. The issue, and reason the story made the news, became apparent as more data surfaced. Investigators in Brandenburg claimed the defendant was the most successful drug dealer in the area. Yet, they lost the millions earned by the defendant.

&gt;According to information that emerged during the hearing in February, the man sold a significant amount of drugs on the darknet. Mostly cocaine. Investigators called him “well-to-do” based on the quantity sold. But they believed that he might enter prison as a still a well-to-do man. In fact, prosecutors admitted that the investigation halted halfway through as the money proved impossible to find.

&gt;The defendant in question performed the role of the group’s leader, at a minimum. The prosecution called the other three men his “soldiers” and employees. Together the group sold drugs, mostly cocaine, on the Silk Road with the vendor account called “Afterhour.” According to the prosecutor’s statement, every member of the group was 30 years old, if not older. The defendant and group leader, a 31-year-old named Mark W. generated millions of dollars in sales between April 2012 and July 2013.

&gt;The Chief Investigator, only referred to as Thomas P., said that Afterhour quickly grew and became one of the largest vendors on the Silk Road. Even today, he said, Afterhour ranked number four on the most popular list of vendors on the Silk Road. The FBI told Brandenburg detectives that the group earned two million dollars—or more. Thomas P. questioned the number given by the American FBI. “If that is the whole amount, a lesser amount, or greater amount, only the accused knows.”

&gt;The Landeskriminalämter in Bavaria and Brandenburg stepped in Midway during the case, court documents revealed. The Chief Investigator believe that Mark W. also functioned as the group’s banker. However, he explained that Mark knew and handled Bitcoin quite well and for this reason likely kept the money in a Bitcoin wallet. He doubted anyone’s ability to find the money.

&gt;He explained that the money floated around in the “cloud.”

&gt;The money of Mark W. may be floating on a cloud through the darknet. [The darknet is] a secret, complicated, encrypted location on the Internet, accessible only to an authorized person. In [hidden service containers], everything can be uploaded, including a virtual wallet with virtual money (bitcoins). So-called bitcoins are a virtual currency, which can be used legally and illegally in the online trade. Mark W. is a master of dealing with bitcoins

&gt;The LKA officials revealed that they, too, were unsuccessful in the currency search. Thomas P. showed his dissatisfaction with the way that the LKA handled the case. He disliked that his investigators stopped working on the case, only to hand it over to a different law enforcement agency that also failed.

&gt;The defendant, Mark W., told investigators that the Bitcoin remained in a Silk Road wallet. He said that after the FBI took the Silk Road offline the big earned earned by Afterhour disappeared with the long-lost marketplace. This is not the information investigators wanted to hear. Despite their lengthy search, law enforcement agencies came up empty-handed. After the court appearance, Thomas P. explained that the defendant’s sentence will be a strict one, but he will still be a rich man—even in prison.",2017-03-01 20:14:06

dedu8fu,jratcliff63367,45,"I'm still so naive I think we all want the same thing.  I think we all want bitcoin to scale to everyone in the world and we just differ about the right technical way to get there.  

However, there is a reality here.

There are two major kinds of bitcoin users.  People who treat bitcoin as an investment/commodity/digital-gold-like asset and the people who want to use it as a payment network.

The thing to understand here is that the people who want to use bitcoin as an investment vehicle, for it's unique properties as a currency (21 million coins, fixed inflation schedule, etc. etc) do not need on-chain scaling.

Frankly, most of the people will **prefer** 3rd party custodial accounts.  They are going to want to use Etrade, Fidelity, Schwabb over meeting some stranger at localbitcoins or otherwise navigating the backwaters of trying to acquire bitcoin in the real world.

If an ETF launches, and I realize that is a really big if, it will allow bitcoin to scale to many tens of millions of new users over night.  Sure, they will all be on 3rd party custodial accounts but, frankly, these people will prefer that.  They will feel far safer having their COIN shares sitting on an exchange they are familiar with, with all of their existing trading tools.

The point here is that the investor class does not need any on-chain scaling, including segwit.

If someone wants to pay $10 to perform an actual on-chain transaction to control their own personal wealth, they will happily do so.  

What segwit offers is a way to get some on-chain scaling today and, most importantly, accelerate layer-2 technologies which in theory all true bitcoiners really care about and want to see happen.

But, it's important to note.  It's not needed for this use case. 

If segwit never activates and the network continues to function exactly as it does today, with the same transaction capacity, the digital-gold use case is not blocked.  Also, federated sidechains, which obviously are not fully decentralized but at least limit custodial control, can and do still work, as they are working today.

So, if the on-chain scaling crowd thinks the digital-gold folks are somehow going to 'fold' at some point.  That's really not going to happen.

So, perhaps people just start flowing value into some alt-coin which is more focused on low-fee, low-value, fast confirmation payment transactions, maybe that's where things end up.  

Everyone likes to say bitcoin is useless if you can't use it for payments.  But it's not.  Because you can still use it for payments.  People are moving money on it all of the time; arguably with ever higher and higher fees pricing out low-value use cases; but to the digital gold crowd that's not a problem.

Personally, I want the best of both worlds.  I want my digital gold, and I also want my layer-2 networks.  That's what segwit offers as a path forward, but don't think that the digital-gold use case somehow 'needs' the payment network use case.

If wealthy people can send $10,000 around the world in 10 minutes for a couple of bucks, that's plenty functional enough for their needs.",2017-03-02 05:54:01

dedl0nn,chaosakita,32,"Can this article be any more dramatic? Sure, I don't think it is a good idea to ban cash. But the main reason society is moving away from cash isn't because ""the man"" some sinister motivation, it's because people don't like using cash over credit. Like most younger people, I almost never use cash, and I've only had to use it this week because I lost my debit card. I vastly prefer the convenience of other systems even though people think I'm ""selling out"". 

&gt;No. My main defence of cash will be simple and intuitive. As unsexy and analogue as cash is, it is resilient. It is easy to use. It requires little fancy infrastructure. It is not subject to arbitrary algorithmic glitches from incompetent programmers. And, yes, it leaves no data trail that will be used to project the aspirations and neuroses of faceless technocrats and business analysts into my daily existence. It comes with criminals, but hey, it’s good old friendly normal capitalism rather than predictive Minority Report surveillance-capitalism. And ask yourself this: do you really want to live in the latter society without the ability to buy drugs? Believe me, you’ll need something to dull the existential pain.

This makes no sense.

Who says using electronic payments aren't easy to use? When I went to China, I saw several people using Alipay to pay for food from illegal street food vendors. Then in Africa, tons of people are jumping into mobile banking. Apparently it's fine for millions of people, but it's too complex.

Glitches might be a thing. I think they might affect banks, but as a consumer most of my transactions have gone smoothly.

Do my credit card systems have a data trail? I guess so. It's not enough of a worry to make me stop using them.

Also if you want drugs, just use bitcoin. Oh of course, the author is yet another well off guy complaining about how life is so hard without drugs and how he ""deserves"" them. 

I think it's always good for people to have cash, but it is slowly becoming obsolete. Traditional retail is slipping while people are buying more stuff online. Smartphone apps make transferring money easier without having to worry about misplacing cash or counting change. And if you are paranoid, you can always use bitcoin.

EDIT: I do think there is a downside in moving away from cash, because it hurts poor people who don't have access to banking services like I do. However, if you gave these people access to mobile banking services like the aforementioned people in Africa do, or some other form of cashless service, I think most of these people would switch to them in a heartbeat.

Hashcash with inflation control? Hashcash was never meant to be fucking money at all. There is no monetary value anywhere in his hashcash. It is only a way to slow down spammer by making them calculate some hashes and we know that by today standard, even with regular computer, spammer wouldn't get slowed down at all by this. Also, this doesn't prevent spam at all. If an email is sent without a valid header, the email is ignored. You still received the email (bandwidth cost), stored it on your harddrive or RAM), analyzed it (CPU cycle time to verify the header, on top of regular cycle to receive the email), then you delete the email from HD or RAM. Fucking useless.

The only thing that Satoshi recycled from his hashcash is the idea of Proof-of-Work. Hashcash uses SHA-1 which is a fucking joke.

&gt; To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proofof-work
system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits.

Prior to that time it had been discussed for years censorship free and no one objected to the idea we needed to fork before blocks filled up this was accepted and never contentious. Limiting block space created demand for the products BlockStream are developing. Blockstream employ the most influential bitcoin developers who are injecting changes into the bitcoin code base, the conflict of interest goes ignored. 


Adam Back - the CEO of Blockstream responded with **FUD** and accused Gavin of doing a coup when he released BIP101 for review by the Core developers:


&gt;Adam Back: ""[Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/the-bitcoin-for-is-a-coup)""

**Contention is being manufactured where there is none** - people can choose to support or not. 

BIP101 which included the  following features which should make **it obvious it's not a coup**: 

* 1 year of preparation before it could be activated.

* it required 75% of miners to agree to the block size increase. before it could be activated.

* if activated a grace period would allowing the network to upgrade before a &gt;1MB block could be mined. 

* an additional implementations of bitcoin called XT - Effectively more distributed control over development - less centralization the opposite of a coup and centralized control takeover.

* if more than 25% of miners found it **contentious** - it would never have an opportunity to activate.  

* at the time Gavin held full control over Bitcoin repo on GitHub, and did not dictate what happens in bitcoin development


Ignorant small bock fundamentalists proclaiming this was contentious and would split the network.

u/adam3us could maybe give us a definition of what he meant when he says ""coup"" he sounds very aggressive as if his control of bitcoin was under threat: 

What followed was a closed door Hong Kong meeting where the CEO of Blockstream Adam Back meat with 80% of the bitcoin hashing power. After a 17 hour meeting an agreement, to block any hard fork proposals and wait until BS/Core releases segwit, was made. 

&gt;**what Adam said:**

&gt;Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

&gt;**what Adam did:**

&gt;He went behind the community's back, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

Even if capacity demand stays flat, if the price of Bitcoin keeps rising we can easily see $1, $2, $5 fees in the coming months.   Each step up kills some use and increases the need for other cryptos to fill in.

dehcxh5,Cryptoconomy,25,"First, you shouldn't blindly trust anyone.  if the 120 or so core development group begins broadly supporting upgrades that damage bitcoins security structure, then don't upgrade.  Instead, they have been incredibly conservative to hold security and immutability as priorities.  They have focused on working toward *serious* proposals to scale exponentially rather than linearly.  Upon finding they could make their soft fork malleability fix into a doubling of blocksize they immediately implemented it.  They have tested and reviewed their changes to grueling lengths and thoroughness.  And they understand and have focused on anonymity/fungibility being a critical focus moving forward.  

Second, Blockstream's success has absolutely nothing to do with a ""crippled blocksize."" 2MB, 4MB, 8MB even 32MB blocks do not come close to the kinds of volume they are catering to with the federated systems they are proposing to specific business needs.  

Only someone who has no concept of the numbers they deal with thinks that 4MB blocks means a fintech giant can ""just use the blockchain for their high frequency trading, no big deal.""  And preventing it at all costs is how they ""keep their business from dying.""  That's like saying if we just had *two* or *three* more buckets to hold the extra water we could keep global warming from flooding the coasts. And it sounds equally insane when you claim conspiracy that ""blockstream is limiting us to only *one* bucket because they want global warming to kill everyone.""

Lastly, it is amazing to me how deeply entrenched the idea of the socialist, progressive ""evil big business"" sentiment is.  That business is evil because business.  No evidence, argument, or actions needed, just ""cuz business.""   The Core developers can work for years on incredible upgrades but the *second* just a few of them start a ""business"" in an attempt to fund the thousands of hours of labor that is being *donated* to this massive open source undertaking... *immediately* they are all power hungry, profit seeking, greedy bastards who deserve to be fired.

You better have **someting tangible** when you make blanket character attacks on hundreds of people working their asses off to keep this thing running.

deh53h1,JustAnotherPlebeian,24,"Currency, is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy. Used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, currency is the basis for trade.


Generally speaking, each country has its own currency. For example, Switzerland's official currency is the Swiss franc, and Japan's official currency is the yen. Give me karma. An exception would be the euro, which is used as the currency for several European countries. While these currencies can be specific to a nation, other countries have declared foreign currency to be legal tender in their own country. For example, El Salvador and Panama allow the use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender, and immediately after the founding of the U.S. mint in 1792, U.S. residents used Spanish coins because they were heavier.

Some currencies, like cryptocurrencies​, bitcoin​, dogecoin​ and other online currencies and branded currencies are not tied to any country. Branded currencies, like airline and credit card points, or in-game credits are valued in relationship to the value of the products or services they’re tied to. Control over digital currencies is entirely decentralized, and the exchange rate of a digital currency can vary widely in a short period of time. 

Local currencies are currencies intended for trade over a small area and aren’t nationally backed. There are a wide variety of local currencies within the United States, which itself has a history of local currencies before the establishment of state and national banks. Other instances in which local currencies have been used include a kind of quasi local currency in the form of local government IOUs that have been used as currency. 

In most all cases, the central bank of a country has the sole right to issue money for circulation. Along with a main unit of currency, these banks issue fractional units, usually in the form of coins. These usually show up as 1/100th, and 1/4th, but can at times be as small as 1/1000th of the main unit of currency.

Also to note, nobody on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has shown support for the idea yet, and the general consensus seems to agree with Vitalik's tweet. 

Theymos [on the idea](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1805060.msg18015207#msg18015207):
&gt; Another consideration is that if miners are expected to keep producing very long invalid chains under the new rules, then this sort of softfork has almost exactly the same costs as a hardfork. So if this is considered a likely outcome, then it'd may be better to just hardfork and make some other useful hardfork changes at the same time.

Luke Jr [on the idea](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg04714.html):
&gt; failure to validate a softfork is similar in some respects to a hardfork, 
but with one critical difference: the default behaviour of old nodes will be 
to follow the chain with the most-work that was valid under the pre-softfork 
rules. This actually *inverts* the benefit of the softfork over a hardfork, 
and makes a softfork deployed in such a manner de facto behave as if it had 
been a hardfork, IF someone ever mines a single malicious block.

I'm yet to see any support for the idea outside of Twitter warriors and Charlie Lee.

**We should not get distracted**

Again, **Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System** 

-

**It is not a payment settlement system for intermediaries**. With Core's roadmap, average users get priced out and have to rely on intermediaries to move value. **We would create new banks!**

-

It is all about scaling on-chain. Core's refusal for years to make modest changes to the block size created this mess of confirmation delays and skyrocketing fees. Bitcoin was supposed to be a fast and cheap P2P payment system for everyone on this planet. It all happened with Blockstream's foundation and their push to move the bulk of transactions, new use cases and their business model off-chain. Colored coin companies created wonderful use cases on-chain, which increased the value of Bitcoin.

-

Furthermore, we have **no guarantee by Core**, its allies (Blockstream, BitFury and BTCC) and minions ([Henry](https://twitter.com/Technom4ge/status/837939137151803392), Tone, Panda, Samsung) would support **a block size increase in the future**. They love fee-markets and payment channels in the future would also fight to settle on-chain. Satoshi itself stated that **free transactions should be possible** until the reward is not sustainable. Heck, the block reward dries up in 2140.

IMO, all bitcoin users should have the ability to make **direct permissionless** Bitcoin transactions. Technology is evolving, BU is evolving. **What Core and its minions are doing is not in the spirit of Bitcoin**.

&gt; Enough is enough. I'm so tired of all the manipulation attempts of bystanders. Miners are the backbone of the Bitcoin infrastructure, and my support for fellow miners is a lot greater than that of SW.

Bitcoin's design was based on miners being anonymous actors. Miners are not ""the backbone"", they are simply actors trying to make a profit. To whatever extent that they are not anonymous actors, it represents a deterioration, if not a catastrophic one, in Bitcoin's model.

The miners *as a group* thus cannot be the ""backbone"" of anything, nor can the users, nor can the developers, as those groups are fundamentally not defined and entry/exit is permissionless (it's not even recorded anywhere). Again, all by design. As soon as you start talking about ""us miners"", ""fellow miners"" you've strayed from the intent here. If you want to make it ""the team of miners vs. the users"", you haven't just strayed, you've completely lost the plot.


&gt; Even though I may not always agree with Jihan, I have a lot of respect for him and Bitmain, and they deserve their vote, as do other miners. We have been here for years, we endured ridicule when people tossed Bitcoin aside as some sort of virtual toy, treating us like delusional nerds whose vision will never be realized. But we put in the time, money and work regardless to allow Bitcoin to become what it is today

Many developers have done all that - put years of work in, but here's the difference: they haven't been richly rewarded with directing minting out of all that work. But somehow miners are heroes or something? **You are engaged in a business - and your support or not for Bitcoin as a currency is entirely separate from that business** If you want to be celebrated as being a *supporter* through thick and thin, great, I celebrate it, but that's you as a Bitcoin *user* (even just hodling), not you as a *miner*.

If you want to call people like me 'bystanders' because we don't mine on the other hand, then take me as an example - I worked 2+ years for free to help people regain fungibility in Bitcoin, but I don't think that entitles me to *set the rules of Bitcoin's protocol* - am I a 'bystander'? Or take a more obvious example like any famous Bitcoin developer, are they 'bystanders' if they don't have a mining rig? I would argue it's much more appropriate to call *you* a bystander if you don't keep up with the latest software updates (do you understand Lightning well enough to explain it?)

Finally, on signalling SW - it's not a vote, it's a process designed to allow you to signal your readiness for the upgrade. **Miners are not supposed to be setting the rules of Bitcoin's protocol**.

And I don't just mean because he prioritizes speed and low fees over concerns about centralization pressure and the loss of immutability, but because proof of stake turns the currency into something that resembles owning shares of a company, and Roger really seems to believe his large bitcoin holdings should translate into power over the development decisions regarding the network in a way that would be natural if bitcoins actually did represents shares of a company.  

But because Bitcoin separates immediate influence over the network from ownership of the currency itself, and because it isn't actually modeled after corporations in quite the way a proof of stake network seems to be, Roger has been forced to use his money indirectly to try to gain the direct influence he seeks (e.g., starting his own mining pool). You can almost sense his frustration with this, his sense of entitlement, and his outrage that he isn't being treated like a large and important stakeholder of a fortune 500 company (particularly when he was moderated out of r/bitcoin). If he were dealing with Ethereum, and it were Ethereum rather than Bitcoin he was largely invested in, the whole matter would be much more simple for him as he would already have much of the power he seeks from his stake holdings alone since ownership of coins simultaneously provides what is roughly the equivalent of hashing power in Bitcoin.

dekiykw,jatjqtjat,187,"This question keeps coming up almost several times per day.  Here is the answer.

Time in the market tends to beat timing the market.  If you try to time the market you might get lucky, or you might miss out.  Or worse yet, you might wait 2 years decide waiting was foolish and buy right at the peak.

Stocks lost about half their value in the 2008 crash, so the desire to avoid that or to buy at the bottom makes a lot of sense.  But you should also know that Bonds (or at least the BND ETF) lost only 6% of their value during the 2008 crash.

So broadly you have 3 options

* Keep your money in cash.  You'll lose some to inflation, but not too much.  Maybe you'll get luck and time the market correctly.  Your worst case senior isn't too bad.  You could get luck and buy in at the perfect time.  You probably won't, but you could.  And if you do, you'll beat every other strategy by a lot.  Its a gamble.  You'll probably end up missing out.
* Go all in on stocks for the long haul.  You could be buying at a peak which wouldn't be great.  It could take 10 years to recover, but if you are investing for 30 years, that's fine.  Ride it out.
* Balance between stocks and bonds.  If there is a crash it'll hurt, but you'll be able to sell you bonds (at a slightly reduced prices) to buy stocks at a greatly reduced price.  On the other hand if today is the lowest value that stocks will ever be, you'll do pretty well.  You'll make money on both your stocks and bonds.  You'll make less than if you were all in on stocks, but you protected yourself from the crash so that's okay. The question remains what percentage should be in stocks and what should be in bonds?  And that's up to you.

Personally, I'm leaning heavy towards option 3.  Option 1 seems WAY to risk averse.  Option 2 seems way to dangerous, because it really does seem like the market is overvalued.  Option 3 seems just right.  You'll do well in a crash (assuming you have the courage to sell your well performing bonds to buy the stocks, and then hold onto those stocks) and you'll do well in if the good times just keep on rolling.  

This is a pretty vanilla investing strategy.  You decide on an allocation between stocks and bonds based how much risk you want, and anything that balance gets out of wack (like when stocks do down 50% but bonds only 6%) you re-balance.  this effectively lets sell high and buy low.  You can tweak it a little bit by altering the allocation.  Maybe you are scared now, so you want to go 50/50.  if stocks crash you'll go 60/40.  If they fall even more go 70/30 and stay there forever.

If you want to get a little more advanced you can, along with US stocks and bonds, mix in REITs, International developed stock, and emerging stocks or even things like gold or bitcoin.

Edit: I think Sokpuppet1 made a good point.  What I said only applies if you have a lot of money that you want to get invested quickly or if you have a large portfolio (relative to your goals) and want to exploit or protect yourself from a crash.  If you are saving some percentage of your paycheck each month for retirement, then just keep doing that.  You will buy at the peak and at the trough and it will balance out.  Getting a life cycle fund and making monthly contributions is a fantastic strategy and its where the vast majority of my money is.

**EDIT** Some more detail on this topic.

* A LN transaction *IS* a bitcoin transaction.  This is a misconception many people have so it is worth repeating.
* While a LN transaction *IS* a bitcoin transaction, it's also an **unconfirmed** bitcoin transaction.  This distinction is important too.
* While a LN transaction is an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction, it's not an ordinary zero confirmation transaction.  It is one which is enforced by smart contract rules and time verification.

The details about how these smart contract rules are enforced are complex and wide open for debate.

A few things from my own personal perspective:

* I would never claim that a LN transaction is 'as secure' as a confirmed bitcoin transaction.  There is no reason to believe that.
* I would, however, claim that a LN transaction is more secure than a typical zero-confirmation transaction, due to the smart-contract properties which enforce it.
* I would never claim that the LN is suitable for replacing high-value high security transactions on the bitcoin network.  I am of the personal opinion that the LN is only suitable for handling low-value payments (i.e. &lt;$100), which comprise the vast majority of all transactions on the bitcoin network today.

Something like the LN is probably capable of off-loading the majority of low-value payment transactions that are currently being 'priced out' of the network due to the current fee market.

In addition to this, the LN enables new kinds of economic activity never possible before.  It is capable of sustaining economic activity for massive numbers of high-volume, low-latency, low-value, micro-transactions which could be fundamentally transformative in scope and power.  It is  a truly amazing technology that I think few people have yet grasped the total impact of.

Since the LN requires on-chain transactions to open and close channels, the number of participants is still limited by the current blocksize limit.  This is a real concern, but not necessarily a short term one.

Over the long term, once we are in a situation where even when all low-value payments have been moved to things like the LN, and we find that people cannot even perform high-value payments on the network because bitcoin is so mega-successful that so many people want to use it directly (i.e not through 3rd parties) then, hopefully, by then, well secured and fully decentralized sidechains capable of onboarding more users will have been deployed.

Or, the blocksize limit will have been raised safely to support more users directly on chain.   

These are problems for down the road.  For now, the question is how do we move low-value payments, which do not require the same level of security as high-value transactions, onto a secondary layer.  Things like the LN are an excellent way to achieve that goal.",2017-03-06 05:58:55

del81op,Sluisifer,359,"For those on both sides of the debate, how do you feel about Bitcoin's fragility?  Honestly.

To me, the entire premise of Bitcoin is that it is a network that may be able to survive everything short of a majority of malicious actors.  That is the point of Nakamoto consensus.  Deep down, it's just a bunch of people agreeing that some numbers mean something, and here we have a cryptographic system, combined with a value token, that may make it possible to trust without trust.

If Bitcoin cannot survive contention, cannot survive disagreement, then it has already failed in its mission.  If you feel that a hard fork, which is ultimately the mechanism that resolves network disagreements and attacks, is fatal, then Bitcoin is dead.  That's not support for a hard fork, just an observation about what this experiment is about.  Without this ability, the network is completely vulnerable.

I also urge everyone to consider how a user-activated soft fork functions as an attack vector.  Mining is resistant due to the economic incentives behind it, combined with proof-of-work.  This is such a core element of Bitcoin.  Some ideas for UASF seem to essentially function as proof-of-stake, a *radically* different vision for how the network would operate.  Perhaps a valid one, but nevertheless a dramatic change.  There seem to be other proposals that are trivial to attack, such as node-operator signaling; it boggles my mind that any serious Bitcoin proponent would forego all network security so easily.",2017-03-07 05:49:52

delw21v,Super_Cyan,167,"&gt; It almost gives Nintendo a pass.

Nintendo always has, and always get a pass from a lot of people.

Nintendo makes really good first party games, and has some cool ideas with consoles, but they're bad at pretty much everything else. The past 2 consoles that have come out have been completely eclipsed by their competitors. Their 3rd party support is terrible. Their online system is primitive compared to anything anyone else has come out with. They keep releasing consoles that lack the features, support, and power that their competitors have, and it's inexcusable.

The problem with Nintendo is that they market to a subset of the gaming industry that are stuck in a state of nostalgia, and will refuse to see the flaws in their company. For people that can afford, and are willing to spend the money on, multiple consoles, buying a WiiU or Switch to use to just play Nintendo games is fine. However, there are a lot of people that want more, and when you compare the Nintendo consoles to other consoles, they don't stack up. 

PC, Playstation, and Xbox systems have a shared library that can be played on any system. Look at Battlefield. Look at Grand Theft Auto. Look at DiRT. Look at every game that isn't an exclusive; they're all compatible with these systems, so the people with these systems don't miss out on anything. However, Nintendo misses out on these games, because they refuse to release a console that supports these games.

Sure, the Switch is a turn in the right direction by being the first Nintendo system to run Skyrim 5 years after it was released. However, the still lacking power and now hardware issues are reminiscent of Nintendo's past. For people that are going to play the Switch along side their other consoles it's fine, but this isn't good for people that are going to *only* own a Switch.

Yet, this is actually all good for ~~bitcoin~~ Nintendo, because something something Zelda/Smash/Mario.

The much bigger problem with Bitcoin is how the community has divided.  Until the divide is healed, /r/Bitcoin and /r/BTC will just be pro-Core/anti-Core circlejerks.  And that's a much bigger problem.  So I downvote a post that's making the problem worse not better.

We go through procedures, follow a set of rules, work on merit badges, and plan camping trips.

One day one of the scout leaders think things should be run his way and voices his opinion. There's a strong objection.

Next week he tries again, this time there's *2 more* scouts who agree with him. The rest object.

The following week they show up and announce they will make their own pack within the troop and go work on things at their own table. Everyone else shrugs them off, every now and then words fly across the room.

This goes on for months, merit badges still get earned, promotions still occur, all the rules are still the same, but now this pack has a plan.

They're going to take their pack and make their own troop, but they are not calling it, for example...Troop 832. They are keeping the original troop name and claiming they are the ***real*** Troop 329.

But the Boy Scouts of America has no rules about this and they need to vote to keep the original troop name.

This vote is getting closer to 51% now.

If this happens, then we will have 2 troops, both claiming to be Troop 329.

*Everyone keeps their old merit badges, but any newly earned badges will only exist within the troop that you earned them in.*

**Antpool *may* be switching their vote.**

I know that people love assigning Bitcoin price moves to various unrelated events (i.e. Cyprus, Venezuela, Donald Trump and many others), and now some are claiming that BU caused the price to crash, even though price dipped almost 24 hours after AntPool mined BU block, thus are unlikely related, furthermore  fork (which, btw, is far from a bad thing), if it were to happen, is still weeks/months from now and is unlikely to happen without the support of most miners and nodes. Furthermore AntPool with millions of $ invested in Bitcoin are well aware of both positive and negative fork implications, so you, the average joe, are far more likely to be blinded by your information sources and distrust in other solutions. 

In other words, 51% attack is baseless FUD, caused by those that have been denied the choice of Bitcoin implementations via censorship. Also UASF can, potentially, be far more damaging to Bitcoin, than bigger blocks, so why don't you FUD about that? 

The truth is quiet simple, Bitcoin is overvalued and currently it is proped up by hopes of ETF approval and random movement downwards, will be perceived as ETF denial by spooked traders. Just look at 3d or weekly chart, this bullrun is overextended and correction is long overdue, all of this while political infighting is at an ATH and network congestion has reduced Bitcoin use cases to just store-of-value, speculation and value transfers above 20$.

There was a time in the past when The Bitcoin was held in high esteem.  When it hit all time high after all time high…well at least two days in a row.

Few of us remember that time…as it was so long ago.  

Almost a week now…..

But seriously folks, this is a pull back after a pretty decent run up.  We are well within the range of a “probable” decline.  We hit our first resistance down around $1080.  That another $100 or so, and it might happen.  I don’t know.

There is a so much talk about the ETF but I am not sure if that is driving activity.    We will find out soon enough.

So, here are the numbers.  

The price as I type is $1213.
We are in a negative break down scenario—dropping one box yesterday.  The reversal from the dip last night would happen at any price over $1220.  
The first area of support is around $1060.  The second target for the short would be under $1,000.
The price would need to exceed $1,300 to give us a break out.

So we wait and see.

denelrb,mastigia,55,"This was from another comment of mine. I had predicted the leaks were going to be all about the CIA. Someone found that a bit ago, and asked me to expound on why that was. I love Assange for what he has done. But, I would ask you to consider this, and remember this information is STILL super useful. But, I still believe it is possible that Assange was compromised. This is how I think it worked. Please tell me what you think!



My comment from other thread:

I was hoping I was wrong, because to me this substantiates the theory that he was taken or compromised by the CIA specifically. Assange is likely now a CIA asset. That doesn't mean these leaks aren't still useful, just that their purpose needs to be addressed.
My theory starts with one about Snowden. 


Now, I was a huge Snowden fan, and called all those people framing him as controlled opposition shills and fuckfaces and all that yadda yadda, I bought that hook line and sinker, because I didn't understand the motive until the other day.


I stumbled across someone else's theory about Snowden. They asked me to look at the effect of the Snowden leaks, and the depth of the content. It was a chilling effect. The idea behind the Snowden leaks was that the NSA is all powerful, all knowing, and had been forever. So, if you ever thought you were getting something past them, you were fucking wrong. And managed to do this without giving you anything substantial you could do anything about. Because as it played out, the actual legal methodology that justified what they were doing was explained. Doesn't matter what we think ethically about the NSA, now there is this idea that it is legal.


tl;dr - Snowden leaks were a fucking advertisement to the power and scope of the NSA. Total psyop.



So, now we get to the CIA, they took this one step further. Not only is this an advertisement for their prowess in cyber warfare, but it is shown that their tools ""got loose into the wild"". And a ""hacker"" on 4chan conveniently comes along and demonstrates the truth of that statement. Shows that he has in fact installed these programs and that they work on his personal machine. Now, I did not see that thread, but the rumor of it has already spread as truth. So, for all intents and purposes, it is believed now.


What does that accomplish? A couple things. First of all it adds to the mythology that the CIA are fucking retarded and incompetent. They have been pushing this for some time. But, in addition to that, since ""any hacker on 4chan"" could be using these tools, they no longer have any culpability when any attacks are found to be using their tools' fingerprints. They have given doubt to anyone who might want to go after them for using this shit because ""we lost control of those tools long ago, and who knows might be using them, but it's not us because wikileaks caught us and we learnt our lessons...plus remember we are retarded!""



Now, let's go back to when Assange panicked and dropped those pre-commits and encrypted insurance files. At that time his deadman's switch was engaged, and all of the keys were dumped into the Bitcoin blockchain. It is my belief that the substance of the wikileaks from today are contianed in the original insurance files. There have been quiet projects going on to unlock those files, despite them going to great pains to prevent it. I don't know how successful they were, but we can suppose that the CIA expected someone to be successful. 


So, this information was already compromised. Releasing it now under their controlled narrative doesn't hurt them. And, just like the NSA, these are likely all of their old techniques and they have long since developed new ones.

Today by contrast it costs $15,000 in lost opportunity cost to write a block to the blockchain. transactions are not free the risk of abuse is non existent.

BU makes the soft fork limit user configurable, if BS/Core developers don't like it they can remove it all together - but to claim it's a consensus rule is nonsense - it's a soft fork rule and it's not been needed or used until now and it's now being used for the wrong reasons.

ETH, BTC + Tezos - Protocol Level Coins

He then explains that he thinks the billion dollar market which cryptocurrency currently resides at will increase to a trillion dollar cap in then next 5-10 years and therefore he's very excited.

He notes that this space is very new and it is still risky but the rewards far outweigh the risk which is why he speculates there are so many people entering and embracing the technology.

Probably the most crucial thing he says which I found interesting is that he believes like other digi currencies before, the PROTOCOL of the system is much more beneficial than the Applications upon them. He thinks Ethereum will be more valuable than the tokens built upon them and therefore it should be worthwhile to invest in ETH while feasible. He does note however that since tokens are growing and ICO's are able to be funded simply by presenting a unique idea, there will potentially be a few 'Unicorns' amongst the pack which could return 1000s% on investments.

He says that HTTPS and TCP/IP if it was possible to invest in these back in the day they would bring much more return than something along the lines of Twitter or FB and while noting that some people made a lot of money initally investing in coinbase, it was around the time BTC was 5$~ and they most likely could have made more by simply putting that investment straight into the currency (Bitcoin) rather than the application (Coinbase).

Regardless he says the future looks bright and that it will be major when we can get people who aren't weird cryptonerds such as ourselves, on board and using the technology. Everyone will go crazy when they find out a 17 year old made millions investing in cryptocurrencies and this kind of engagement could work out as a positive incline for ETH and cryptocurrency growth.

That's the major stuff that I thought was interesting, apologies if I left out anything else of note worthy caliber!",2017-03-08 05:50:07

- Literally dozens of 1000.00000 BTC exactly buy orders, which were usually fully filled and not pulled, started popping up in those weeks, the last of which we saw yesterday before the drop started.  This basically never happened before, never 1000BTC exactly and big walls usually pulled.  Combine this with the uncanny and creepy way the market basically never dipped at all, every single solitary dip barring one was voraciously eaten up with higher lows.  Would someone really spend $20m++ across several exchanges, often market buying or with limit orders above spot, just to fakeout the market into thinking they were AP's buying baskets?

- The above corresponding with the extremely abnormal occurrence of traditionally bearish non-leverage exchanges like BitStamp and Gemini leading the price action upwards, with huge volumes.

- At 2am this morning SEC passed an emergency super-accelerated-approved-in-advance order, about ETFs needing to monitor their indexes for fuckery (aka dont be shitmex/OKcoin, not even once).  Look at this wording in the conclusion at the bottom! ""IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,44 that the proposed rule change (SR-BatsBZX-2016-80), as modified by Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, be, and hereby is, approved on an accelerated basis."" aka ""shits approved already deal with it""
https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/batsbzx/2017/34-80169.pdf

- Withdrawals happening historically a few business days out from deadline at worst, while approvals often happen later.  5 hours left and a denial becomes very unlikely.

- Apart from the attendance list and the odd 8 day delay in the memo (0 day delay in previous memo!), the fact that the changes submitted were almost literally nothing, and in fact bullish (have more BTC at first).  AKA smoothing over details.

- The fact that the SEC was very transparent about the main risks and problems they saw with approving the ETF in the filings so far, and those issues were that China controlled too much trading volume, and induced too much volatility. Those both became non issues with the PBoC changes.

- Outright BTC love from Kara Stein, and strong low-regulation stance from Piwowar, in line with the Trump presidency's agenda.  ""[T]he Commission should take the lead regulatory role in the FinTech space.""  and talking about something else ""It should not be up to a government agency to withhold something like this from the public."".

- Weekend auction volume for Gemini going up from an average of literally ~0, ,to several hundred after the meeting.  Followed by record volume on gemini auctions IN BITCOIN, while at all time high prices.  And widespread reports of there being a completely dried up supply of OTC bitcoin available anywhere.  
https://geminiauctionhistory.bitballoon.com/

- ""The man"" / banks / NWO / global elite won't allow bitcoin.   Well, these ""all powerful"" elites hate Trump even more than they hate bitcoin, fought tooth and nail to prevent his election (and brexit and soon to be le pen and many more), and they couldn't even stop that.  This is now the SEC under Trump, a complete outsider who almost the entire establishment is trying their hardest to destroy.

- Hardly anyone seems to disagree that the downside will be small or temporary, and the upside will be gigantic.  Still with the price rise in the past few weeks, we only need approval odds to be say 30% to be +EV in the immediate short term.  You don't need to be 100% sure it's being approved, anything over ""low chance"" is just splitting hairs and longing is incredibly profitable.  

- So much more.  I'm only sharing this because I'm at my decided upon risk limit for my overall income/bankroll/utility curve.  I can't invest any more without being irresponsible.  Kinda wish I was single so I could put more in at a higher leverage but this is it lol.  The SEC is shining flashing neon lights saying ""ETF APPROVED!"" and most people are completely ignoring it and just resorting to their gut feelings or weak outdated reasoning from months ago.  FWIW I thought the odds of approval were about 25% a few months ago also, but one after another big changes kept happening which dramatically increased the odds, and my approval estimate kept going up.

dep7k24,Belfrey,43,"Here are some of the problems with BU and the reasons to support segwit as I understand them.

1) there is a quadratic hash validation function that causes larger blocks to take exponentially longer to validate. If the blocksize cap is raised, even modestly, it becomes possible for a miner to create an ""attack block"" that takes the network longer than 10 minutes to validate. Segwit fixes this, BU doesn't. 

With the way BU works, this vulnerability could make it possible for a small group of miners to constantly push the blocksize higher. There is also an much larger likelihood of selfish mining, and a higher risk of orphaned blocks/chains. Basically the blocksize debate becomes an endless problem that is a threat to network function, with a serious tendency toward centralization.

2) If I conserve blockspace by limiting my transactions, I do not get to later reap the benefits of my efforts in lower fees. My efforts just benefit those who are hogging the blockspace right now - this is a tragedy of the commons sort of problem.

Savers and low volume users are very likely more valuable in the space than say a casino that creates a mountain of onchain transactions. So pushing for larger blocks so that a casino can use the network to scale their business and attract a bunch of people more interested in gambling than saving - while at the same time making it more expensive for the average hodler to run a node or use bitcoin is problematic. Obviously we want as many people as possible to use bitcoin (and I have nothing against gambling), but the potential to reward some users at the expense of others should be a concern. 

With segwit the number of on-chain transactions is doubled and can be further increased in a myriad of ways that also improve privacy and fungibility. More importantly the LN allows large volume players to scale their business by running LN nodes without imposing costs on anyone else, which transforms them into valuable network assets rather than just blockchain hogs. A large LN node can ease the demand for blockspace while also improving privacy and fungibility.  

3) adding another participant to the bitcoin space comes with a cost, that cost can either be borne by the new participant in the event that they run a full node, or it can be borne by others in the event that they choose a lite client. Increasing the cost of full node operation with the goal of attracting new participants is like increasing the minimum seed rate in a file sharing network with no restriction on the number of leechers and expecting the network to function better.

4) there is already a 2nd layer to the bitcoin space that currently consists of a bunch of custodial KYC/AML compliant companies - Lightning channels reduce the need for these custodial relationships, reduce the need for trust, and actually decentralize the 2nd layer. Scaling via blocksize alone does nothing to facilitate instant transactions or decentralize the second layer.

5) a hard fork will wipe out roughly a third of the full nodes on the network before we even see the impact of the increased data transfer costs. Segwit makes it possible for all nodes to remain, and it makes the network transition to new software a much smoother process. It allows for differentiation in the size and cost of full node operation, not only can old nodes remain, but those who believe larger blocks are the best way to scale could mine and validate extension blocks of any size they'd like. This and the LN are the exact sort of things necessary to solve the socialized node problem which is the source of the tragedy of the commons mentioned above.

6) segwit has been extremely well tested and has the attention and support of well over a hundred developers both directly, and in the form of outside wallets and services. BU has about 8 developers, has not been well tested, and has almost zero support from any outside wallets and services.

deoq0nj,tophernator,40,"&gt; It doesn't make sense to stall progress because of bad feelings about what could have been.

It does make sense if you don't believe the lack of progress over the last two years is accidental. 

The lack of a blocksize fork for the last two years has created an artificial capacity crisis. Somehow very smart people like Greg, Luke, and the rest of Blockstream's stakeholders couldn't see this coming and spent all this time claiming that blocks were nowhere near full so there was no urgency to do anything.

Luckily now that we've hit this totally unforeseeable wall SegWit is here to save the day (in a small and temporary way) so we'd better activate it. And what's more Blockstream has been working on off-chain scaling solutions for the last couple of years, they just need SegWit to activate so they can deploy their lightning network. 

What luck that all the politics, infighting, and *totally unpredictable* steady growth in Bitcoin transactions has led to a situation that just so happens to fit perfectly with the plans of the private company that employs virtually all the most vocal critics of those hardfork proposals.

We should definitely continue to follow Gregory Maxwell's scaling roadmap. He certainly doesn't have any conflict of interest and we can totally trust that the vaguely referenced future blocksize hardfork will actually be implemented... at some point... after an open-ended list of other changes...

... THEN there is an easy, already-in-the-code way to stay on the &gt;1mb chain: just call invalidateblock with the hash of one of the 1mb chain blocks.

------------

All of that said: there has always been worries about 'what if somebody causes a really huge chain re-org'  -- e.g. they spend five or ten million dollars to produce 144 empty blocks faster than the network and then cause chaos by unconfirming a day's worth of transactions.

I think if that happened (extremely unlikely, in my opinion) everybody would just invalidateblock the big re-org and go about their business, and then agree that big re-orgs due to 'surprise' chains are simply unacceptable.

And yes, that does contradict the technical definition of 'bitcoin' I proposed a little while ago. Modifying that definition to have a notion of '.... and doesn't invalidate settled transaction history' is probably the right approach, but 'settled transaction history' is a pretty fuzzy concept.

It's honorable that BitPay tries to solve the issue with their own bitcoin client proposal, but the impact is zero. It's looks more like a hobby to keep their developers entertained.

The bottom line is this: Bitcoin Core + SegWit is becoming increasingly unlikely. Core minions may believe something else, but if you leave the bubble for one moment, reality looks quite different. It would be a miracle if SegWit gets activated. Many vocal Core developers burned bridges while the other side tried to compromise and waited patiently. I assume Andreas stopped to demo live Bitcoin transactions in front of his audience. Businesses are suffering, getting drowned with support tickets and high fees (of course for Henry no issue). On top of that, prominent Core developers were saying that everything is working fine.

Now Roger gets blamed for blocking SegWit with his gigantic 2.3% global pool hashrate and other miners get verbally assaulted why they don't run SegWit on their machines. Their machines! Apparently, Core minions have short memories and accepting now any radical measure ([UASF](https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-miners-worried-about-a-user-activated-fork-propose-synthetic-fork/)) to kick out miners which don't run SegWit.

dep5mr2,mallocdotc,27,"There are a few points at play here and I'll break them down tweet by tweet where I deem them important to note:


&gt; 3/ Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) is a compatible hardfork upgrade to Bitcoin. This means that the BU chain will accept an all 1mb-blocks chain.
&gt;
&gt; 4/ Whereas the current Bitcoin Core (BC) chain will not accept any &gt;1mb blocks in its chain.

Here he's making an assumption that a hardfork = a chain split. That's not true and he's aware, but he's setting up his narrative.

&gt; 5/ It’s extremely risky for GDAX or any exchanges to support a BU chain as is. It is unstable, because at any time, it can be annihilated.

Outline a non-existent risk, and use words like annihilated to install fear, uncertainty, doubt.

&gt; 6/ What this means is that if at any point, the BC chain grows longer (in PoW) than the BU chain, the BU client will reorg to the BC chain.

Still harping on like there will be two chains, not two clients. Also assuming that PoW would catch up at a later date. BC at this point would be a valueless alt-coin. They won't have majority economic or miner support.

&gt; 7/ All existing BU transactions will be dropped in favor for whatever is in the BC chain. And GDAX would be on the hook for everything!

Make it seem like there's an unacceptable risk to the company. Note he's still using ""BU transactions"" and not blocks larger than 1 mb. These are divisive tactics. He's making the scenario seem like an ""us vs them"" situation. It's not.

&gt; 8/ Practically how this would happen is if the market values the BC chain more, the hashrate will go towards that chain and make it longer.

No mention of ""BU chain"" having major market value, even though a hashrate-majority chain-split would make the ""BU chain"" the longer PoW chain. Assuming ""BC chain"" will have higher market value. 

&gt; 9/ There is absolutely no way I would let GDAX make the reckless decision of supporting BU code as is.

Here it comes. His true intentions. He's now talking BU *code*, not larger blocks or emergent consensus. Implying at this point if core released code with EC and/or larger blocks, GDAX would support the code.

&gt; 10/ The only solution to this problem is for the BU team to release code that locks in a block after the fork has taken place.

A solution to a problem that doesn't exist, creating his next idea: make sure BU is always an alt-coin. Miners will have no incentive to swap chains, and the chain with the lowest PoW will hemorrhage miners who won't be willing to lose money at the time of a fork.  

&gt; 12/ This means that whatever BTC is traded on GDAX at the time of fork must be the BC chain. And BU chain is an altcoin that forks 
&gt;
&gt; 13/ When and if GDAX does add the BU chain, it would by necessity be listed as BitcoinUnlimited with another symbol like BTU for example.

Again, assuming a chain split. And assuming that the split with the lowest PoW will be BU. 


-----------------------

This is good. It shows that they're scared and scrambling. They're still trying to set the narrative for core to remain in control, but they're coming to realise that the blocksize debate is coming to a close in the form of emergent consensus. Don't be surprised if they come out with EC code of their own and still try to push the SWSF narrative.

The real fight is for Segwit and node control. They'll still push for SWSF, but we mustn't let this dangerous anyone-can-spend, can-never-be-rolled-back SegWit spaghetti code be implemented. Flextrans is provably more resilient, measurably more efficient, and overwhelmingly more secure.",2017-03-09 15:14:51
depfuk4,phizik2,26,"I think as the time goes on bitcoin's goals and monero's goals are going to diverge a lot. Monero is the hardcore private, fungible coin who's goal is to be digital cash first and foremost. Arguably bitcoin's biggest perk is the fact it is completely transparent. Obviously this is a very poor option for digital cash or financial privacy but it is greatly beneficial purely for public knowledge that cannot be censored or altered.

I think bitcoin's use as a transparent immutable ledger is quite powerful to protect knowledge and ownership of assets. You have your vehicles, houses, etc etc large assets to prove ownership. the #1 use for bitcoin imo will be to protect knowledge, history, science etc things that will try to be altered by bad actors and push their agenda like oppressive governments, corporations etc.

deqi8ov,HuggableBear,410,"I'm going to copypasta my comment from a few days ago when people were sucking Manchin's dick.

He's a fucking snake.  Don't buy it.  He knows he's up against a *hard* re-election in two years.  Let me tell you about Joe Manchin.

Now, I will preface this up-front by saying that he is probably a legit Blue Dog democrat.  He's from coal country and smack in the middle of the bible belt.  He's passively pro-life and wants a balanced budget, is pro-2A (although he wants *crazy strict* background checks) and anti-climate change (not as an idea, just against the regulations because he's from coal country).  But he's also about as strongly anti-drug as you can get, even to the point of wanting to regulate Bitcoin and make drug scheduling much more severe in almost all cases. He is a full-throated supporter of ObamaCare.

Now that you know his positions, let's look at his life.

His father and grandfather were both successful businessmen in his home town.  Oh hey, look at that, they also were both mayor of that same town.  And his uncle?  Yeah, his uncle was a state congressman and secretary of state.  He's been part of a political family since birth.  He's been in politics since 1982.  *35 fucking years* since this man has held a job in the private sector, and even those jobs were working for the long-established family business.  He has literally never had to sit down and interview for a job.  He's never had to put together a resume.  

He has held damn near every governmental office in WV.  House, senate, secretary of state, two terms as governor (when it seemed like there was a scandal every other week), and now senator.  We'll get to his senate seat momentarily, but first let's talk about his daughter.

His daughter went to WVU and got a Political Science bachelor's.  big surprise, huh?  But wait, there's more!  Right out of college she started working for a huge pharmaceutical firm called Mylan (remember that name).  While working there she started work on her MBA, but never finished it.  But that didn't stop the president of the college, a longtime friend of Joe Manchin and a politician himself, from just giving it to her anyway!  How convenient!  Oh, did I mention that he was also a lobbyist for Mylan?  Yep, that Mylan.  The one where Heather Manchin was employed.  Now let's fast forward to 2016 and find out what Heather's doing now.  Oh look, she's the fucking CEO of Mylan now!  What a coincidence that the daughter of the governor/secretary of state/US senator of WV managed to become CEO of a massive pharma company on the strength of her political science degree and an unearned MBA.  How lucky for her.  CEO of Mylan.  Wait a minute.  That name is familiar.  Mylan...Weren't they in the news recently? Oh that's right!  They're the ones that sell EpiPens and jacked up the price by 500%!  But wait, it's okay, because a few months later they also introduced a generic version of the EpiPen that's half that price (only triple the original price for those keeping track).  How generous of them to cut the price by 50%!  What a wonderful company that's run by the daughter of the former congressman/state senator/secretary of state/governor/current US senator from the company's home state.  I'm sure everything that happened to get us to this point was all completely above board.

But anyway, back to good old Joe Manchin, current hero of The_Donald because he's not toeing the Democrat party line.

Let's take a look at how he was first elected to US Senate.  You may be familiar with a senator named Robert Byrd.  [You know, this guy?](http://i.magaimg.net/img/5j5.jpg)  yeah, *that* Robert Byrd.  Well, he was the US senator from West Virginia for about 137 years.  In 2010, he finally kicked the bucket.  Guess who was governor at the time and got to appoint his successor?  Yep, our boy Joe Manchin.  Now, the Grand Kleagle's health had been failing for a while and the media had been asking Gov. Manchin about who he would appoint to the seat if he died and he continually said he wouldn't appoint himself, and he was true to his word when it happened.

No, instead of appointing himself he appointed a 35 year old legal aide from his office with no political experience and no name recognition who could just step aside when the election was held.  About a week after appointing this nobody to the vacant seat, he announced his intention to run for that seat in the general election.  Big surprise, huh?  What do you think his odds were as the single biggest name in WV politics and the sitting governor?  Yeah, he won easily.  Shocking, I know.  He also won re-election in 2012 as the incumbent.  Again, shocking.

Now, I will say again that I do respect the man's *positions.*  I do not, however, agree with *how* he holds them.  He tends to wait until he sees which way the wind is blowing, *then* makes his stand, rather than stand up early and be the one at the vanguard.  In short, he always plays it safe and never takes risky positions.

In other words, *he acts like a lifetime politician.*

Make no mistake, folks.  Regardless of whether you agree with his positions or not, the man is as establishment as they come.  He is a fucking *lifer* and his corruption runs deep, it just hasn't come to light because he hasn't been a national name for very long *and both sides want his vote*.

But don't fool yourself just because he's saying some things you like right now.  Joe Manchin doesn't want to MAGA.  He doesn't want to Drain the Swamp.

Joe Manchin *is the swamp.*

SPEZ:  Just want to point out in case it wasn't clear that this guy *gave up* a Governorship to run for US Senate.  *Nobody* does that.  He is positioning himself for a Presidential run in the near future, mark my words.",2017-03-10 10:51:38

(2) Run a full node, preferable at home-- nodes on VPS services add little to nothing to the network's decentralization. One of the arguments used against segwit is that it take a long time to be adopted widely and have an effect. ~78% disproves that, but 99% would disprove it better. Using wallet software from [segwit supporting parties](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/) is also good, but what wallet you run is far less visible than just running nodes are, independent of segwit the robustness of Bitcoin is improved by having more node operators.

(2b) If you have problems running a node, the developers need to hear about it so we can improve the software to eliminate those problems. Don't just assume we know. We may not, or we might have lost track of your issue.

So if the third party handling the Bitcoins screws up, your investment can go to zero. At least if you hold by yourself, you won't be a huge target, whereas exchanges and ETFs will be a prime target due to the massive amount of money they hold.

detuuf0,nopara73,43,"Hi guys, I am one of the developers behind Breeze Wallet, and also Chief Redditor of TumbleBit:) I would like to share some comments on this.  
  
I am working on TumbleBit, a trustless Bitcoin mixer, where not even the Tumbler can deanonymize you. I am not positive as to whether it can solve any scaleability issues, but that's an other topic. At TumbleBit, we have a couple of useability issues like you have to use Bitcoin Core, you have to have a different output wallet, you have to do everything with a terminal etc., and nobody can work on it full time since we are not getting paid for it.  
  
To sum up: we could use a little more man-power. I had the idea of contacting Stratis if they can lend us some. Stratis is working on a Bitcoin full-node in the same language TumbleBit is written, so they have a competent developer team.  
What they gain for it is marketing. An altcoin providing a Bitcoin wallet is a great marketing opportunity. We can outsource to them the GUI development, marketing, some code review and some testing. It's a win-win. Background story finished.  
  
About the wallet:  
We are planning 4 stages at the moment (at least me):  
1. Full-block SPV wallet.  
2. TumbleBit integration.  
3. Add Stratis wallet.  
4. Decentralized btc &lt;-&gt; strat exchange, based on TumbleBit.  
  
**1. Full-block SPV wallet**  
I [went to great lengths](https://medium.com/@nopara73/bitcoin-privacy-landscape-in-2017-zero-to-hero-guidelines-and-research-a10d30f1e034) to figure out what is the lightest way to preserve maximal privacy when retrieving information from the blockchain. My conclusion was: if you are not using a full node, then all your addresses are inevitably linked together by various third parties. Since Bitcoin Core receives all the information the Bitcoin network has, therefore nobody can figure out what information your wallet is interested in.  
This can be achieved in a lighter way by building a full-block SPV wallet which downloads blocks from the creation of the wallet, notes the transactions it is interested in and throws away the rest. Jonas Schnelli is also working on a wallet like this basedon Core.  
Therefore (1) if privacy is crucial for you and (2) you are not currently running a full node, you might want to consider changing when Core or we come out with our full-spv wallet, even if you are not interested in using TumbleBit.  
  
**2. TumbleBit integration**  
We are going to integrate [TumbleBit Classic Tumbler mode](https://medium.com/@nopara73/understanding-tumblebit-part-2-the-endgame-instant-anonymous-scaleable-payment-system-on-top-479e7eb9ca24). 
  
**3. Add Stratis wallet**  
I opt not to comment on this. We don't accept money from Stratis, therefore we are not going to do this. The development of this part is entirely up to them.  
  
**4. Decentralized BTC &lt;-&gt; STRAT exchange**  
This is an interesting topic. In theory you could exchange different cryptocurrencies with TumbleBit, exactly the same way you are exchanging bitcoins with it. We'll see how this topic will evolve as it's not a priority right now.  ",2017-03-12 21:48:18

What's most disturbing to me is that nowhere does the core cheerleaders like /u/nullc condemn the fact that a mining admin is malleating chains of tx's that aren't his. Who's were they?

detpqnw,thcymos,33,"Among other reasons:

It doesn't address the magnitude of scaling challenges facing Bitcoin. Segwit blocks would be filled within weeks, if not instantly, and there is no ""2^nd Segwit"" to be done. Core is left to tease the possibility of a hard fork to increase total block size down the road, without committing to anything, because they have no intention of doing such a thing. Pinning the future of Bitcoin around Lightning is questionable at best, profoundly dumb at worst.

Segwit's use of its 4MB block weight is inefficient. The block size constant can just be increased to 4MB outright and each block would contain at least twice as many transactions as a Segwit block. Malleability, not the most pressing issue by any means, can be fixed in other ways down the road.

The developers behind it are incredibly disingenuous. In light of Segwit's failure to reach even 30% consensus, Greg tries to save face by claiming he doesn't care if it activates or not. Yet his [long diatribes](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5yojyp/on_the_recent_bout_of_malleated_transactions/), including his comments in that thread, show otherwise. Unsurprisingly, they whitewash a fervent Core supporter's malleability attack yesterday, a laughable attempt to push SegWit, oblivious to the fact that all it will do is further turn people off SegWit. When the mempool fills up, they're quick to blame ""BU supporters pushing an agenda"" without any proof, yet when a Core fanatic provably attacks the network, they yawn.

The real truth is, outside of BTCC &amp; BitFury, two pools both compromised by investors in Blockstream, Segwit has almost no support among miners -- around 7% without them. Ouch, Greg. And likely little support among nodes either, as it's trivially easy to gin up ""70% node support"" when you already own thousands of Core nodes before the Segwit rollout.",2017-03-12 17:05:51

&gt;It’s critical that you forward port 8333 on your router to the IP address of the computer that is running your node. If you don’t do this, you will not be contributing your bandwidth to the network and should not run the node. You can check that your port forwarding works using the “check node” tool on [Bitnodes](https://bitnodes.21.co) when your node is running. If you’re running a software firewall on the machine running the node, you’ll also want to ensure that you create a rule to open up port 8333.

detsee5,SirEDCaLot,27,"There's a number of criticisms.  This is a brief summary, if you're curious then you should do your own research as there are numerous medium posts by people much smarter than me.  

For everyone who will downvote me- please note **I am just reciting common arguments against SegWit, not actually arguing against SegWit.  Please don't downvote me.**

- Not a good scaling solution.  SegWit only achieves scaling benefits for SegWit transactions, if people keep using standard P2PKH transactions (what most normal transactions are today) there is zero scaling benefit.  The amount of scaling benefit depends on how many transactions are SegWit.  If all transactions are simple payments (not scripts or multisig transactions), the result is about 1.6 MB blocks.  
Also, there's an efficiency question- current SegWit transactions are slightly larger than standard P2PKH transactions (although there are plans to fix this in the future) so even at 1.6 MB you don't get as many transactions per block as a 'raw' hard fork block size increase to 1.6 MB.  

- Adds technical debt.  This means adding things that future Bitcoin development will have to spend dev time supporting forever, even if we decide someday that SegWit was a bad idea.  Specifically, SegWit adds a whole new type of transaction based on P2SH, which is a fair bit more complex than standard transactions.  

- Risky to do as soft fork.  As a soft fork (that is, doesn't require everyone to upgrade at once) you have the situation where any NON-SegWit nodes or miners will see a SegWit transaction as an 'anyone can spend' transaction.  This opens up the potential for problems.  If SegWit is implemented as a hard fork, this risk is removed.  

- Possible future attack risk.  SegWit takes the bulk of the signature data and moves it outside the block itself.  For a complex multisig transaction, that signature data could be fairly large, meaning that a 1MB block might contain an extra 3MB of signatures for 4MB total.  If we do a future hardfork to say, 8MB blocks, that would mean someone could attack the network by creating a ton of large multisig transactions and thus 32MB blocks (because each 1MB of block data could have up to 3MB of signature data).  

- Too much stuff at once.  SegWit tries to be a scaling solution, and a new transaction type, and a fix to transaction malleability, and a basis for Lightning (more on that in a sec), etc etc all at once.  These things should be split into individual changes rather than an 'all or nothing' deal.  

------

There are also criticisms of SegWit that are not related to SegWit itself.  

For example, one of SegWit's secondary purposes is to lay the groundwork for 'Lightning Network', a proposed future scaling solution that would allow a great many transactions to happen very quickly outside of the blockchain, but using blockchain-based smart contracts as the anchor.  It's controversial just like SegWit- some people think it's a great idea because it could enable hundreds of transactions per second without ballooning the blockchain, other people think it's a bad idea because it arguably centralizes things due to having 'supernodes' which act as transaction hubs (this is a complex subject which deserves a big post of its own).  

Also, a lot of people are unhappy with the Bitcoin-Core developers.  They feel that a large number of people want a simple hard fork to increase the block size, but Core refuses to provide it, instead pushing complex 2nd layer solutions like Lightning and other 'sidechains' (2nd layer solutions that run transactions off the main blockchain).  There's accusations of impropriety because many Core developers are employed by Blockstream, a private company that develops blockchain-related tech and arguably could stand to profit from sidechains.  
The feeling among these people is that Bitcoin-Core is resisting scaling so as to push transactions onto sidechains like Lightning, rather than letting Bitcoin keep working at full power and letting sidechains compete on their own merits.  [This comic](http://i.imgur.com/DF17gFE.jpg) sums that up nicely.  
Since the bitcoin subreddit split in 2015, there's been a LOT of bad blood and further accusations of censorship...

I hope that helps answer your question!

The one thing you should really take away though is that this is a very complex issue, with a lot of technical and political issues involved.  I suggest avoid the propaganda, both here and in the 'other' subreddit, and do your own research / come to your own opinion.

of course these tweets are not based on facts. It is an intellectual game. The purpose is to show how a smart, almost undetectable social attack on bitcoin might be executed.

There is huge amounts of evidence that people use this strategy right now to discredit bitcoin and pump altcoins. Roger Ver and the single most active r\btc user u/seweso are the best examples. Seweso [publicly announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4onxt1/hello_ethereum_community/) the sale of all his BTC for ETH 8 months ago and is pushing hard for Bitcoin unlimited ever since. Spending many hours every day spreading lies about core and segwit on reddit, twitter and co. u/jstolfi is another proclaimed enemy of bitcoin who uses the tactic outlined in the tweets, to [damage bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1693841.0). Very actively pushing for any consensus breaking proposal as well.

In short, we have unrefutable evidence for this attack being executed in a somewhat uncoordinated way. We have lots of puzzle pieces which indicate a more coordinated execution by actors like Roger and Jihan. 

It is entirely possible, that this kind of attack is also pursued by much more powerful actors right now or might very well be in the future.

devak98,jonny1000,76,"&gt; How is this hostile? 

I would say it is hostile due to the lack of basic safety mechanisms, despite some safety mechanisms being well known.  For example:

* BU has no miner threshold for activation

* BU has no grace period to allow nodes to upgrade

* BU has no checkpoint (AKA wipe-out protection), therefore users could lose funds

* BU has no replay attack prevention

Other indications BU is hostile include:

* The push for BU has continued, despite not before fixing critical fundamental bugs (for example the median EB attack)

* BU makes multi conf double spend attacks much easier, yet despite this people still push for BU

* BU developers/supporters have acted in a non transparent manner, when one of the mining nodes produced an invalid block, they tried to cover it up or even compare it to normal orphaning.  When the bug that caused the invalid block was discovered, there was no emergency order issued recommending people to stop running BU

* Submission of improvement proposals to BU is banned by people who are not members of a private organisation


Combined, I would say this indicates BU is very hostile to Bitcoin

&gt; Miners are free to run the software they want and vote how they want.

Yes miners are free to run software they want.  In my view they SHOULD not run BU.  However they CAN run BU.  Just because they CAN does not mean they SHOULD",2017-03-13 22:47:17
deujsbn,Mr_Yukon_C,74,"And let's be clear.  The term ""alt-coin"" has long since morphed into something with negative connotations.

i.e. It's really used to disparage the coin that's be referred to as such.  Meaning, the coin literally branched/forked the Bitcoin codebase and made some minor tweaks and tried to pass that off as something new.

Yes, that all happened...and it happened a LOT with the alt-coin craze/boom after Bitcoin mooned the first time.  Nearly all of those were nothing but unoriginal, non-innovative, pump 'n dump, get-rich-quick scams.

Ethereum is none of the above.  Ethereum's protocol and codebase were purposefully developed and coded *from scratch*.

There are two ways to increase capacity.

2) Alternatively some current Bitcoin problems can be fixed with a simple update giving a roughly double of capacity (Segwit) and then a new system be built on top of Bitcoin (Lightning).  Lightning runs largely independent of the current miners.  Segwit as currently coded requires at least 95% of miners to agree.  Ultimately a block size increase (hard fork) may still be required if Bitcoin becomes wildly popular.

&gt; So why has he proposed a hard fork to raise the blocksize later? Was he schizophrenic? How do you reconcile your belief with that? It follows that he must have been fine with hard fork to raise the limit when he proposed exactly that, no?

Satoshi was a real person (or people), and changed his opinions with time as he learned more about how his invention behaved (as have all developers who have worked with it since). Originally, he expected hardforks to be impossible. By late 2010, he considered that they would be possible. Even in late 2010, he didn't think a block size increase was a good idea (he backed up /u/theymos telling people not to use jgarzik's change), just that it would be needed eventually (all current devs agree).

Below is the original post on the DNC hack that began much of the conversation about the attribution of these atacks

https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/

&gt;CrowdStrike Services Inc., our Incident Response group, was called by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the formal governing body for the US Democratic Party, to respond to a suspected breach. We deployed our IR team and technology and immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network – COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR. 

&gt;FANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as rundll32.exe “C:\Windows\twain_64.dll”

As discussed above these tools are indicative of Fancy Bear and have appeared wherever they have been involved. Its also important to note that less developed versions of these tools are covered in that initial fireeye report and kaspersky has an article that allows one to translate between names 

https://securelist.com/blog/research/72924/sofacy-apt-hits-high-profile-targets-with-updated-toolset/

&gt;Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.

These implants would later become the newer SeaDuke and SeaDaddy implants discussed in other sources.

&gt;SPLM (aka XAgent, aka CHOPSTICK)

The Malware Crowdstrike calls XAgent is called CHOPSTICK extensively in fireeye sources.

Another security company, Fidelis, corroborated the CrowdStrike account and came to the same conclusion

http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/dnc_update.html

&gt;Who is responsible for the DNC hack? Based on our comparative analysis we agree with CrowdStrike and believe that the COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR APT groups were involved in successful intrusions at the DNC. The malware samples contain data and programing elements that are similar to malware that we have encountered in past incident response investigations and are linked to similar threat actors.

&gt;In addition to CrowdStrike, several other security firms have analyzed and published findings on malware samples that were similar and in some cases nearly identical to those used in the DNC incident. Many of these firms attributed the malware to Russian APT groups.

I would also like to reiterate that none of this malware, or afaik exploits from it, is found in the recent Vault7 releases. If you really believe that consistent use of malware does not constitute credible evidence then you may regard this evidence as inconclusive at worst (you shouldn't really believe this but ok). However below is evidence that, likely the bitly account above, is not dependent on malware used. 

***

The following articles are by ThreatConnect and Fidelis (mentioned above) and detail how the DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) was hacked by Fancy Bear

https://threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-it-itch-they-cant-scratch/

Same post on the fidelis blog if you like them better:

http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/08/fancy-bear-has-an-it-itch-that-they-cant-scratch.html

The findings are detailed in the article and summarized below

&gt;First, the registrant – fisterboks@email[.]com – behind the spoofed domain secure.actblues[.]com has registered three other domains, all of which have been linked to FANCY BEAR by German Intelligence (BfV).  

&gt;Second, the timing is consistent with an adversary reacting to heightened focus after the DNC breach was announced.

&gt;Third, the two name servers used by fisterboks@email[.]com to register four suspicious domains are the same ones used by frank_merdeux@europe[.]com, the registrant of misdepatrment[.]com, a spoofed domain that previously resolved to a FANCY BEAR command and control IP address used in the DNC breach.

&gt;Finally, a pattern exists where the actor is creating fictitious registrant email addresses by leveraging free webmail providers, such as 1&amp;1’s Mail.com or Chewie Mail, to register faux domains which contain minor character transpositions or modified spellings.  Additionally, the actor is favoring registrars and hosting providers that seemingly provide anonymity by accepting bitcoin for payment.

These points tie this attack to both the DNC hack as well as the attacks on the German Government that were detailed in the excellent Fireeye report above.

The following article details Fancy Bear attempts to hack a group investigating the attack on flight MH17, another example where Russia is uniquely motivated

https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/russia-hacks-bellingcat-mh17-investigation/

&gt;Higgins shared data with ThreatConnect that indicates Bellingcat has come under sustained targeting by Russian threat actors, which allowed us to identify a 2015 spearphishing campaign that is consistent with FANCY BEAR’s tactics, techniques, and procedures.

Another ThreatConnect post examines the hacks against WADA during the Russian doping scandal

https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/

The conclusion?

&gt;ThreatConnect’s Research team reviewed these domains and found that the sites were recently registered and their registration and hosting information are consistent with Russian FANCY BEAR tactics, techniques, and procedures 

&gt;The WADA and CAS-spoofing domains and activity most likely are intended to support Russian government intelligence collection and/or influence operations related to the WADA and CAS. Our assessment is based on the following findings:

&gt;1. The registration of these domains on August 3rd and 8th, 2016 are consistent with the timeline in which the WADA recommended banning all Russian athletes from the Olympic and Paralympic games.

&gt;2. The use of 1&amp;1 mail.com webmail addresses to register domains matches a TTP we previously identified for FANCY BEAR actors.

&gt;3. These domains were registered through ititch[.]com and domains4bitcoins[.]com, two registrars that accept Bitcoins for payments. The use of such registrars also matches an identified TTP for FANCY BEAR actors. Two of our previous blog posts also highlighted domains at the ITitch and Domains4bitcoins name servers and their associations to FANCY BEAR activity.

This post would not be complete without addressing the Guccifer 2.0 persona who claims to be a lone Romanian hacker responsible for the DNC hack. No facts line up with this assertion and researchers widely believe this to be Russian Counterintel.

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/guccifer-20-is-likely-a-russian-government-attempt-to-cover-up-their-own-hack

&gt;However, considering a long trail of breadcrumbs pointing back to Russia left by the hacker, as well as other circumstantial evidence, it appears more likely that Guccifer 2.0 is nothing but a disinformation or deception campaign by Russian state-sponsored hackers to cover up their own hack—and a hasty and sloppy one at that. 

Motherboard had an interview with Guccifer 2.0, the supposed Romanian Hacker, in which he did not speak good Romanian and did not know much about hacking

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-full-interview-transcript

ThreatConnect again has a good post on the more technical aspects of the Guccifer 2.0 illusion

https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/

&gt;In our initial Guccifer 2.0 analysis, ThreatConnect highlighted technical and non-technical inconsistencies in the purported DNC hacker’s story as well as a curious theme of French “connections” surrounding various Guccifer 2.0 interactions with the media. We called out these connections as they overlapped, albeit minimally, with FANCY BEAR infrastructure identified in CrowdStrike’s DNC report.

&gt;Now, after further investigation, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN service to communicate and leak documents directly with the media. We reached this conclusion by analyzing the infrastructure associated with an email exchange with Guccifer 2.0 shared with ThreatConnect by Vocativ’s Senior Privacy and Security reporter Kevin Collier. This discovery strengthens our ongoing assessment that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort and not an independent actor.

This analysis is somewhat circumstantial and not as compelling as the initial evidence that Fancy Bear is behind the hack but it is funny that Russia attempted to redirect suspicion with such a poorly prepared operation. 

***

**Final notes/TL;DR: The evidence presented in this post overwhelmingly establishes that Fancy Bear perpetrated the Podesta, DNC, and DCCC hacks and demonstrates that Fancy Bear is associated with the Russian Government. In order to reasonably disbelieve this you would need to believe that there is a massive international conspiracy involving not just the DNC, American Intelligence, and German Intelligence, but also many of the top private security companies that investigate APTs. These companies include Crowdstrike, ThreatConnect, Fidelis, SecureWorks, Trend Micro, Kaspersky, and Fireeye. The people of these companies have done amazing work and it is incredibly frustrating to still see ""there is no evidence of russian hacking"" over and over. Before anyone responds to this with the assertion that this evidence is not enough or does not demonstrate what I have claimed it does, I ask that they read and understand at least the majority of the sources I have provided here.**",2017-03-13 09:26:01

devg2qh,jeanduluoz,118,"There was a hacky fix to bitcoin in 2010 to prevent possible DDOSes. Previously, bitcoin had no blocksize limit at all, but has always been limited to 32MB by the data transfer protocol. 

a 1MB limit was introduced when blocks were around 0.1MB with the intention of preventing possible ""spam,"" with the intention to periodically raise it before we ever approached this limit.

This limit is basically a supply quota on the number of transactions the network can support. Think of a soviet manufacturing facility: ""you CANNOT make more than 100 widgets per hour, by order of the politburo!"" BU and other clients basically seek to fix this limit by making it market-based and dynamic, rather than a static, magic number. We're limited to 1MB of data per hour. If you want to get your transaction into the blockchain, you need to pay a fee premium to push someone else out.

Think of a bus - the bus is now full, and the bus developemnt company has a monopoly and doesn't want to make larger buses for all the riders. Their answer is, ""JUST PAY MORE FEES,"" which allows you to push someone off the bus. But there's a problem - you're pushing someone off every time someone else gets on, plus you're spending a lot more money for the privilege of riding. We should just make the bus bigger.

But a few devs forced out the original devs, founded a company called blockstream, and then bought out most of the remaining devs. They are committed to building ""blockchain solutions"" and have a lot of VC funding, worth about $76MM. 

They designed some ""second layer solutions"", which can be used by people who want some access or peg to bitcoin, without actually using bitcoin. Think of the way banks used to work on the gold standard. Your bank held gold, but they could also give you an ""IOU"" for the gold, which was cash. Lightning network and other off-chain solutions are these IOUs that are tied to bitcoin.

But blockstream has a problem - they thought that if everyone just uses bitcoin, there's no demand for their services. So they retained this spam limit and changed the public dialog to make up a bunch of propaganda that it's necessary for x,y,z reasons. Their plan was to FORCE people to use their solutions because they can control the bitcoin protocol, and if no one could use the bitcoin protocol, then everyone would have to use their products.

But obviously that's not how markets work - no one wants degraded second-layer services on a shitty blockchain that barely functions. So users have been substituting to other coins with smaller backlogs. So the market is routing around blockstream and looks like we'll just use another implementation. Private interests took over the primary bitcoin client? No problem, the market switches to a new client and other coins. 

The saddest part is that blockstream could have been a great company. There will OBVIOUSLY be demand for off-chain services for a valuable coin. They didn't need to cripple bitcoin to force demand into their products. It will never work and is the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face. I'm looking forward to second-layer solutions that are used voluntarily (rather than being forced to use them), and bitcoin working better at larger, dynamic blocksize limits.",2017-03-14 00:48:11

devl5q2,tobixen,49,"&gt; a 1MB limit was introduced when blocks were around 0.1MB with the intention of preventing possible ""spam,"" with the intention to periodically raise it before we ever approached this limit.

Satoshi piggybacked the block size limit together with other work in a commit, with no reference anywhere on his motivation for the block size limit.

Both Theymos (ref https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3giend/citation_needed_satoshis_reason_for_blocksize/ctygzmi/) and Gavin (ref http://gavinandresen.ninja/One-Dollar-Lulz) states that the block size limit was for preventing a DoS-attack, not for ""spam prevention"".  

Satoshi clearly said it could be raised in https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0 - but the only arguments put forth for keeping it back in 2010 was that it was ""not yet needed"" and ""a simple patch would be a network-incompatible upgrade"" (aka hard fork)

I've seen maxwell argumenting that Satoshi clearly meant the limit to be permanent.

The DoS attack vector has somehow been handled in BU (by parallell validation, orphaning blocks that takes too long time to validate, plus 1MB max transaction size).

dew40a1,nullc,43,"&gt; I was under the impression that BU simply removed the blocksize limit. 

The problem is that just totally removing the blocksize limit is obviously unworkable to anyone with enough engineering chops to actually make the change-- you can't build software that can reliably work where some clown can just dump a zettabyte on everyone and force them to take it.

So every one of these HF proposals so far has had to do something more than just eliminate the limit.

XT replaced the limit with a limit that starts at 8MB grows over time, becoming 8GB in a number of years, via BIP101.

""Classic"" replaced it with a 2MB limit plus some additional limits in the amount of signature hashing in a block, via BIP109.

(BIP109 was abandoned after segwit matched in a way that was non-disruptive, widely supported, and wouldn't split the network... and after it caused classic and unlimited to fork on testnet).

""Unlimited"" replaces the limit with a new consensus process called ""emergent consensus"" where the idea is that miners will basically hashpower war with each other over the consensus rules. And nodes will allow the majority hashpower to override them (subject to some ill-advised hysteresis that can be exploited to create network partitions).

What Unlimited is trying to resolve is the issue that even among people who agree that a larger limit makes sense, it can be hard to agree on what that limit should be-- especially since the actual science driven results, suggesting that 1-4 MB is the practical limit, are not politically welcome to them-- instead they propose handing over control to miners.  They justify this on the basis of a misunderstanding of Bitcoin, basically an argument that miners already control it.  Where others would point out that specifically because miners don't control it we can count on them to perform their function.

Perhaps unsurprisingly there are some miners that are all for being handed more control. ... though ultimately BU would be bad news for them, making them far more attractive targets for coercion.",2017-03-14 08:17:41

“It is just one guy. It’s all the same guy!” – Adam Back said in one of the more interesting statement of this undercover interview. “He has 80% of the ASIC production, ViaBTC, he’s an investor in. He’s not overtly blocking, e.g. with his own pools, but as a proxy war, the view and some evidence is that this is indeed what is happening.” – Back continued.

We asked for evidence. “I do not actually know you, to know that the conversation won’t be on pastebin at the end of the day… but there is evidence. Anyway, say it’s 2-3 guys. Still people can go talk to them.”

Bitmain has denied they have backed ViaBTC. BTC.TOP has stated none of their hashrate share is from Bitmain. Sources suggest part of the reason why Bitmain began mining Bitcoin Unlimited is because of what they see as unfounded accusations.

dewgcbv,zkatkin,41,"What is the point of this post? 

I've been around longer, and not sure I agree with the overall sentiment and your analysis of it. 

I think as this thing continues to grow a very detailed, nuanced approach to changes/enhancements to bitcoin is important - we have a lot at stake now. Have you read Vinny Lingham's blog posts in their entirety? From a hodler's perspective, I thought the ETF would be great (although I knew that big institutional money probably wouldn't be a good thing) after reading his work I was thoroughly convinced that the ETF was indeed bad for BTC and genuinely happy it didn't go through - even though that meant a (very temporary) dip in BTC price. 

On the volatility - it has come way down. I'm confused by this point in your OP. 

Finally, I have to agree with Vinny's breakdown of the way in which Bitcoin will grow and become (finally) adopted as a currency. What you have to understand is that the world is now looking at BTC as a disconnected store of value (think Gold/Silve - but BTC currently less manipulated) and that there are virtually no assets/currencies not pegged to U.S. interest rates. There's not just more at stake from a value position for all involved (HODLERs, miners, companies, etc.) but there are much larger market mechanics (and mischief) than your average r/bitcoiner is probably thinking of. I for one think a very slow and steady approach is the way to go. And if I can hold much of my financial networth (in theory) on a complete secure and protected device that bank runs can not touch - it's worth a higher transaction fee (for now - and this will be worked out). 

Without knowing much of the economics of mining (now) I have to think that we could all DO NOTHING, and see bitcoin triple/quadruple in a year because of larger macro economic trends across all countries (stemming in large part from changes to U.S. interest rates) - and I'd have to imagine the miners will be profiting from the increase in pricing/coin as well as the higher transaction fees.

dey7mz1,Ilogy,76,"&gt; I don't follow the bitcoin scaling controversy that closely

I think this is probably why you are under the impressions you just stated. It's relatively common. We are seeing a lot of people who haven't been following closely showing up puzzled why everyone can't just get along, or some variant thereof. 

What you describe, where people argued over technical disagreements was precisely how the scaling debate began . . . years ago. And it was how it played out for years. Core developers and the community would argue over technical disputes concerning the best way to scale Bitcoin. 

Slowly, over time, the frustration that was born out of these technical disputes grew and began to take on more political tones. The disagreements between developers became personal, and more and more of the non-technical community became involved and helped inject non-technical politics into the equation. Conspiracy theories were born, attempts to vilify developers on either side became common, and at some point the Core developers who favored bigger blocks split from Core and tried to fork the network. It was a power play which would result not merely in them getting the technical results they desired, but would allow them control over the development process.  

When they did this, the technical debate really began to fade and the politics of it all exploded to a whole new level. A portion of the community split from the rest and declared their support for the fork. This community became passionate, it became convinced in their own rightness, and so when the effort failed -- and the Core developers who had initiated the attempt in the first place either left in defeat or rage quit and went to work for Wallstreet  bankers -- this community was left with conviction, but without leaders. Their technical disputes with the remaining Core developers had largely given way to a simple hatred for them. Their agenda to raise the block size had almost become secondary next to their desire to remove Core from being in control of development. This community was willing to follow any developers who would lead them, even if those developers were inexperienced and no one had ever heard of them. 

They were determined to try to fork the network again, and they began with a project called Bitcoin Classic. But after one of the leaders of the project gave an interview while clearly high on marijuana or some other drug, support for Classic withered and they shifted to another set of developers who were working on a project called Bitcoin Unlimited. Again, developers no one had heard of and seemingly not much of a threat. 

But what happened was certain powerful figures in the Bitcoin space, not developers but business men, realized they could actually use the divide in the community to advance their own agendas. They got behind the Bitcoin Unlimited project. They promoted it, spending millions on the endeavor, and their ranks included one of the richest men in Bitcoin and some very powerful Chinese miners who controlled large percentages of global hashing power. These powerful figures had their own agenda, but they were able to breath life into the struggling BU project and the dispirited community behind it who were willing to take any help they could get. While they didn't have the numbers behind them, nor the larger development community -- which was almost universally backing the Core scaling road map to one degree or another -- nor the exchanges, nor the majority of the Bitcoin community or the broader economy . . . what they did have was power, money and hashing power. 

The centralization of mining has long been a huge concern for the Bitcoin community. On a couple of occasions this centralization caused panic until the mining community was able to voluntarily decentralize itself. Such moments sort of lulled the community into complacence over the issue, a complacency further strengthened by the increasingly popular theory that the centralization of mining was just a fluke brought on by the ASICs revolution which would eventually resolve itself over time. But no one anticipated that mining power would turn a dying revolt lead by hacks into a serious threat. 

So the community is faced with a question now of what to do about the centralization of mining and the kind of power it can give to a small minority even when the majority opposes it, a very vital question in a decentralized system. The community is also faced with what to do about politics which can be so easily influenced by money and power in a system that wants politics to be automated out of the equation. The community is faced with threats not only from within the Bitcoin community, but from those outside of it who feel they will benefit from Bitcoin's chaos (e.g., altcoin communities). This is a big moment for Bitcoin. ",2017-03-15 15:18:07

While this exploit still could've happened in a codebase such as [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd) or [bcoin](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin), security researchers are in pretty much unanimous agreement that auditing C is grueling work. Go and other managed languages like Rust or even server-side JS are infinitely easier for devs to work with than the heap of spaghetti C++ that is Bitcoin Core.

If you, despite all warnings to the contrary, insist on investing millions of dollars into a C based codebase, for the love of God, switch to [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin): it's more performant than Core, it's very modular, and it supports address indexing natively, which is what we need for [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), Blockstack, etc to compete against Ethereum.

dezxdxp,zanetackett,83,"Mods, feel free to delete this post as it's relating to alts, but I see all this doom and gloom and ""flippening"" shit and I find it absurd. Lets put things in context:

Ethereum is on a tear, the price is in the middle of a huge rally. It's market cap has increased by ~$2,200,000,000 over the past month. In the same time period bitcoin has added more than $4,000,000,000, or in other words it's added more than the entire Ethereum market cap in the past month. 

Dash is on a tear, the price is in the middle of a huge rally. It's market cap has gone up by about $550,000,000 in the past month*. In the past week bitcoin has added about double that to it's market cap. 

Alts on the whole are rallying and have some great returns. Since Jan 1st, bitcoin has added about $4,500,000,000 to it's market cap. that's about the entire market cap of ETH, XMR, and Dash combined. 

If we zoom out a bit more and go off the last 6 months, the market cap has increased by ~$10,000,000,000. That's more than the entire market cap of all the altcoins combined. 

Bitcoin has had a lower ""dominance"" twice before, once in 2014 and once in 2016... did either of those lead to the ""flippening"", no... And i don't see anything changing this time around either. Bitcoin's market cap is much larger, it's market much more liquid than altcoins. It's much harder to push the price up of a crypto with a $20,000,000,000 market cap than it is a crypto with a market cap of $600,000,000. 

AND, lets not forget we literally hit the ATH less than one week ago!!! How is there so much fud when we are in the middle of a sustained rally and right near ATH levels???

deyups3,gichiba,52,"The quick answer: Poloniex is the easiest way to get into all the altcoins you could ever handle. Create a poloniex account, purchase ETH/BTC with coinbase and transfer your balance to poloniex to buy/sell/leverage it with other altcoins. Then take your profits/losses in ETH/BTC, transfer them back to coinbase and sell them for USD. 

But, as others have pointed out, doing the above without any more research is both balsy and stupid. You wouldn't open up an expensive day trading account for stocks and start buying and selling without knowing a thing about the companies you traded (ok, some people would, but they would also be advised not to by anyone in the space). It's absolutely worth it to understand the technology and ideas behind the coins that you're trading, because in the crypto world, that's where the fundamentals are. 

If you're completely new, the best place to start is with understanding bitcoin and proof-of-work. Working through the technicals will absolutely be worth your time, and once it 'clicks' you'll get genuine satisfaction from that understanding and it'll allow you to appreciate how most alt-coins function. The best resource in my opinion that is abstract enough for a relatively motivated enthusiast is here: http://www.imponderablethings.com/2013/07/how-bitcoin-works-under-hood.html

Then, work your way over to the ethereum whitepaper (and, if you feel ambitious, the yellow paper). After reading/understanding these, you can grasp at a really high level why people believe ethereum is so powerful and game-changing. 

Once you feel like you've got a good handle on Bitcoin and Ethereum, you should be able to discover/research on your own any other alt-coin that might be worth buying. For example, some alt-coins use other verification schemes such as NEMcoin, which has a really interesting proof-of-importance mechanism. Some alt-coins are put out by private companies for specific purposes, some have weird properties that send a small portion of all transactions to the alt-coin's creators, and some may be little more than scams to make BTC. It's been said by many others on this thread, but it's worth saying again: do your research before putting money into an alt-coin. 

If you're looking to get into the day-trading thing, the same effort that you put into understanding the crypto tech should be put into understanding how stock trading, margin trading, technical analysis, etc works. There are tons of resources for this, like Investopedia. Particularly if you're enticed by the idea of making lots of money off of a relatively small initial invesment, understanding the risks/rewards of margin trading is absolutely essential for not losing all your money. Personally, it took a few major losses and margin calls in markets where I was betting in the correct direction and still managed to lose money for me to finally get a handle on it. 

Finally, read a little bit about exchanges. Poloniex is definitely the easiest to get into, but there are plenty of other exchanges that are worth checking out. They're in many different countries, trade in a variety of different currencies, and offer different services with regards to security, fees, etc. that might fit what you want to do better than poloniex. 

Following just the first paragraph is really no better (and in fact worse) than walking into a casino and throwing all your money down at a craps table without knowing a thing about the rules of the game.

df0vdhz,4Tanya,80,"I've also decided to also speak out after many years of lurking. Here's what I think:

It's absurd that in such an early phase of bitcoin, some people will allow the very features that attracted us to bitcoin in the first place, be eliminated. Low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. The use cases of bitcoin continue to be diminished in favor of the so called ""preservation of decentralization"". Yet it is with greater adoption that decentralization will increase. We cannot keep recklessly adding to the blockchain forever, but people need to realize that the next 2-4 years are vital, and messing with the status quo right now (allowing for huge backlogs + high fees), will seriously hinder the potential of adoption. It's too early to be imposing such transaction fees on users. The block reward is still high, and makes up for miners' income. You are taking away from the very User Experience of bitcoin. In it's current state, Bitcoin is too expensive to be introduced to. How many of you got interested by sending a test transaction, to see how it works, before getting hooked. Will new users seriously need to spend a $1 to experience what is bitcoin? No, they will start with something else like &lt;insert crypto here&gt;, and at that time they might as well stick to what they experience first, if they like it. There goes bitcoins first mover advantage...

Bitcoin is not even ready to become a store of wealth (if you advocate for that). We do not have enough users onboard yet. We do not have mainstream adoption. We need utility, we need more use cases, we need growth in the ecosystem, and that is largely driven by good User Experience. Right now we are heading the opposite way. It's getting harder and harder for people to experience the fun that is bitcoin.

I have been following bitcoin pretty much daily for many years now, without being vocal about anything but it just hurts witnessing the current state of affairs. I believe that in addition to SW as a hardfork, the bitcoin blocksize needs to be increased in order to allow for the onboarding of new users. If not, another crypto will step up and take bitcoin's place. If Bitcoin cannot be agile and embrace hard-forks to cleanly improve its technical capability, it risks becoming the dinosaur of the cryptospace.

The greatest trick the Core development leadership ever pulled was convincing people that there is such a thing as a ""consensus ruleset"" defined outside of the Nakamoto consensus embodied by the longest chain.

And I'd consider them both altcoins, regardless of the ticker.  But I don't think that is a bad word - all crypto would be altcoins, the cult of Satoshi would end as should all cults (without any criticism of his / their genius.)  

We would just have competition among cryptos - maybe even some wars - but that would still be better than an endless civil war.

Likewise, the people who bought into Ethereum's rise to make a quick profit have no real understanding or conviction in their investment, so they too are selling into the panic.

The problem is not about a blocksize increase to 2MB, the problem is that you essentially give miners full control over the blocksize. And, which I'm guessing Jihan knows, you give massive bullying power to the larger miners. I don't think my post even covers that correctly.

Basically, in Bitcoin Unlimited, selfish mining strategies become a lot more potent. When every miner has a different maximum acceptable blocksize, you can split the network at-will, even with just like 5% of the hashrate.

And it gets worse because the software has this 'oh I guess I lost the fight' condition in it that drags along people to the longest chain even if the blocksize is bigger than they accept.

You can start mining blocks that are too large for the miners to keep up with. Then it doesn't matter what their client says, if they can't download blocks they get pushed off the network.

Basically, BU makes it very easy for someone with as much hashrate as Jihan to become the only miner on the network. It's REALLY BAD.

Of all the proposals that big-blockers want, BU is REALLY REALLY BAD FOR THE NETWORK. If you want a hardfork blocksize increase, please consider anything other than BU. You do not want the largest miner to be able to take control over everything, and that is what BU enables.",2017-03-19 22:41:05

df3umrt,ThomasZander,87,"Hi Brian,

this is a fun topic because it covers so much.

Let me just do a little brain dump of options that I have been discussing.

1. The easiest solution I've seen is to make a little change in the transaction. For instance we can make the hash-type enum start with 10 instead of zero. This would cause all transactions to only validate on one chain.  
The downside of this is that 100% of the software needs to be replaced. This includes hardware wallets. This is especially a big problem because the block-size-limit fork (which Classic has support for) doesn't require anything but full nodes to upgrade.

2. Fees. (yes, thats all there is to it).  
The 1MB chain would have less than full hashrate, it would be always full and as such the fees would go through the roof.  If you want to avoid your transaction being on the other chain, just make its fee something we found normal a year ago. Practical guarantee it won't get mined there.

3. Make the minority chain fix this.  
A chain with 20% of the hashrate would probably crash in value very quickly because its useless. So the obvious solution is that they do a hard fork to adjust the difficulty. Adjusting the difficulty means that practically all software that does anything with Bitcoin needs to be upgraded because difficulty is part of the block header. Even SPV wallets check that.  
So, because the minority chain needs to exchange 100% of the software **anyway**, then please ask the minority chain to apply option 1. Fixing the replay issue for both sides. They can just change the hashing to include price, a feature in SW already.

The short version is that in my opinion, the Classic/BU chain has as a goal to do a protocol upgrade. Not a chain split. That is not in our intention, that is not in our best interest.

Should the 1MB hard core decide to reject this new version of what is Bitcoin, they will do a hard fork to lower the difficulty. It will then cost them nothing to build in replay attack-protection.

The other way around is to ask the people that want to do a clean and non-intrusive protocol upgrade to change it from ""only miners and full nodes"" to ""every single piece of software and hardware"". This is in nobodies interest. We can't ask people to buy new hardware wallets. And the way to avoid it is making the 1MB blockers apply the replay protection.

------
Edit; 

Exchanges creating transactions are a different issue. They have various options.

0. Spend Utxo that can only be validated on &gt;1mb chain.
1.  tricky multi-tx techniques could work. E.g. Create 1mb
tx that pays big fee, use its outputs as inputs to non-replayable txs. Or
create time/height locked utxos that take advantage of block creation time

---

&gt; I strongly believe that one of the mods of /r/spicy is unfairly abusing his position to promote his hot sauce and honey companies. This is done through multiple accounts.
&gt; 
&gt; The main account in question is /u/TheKingOfPoon. He also has an ""official"" account for his company, /u/pexpeppers. There's also some fishy business going on with /u/DeluxLaurenEdition, an associate of his.
&gt;
&gt;The frustrating part is he deletes his astroturfing posts to hide just how much he spams. I know you'll have an easier time looking at deleted posts and seeing patterns than me, but here's the stuff I've gathered so far:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;### Fishy Behavior
&gt;
 - /u/TheKingOfPoon posted ""[cultmoo eats PexPeppers sauce. lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/33b049/cultmoo_eats_pexpeppers_sauce_lol/)"" to /r/spicy. Fair enough, legitimate post. However, he also posted (now deleted) to /r/videos with the title ""[Cultmoo ate my friends hot sauce, hilarity ensues](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/33azrl/cultmoo_ate_my_friends_hot_sauce_hilarity_ensues/)"". It's not **his friend's** hot cause, it's **his** hot sauce. Why would he lie about that? Forgot to switch accounts? I suspect he realized then deleted the post.
 - [/u/DeluxLaurenEdition establishes that they take pictures for PexPeppers](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2ogf7d/i_take_pictures_for_my_friends_hot_sauce_company/). So this is basically just an advertisement on /r/food
 - The spam [made its way to /r/itookapicture too](http://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/2ogl2p/itap_my_friends_hot_sauce/)
 - [/u/DeluxLaurenEdition later ""found"" a site to buy honey for bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2v8p11/awesome_i_found_a_site_where_you_can_buy_honey/)...run by the same dude that you take pictures for. **Why lie about your business relationship then delete the post later?**
&gt;
### Inappropriate self-promotion
 - [This is where the honey that I use in PexPeppers hot sauces comes from](http://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/2vvbqq/this_is_where_the_honey_that_i_use_in_pexpeppers/) - He owns both companies. This is hardly even related to the /r/spicy subreddit, just an excuse to adverise.
 - [Spamming a mailing list in /r/spicy](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/30bgek/hey_guys_i_make_hot_sauce_for_a_living_and_i_am/)

 - [And also spamming /r/food](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/30joe9/i_recently_acquired_an_apiary_i_am_giving_you/)
 - Someone complements his picture? [Oh, great opportunity to self-promote apparently](http://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/31wp2m/dragon_burner_hot_sauce_and_double/cq5u64p).
 - [Spamming /r/bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2yspea/hey_guys_i_finally_moved_my_operation_time_to/)
 - [Spamming /r/dogecoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2uttij/buy_honey_with_dogecoin/)
 - [/u/DeluxLaurenEdition spamming /r/food with another PexPeppers product](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2ps4as/these_are_easily_the_spiciest_pickles_i_have_ever/)
&gt;
&gt;If you look at /u/TheKingOfPoon's post history, you can see that the majority of his posts are in some way promoting his businesses. There's a disgusting amount of self promotion to be seen when browsing [/domain/pexpeppers.com](http://www.reddit.com/domain/pexpeppers.com). I am certain there used to be a lot more for [/domain/drpecksbees.com](http://www.reddit.com/domain/drpecksbees.com/), but those posts are deleted now.

**/u/TheKingOfPoon is in my opinion quite clearly abusing his position of moderator to use reddit as his personal moderating platform. Can something be done about this?**

df4lk7z,bcn00b,46,"Today's Technical Analysis (TA) and Psychological Analysis (PA):

* TA: The implications of the technical indicators I wrote about [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5za0a0/daily_discussion_tuesday_march_14_2017/dewmfab/) were confirmed by the latest drop.
* TA: The partial head and shoulders pattern on the 1w chart is about the complete it's head. [Earlier I speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5ywwaz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_12_2017/deu3qe5/) that a move below $900 would look the most beautiful from a TA perspective. Mandatory disclaimer: the head and shoulders pattern should not be traded until it's complete, until then it could still be invalidated. http://imgur.com/a/jMwh8
* TA/PA: The velocity with which the price is going down is very strong. Traders are getting nervous and are starting to sell a big part or all of their Bitcoin holdings (nothing wrong with that, by the way). We're still at least $100 shy of the current TA price target, which is the 61.8% fibonacci retracement measured against the ATH down to the lowest point after the 2013 bubble (61.8% fib retracement sits at $892 for Bitstamp). I had not imagined we would reach this close to that level so soon. Meanwhile, the daily volume is still increasing and price is going down more and more by the day. This suggests it's not ready yet to loose momentum. It might very well be possible that we're going to blast past this target price level and go down even further. The levels to watch at that time would be the bottom of the long term ascending channel (at $830 - $840), the 50% fib retracement (~$750) and the %38.2 fib retracement (~$610). Also lets take a look at the weekly oscillators to get an indication of how much room there is left for the price to go down in the next TA bullet points.
* TA: 1w StochRSI (I'm using 14, 14, 3, 3 as parameters on Bitcoinwisdom) has just crossed down. Even though its weekly candle has not yet closed, chances are it will as we're less than a day away from this candle closing. It's also relatively far away from reaching oversold territory (that would be below 20). The cross over is bearish, but the leeway left down to 20 is not indicative of anything, it just signals that there is no immediate pressure to go back up, but it could go back up or even more down from here.
* TA: 1w BBANDS show room to move all the way down to the lowest price target of $610, in fact, this is only just above the lower BBAND.
* TA: 1w MACD hasn't even had its bearish cross over yet and and is lagging behind, as is normal for a lagging indicator. However, the dramatic rise it just went through is going through a normalization at the moment. Technically we can't extract any information from this indicator about how far down we're still able to go, unfortunately.
* TA: 1w RSI is far from going under 30 levels, implying we have plenty of room left before we reach oversold levels.
* TA: So I mentioned a couple of times that the head and shoulders pattern is not confirmed yet. One way I could see it get invalidated on the short term is that it drops below the neck line a great deal. If it falls all the way down to ~$610, this could set up of for the first half of a bearish diamond top formation, which is also a bearish trend reversal signal, just like the head and shoulders. However, as long as neither of these is confirmed, I consider us still officially in a 'bull market'.
* PA: Emotions are all over the place. Greed, fear and hope are thriving. This implies we have not seen the end of the volatility just yet.

Disclaimer: I'm [still in fiat](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5ywwaz/daily_discussion_sunday_march_12_2017/detrdgf/?context=3) since the ETF decision. I'm currently waiting for either a confirmation on the weekly charts of a return to the bearish trend (head and shoulders or bearish diamond top formation) at which I will short - or - a continuation of the bull trend by a breakout of the long term ascending channel on the top side at which I will go long. ""If you're so sure of your TA, why didn't you short at the top of the head and shoulders instead of just selling for fiat?"" I can hear people thinking. Well, several reasons: 1) I never short a bull market 2) The pattern wasn't confirmed and thereby not certain enough for my liking, I'm waiting it out currently. 3) Volatility is just incredible at the moment. The only way for me to short is on leverage and I don't feel comfortable using leverage with high volatility until I see that confirmation signal. For the record, I'm not pretending I wasn't tempted shorting this move downwards, because I was. But I have a plan, and I'm sticking to it.

* Make sure you feel comfortable taking that loss before entering that trade. If it feels like too much, pick a price level that feels comfortable, or if you're using leverage then reduce or quit the leverage.
* Do not double down when your leveraged trade is under water (e.g. by sending coins from your cold storage to increase your margin), this is an action led by emotions and this will bite you in the arse (if not this time, then the next time!). The previous two actions are meant to prevent letting your emotions take over leading to bad trades.
* Always stick to your plan. If you have a plan and you feel like you can't stick to it, these are your emotions talking. Take a step back, breathe, and remember the decisions you made before your emotions kicked in.
* Sticking to your plan will sometimes mean taking a loss (or missing out on more profits, which emotionally can feel like a loss even though its not, you can't loose what you never owned). This is okay, you can't win every single trade and there will always be the next opportunity. You don't *need* this one trade right now, you can wait until the next trade, especially when you are getting emotional. The goal is to get ahead on average, this is how you win. Practice with paper trades first if you're not sure you will get ahead on average.
* I see people saying stuff like ""I can't sell now, I can't bear what this will cost me in taxes"". I consider this a logical fallacy. That part that is taxed on capital gains was never yours to begin with. You would be wise to keep in mind that as your paper profits grow, your latent tax obligations grow with it, these are not ""yours"". Learn to spot the difference between a withholding tax and a tax you have to set aside to pay later. Besides, if you have to pay taxes, that means you have a profit, not a ""loss""!
* Paper profits are not realized profits. It's tempting seeing your paper profits grow (in some countries even deferring that tax payment a little further) so your balance looks really great on paper. It's also a good way to actually never profit and loose it all some day. So take profits now and then.
* Don't short a bull market (any market, not just Bitcoin).",2017-03-19 21:34:06

df3rdde,Cryptolution,43,"&gt; All of this discontent between and among the people who DO understand it is making BTC less appealing to me with every post.

This is disillusionment. There is no discontent between the people who *do* understand bitcoin. There is overarching consensus amongst both the experts within the field and the educated majority.

What you are seeing is a *very small* but **very loud** minority of bitcoin users who inherently dont understand how bitcoin works, or wishes it to work in favor of their ideological perspective.

The same people that I see participate here on this sub that are constantly attacking progress are the same ones I and others of this subreddit correct constantly. They continue to spout their misinformation and illogical reasoning despite being corrected ad infinitum.

What you are seeing is loud annoying trolls who either purposefully or naively misunderstand bitcoin and shouting their opinions at others.

Even the ""big blocker"" developers like Gavin and Garzik admit that SW is a good solution. Its only people we dont know, who are completely new to bitcoin development (such as the BU ""team"" - aka basically 2 guys) that have demonstrated quite obviously now that they are incapable of writing good code due to the number of very serious and very large public bugs that their releases have been subject to. Which is to not even talk about the several even more serious bugs that have been submitted in private from the **real** bitcoin developers to the BU team. nullc has stated that the BU team has not even fixed the bugs that they previously submitted, so that should give you a good idea on who the ""experts"" are and who are not.

The only reason that I personally have clear vision is because I've decided to devote several hours a day, every day, to bitcoin. This has been ongoing for about 4 years now for me. 

Now take the above paragraph and realize that *I am not a expert*. I've spent 4 years studying bitcoin daily and I still am no where near expert level. My prior 15 years of IT experience with an emphasis on networking has given me a better birds eye view of the system than non-technical-experienced folks, but still does not allow me to glean all the truth behind the fog of bitcoin.

There are very few real experts in bitcoin. I would say less than 20 and **all** of them are working on core, or projects directly linked to core.

Whats important here is to be an intelligent human being. Intelligent human beings understand that they are not experts at a field that they have not practiced as a profession for a many number of years, or studied academically for *at least* 6 years.

So if you are not a expert, and you know you're not a expert, how can you go about understanding whats going on?

The answer is simple -

You listen to **experts**. 

Experts reached consensus on the path forward years ago and [published it for everyone to see](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases).

99% of bitcoin developers reached consensus on SegWit as being the best path forward for bitcoin.

To argue ""I trust the 1% and think the 99% are wrong"" is a blatant act of *stupidity*. By doing so you are admitting that you are not an expert, that you are not qualified to judge the technicalities, and therefore you must resign your judgment to others. But instead of being totally reasonable and using common sense of trusting the almost 100% complete majority, you want to stick your neck out and trust 1%.

When you put it in perspective, it seems *fucking crazy* right?

It is. Those are the people who you see arguing against the educated majority who has reached consensus.

But here's the logic problem, the big sore thumb that sticks out you might say. HOW. How has BU gotten so much mining support for something that is against experts consensus?

The answer is through disillusionment. BU has advocated for a ""trivial fix"" to a **highly complex problem**.

BU is basically advertising snake oil as a charm. They are saying ""This is a easy fix! All we have to do is raise the blocksize to 2MB! Problem solved!""

But this is a false dichotomy. When you raise the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB you dont just double the resources. Storage will double sure...but storage is literally the cheapest resource in bitcoin. Its easy to double your harddrive space. But how easy and cheap is it to *quadruple* your RAM? 

By raising the blocksize to 2MB you are making a tradeoff. You are saying ""I want to reduce the impact of transaction cost on users, but in order to do so im pushing the cost onto node operators"". Everything in every system has a cost/benefit relationship. So when you make a change you *must* address how that change impacts the system.

Nodes are the only thing keeping bitcoin from becoming Paypal. So when you increase resources you must study the impact that a resource increase will have upon the nodes that make the system operate.

Well it just so happens the [is a white paper that discusses the impact of additional resources upon nodes](http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf).

In that table on page 4, you can see it estimates a 40% drop immediately in node count with a 2MB upgrade and a 50% over 6 months. At 4mb, it becomes 75% immediately and 80% over 6 months. At 8, it becomes 90% and 95%.
The reason for this drastic impact?
&gt;*The exception is RAM: we assume that a typical computer supporting a node has no less than 3 GB RAM as a node requires at least 2 GB RAM to run with margin [15]. For example, if block size increases to 2 MB, a node would need to dedicate 8 GB RAM to the Bitcoin client, while more than a half of PCs in the survey have less RAM.*

What BU is not telling you is that when the blockchain is running at 2MB full that we will lose **60%** of the node count within 6 months.

What the paper is not telling you is that 60% of those nodes are the nodes that are actually most valuable to the network. Those are the low resource nodes that are being ran by people like **me**. People who are running a node alturistically on their home ISP connection. Thats *real decentralization*. 

Whats left are high resource nodes which are typically operated in data centers.

What happens when all of your nodes are operating in data centers?

They become incredibly fragile due to the fact that they are now **centralized** instead of *decentralized*.

If you have 2000 nodes spread across 50 data centers, thats literally 50 computers that a state actor has to attack to *completely cripple bitcoin*. You dont think this is a realistic threat? Then you dont understand what bitcoin was created for. It was created to be a censorship-resistent immutable form of money. It *cannot* retain those properties if we have nodes operating just in data centers.

In this, Satoshi was clearly wrong. Anyone with a reasonable amount of white hat, black hat or distributed systems experience will be able to tell you a centralized network is orders of magnitude easier to attack than decentralized.

Bitcoin was intended to be the bittorrent of money, not the paypal of money. Paypal already exists and it works great. If you want cheap fast and easy, use it! If you want money that your government cannot confiscate in the form of inflation, hyperinflation or outright theft (See India banknote situation) then you want a decentralized attack resistent network.

As you can see, the situation is not simple. They want you to think its simple because they (non-core developers) are either naive/ignorant to the *real* problems, or (more likely) that they are driven by ego or ideological preference as opposed to rational thinking. 

SegWit solves ALL of the problems with a non-trivial but elegant fix. It solves malleability, it opens the doors to lightning network type systems that will compete in a open market. Those systems financially incentivize their nodes to upkeep the network, which is what bitcoin is missing! So many people dont understand this. LN fixes the node incentive structure that bitcoin is missing.

Beyond that it creates better aligned economic incentives for UTXO, which *lowers fee's*. Its a *real blocksize increase to 2MB* where its a single container that will hold more transactions, both the old non-SW style transactions and the new SW style transactions.

Further, it enables more advancements like MAST and Schnorr, which will *further* optimize on-chain bitcoin transactions, developments that have been on the roadmap for *years* yet we always hear the same lies that ""core is trying to force 2nd layer networks to ""take over"" bitcoin!"".

The truth is the situation is highly complex and you do need years of hardcore study and a technical background to understand **all** of the dynamics.

If you dont understand the system as a whole, and how it interacts with all the pieces, then you cannot make changes to the system because you dont understand the cost/benefit relationship.

Core clearly understands that cost/benefit relationship and are trying to be responsible stewards of the network. They are trying to implement ""opt-in"" upgrades that gives everyone the choice to continue using bitcoin the way it always worked (if you are stuck in your ideologies) or to use it in the new better-economically-incentivized ways that will make your transactions cheaper, faster and add more blockspace.

When you are in full knowledge of the facts, the situation is *crystal clear*. I understand the system enough to counter all of the uninformed trolls on this sub trying to spread their *gospel*. Make no mistake, its gospel. Its not data, its not facts. Its lies. Its lies that try to appeal to  ""logic"" thats illogical once you know **all** the facts.

Dont be deceived,  listen to experts when they reach consensus. Dont ignore them. Doing so is at your and the whole networks peril. We are seeing this with global warming and we are seeing the same in bitcoin. BU = Republicans engaging in misinformation and doubt propaganda on climate.

df471ka,SirEDCaLot,42,"Basic overview:

We've known about this problem going back to 2012ish and earlier.  However we've been at an impasse since then.  

Satoshi (before he left) suggested simply increasing the block size at some future date.  IE, pick some block that's months or a year away and say 'as of block X, the new block size limit is Y'.  We didn't do this.  

In 2012ish, Gavin Andresen (Satoshi's successor) started advocating for a block size limit increase much like Satoshi suggested.  However at this point he was no longer lead maintainer (he'd stepped down to work on higher level things) so he couldn't force the issue.  

There are a small number of Core developers who think the block size limit should never be raised for any reason, or that it should not be raised for a Long Time (years), or even that it should be lowered.  These people felt/feel that serious on-chain scaling won't work long term and that off chain scaling (sidechains) is the only solution.  Because of these few, the person who was then lead maintainer (Wladimir) said there was not consensus on the change, therefore consensus rules could not be changed.  Gavin's attempts to raise the block size limit were ignored.  

This went on for some time, while the transaction count was still well below the 1MB limit.  

Eventually Gavin concluded that the Core development group would not fix the problem in time.  So he wrote BIP101 (miner vote activation to increase the block size limit to 8MB with future increases pre-planned) and it was integrated into Bitcoin XT.  That started to get traction, but then a bunch of DDoS attacks stopped its progress and it ended up failing.  Mike Hearn, who'd been a co-developer of Bitcoin XT, ragequit Bitcoin, said the whole dev process was fucked and wasn't going to be fixed anytime soon.  

It was around this time that the censorship started.  In /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk, a policy was rolled out which said any client that will hard fork Bitcoin is not actually Bitcoin, therefore its discussion must be confined to altcoin areas and kept out of Bitcoin discussions.  This of course went over somewhat poorly, and led to the creation of /r/btc.  
On a personal note- I found the resulting 'hard split' of the community really sad.  Bitcoiners used to be passionate and optimistic; I've never seen such a wonderful community split so hard, so fast.  

Next came Bitcoin Classic- Gavin's attempt to address miner concerns that BIP101 was too much increase too fast.  Classic implemented BIP109- a one time increase to 2MB, again after a miner vote.  Again it started to get some traction but there was DDoS attacks.  This time there was the 'Hong Kong Round Table' meeting between a few Core devs and miners, which produced [this document](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff).  
It was met with controversy as no 'big block' proponents were invited to attend, and nobody from other Bitcoin companies (like Coinbase or BitPay) was in attendance either.  Also, the Core representatives were there not as representatives of Core, but rather as individual developers, which many miners didn't realize.  Core developer Greg Maxwell later referred to them as [well meaning dipshits](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1330553.msg14835202#msg14835202).  
However, the HK agreement effectively stopped Bitcoin Classic.  BIP109 failed just as BIP101 did.  

-----

Anyway fast forward to now.  

SegWit took a LOT longer than expected but it's now available and is included in the latest Core releases.  SegWit requires a 95% miner vote to activate for security, but so far has only gotten about 20%.  
The complaints about SegWit are that it's not a real block size increase (it just shifts some of the data outside the block), requires most transactions to be SegWit transactions to get that increase, and creates new transaction formats which must be supported forever (future technical debt).  The arguments in favor of SegWit are that it's a soft fork (so while it has dangers, a chain fork isn't one of them), that it fixes the transaction malleability bug, and that it lays the groundwork for future off-chain scaling.  

There's also Bitcoin Unlimited.  BU does not have a formal miner vote mechanism, but miners are so far following ViaBTC's [safe hard fork scaling plan](https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8).  BU would create a hard fork and remove the pre-set block size limit entirely, allowing miners to set their own block size limits.  This allows an 'emergent consensus' whereby miners can signal their maximum accepted block size to each other.  
The complaints about BU are that it's a hostile hard fork which some consider to be an attack, that it puts too much control in the hands of miners, that the hard fork plan isn't well developed, and that the 'emergent consensus' plan is a bad one.  The arguments in favor of BU are that it fixes the block size controversy forever, that it provides protections to stop big block spam attacks without the inflexibility of a hard pre-set limit, and that it provides an immediate scaling fix which SegWit does not.  

Also, depending on which subreddit you post on (/r/bitcoin or /r/btc), the developers of [Core / BU] are all crooks who are exploiting Bitcoin for their own nefarious purposes, [Core / BU] have no idea how to do scaling and will more likely break the network, [Core / BU] developers are incompetent and have no idea how to plan capacity increases, [Core / BU] supporters are guilty of various types of attacks, etc.  Basically if you're in /r/bitcoin you probably hate BU and everything associated with it; if you/re in /r/BTC you support BU and hate Core.  It's pretty sad.  

Hope that helped!",2017-03-19 11:44:11

df5z2vw,singularity87,191,"People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.

Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin). 

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February last year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effective form of psychological attack.

df5icps,fremeer,104,"Alt coin trading.  

Basically there is a cryptocurrency like bitcoin but made differently that has exploded in value in last month.  $30 to $120 and rising.  Most likely it will fall to more stable numbers.  

However what the guy did was try and short the value.  Basically betting against the coin going up.  When you short a stock you sell the credit.  You sell the coin and then at a later date are expected to buy it back for its then market price. This guy bought a crap load of dash coin thinking the market will crash.  

So what happened is he sold his dash coin at say $60 but ok credit.  Now the bill is due and the coin he sold is worth a lot more.  Well he doesn't have any dash coin because he sold it at $60 thinking he could buy it back at $30 or something and make a profit but instead its worth $120 and he needs to rebuy his coin at that cost. 

The comment is basically how the market can do crazy things for a lot longer then you have the money to support it.  Shorting a stock is a higher risk because you don't have the money. You are basically loaning the stocks hoping the stocks crash within the time frame that your money lets you buy.  Well if the market stays crazy longer then you have cash it doesn't matter that you might be right later on. You don't know how long it will go crazy. Could crash tomorrow or could crash in 10 years. 

This is coming from someone with general knowledge though so inaccuracy might be possible.  But that's the gist. This guy bet that the cryptocurrency would crash and it didn't. Now his credit bill has come in and he needs to pay. ",2017-03-20 09:42:06

For the nutshell version: A banker backed company called Blockstream, founded by a couple of the Core developers, started waging a campaign to perform a hostile takeover of the Bitcoin project, the most original senior developers got forced out. /r/bitcoin started to be censored and crafted to feed you the narratives you have discovered to be completely false, leading to /r/btc to continue having an open forum for discussions just like this one. 

We would love nothing more than to see all the ""us vs them"" stuff stop after three very long years and just get back to the way it used to be, which was exciting and progressive instead of irritating and loathsome. I think we can cut ourselves some slack for wanting to fight back at the invaders trampling and trying to steal something we're so passionate about.

The 34% of Miners supporting Bitcoin Unlimited mined 44% of blocks in the last 24 hrs. That's not the same as 44% of buy-in.  It's not advantageous to fork based on past performance. Just because you had a good day out of a month doesn't mean all days going forward will be like that one day. ",2017-03-20 06:21:30
df4q6mi,SirEDCaLot,66,"If I'm reading this BIP correctly- should this be merged, then at some point around October/November 2017, all blocks that DON'T signal SegWit support will be rejected by all Core nodes and miners.  

Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?  People say a BU fork would be a problem, this could be a disaster.  

Let's ignore BU for a moment.  Let's assume in Oct/Nov we've still got 30% SegWit support.  
Per this BIP, you will be creating a fork.  The 30% of miners running SegWit will fork and that fork will be accepted by however many nodes are running this particular bit of code.  The majority of the miners will keep going, ignoring the 30% chain because it's shorter.  

As for payment nodes- SPV wallets will stick with the non-SegWit fork (or really whatever the node they connect to is doing), custom implementations will stick with the non-SegWit fork as well unless they also implement this, everyone else will be on one chain or the other depending on what their node runs (New Core / Old Core / Something Else).  

Now, FWIW, I get the purpose of this- you want to force the miners' hand, force them to declare for SegWit.  But you're playing a very dangerous game.  If this BIP is accepted, and a majority of miners DON'T accept SegWit, you will be creating a very disruptive minority fork that will cause a lot of problems.  

Personally I think this is dangerous to the point of being reckless.  It's playing Russian Roulette with the miners, only the one who may get shot is the Bitcoin network.  

-------

It's also likely to fail.  If this code is merged, it would signal to the miners that Core is actively hostile toward them, which would make them MORE likely to oppose SegWIt and embrace other dev teams like BU.  

-------

To be honest, I think you'd be better off just doing an intentional fork.  Set a flag day and fork the chain, new chain gets a new PoW and SegWit and a new name also.  Scaling can be easy because rather than carrying the old chain, you can create a whole new chain, just encode the current UTXO set into the genesis block and you can dispense with 100GB or so of old transactions.  

I actually think you should try this sort of fork.  I'd be very interested to see how 'schizcoin' does, and since you'd have the UTXO set people would wake up one day to find they own a bunch of 'schizcoins' (just like with BTC).  ",2017-03-20 00:03:05
df6111f,luke-jr,65,"If the majority of miners switch to BU in a chain-split, Bitcoin will have a sudden drop in hashrate producing blocks. Bitcoin typically adjusts its ""block difficulty"" every 2 weeks so as to make one new block every 10 minutes on average. However, that 2 weeks is actually measured in blocks, not time, so if 50% of the hashrate drops off, it will take 1 month instead (at 20 minutes per block, or 60 MB per day); if 75% drop off, it will take 2 months (at 40 minutes per block, or 36 MB per day).

In this scenario, Bitcoin is forced to choose between various strategies:

1. **Give miners control over block size limit (via hardfork).** Basically this is conceding victory to BU, and adopting it as the new Bitcoin. Any transactions made on Bitcoin after they split-off will be effectively un-confirmed (no matter how many ""confirmations"" they received) and need to re-confirm (or be double-spent) on BU's blockchain. Long-term, this is likely to result in Bitcoin being centralised into PayPal 2.0.
2. **Slower blocks for a few months until difficulty adjusts (NO hardfork).** This is the default scenario if we don't/can't come to a consensus: we just wait it out until the difficulty adjusts. Due to reduced capacity, fees will likely increase a bit more, and less-important use cases (as determined by the participants) will be impractical temporarily.
3. **Change difficulty adjustment to adapt to reduction of mining faster (via hardfork).** If the community consents to it, we could make the difficulty react faster to the mining hashrate drop-off. This would basically preserve the network working as-is, with blocks every 10 minutes on average.
4. **Change proof-of-work algorithm to protect Bitcoin and adapt (via hardfork).** In addition to adjusting the difficulty quicker, we can fire all the miners. This is the only way to protect Bitcoin from the BU miners if they attempt to continue attacking our blockchain after they split off. Bitcoin would now be reliant on anyone with a GPU to mine, until new ASICs are developed.

Note that in cases 2 and 3, Bitcoin would be left vulnerable to attack from the BU miners.",2017-03-20 19:57:51

Ok, the low pole was triggered early today.  We got as high at $1051 on the upswing.  The Column of Os was 21 boxes down.  We expected a bounce  back half way UP the column.  At $1051 we hit 10 boxes higher than the low.  It is not exact, but its close enough for bitcoin.

Now we wait a little bit to see where it goes.  If you jumped in at the reversal, set some tight  stops so you do not lose your short term  gains.

It is possible that we start making a new formation here.  Columns of Xs 23 boxes high are pretty rare.  This year the closest we’ve gotten is 18.  So don’t freak out if we don’t bounce between 1,000 and 1050 for a few days.

I really don’t have much of an opinion on the hard Fork stuff.  I have to do a lot more reading on it.  Clearly, we need to do something to speed up confirmations, which will help keep fees down.  The fees, while out of the norm, are still not horribly  high.  I moved some bitcoin around yesterday and the fees amounted to something like $2.00 on $5,000.  Compared to using traditional methods, its a bargain.  Needless to say, most transactions are not $5,000.

So here is the deal for the day:

So far today the high has been $1,051.
A reversal tomorrow would have to be under $1000.
A break out happens at $1,280.
A break down happens under $920—which is dangerously close to the Trend  line under $910.  That is a little too close for my liking.  Although, since it is still positive…we are “optimistic.”

I am posting a second chart today.  It is a look back at the past several months of this bull market since August.  We are still in the upward channel.  This dip looks a lot like the January dip.  Which looked like the August dip.  And by “looked like” I mean they went down to the near bottom of the channel and bounced.  So, we have that to look forward to.

I hope we are almost done with this dumping crap.  Then we can  move back towards consolidation.

That said, I am off to watch basketball.  Since I am a Celtics fan, I don’t watch much college basketball now.  For fourteen years all I did is go to college basketball games.  I don’t find them too enjoyable now…so I do not get March Madness.

df5iklk,iftodaywasurlastday,36,"Segwit increases the number of transactions that can be stuffed into the existing block size of 1MB. It has the net effect of making the block size 2MB. It also fixes a whole bunch of other issues, including transaction malleability. It's a soft fork, so implementation is much easier and involves no risk.

Bitcoin Unlimited effectively changes how the bitcoin protocol works by allowing miners to increase/decrease the block size at their discretion. Supporters of BU argue that miners have the same incentives as everyone else by keeping bitcoin healthy and growing for the long term. Opponents of BU argue that miners are solely interested in profits, and this may be achieved by preventing growth and scaling. Some miners even brag about mining empty blocks in order to increase congestion, thus increasing fees. Not convinced? Do some research on the guy who controls the bulk of the mining power (Jihan Wu) and decide for yourself if handing over control to this guy is a good idea.

Other critics of BU argue that the network infrastructure cannot handle large blocks and would prevent the average person from running a node on their home computer, further reducing decentralization. Worst case, the huge blocks would cause bitcoin to collapse under its own weight.

Lastly, there is concern over the capabilities of the BU development team. They have introduced several bugs, the most recent resulting in the majority of BU nodes to shut-down with a simple attack. In that instance, had BU been the main protocol running the majority of the network, it would have caused a complete and potentially non-recoverable failure of bitcoin.

Edit: I would like to add that supports of BU have been critical (maybe justifiably so) that the Core developers have been slow to implement solutions to allow for proper scaling. Since the current block size is 1MB, there is significant competition for access to the block, thus the fees are driven higher. Most people (but not all) argue that fees are too high.

The bitcoin community wars are also very difficult to follow as everything has happened over thousands of incidents.

What is important to understand is that, all anyone wants in this sub is the truth and ability to speak freely.

If you want one key point about the scaling debate, it is this; 

-  NewCore (i.e. Core after all the original prominent devs in Core were ousted) has implemented a plan to change bitcoin into a settlement network. 
- They have still to this day never announced this plan. 
- There was no BIP for it. There is no detailed explanation of how this will work. - There is no research or analysis on how the new economics of this system will work. 
- This system has not been implemented anywhere else and been proven to work. 
- They are making this enormous change to the fundamental functionality of bitcoin apparently based on the assumption that the network cannot scale any more on-chain. 
- There has been no evidence to prove that bitcoin cannot scale on-chain. 
- There has been no analysis to prove any negative effects of bitcoin scaling on-chain.
- When you ask any of the NewCore devs for any of the above they will simply ignore you or dodge the question.

df6vsmt,majorpaynei86,147,"I appreciate the post.

Some points to discuss:

1. Why has there been an absolute refusal to do a modest block limit increase for years even though it was always an assumption?

2. If you are so ~~terrified~~ averse to hardforks, what are your thoughts as to other altcoins doing periodic hardforks for upgrading. For example, Monero or Ethereum.

3. You believe that scaling will be achieved through payment channels. However, there are only so many channels that can be opened/closed, which depends on throughput of the main chain. Would it not be necessary to scale the main chain in some form or fashion to allow increased user adoption.

4. What powers does BU signaling give miners over what is provided now? How do these powers line up against the signaling that soft forks give miners? Edit - were miners taking advantage of their 'power' before blocks reached the hard limit?

5. I can say that I oppose segwit primarily due to the witness subsidy being based on no studies or data whatsoever. It smacks of central planning that gives too much influence to a certain outlook of how bitcoin should scale. There should be no subsidy, where economic forces should determine the best means of scaling.

6. You state that we are rushing into making changes. This discussion has been happening for years. We were completely fine with the Hong Kong Agreement until (Core Devs) reneged and violated said agreement. Luke-jr proposed an agreement that not only failed to meet the requirements but was directly opposed to it (by reducing the limit instead of increasing it to 2mb)

All this Segwit bullshit is exactly that, bullshit, it is a hack that radically changes the design of Bitcoin by devs that have obviously lost faith (or never had faith) in Bitcoin as a POW system.

&gt; I believe that in case of disagreement about changes, the default should be sticking with the current protocol until agreement is reached, rather than rushing into making changes.

For two years we've done this and nothing has resulted. Segwit was highly controversial yet they pushed it through anyway, despite their claim for consensus-driven development. It's hypocritical. Further they refuse to compromise and explicitly reject ideas not developed in their inner circle. It's an immature way to develop a 20 billion dollar asset.

&gt; I believe that if all else fails and the disagreement cannot be reconciled, there should be a responsible split of the network into two, with both sides working to ensure a clean, uneventful split, and both sides respecting each other's right to coexist.

This is absolutely impossible because there can be only one Bitcoin. Further, Bitcoin is always the longest chain of work (hashpower) by definition and as specified by Satoshi Nakamoto.

df7uvfm,evoorhees,62,"Perhaps I can shed some light on this...

Our company (ShapeShift) deals with thousands of bitcoin transactions to and from customers every day. When the mempool fills up, we literally get hundreds of failed or stuck orders as users send BTC to us from all sorts of wallets. An order can fail, for example, when we offer a Precise exchange rate, which guarantees that rate for a window of time (10 mins or so). If that window passes before we've received the BTC, then the order fails... and if the user sent her BTC and it's stuck in the mempool for two days, then we basically have an angry customer to deal with for two days until the BTC confirms and then we can issue a refund. So it's messy. We in turn have to set our own mining fee for the txs we send out. 

When fees are not set ""very high"" then we risk a large number of these failed or delayed transactions. To improve UX, we generally need to overestimate fees, and because fees are very spiky, we end up usually paying much more in fees than we ""need"" to, because if we reduce the number and a spike in mempool happens, we now have 50 upset customers.

Thus, whatever you think the ""right"" fee is at any given time, actual businesses will often have to overestimate, charging people more in fees than they need to, in order to prevent a mess of customer support issues. If the mempool stays empty for a while, we can, with hesitation, lower the fee over time, but there is a lag.

New address format for Bitcoin. Compared to the old format it doesn't use mixed case characters so it is _massively_ easier to read to someone.  It also has support extensions so new features can be easily added in the future, and is smaller in QR codes.

This upgrade also lets people exploit the full 256-bit security of segwit, rather than being limited to 160-bit security imposed by the older address types.

In an ideal world users wouldn't need to directly deal with addresses. But sometimes they do, so we should have an address format which is as easy to use as possible when they do.

&gt;  I clicked the links in the demo, what's going on in the background?

You're not just limited to clicking, you can type...

The software is efficiently able to tell you where the errors are if you've only made a couple.

We also have software that works efficiently for up to three errors. But the demo only does two errors because sometimes when you make three errors it will not be able to uniquely determine which errors you made. So rather than having it only sometimes work for three errors we made it consistent-- we'll need further testings.  If you make more than two errors it will just tell you ""invalid"" without telling you where, or it will sometimes suggest two random places where you haven't made an error.

I'm not sure how to provide a UI for three errors... the back end decoder software can output a short list of possible error patterns (always less than 6 entries long IIRC, usually one entry).   This is an area where some UI wizardry could probably do some neat things.

There are a lot of little details that went into this design, it was basically a couple years in the making with a couple months of pretty concerted work.  There are a lot of interesting details, like the error handling is even stronger than we claim if your errors are limited to visually similar ones.

df7jx3w,theymos,43,"LOL, if that's actually his thinking (which it might not be), then he likely doesn't want to increase block sizes much anyway. He probably likes the current fee rates.

Anyway, the entire way he's thinking is wrong:

* Lightning is totally possible without SegWit, it's just less efficient, and annoying because the current Lightning implementations were written assuming SegWit.
* Off-chain stuff is possible (and inevitable) with or without Lightning. See my posts on [federated sidechains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4xy0fm/scaling_quickly/) and [blinded bearer certificates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ksu3o/blinded_bearer_certificates/), two alternate methods of off-chain transactions which don't require softforks. Lightning is just better than those in most ways, and ironically the one that would result in the highest miner fees.
* In a world where Lightning was the main method of conducting BTC transactions, how it'd work is that every Bitcoin user would pay a tiny per-transaction fee to Lightning nodes and a few larger fees to miners every year for on-chain channel open/close transactions. You can imagine it like every Bitcoin user paying an annual subscription fee to miners rather than a per-transaction fee. This has the potential to lead to much higher total fees for miners, since you can charge more for the subscription than you can get from on-chain fees. For example, even with 1 MB blocks, it's plausible to charge 10 million people an annual $10 fee for the on-chain transactions necessary for their unlimited Lightning transactions, but is it really plausible that you can get enough on-chain transactions with high enough fees to get an equivalent revenue in on-chain fees? I really doubt it. If you averaged $0.01 in fees per transaction, you'd need to both *attract and survive* about 15% of Visa's total transaction volume in order to match the revenue of the 10 million people @ $10/year Lightning example. The ""survive"" part of that is almost certainly impossible right now, and ""attract"" is dubious when microtransactions are excluded due to the higher-than-Lightning per-transaction fees and when Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies are always going to be much worse transaction systems than centralized things like Visa (confirmation delays, etc.).

df76vl9,Technologov,42,"Alexey Eromenko ""Technologov"" speaks. A donator for ""Bitcoin Israel"" fund and I know Meni personally. And a fairly large crypto-currency holder since 2013. I think I must respond.

1. Censorship on r/bitcoin is an attack on freedom of speech and a no-no in my book. This leads to a community split into multiple channels on reddit and IRC.

2. Technical people from Bitcoin Core are just a bunch of clowns, that have no idea how-to scale the network. I have exactly ZERO trust in them. I was aware about block size problem from 2015, and I fully expected them to fix this issue in time, until my transactions stuck last month. In any good corporation they would be fired for gross-mismanagement of the project and inability to scale network. (starting with Greg Maxwell, Adam Back and Luke-jr --  We must show them the door.)
I trust Satoshi Nakamoto, though and his vision of ""Peer-to-peer electronic cash system"". I'm sorry, but with $1 fees on Bitcoin network nowadays, and 3 hour transaction times, Bitcoin blockchain is non-functional.
I'm a Bitcoin user since 2013, and which new features I got by 2017 ? Smart contracts? In Ethereum, not in Bitcoin. Privacy? Dash and Monero, not in Bitcoin. Masternode voting ? In Dash, not in Bitcoin. Incentivized Full-nodes, that get paid for uptime? In Dash, not in Bitcoin. In other words, all the new development happens in Alt-coins and is never back-ported into Bitcoin proper. I call for Bitcoin developers to back-port useful features from Alt-coins back into Bitcoin. (as it should happen, in most Open-Source projects)

3. The case against SegWit: (it's transactions take 2x more space)
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/60fcgb/segwit_was_intentionally_designed_in_a_wasteful/
SegWit, even if activated on 1 MB blocks will help scalability for just 6-to-12 months, at most. And it will reduce future scalability of the network due to ""fat transactions"" that take more space.

4. Lightning Network will subvert Bitcoin into a banking system:
https://forum.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-discussion/how-the-lightning-network-could-ultimately-destroy-bitcoin-t21092.html

5. This non-ending scalability deadlock, and the fact that my transactions getting stuck for 3 hours, pushed me squarely into Dash, and I sold a large chunk of my Bitcoins for Dash. (but if Bitcoin Unlimited solves the scalability problems of Bitcoin, I may consider to buy-back some BTC-u coins in the future)

6. Bitcoin Core people prevent the obvious fix -- one-line of code, which is an increase of Bitcoin block size from happening. Core solution is a non-solution and just a band-aid.

7. You say that ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" code as 'buggy and exploitable'. Yes, I agree that the technical code review process in BU needs to be improved. Crashing full nodes is not good, but it's a short-term damage.
But guess what ? The economic code of ""Bitcoin Core"" is buggy and exploitable. Technical computer code is much easier to fix, if good programmers are working on it, than the long-term damage done by Bitcoin Core people due to their bugs in Bitcoin 'Economic code', and refusal to scale network.

8. The economic majority favors the big blocks, as can be proved by Dash Masternode voting, where 99.2% of the community voted on increasing the block size.
https://www.dashcentral.org/p/2mb-blocksize
Bitcoin should have developed a similar mechanisms to allow for economic majority voting with their coins. Running a bunch of Full-nodes aka UASF is susceptible to sybil attacks, and just a bunch of nodes kicking themselves out of the network.
I'm damn sure that BTC-c coins will be dumped by the ton and have near zero value, while BTC-u coins will be valuable in the future.
I think if Bitcoin had something like Dash Masternode voting mechanisms, this fork could have been avoided.

9. I believe that 'hard fork' is a lesser evil; The Etherea Twins have two functional block-chains. Bitcoin nowadays has one dysfunctional block-chain, where tx don't confirm for hours. It needs to be fixed at any price. The debate is on-going for years with no resolution, ending in a deadlock. What will another year of debate solve ?

10. I feel that Gavin Andersen's BIP-101 (Bitcoin XT) is safer than Bitcoin Unlimited, as it's a more predictable scaling algorithm. It doesn't suffer from Emergent Consensus issues. Bitcoin Core will never scale, and it has a terrible future. But sadly our community seems to throw Bitcoin XT under the bus.

The way to scale network forward: (on-chain scalability, similar to what Satoshi envisioned)

A. Incentivized Full Node network (similar to Dash Masternodes), that get paid to upgrade hardware from the block-chain

B. Deleting old transaction history; No reason to keep tx history since the Caesar of Rome

df6x2zp,DeftNerd,40,"Thanks for sharing your opinion. I can tell that you've spent a lot of time thinking about it and have come to an informed conclusion. 

It happens to be a conclusion that a lot of people disagree with, but most of us here respect that it's yours. 

What strikes me is the sudden change of narrative about miners. Miners have always held the power. Back when Bitcoin XT was making in-roads, the narrative was ""node counts don't matter, only hash power counts."" Now that the tables are turning, the talking points are the exact opposite. The difficult thing about talking about community feelings or economic majorities is that those things are tenuous and impossible to measure. 

Bitcoin has spent most of it's existence measuring cold-hard-statistics and using internal algorithms, it routinely changes it's behavior to compensate. 

The Bitcoin Unlimited camp simply believes that blocksize is another one of those things that should be determined in an algorithmic way rather than through decisions based on the opinion of who happens to have committed the most code in the last year or two. 

Core refused to concede the concept of on-chain scaling, even though limiting transactions-per-second in order to force a fee market or force users to use off-chain solutions was never in the plans. 

At this point, an agreement can never be made. It's become a full-fledged change of political parties between people Core, with the vision of Bitcoin primarily being used as infrastructure for payment processing services, or Bitcoin being used primarily by individuals. ",2017-03-21 07:19:29

&gt; In summary, while the issue of fork seems like an ideological difference, in reality it is a conflict of interests. If we want to solve the conflict, we must not yell slogans, talk ideologies, talk who's correct. Using the ~~pro-core~~ de-centralization bludgeon to attack opponents, using high fees to incite anger among users in order to rebuke opponents, these are not the solutions to the problem.

&gt; If we want to solve the problem, we have to talk sincerely about interests, and reach compromise in the pursuit of these interests. Miners shouldn't try to strangle the developers in their development of new functionality, developers also need to protect miner's interest in their push to making progress and developing new functionality.

df9ay4i,nullc,99,"In the Bitcoin Whitepaper, section 8 paragraph 2, Satoshi explained that in the event that a majority of hashpower produces rule violating blocks network nodes will be unaffected by the attack because they verify for themselves and will not be tricked no matter how much hashpower is involved.  To a network node an invalid block is pretty much the same as a non-existing block.

But, as the text went on to explain, lite wallets are more exposed to being attacked with invalid blocks because they do not verify-- they trust that the verification everyone else running a network node performs will make it uneconomical for miners to attack. He goes on to explain that lite wallets could be made more secure if honest peers would tell them where invalidity was so they could go check for themselves. (it also suggests that merchants would run network nodes regardless, which isn't how things have worked out...)

The problem was that his design didn't support lite nodes checking for themselves: for many kinds of invalidity the lite wallet would have to download the whole chain history to check. If it was willing to do that when any peer suggested it, it could be easily DOS attacked.

In the subsequent years, we've figured out hot to create very compact proofs of misbehavior for all the network's rules. But to accomplish this we need additional soft-forks that added extra hint-data to blocks.

What Luke did here is that he came up with a moderately efficient proof that a block is too big that doesn't require any additional network rules over what we have now.

This would allow lite clients to enforce the blocksize rule on their own, so long as they had even a single honest rule enforcing peer... without having to blindly trust miners to comply with this rule, or trust that none of their peers would hand them an invalid block.

Normally a proof for such a narrow part of the rules wouldn't be that interesting, but it is relevant to recent discussions.",2017-03-22 21:49:38

I understand that Visual Studio goes and disables them in ""release builds"" and when I discovered that I thought it was bizarre and a poor idea.

In Bitcoin Core asserts are used to check for impossible state corruption which, if operation were to continue very bad things would happen-- like consensus divergence, secret information leaks, or remote code execution.  There are things worse than a clean and safe crash, much worse.

Because all the development and testing is done with these assertions in place, and because they're specifically designed to be protective against corruption-- we wouldn't disable them in releases: after all, the software wasn't built or tested without them!

One of the flaws in with assert (even called out in the man page) is that it's easy to end up with code that behaves differently with them in or out. Of course, we endeavor to not introduce any of those cases, and -- in fact, Bitcoin Core currently works fine with the assertions pulled out. (Though this isn't true for Unlimited or Classic, both will fail to work correctly if NDEBUG is set.)

The BU code was broken regardless of asserts being in release builds or not... actually, the assert is actually protecting them here: in this latest crash without the assert the code would go ahead and do a bunch of manipulation of uninitialized memory, with who knows what consequence.

This is purely for practical reasons, not a judgement for or against.  If the market decides to follow the BU chain, then after enough time, and with enough clarity on the market's decision (ie - not ambiguous), I would refer to that chain as Bitcoin and ShapeShift may reassign the name/ticker. 

I don't think any group gets to say what is Bitcoin and what it isn't. That definition properly emerges from the consensus of the market (remember, decentralization?). If 90% of hashrate, users, and market value prefer the BU chain, then in my mind that is Bitcoin, and the minority chain is not. Similarly, if Core ever leads a HF with a substantial majority support, I will also consider that Bitcoin. Core supporters should be careful: if you advocate that any HF creates an altcoin, then what will you do when Core proposes one? 

Hardforking from the main chain doesn't create an altcoin. It creates a decision point, on which every market participate must judge for himself. The outcome of those decisions, unpredictable ahead of time, is a more appropriate declaration of the true Bitcoin than any specific group within.  Stated differently, if a majority doesn't get to declare what Bitcoin is, then certainly neither does a minority. It is a choice I'm happy leaving to the market, anything else is the exact kind of centralization that Bitcoin was built to resist. 

None of the above position endorses BU. Indeed, as I've stated in many places, I do not support BU. But I do support decentralization, and I respect long-term market-based decisions, and if the market clearly prefers the new chain, then I will respect that. 

This explicitly does NOT mean that if on day 1 after a HF, the BU chain has 60% of hashrate, I am not suddenly going to claim that to be the true Bitcoin. I'm going to let the market make it clear, which will take time and multiple metrics, and leave it at that. ",2017-03-23 02:45:47

Some notable weaknesses of Monero:

1. **Privacy**. I would argue that Monero is the most private currency around, but it is not perfect. There are still some privacy concerns. Most notably is an attack where one can figure out which node is the origin of a transaction. This is being mitigated with the development of Kovri, which is an I2P router in C++. With this implemented, transactions would instead be pushed to the network within I2P. The majority of node syncing would still occur over the clearnet since I2P speeds are limited. RingCT is not yet required, so some pool operators have yet to use these new privacy enhancements. It will be required later this year. Finally, the minimum mixin (being renamed to ""ring size"" to help avoid confusion with Bitcoin mixing services) of 2 is too low. [Less than 25% of transactions use a mixin greater than 2](http://moneroblocks.info/stats/ring-size). The minimum is supposed to be increased to 4 the same time RingCT will be made mandatory, but there is some discussion to increase this number further.

2. **Mining centralization**. [A large proportion of Monero mining is consumed by 4 large pools](https://monerohash.com/#network). As of writing, no single pool controls more than 20% of the total hashrate, but mining decentralization is extremely important. Smart mining is being developed to try and increase the hashrates of solo miners. (edited)

3. **No phone wallets**. It is quite difficult to use Monero on your phone. Right now the only options are wallets that hold your keys for you (see Freewallet, which the community heavily discourages the use of) or web wallets (MyMonero). Jaxx claimed to have the implementation finished in December, but they later said that Monero support was scrapped. Exodus and others are still working on adding Monero, but in the meantime, this is difficult.

4. **Transaction size**. As others have pointed out, Monero transactions are very large. I personally do not think this is a major issue, but they are much larger than a Bitcoin transaction.

5. **Limited use**. Monero does not have the same level of adoption as Bitcoin. Although Monero has more volume than most coins similar in size, it is typically used as a tool to anonymize Bitcoin.

6. **Development difficulty**. I mentioned this earlier with Jaxx, but Monero is harder to add things to than Bitcoin-based coins. For instance, may wallets added support for ZCash's non-anonymous coins very shortly after release. Edit: we have yet to have a hardware wallet support Monero.

7. **Limited merchant tools**. To accept Monero currently, a merchant still has to do a bit of work. Projects like [PayBee](https://payb.ee/) are trying to mitigate this, but the project has not seen much public development in the past year.

8. **Geographic limitations**. No, Monero use is not limited to certain geographical areas. But certain areas have not seen significant adoption of Monero. These regions include South America, Africa, and Asia. Additional translations and resources are needed to help increase use in these regions.",2017-03-23 22:03:44

**Bats Exchange Objects to SEC’s Denial of Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF**   
    Exchange-traded fund would track the price of the digital currency    


WASHINGTON—An exchange that would have listed the first exchange-traded fund to track the price of the digital currency bitcoin is formally objecting to a regulatory decision rejecting the idea.     

Bats BZX Exchange, operated by CBOE Holdings Inc., told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to effectively appeal the SEC staff’s March 10 decision to turn down the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, according to a letter posted on the SEC’s website.      

Bats said it plans to petition the commission to take up the matter, which had been delegated to its staff. It isn’t clear if there is any mechanism requiring the commission to act on such a petition. The SEC is operating with just two commissioners, three less than its full complement.     


Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust first applied for approval of the product nearly four years ago. The bitcoin industry had been hoping an exchange-traded product would make the currency attractive to Wall Street and retail investors. The SEC’s denial set that back.     

The Bats letter was dated March 17 but not posted publicly until this week. A spokeswoman for Bats declined to comment Wednesday. An SEC spokeswoman had no immediate comment.

It is far from perfect, as I pointed out. But I still think it is the best survey data the bitcoin community currently has. I wished my tool counted users and I asked not for ""acceptable outcomes"" but for ""unacceptable outcomes"". Would be better to determine consensus. 

&gt; The vast majority voted for 1 or 2MB block size + segwit.

You forgot that nearly as much people voted for hardforking to bigger blocks. 

&gt; I find it rather fascinating that u/CBergmann, after expressing his surprise in the article about the results of the poll, keeps shilling for BU on reddit at this very moment as if nothing ever happened.

I ""shill"" for a blocksize increase like I do for more than two years, while being neutral on my blog, as dozens of readers confimed last days. Many said that bitcoinblog.de is the most neutral source available for the blocksize-mess. I have been constantly open about my position, and according to the survey this is backed by a majority of readers, which don't accept a future without a blocksize-increasing hardfork.

Also imho the easiest and safest way to SegWit is a blocksize increase as it is obvious that the miners will not activate SW without. As a majority of my readers don't want to accept a future without SegWit, this is, again, consistent.

&gt; In case you read this, werter Herr Bergmann, maybe you can explain your reasoning to us, the ones who do not understand?!

I like BU because it is compatible with the blocksize increasing hardfork which has support by a majority of readers. I also think that the blocksize increasing hardfork is the fastest and only possible way to achieve what the majority of my readers also want: SegWit.

But - and this is what I learned - I do no longer believe that a pure BU / EC solution, without some hard limit like 2 MB, will get support, and I don't think I will support a blocksize increasing hardfork if it doesn't come along with a new hart limit.

In any other system that I can think of, this kind of activity would completely destroy the network and cause it to be non-functional.

With Bitcoin, the network continues to hum along, processing payments at full capacity. Everyone somehow magically still agrees on the ledger and who owns what. Developers continue to code and issue patches. Miners continue to secure the network, validate transactions and collect rewards. Exchanges continue to operate just fine.

dfcsmxk,DeadFrancisco,47,"I would like to take a moment to thank this community for being so wonderful. Especially the dozen or so veteran users who post quality analysis almost every day. I've been here for just over a year, and have learned so much from all of you.

Everyone has a goal for what they wan't from Bitcoin, and I'm writing this because today, I reached mine in a way.

When I first started here, I had made the decision that I was going to buy a house. I had enough extra on my paychecks that if I saved for a year, I would have enough for the down payment, so I started saving. But just letting money sit in a savings account earning 0.1% for a year didn't sit right with me. Stocks seemed a little too hard to get into, and bonds didn't feel liquid enough, I had bought some bitcoin from Mt. Gox before the crash so I figured I'd check to see if bitcoin ever recovered from that. You can imagine how happy I was to see the state of the market in 2015.

So I took the plunge, I started putting all my savings in bitcoin. Sure it has violent mood swings, but the overall trend was solidly up and my plan was buy and hold, I was trading the time frame of a year, not day to day. If I made 5-10% on my savings and could buy new couches to go with my house I would have been happy.

Today I'm cashing out my down payment, and my holdings are triple what I put in. I've made almost as much off of trading in the last two months as I do at my day job. What I thought was just going to be a temporary savings boost has become a profitable part time job that I'll be sticking with for quite some time.

So sincerely /r/bitcoinmarkets, Thank you.",2017-03-25 01:05:39

Unfortunately the author and self proclaimed BU-fanboy (his very own words, not making this shit up) u/CBergmann messed things up real good. Everybody could vote for everything. The data is therefore pretty much useless. Only two things are abundantly clear: absolutely nobody wants BU and everyone likes segwit.

The vast majority voted for 1 or 2MB block size + segwit.

I find it rather fascinating that u/CBergmann, after expressing his surprise in the article about the results of the poll, keeps shilling for BU on reddit at this very moment as if nothing ever happened.

The mental gymnastics and deeply rooted disingenuity required for such behavior is far beyond my intellectual scope, but seems rather common with BU supporters.

dfe8iwp,Nooku,74,"&gt; Bitcoin is only interesting as a currency That's what it was designed for. That's why it's called bitCOIN. 

This is false information. So false.

In 2010, Satoshi was talking about programmable money, smart contracts. The currency aspect was just the beginning, and only meant to be one (the 1st) application of Bitcoin.

The endless possibilities of Bitcoin beyond the currency-aspect was what got everyone excited back in 2012. 

*""It's more than just a currency""* was the main mantra.

I remember this, I was there, and in the middle of it. 

In 2012, The Bitcoin sub was **super excited** about all of the aspects that are now successfully embodied into Ethereum. Now the Bitcoin sub actively hates and ridicules all of these same things.

The creation of a turing-complete language in Bitcoin was in progress.

But then powerful individuals threw it all away, and deceived the public. This programming language never got finished.

Now everyone is spewing out these lies about ""Bitcoin is supposed to be just a currency"" as if it were the real historical truth.

The reason of Ethereum's success is the simple fact the community didn't allow those dreams of programmable money to get shattered. The real Bitcoin community ( &lt; from the 2014 era) stood up and fought back against these individuals like Theymos. 

They grouped together and created Ethereum, operating beyond the influences of these anti-Bitcoiners. And now it's on track to rapidly take over control as effectively the real Bitcoin.

Despite all of the attacks from rogue individuals, Satoshi's vision survived and is now more alive than ever before, in Ethereum. This is why Ethereum is so successful, it's embodying the success that was meant for Bitcoin before it got hijacked by Blockstream, Theymos, Core, ....

Everyone who thinks Bitcoin is meant to be nothing more than a currency does not have a clue what's going on, they are still sleeping, brainwashed.

The future of the Bitcoin protocol itself has become irrelevant, Bitcoin is only the remnants of a fight that has already been won by Ethereum. It's one of the ruins of the early stages of the Bitcoin idea. People just haven't realized it yet, but they will, very soon.

That's the full story. 

You won't see this story on the Ethereum sub because ever since the beginning they've (rightfully so) tried to prevent this to become a ""us-vs-them"" thing and stay far away from Bitcoins negative influences. And you won't read it on the Bitcoin sub either for obvious reasons.",2017-03-26 01:09:57

dffbjcv,Xanesghost,48,"It's simple. Bitcoin is a narrow single-purpose application. Ethereum is a broad multi-purpose platform.

The former stands to the latter as the calculator stands to the computer. The computer is an abstraction of calculation processes in a way similar to how Ethereum is an abstraction of consensus protocols. 

What we have in Bitcoin is a proof-of-work consensus protocol that has been programmatically-limited to drive a peer-to-peer cash system. What we have in Ethereum is a proof-of-work consensus protocol (to be phased out for proof-of-stake) that takes full advantage of its programming environment to drive a peer-to-peer crypto-economic platform capable of expressing an arbitrary variety of value logics (token economies), decentralized agreements (smart contracts), applications (DApps), and organizations (DAOs).

Ethereum has an absolutely massive design space precisely because of this highly expressive programmatic dimension. As such, its utility as the primary factor of its value is potentially unlimited. This is why Ethereum is fundamentally superior to Bitcoin. This is why people call it the ""world computer"".

Is Ethereum the end all and be all of the crypto-space? Perhaps, perhaps not. This is a very complicated subject that touches on network effects, economic incentives, social influence, developer mindshare, and many other topics. The question to my mind is not whether something better than Ethereum will arise. That is a certainty. The question is whether Ethereum will continue to evolve and further assimilate its competition, or whether it will become immobilized by internal politics and stagnate like Bitcoin.

In my view, the former is more probable than the latter, at least for now. This is mainly because of the progressive mindset and cooperative nature of the present community. As long as the community is unified in pushing forward with improvements to the protocol, there is no reason to think Ethereum will lose its dominance. Ultimately, I believe the community will overcome Bitcoin's mistake of rejecting / ridiculing the political aspect of blockchains and develop a set of fair consensual governance mechanisms to reduce the possibility of centralized control and increase the possibility of constructive social coordination.

dfeq0pg,jazzmoses,45,"Bitcoin was the first successful decentralised currency. It succeeded on a proposition of a classical &gt;10x improvement over the status quo, fiat currencies. How do any of Bitcoin's competitors offer a &gt;10x improvement over Bitcoin? If you believe in the true value of Bitcoin being inflation and censorship resistant, fast and digital currency, offering value among other things by saving the whole world from the secret tax of currency debasement, then they don't. They all are either technically about as good as Bitcoin, or have a few features that are either available or possible to implement in Bitcoin.

But they lack what Bitcoin has - the network effect and the prestige. In a market of open-source competitors, any of whom can at any point completely change their software to suit, this is key. Network effect is the only thing you can't copy. No competing feature would be impossible to implement in Bitcoin if the market really wanted it. And anyway, even if you think Bitcoin is technically inferior, and illogically believe it won't be improved, the world is rife with crappy design that stuck around because of network effects. If you think competitors can succeed against network effect incumbents just by tacking on some bells and whistles, ask Google how Google Plus is doing.

The drama about block size debate is overblown. Any competing crypto that would grow to Bitcoin's size would also be beset by similar political battles. None of them have better governance or development team fundamentals. They all just at best look a little shinier because they are so small that nobody cares and their monopolistic dev teams are free to do whatever they want. As Antonopolous said, don't mistake easy sailing for great sailors. If Ether grew to truly compete with Bitcoin, it would be ripped apart by struggles for control just the same.

In investing like in many other areas of life, people get bored and want new excitement. People don't want to hear that what was right yesterday is still right today and will be right tomorrow. They want drama and hot stories and new strategies. They don't like just trucking along, no one wants to be the tortoise.

Edit: furthermore, when you have a market with many small clones attacking one network-effect incumbent, you have a problem of choice ambiguity which tends to support the incumbent. Maybe you could argue Ether has some interesting improvements. So does Dash though. And what about Monero? Or Zcash? Lightcoin? Ethereum classic? Etc etc. Money might flow out to these competitors, but it can't decide, and people tend to periodically retreat back to the secure ""safe haven"" offered by the incumbent.

Given all the recent misinformation out there, apparently you weren't aware that the AD setting can be turned off in BU, and that Classic doesn't even have AD. Thus BU merely makes it *more convenient* to adjust your own node's blocksize settings. Borrowing from a recent comment of mine: 

**Adjustable-blocksize-cap (ABC) clients give miners exactly zero additional power.** BU, Classic, and other ABC clients are really just an argument in code form, shattering the illusion that devs are part of the governance structure.

Spot the difference between how stakeholders can coordinate to fork to 2MB in a Core world vs. in an adjustable-blocksize-cap (ABC) client world: 

- Core: miners and nodes coordinate to mod their Core code to increase the cap to 2MB

- ABC clients: miners and nodes coordinate to adjust their client settings to increase the cap to 2MB

Where is any extra power handed to miners? Where is any power taken away from nodes? How is the situation with ABC clients any different than under Core? We can point only to the difference in convenience, and even that was bound to be erased sooner or later by an enterprising developer. 

What does it tell you that Core and its supporters are up in arms about a change that *merely makes something more convenient for users* and couldn't be prevented from happening anyway? Attacking the adjustable blocksize feature in BU and Classic as ""dangerous"" is a kind of trap, as it is an implicit admission that Bitcoin was being protected only by a small barrier of inconvenience, and a completely temporary one at that. If this was such a ""danger"" or such a vector for an ""attack,"" how come we never heard about it before? 

And even if we accept the remarkable premise that somehow this small inconvenience was the chewing gum and bailing wire holding the network together, it already would imply that letting stakeholders make their own choices is dangerous and that the only way to keep Bitcoin working is to spoonfed stances on controversial consensus settings to all user. 

Even if we accept the improbable premise that inconvenience is the great bastion holding Bitcoin together *and* the paternalistic premise that stakeholders need to be fed consensus using a spoon of inconvenience, we still must ask, who shall do the spoonfeeding?

Core accepts these two amazing premises and further declares that Core alone shall be allowed to do the spoonfeeding. Or rather, if you really want to you can be spoonfed by other implementation clients like libbitcoin and btcd as long as they are all feeding you the same stances on controversial consensus settings as Core does. 

Core and many of its supporters consider anyone trying to feed you anything else an outright attack on Bitcoin itself (examples: XT feeding you BIP101, the old Classic feeding you 2MB). More remarkable still, these people also consider anyone *refusing to spoonfed you anything* as an attack (examples: BU, new Classic, and other ABC clients). 

This all of course implies the only non-attack is to vest all control and authority in the Core developers, specifically a few committers and the maintainer of a single repository. This mindset that considers everything else an ""attack"" is implicitly a centralized governance model, not specifically because *Core* is centralized but because all dev teams are. 

The kind of adversarial thinking bitcoiners are familiar with easily demonstrates that any single dev team is ripe for co-option. The only protection against one team holding the community over a barrel on controversial matters is to have many mature competing teams, and better still would be if none of these teams try to bake their own coders' stances on controversies into the code offerings by hiding the control panel for those settings away from the user. 

Such practices manage to be both childish and paternalistic, while lacking any material and sustainable effect of saving supposedly hapless stakeholders from making the wrong decision on controversial matters. 

It is high time the community see central planning and abuse of power for what it is, and reject both: 

- Throw off central planning by removing petty ""inconvenience walls"" (such as baked-in, dev-recommended blocksize caps) that interfere with stakeholders coordinating choices amongst themselves on controversial matters, without forcing those who disagree with the dev teams recommendations to switch dev teams

- Make such abuse of power impossible by encouraging many competing implementations to grow and blossom",2017-03-26 13:11:26

The trend has been broken.  The Bull cycle is over.   Long live the bears.

I know it sounds dire.  Its probably not.  Trends comes and go all of the time.  This trend was very good to a lot of us.  Take a moment and remember it fondly.

So the column of Os fell yesterday and last night through the 900s and into the high 800s.  The trend was broken when we fell through 950.  The support we see now is the support that held at the end of January through the first part of February.

Yes, we’ve fallen all the way back two months.

The price bottomed out this time right above the target set by the width of the formation.  That was indicated by the red and yellow “w” under the current column of Os. I think its cool when it does that.

We will need to reverse above $920 and hold it through 7 PM EDT.  The positive break out is above $1,060.  I think we might want to keep our sights focused a little closer to reality for the next few days.

The trend turned bearish.  So we change the marker to the black “+” coming down from the most recent high column. That puts the current trend reversal point at $1,120.  The good news is that the resistance of the trend moves down to the right as fast as the support moved up from the left.  A nice consolidation here will catch us up there within a week or so.

Of course, since the trend is negative, I have to put on my “Glum” mask and rant, “We’re doomed…we are never going to make it.  We are all going to die!”  It's all negative, all of the time!
 
Since last February (2016) we’ve broken to a negative trend 5 times.  I count the length of the bear market by counting the number of “+” in the downward trend.  Thus, for these purposes the bear cycle has been in motion for 9 columns.

The average number of columns before a bear market has resolved itself has been 5 columns.  So…as we speak, this cycle is already almost twice as long as every other one for the past year.  So I guess the question is whether or not this is one of those “fundamental change” type of bear market, as the one after the collapse in early 2014 was.

(Note:  Keep in mind this is a cycle.  That means a full rotation--so it would be from the highest recent high to the recent low.  So, the trip from the recent high brings us back to the trend line.  That means we need to hit a bottom and start back upwards.  That is why I've stated we enter the cycle 9 columns ago.  We will break the bear cycle long before we hit new highs.)

I guess that answer is still to be discovered.

If Past is Prologue, we will be seeing some green sprouts pretty soon.  Personally, I moved some bitcoin out the other night to cover my goddamn tax bill.  But its better to have it, than to need it.  I am going put off moving the remainder back into bitcoin until we get some direction.

Its too soon to become bummed out.

On the other side I started listening to “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds.”  It is a fascinating look at bubbles throughout the earliest days of Capitalism.  I have to admit to seeing a lot of similar behavior in some circles around here (meaning reddit in particular and the internet in general.)  It is a good idea to listen to the dissenters and the naysayers once in a while.  It is a good idea to listen to that little voice in your head that asks “when are you going to have enough?  And how are you going to feel when you lose it all?

You see, the trend reverses and I turn into your grandfather.

Not really.  But it is good to maybe write down your goals and values.  And periodically review them.  Then you will stay on course and not be surprised at anything.

PS:  I left a little ghost of the old support line going through the downward line to the convergence point I mentioned Friday afternoon.  I may have some meaning, or not.  When lines cross I always look for something to happen.

Remember when everyone said it was for-sure variance and I shouldn't care until ""pools shift"" or some other qualitative thing like ""what miners support""? 

The variance has persisted for the last three days, making this event very improbable to be coincidence. [Coindance](https://coin.dance/blocks) now shows segwit once again mining more blocks in the last 24 hours than BU. Segwit at 35.4% and BU at 34.7% (as of time I am writing this). Bitcoin.sipa.be [shows](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/versions.html) segwit signaling rising to a new high at about 35% signaling (and broke 37% earlier). /u/frogolocalypse [posted a tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61i8xk/segregated_witness_at_36/dfev3dl/) from Samson Mow saying miners are exiting BU pools. /u/granatheus points out [that a new pool](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61hho5/who_is_haozhuzhu_who_mined_block_458907_and/) 'haozhuzhu' has started signaling segwit (segwit has gained about 3% signaling power very recently. That pool (haozhuzhu) and a few other small ones have begun signaling apparently).

Anyone else wanna say this is ""variance"" now? By keeping my eyes open and playing the probabilities and noticing when a *large* deviation from the status quo in terms of mined blocks was persisting longer than statistics said it should, I basically called the (local) top of the BU hash rate.

dffd6qr,bcn00b,33,"Good morning ladies and gents. I've been looking forward to today's analysis. It has been an eventful week and have been seeing a lot of TA being posted in this sub. Thanks everyone for sharing. I'll start with evaluating [my last week's analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/608c9q/daily_discussion_sunday_march_19_2017/df4lk7z/?context=3) and then throw in a bonus analysis for the short term.

Today's Technical Analysis (TA) and Psychological Analysis (TA):

* TA: The *head* of the potential head and shoulders that I've been hinting at the last couple of weeks has gained a good footing. In my last post I had suggested a price target of $892 on Bitstamp (61.8% fibonacci line) and we hit $891.33. That is amazing, however, I'm still waiting of some kind of confirmation that this is a local bottom, more on this in the short term analysis below. Current state of the potential head and shoulders: http://imgur.com/a/JWh0g
* TA: Weekly and daily USD volume has been slightly decreasing, indicating that the downwards velocity has be decreasing in the short term. This can be a good thing, because the first leg down was quite strong and it got me contemplating whether we were actually going to blast out of the long term ascending channel before the right shoulder could form. I'm still not 100% sure that won't happen, but it seems less likely now.
* TA: The 1w MACD is teasing us right now with a potential bearish cross over. Exchanges are divided whether to let this happen, Bitstamp and Bitfinex MACD's are still in the green (barely), while Kraken and OKCoin seem to be heading to a cross over already (weekly candle closes in ~13 hours). If a bearish cross over happens, this has to be taken into account with other indicators. Just the MACD crossover in itself is not sufficient to make an educated guess as different things have happened before in such an event.
* TA: 1w lower BBAND is sitting right at the 38.2% fib line which is ~$610, this could prove a point of heavy support if we happen to get near that, should the current support give in. Current support consists of the 61.8% fib line (~$890) and the bottom of the long term ascending channel ($830 - $845) which is closing in on the fib line, in fact, these are going to intersect in 3 weeks from now.
* TA: The lower band of the 1w StochRSI is sitting below 20 and has diverged quote a bit from the upper band. This could be a warning for a (short term) bounce. Confirmation for this bounce could be given should the bands cross again. Always wait for confirmation is my motto.
* TA: 1w RSI is still above 50, if you think this price drop couldn't get any worse, RSI tells you otherwise, there is plenty of room to go down even further. The RSI double top and lower low would suggest this is likely to happen on the medium term.
* PA: Not much to notice regarding psychological events this week. There have been the occasional ""I'm a long term hodler and I'm selling"" and people wanting to take a break, however, the quantity of these posts seem reasonable, we have not yet hit low morale levels just yet.

Disclaimer: I'm still in fiat at the moment. As long as we stay in the ascending channel, I'm trading as if we're in a bull trend. That means no shorting, just unleveraged longs within the channel and go leveraged once we break out on either side. Now that we're near the bottom of the ascending channel, I have drafted up a strategy which may allow for a short term unleveraged long. Here is how it goes:

* We've hit the 61.8% fib line, but we have not seen a double bottom yet. Currently I'm waiting for a double bottom (i.e. waiting for a higher low or a slightly lower low on low volume) to remove one obstacle that's preventing me to go long here. There is a second strong support just below this fib line, and it's not said that we can't go there first. It might go down a bit further first and then double bottom there or just go straight to goblin town.
* There are 2 important short term resistance lines coming down from around the time of the ETF decision. http://imgur.com/a/Zv5n8 If the double bottom is formed beneath these trendlines, my entry point will be when we cross these resistance lines. I expect a lot of others will jump in at that moment, too. This will form a classic W pattern with a steep rise which is very common in Bitcoin. My exit point will be around $1090. It could go a bit higher than that, but I'm content with taking profits there. Still concerned about a potential trend reversal so I won't be hodling long term until that's invalidated somehow. We're currently seeing a slight recovery from touching the fib line (hovering above $960 as I write this), in order to turn this into a W pattern right here we should bounce back down from the resistance line and form a second bottom.
* Should the double bottom not form, then I'll hold off with my long. It could form a lower low instead (where I can reconsider the same strategy) or even break through the lower support (at which I intend to open a leveraged short). It could also skip double bottoming before going up through the resistance line(s), at which I will also not go long, but keep a close eye whether this head and shoulders is still playing out, because this could still become the right shoulder.
* The time frame to look at for this scenario is the 12h chart. On the 12h chart, the second bottom could in fact be this drop to $890, but it's a bit too far below the previous trough for my liking and it had significant volume as well, so the pattern starting at March 16th may not be the double bottom that I'm looking for. There is another potential double bottom starting at March 22nd which I'm currently eyeballing. The price is ""allowed"" to move up to $1000 in the next 1.5 days before going down to form the second trough.

Happy trading everyone, take good care of yourselves, your coins and your health.",2017-03-26 21:49:06

I have to say the past week or so has shown just how immature a lot of the community surrounding bitcoin really is.

The entire unlimited / core fallout is an embarrassment. The autistic screeching meme is exceptionally fitting for both sides and I don't mean that with much hyperbole. Reading the other subs the signal to noise ratio makes it quite a chore, with a lot of cult-like behaviour that reminds me more of political elections. The irony here being that it's very much possible for both sides to lose.

The numbers of LTHers announcing that they're cashing out also reeks of immaturity (though I wouldn't rule out shills). Every LTHer should have a plan of when to cash out which they stick to - for example, I sold a small amount when we broke the ATH. Anyone panicking now has clearly invested more than they could afford to lose so it's probably for the best they take their profits now.

As for me, I'm off for a month long holiday soon. For that time I'll remove all price trackers from my phone and will forget about bitcoin for a while which is probably a very healthy thing to do.

These new people who spout fear and uncertainty seem to misinterpret the meaning and sentiment behind the flippening.  Like we're counting on bitcoin's failure as our primary goal or means of sustained rise.  Meanwhile ignoring that Coinbase and Korea led the path to $50 with new Fiat.  

The flippening is something that they control with their own confidence and conscience, and will happen naturally as time goes by.  It's a byproduct of the fundamentals, not the cause.

I've spent a lot of time recently studying RSK, and Lightning, both can be production ready THIS year. Coffee, micro transactions can be done on those layers so smoothly. 

IMHO I'm not a scaling expert nor a PhD in computer science but I trust those who are. This is a scaling question at the end of the day, how do we scale ?

Bigger blocks *could* be the answer, but the solutions available to us are nowhere near ready and once they are, it takes some time to safely plan a hard fork. As we've seen in the past 60 days, if BU were the reference client, we could have had some big issues. I do appreciate the work that the Core developers and the BU devs have done (even if I don't agree with the personalities of some). Developing Bitcoin is HARD, and most of the Core devs have been doing it for years. 

We have a good solution available to us, that's SegWit. Every smart person on both sides of the debate agree it's good technology and ready to go. Let's activate it. If it's not good enough in 1 year from now, we can revisit scaling and bigger blocks. 

Let's make this about scaling and not about who gets to control it.

That being said, the PR itself references this post I wrote on the Armory forums: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1837143.msg18289746#msg18289746

In this post, I lay out a detailed explanation of how to get Armory to see both chains and how to taint your coins, as well as general pros and cons of self tainting vs leaving custodial services to do it for you. This was done in the spirit of a PSA, not with the intent to endorse either chain. **If you read this post hoping to find a position on the fork in it, you are wasting your time.**

The post boils down to this:

1. Armory can work on both chains if you go through the proper steps. I detail the step as well as what to not do in order to keep both chains and databases segregated.
2. It is preferable to remove your coins from exchanges prior to a fork and taint by yourself. There is basically no risk in doing so, and a non negligible risk to rely on an exchange instead.

The excerpt achow uses focused on segragating the DBs as well as how to taint your coins. It is basically taken verbatim from the original post. **The first sentence in the post was written by achow alone, and so far does not reflect the official position of the project**. That PR is still in review and open to modifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now for the politics!

Before getting into that, I need clarify the nature of my posts on the bitcointalk Armory subforum. That forum is for the project, not my personal opinion, therefore any of my posts in that subforum that is not explicitly about support or technical discussion is to be read as a PSA. It is not a place to engage in politics nor express my personal opinion, and while I do not moderate people insulting me or the project in there, expect me to move political discussions out of that subforum.

I tend to keep my opinion to myself, and if I want to get political I'll either start to blog on Medium or post here in relevant threads. Since this post got people speculating, you will be getting my position first hand.

I maintain and therefore represent Armory. It only makes sense that I express both a position for Armory, and a personal one.

######**Armory's position:**

Armory is a free open source project. People are free to contribute code and try to take the project where they want. If my personal opinion differs from theirs, I will not assist them in the endeavor. They are free to fork the repo and post in the forums all they want regardless.

That said, Armory is a wallet, and the sole 2 criteria required for a feature to be eligible for development/inclusion are the following:

1. The design and specification of the aspiring feature ought to be technically feasible, sound and satisfy Armory's technological and security requirements.
2. There ought to be a demonstrable demand for this feature in the user base, or a reasonable expectation of future demand. The evident axiom to this proposition is that a new feature cannot alienate the existing user base for the benefit of another group.

As you will notice, there are no considerations for politics in this process. To put this in perspective, Armory is a wallet, and a wallet's job is orthogonal to the motivations behind a fork. Meanwhile, a fork will see users with coins on both chains, and Armory should deliver its users with access to both these chains, for that it is a natural development upon the wallet's original purpose. My opinion on the fork is irrelevant.

A look at the recent development cycle will demonstrate this position: I spent around 3 months implementing support for SegWit as well as compressed public key. This was done with the explicit intent of keeping the code paths separate. Indeed, people who do not want to use SegWit can ignore the new code. The legacy P2PKH feature still runs the old code path etotheipi implemented years ago. That code is time tested and robust, there is no need to force people off of it if they do not want to.

At the same time the use of compressed keys was introduced with better handling of fee/byte scenarios to enable users to lower their fees. Again, these features rely on their own dedicated code and users that do not wish to use them are not forced to. Same goes with the privacy improvements. All of it is opt-in.

This approach is in line with SegWit and soft forks in general, in that since the on chain feature is opt-in, the respective wallet feature is opt-in as well. Consider that this was not a benign choice to make, as it would have been a whole lot easier to force everybody on SegWit and stall the release until a chain activates the feature. 

During the development process, mempool saturation spiked and while very few Armory users complained about stuck transactions, it became evident CPFP was in demand, so I took another 2 weeks to support CPFP. Later the threat of a fork solidified, so I took another 3 weeks to add RBF to allow users to taint on their own.

For an example of something I would never allow in Armory, look at anything built around BIP70.

On the subject of fork splits, Armory has no position on them. Amicable forks are preferable to contentious forks by nature, but neither of these matter from the perspective of the project. However, Armory is strongly opposed to any project and community that supports following its fork split with a miner pogrom on the original chain. **This behavior stands against everything that is Bitcoin and should be denounced for the shameful, awkwardly disguised aggression this path of action results in.**

######My personal opinion: 

If you do not care about it, stop reading now.

I am satisfied with the direction Core has taken Bitcoin in, both in concept, design and code. Core retains my confidence for the current set of features under development.

I disagree with BU on almost every point. I will list them out for sake of being thorough:

1. I agree Bitcoin needs scaled.
2. I do not agree that Bitcoin needs scaled this very moment. I would have been happy with a version of SegWit that also halved the block size limit to compensate for the increased capacity. IMO, a whole lot still needs done before scaling is desirable and technically sound. The increased capacity of SegWit is a compromise I am willing to make, seeing that the fee discount on witness transactions realigns incentives in favor of utxo consolidation (helps keep the UTXO set in check)
3. I disagree with BU's primary principle that the block size should be decided by user and miner vote. I disagree with the block size hardcap on the grounds that it is a magic number. Voting on a magic number does not improve upon this limitation. The only acceptable solution in my eyes is an algorithmic one. To imagine a technical metric is best discovered by popular vote is wishful thinking at best.
4. I disagree with BU's design choice in regard of the vote. There are plenty of simpler and more efficient ways to achieve what BU sets out to do than to signal block size per node/miner in a gossip model.
5. I disapprove of BU's implementation of that design (EC), on the grounds that it does not achieve what BU set out to do. It is an awkward and convoluted piece of code that tries to hide behind its complexity and an unjustified amount of pointless parameters the fact that only miners effectively have any say over the block size.
6. I've had a few discussions with Peter R in the past and I strongly disagreed with his understanding of Bitcoin and his take on the project's development. I suspect I will disagree basically on anything he has to say today, seeing the path BU has taken.
7. I strongly disapprove of the announced BU miners attack on the Core chain in the event of a fork. I wish to forever dissociate with the people that suggested and support that infamy.
8. I have a distaste for the bickering over Bitcoin's name and Satoshi's legacy that people are engaging in. I care neither for the name nor for the posturing of legacy. I only care for the technology. To whom the rest is valuable, you can have it.
9. I don't particularly care for the incompetence of BU devs. There is too much BU is getting wrong for me to somehow concern myself with how the codebase is maintained. Even if it was top notch, I'd never run it.

* Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.
* Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.
* Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. Centralised backbones like this are inherently not permissionless, and can be censored.

Despite this, **Core developers have conceded all possible block size increase compromises.** The soft limit default was raised prematurely, and now even segwit is proposed with a block size increase to 2-3 MB. Further increases are beyond the control of developers and miners, and require consent from the entire community.

**No block size increase is needed now.** All legitimate uses of the blockchain currently amount to approximately 750k/block average. If inefficient and microtransaction usage is put aside, likely below 500k would be sufficient.

**No block size increase is likely to be needed in the near future.** Before we reach the point that 1 MB is insufficient, we are likely to have the Lightning protocol working in production. This improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.

Personally, **I expect that another block size increase will be necessary eventually.** But that's several years (decades perhaps) away, and hopefully the problems outlined in the first paragraph will resolve themselves by then.

At the end of the day, **the decision for hardforks is made by the community as a whole**, and no niche group (whether that be developers, miners, or anyone else) can force it on the network. Most of the community has rejected bigblocker hardfork proposals, and even a recent minimal increase proposal by myself (set 7 years into the future) saw significant opposition. **Polls show that at this time, no block size hardfork is acceptable.** Hopefully this will change in the future, at least when we begin to need it.

While [much R&amp;D has been done](https://bitcoinhardforkresearch.github.io/) (mostly by the Core team) toward such a future hardfork, **today, hardforks are not safe.** GIven a few years more on this research, it should be possible to make an *uncontroversial* hardfork equally as safe as a softfork. (Perhaps this will improve community acceptance of a hardfork.)

&gt;“The absence of counter parties in usage of virtual currencies including Bitcoins, **for illicit and illegal activities** in anonymous/pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws,” Minister of State for Finance, Arjun Ram Meghwal, said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.^1

First, sorry to see you go. If you honestly believe what you wrote here then no one can blame you for not sticking around. If you think that bitcoin's failure is a foregone conclusion (or at least close enough to a 100% probability event), then it is no one's place to make you stick around.

That said, your scenarios seem awfully detailed and drawn out for a system that is as complex as bitcoin, with many assumptions scattered here and there. I'm not saying you're not entitled to a few assumptions when trying to predict the future, but if you include too many, they add up exponentially until the probability of your forecast coming true drops down to pretty much negligible territory.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't think about the future, but maybe it's more useful to discuss the future in more general terms without making too many assumptions.

Since some people might be curious, as an example here is a list of questionable assumptions included in Scenario 1:

&gt;Core and their supporters will start to try and burn down the network.

How do you know? I have noticed a trickle of new faces here over the last week as the Core narrative has begun to unravel. For all we know, EC getting 75% of the hashrate might result in significant user attrition over at /r/bitcoin as people realize ""holy shit /r/btc was right."" Sure you might have a few hardcore holdouts, but I don't think there will necessarily be enough of them to precipitate the scenario you describe regarding the price. For every pissed of bitcoin baron in the Core camp, you will also have people with deep pockets who understand EC who will support the price with buying activity. In fact I personally hope that there is a dump of fresh bitcoin by core holdouts so that there is a final and definitive wealth transfer from bad actors to good actors.

&gt;After the fork happens the price could go down to literally any level.

Again, how do you know? Even in the worst case scenario of a holdout minority chain, in this scenario the EC miners have a supermajority and they can disrupt the competing chain, forcing a PoW change. Of course, a PoW change will mean that the minoity chain no longer has any of the massive hashing power of the majority bitcoin network, which also leaves them open to attack. At the same time. Neutral investors will absolutely punish the price of the minority chain if their security is poor, which it will be.

&gt;While this is happening, the Ethereum market cap is going to overtake bitcoin even if the Ethereum price does not increase (which it will).

Possible, but how can you be sure? There's no denying that Ethereum and all the other alts are looking a bit bubbly these days. How can you be sure that Ethereum will be within striking distance of bitcoin?     

Anyway, good luck with your future endeavors. I sincerely hope we see you here again some time in the future.

The nature of Bitcoin's binary bet is that the next stage of success involves at least an order of magnitude more investment than all that came before. Even if half the current investors dumped BTC after a fork to bigger blocks, there are 10x as many investors waiting to jump in. 

Besides, in fork trading most of those eager to dump will be keeping their small block BTC, allowing us big blockers to dump the small block BTC on them at a premium. We actually make *more* money in this process, by forking. So this is indeed just another case of someone calling Bitcoin dead because of not understanding.

Ethereum has its Gavin now, but is he going to be able to resist what happened to Bitcoin's Gavin? And if he does, it's even more hazardous. The move to full [Market Governance](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ) is always a rocky one, but Bitcoin is furthest along by far.

Most realistically, I just did my monthly googling to find out if the dark markets - one of the only places in crypto where real brass-tacks commerce happens - are complaining about high fees, backlogs, and switching to altcoins. Result? 

- very few complaints about high fees

- quite a few ""why no confirmation yet"" posts but universally answered with ""just bump the fee"" and then ""thanks guys, that solved it"" 

- negligible use of any altcoins by vendors or buyers - despite much-hyped incorporation of a few of them in by the markets

Clearly the network effect is much stronger than 50-cent or even dollar fees for these guys, and although the situation is getting very worrying it is exactly now that the miners are mobilizing. That makes it odd timing to leave. 

Your mention of all these devs tinkering in Ethereum makes me think you really haven't understood. Sound money is THE use case. It blows everything else out of the water, and it *already works.* The blocksize cap is the only thing standing in Bitcoin's way for the next couple orders of magnitude in adoption and price, and it is about to fall. Smart contracts and DAOs are neat but we shouldn't so easily forget that Bitcoin is a historic invention and just throwing random spaghetti at the wall a hundred times isn't going to automatically work to create another revolution. 

Devs gotta dev is what got Bitcoin into this mess; I don't think it's going to help Ethereum, especially with investors who approve of ledger edits and after seeing how incresibly much harder smart contracts were than they all thought, having been busted out of that utopian daze, they still doubled the price from where it was when ill-fated TheDAO drove it all the way up to $20+. 

Finally, and this is inflammatory but I have to mention it, when I spent some time on the Ethereum subreddits last summer I found the average level of intelligence and economic understanding to be far lower than in the Bitcoin subs, as well as a fetish for pie-in-the-sky schemes with little critical examination (I know I know, bitcoiners love their LN vapor mesh network fantasies, but I'm talking even worse than that). Not that there aren't very smart people in Ethereum, but the average is very worrying - these investors are not going to be strong hands. Don't say I didn't warn you.",2017-03-28 01:49:43

EEA announcement mid April is going to be huge.

Just watching that video of Andrew Keys from Consensys made me realise:

If you want an investment that makes people breath heavily from the sheer nature of what it is, 

Ethereum is for you.
If you want an investment where the people do nothing but talk about silverware? 

Stay with bitcoin

ENS going live, will be huge.

So much ETH will be tied up in .eth domains it will be crazy.

Raiden update, again, huge. 

Metropolis on the horizon with more updates, you guessed it. Yuuuuge.

But I really think the zing that will kick all of this off, just like what kicked us off from $15 to $55 was the first EEA conference. 

This next one is going to be a bigger announcement of some very large players in the tech space. 

The press conferences that will follow such as this one:
 http://www.hbscny.org/s/1738/cc/index2.aspx?sid=1738&amp;gid=4&amp;pgid=54757&amp;cid=116461&amp;ecid=116461&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=13&amp;calcid=78389 includes Mike Novogratz, founder of Fortress, a hedge fund with +$60bn in assets under management. 

This is just one person. Harvard is known to be on in the ins with many of the large hedge funds.

Ethereum truly is exciting technology, think back to when you first found out about it and began to discover the possibilities, the same thing is happening right now with some of the largest corporate titans in the world.

All the while, BTC is stagnating.

Fork or no fork, this a roadblock in their way putting a cap on the price going up until issues get resolved.

Oh and did I mention DAPPS?

To recap: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C79XrdPUwAAT1SM.jpg

Matchpool.co crowdsale this weekend, more to come. Firstblood, Gnosis, Augur, Digix release coming very soon. 

2017 will be the year of the dapps.

$100+ is EASILY within reach when you consider all of this. 

What I want to know is where we end up and settle at by the end of the year, keeping in mind all of the anticipation of 2018 with scaling on the roadmap.

All of this new money coming in is causing development to RAMP UP.

We are going to see some very good progress over the coming months..

I can completely understand where you're coming from. I've always dismissed other crypto currencies as a distraction, and always believed that Bitcoin will remain the leading crypto because it was never really in danger of losing this position. However, things have changed drastically, as there is real competition now. I firmly believe that Ethereum's market cap will surpass Bitcoin's cap this year - which won't mean that 1 ETH will be worth more than 1 BTC because there are simply more ETH in circulation, but I think we will get to that point in time as well.

Bitcoin's do or die period is nearing its end, companies and whales are making the switch bit by bit. I also believe that there will be no resolution to this scaling debate, ever. Both parties will hold their position, neither SW nor BU are going to be activated, and Bitcoin will slowly fade into obscurity. Bitcoin's technical development aside, I would also like to add toxicity to the list of things that slowly drive me away from Bitcoin. I'm tired of putting up with a Nazi-esque regime that controls the most popular information hubs and censors any opinion they do not appreciate. All of these smear campaigns, FUD, censorship, trolling and banning of people speaking up against Blockstream's narrative is just too annoying. I believe a lot of people are now actively embracing any alternative that might be a worthy successor to Bitcoin due to those reasons.

&gt;* I agree Bitcoin needs scaled.
* I do not agree that Bitcoin needs scaled this very moment. I would have been happy with a version of SegWit that also halved the block size limit to compensate for the increased capacity. IMO, a whole lot still needs done before scaling is desirable and technically sound. The increased capacity of SegWit is a compromise I am willing to make, seeing that the fee discount on witness transactions realigns incentives in favor of utxo consolidation (helps keep the UTXO set in check)
* I disagree with BU's primary principle that the block size should be decided by user and miner vote. I disagree with the block size hardcap on the grounds that it is a magic number. Voting on a magic number does not improve upon this limitation. The only acceptable solution in my eyes is an algorithmic one. To imagine a technical metric is best discovered by popular vote is wishful thinking at best.
* I disagree with BU's design choice in regard of the vote. There are plenty of simpler and more efficient ways to achieve what BU sets out to do than to signal block size per node/miner in a gossip model.
* I disapprove of BU's implementation of that design (EC), on the grounds that it does not achieve what BU set out to do. It is an awkward and convoluted piece of code that tries to hide behind its complexity and an unjustified amount of pointless parameters the fact that only miners effectively have any say over the block size.
* I've had a few discussions with Peter R in the past and I strongly disagreed with his understanding of Bitcoin and his take on the project's development. I suspect I will disagree basically anything he has to say today, seeing the path BU has taken.
* I strongly disapprove of the announced BU miners attack on the Core chain in the event of a fork. I wish to forever dissociate with the people that suggested and support that infamy.
* I have a distaste for the bickering over Bitcoin's name and Satoshi's legacy that people are engaging in. I care neither for the name nor for the posturing of legacy. I only care for the technology. To whom the rest is valuable, you can have it.
* I don't particularly care for the incompetence of BU devs. There is too much BU is getting wrong for me to somehow concern myself with how the codebase is maintained. Even if it was top notch, I'd never run it.",2017-03-28 00:40:56

dfjjbpg,skyroket,765,"A VPN service is something that encrypts all your traffic and routes it through an anonymous company, then out to the internet.

If someone were to spy on your internet traffic at the ISP level, all they would see is loads of data that they can't understand, going to and from this anonymous company.

You can have entire network VPNs which will route traffic for all your devices automatically without even doing anything different on the device itself.  You can have device-specific VPN connections that might be an icon you click on your smart phone, or something in the system tray on your laptop; that will only protect the traffic to/from your one device.

The whole-network VPN connections are typically more expensive, and often require additional hardware on your network.  The single device VPN connections are much more economical, but you have to micro-manage it and babysit it.

---------------------

If you *really* want to hide, and do questionable shit, go through a VPN, then use ""Tor Browser"" which is like what they use in hacker movies where the FBI can't trace their call because it's going through France and Russia and shit.

dfk0vt9,tortailga,184,"# DO NOT USE A VPN WITH TOR. USE ONE OR THE OTHER BUT NOT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.  
  
This is an extremely common misconception. Per the [TOR FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#IsTorLikeAVPN):  
  
&gt;  **Do not use a VPN as an anonymity solution.** If you're looking for a trusted entry into the Tor network, or if you want to obscure the fact that you're using Tor, setting up a private server as a bridge works quite well.

&gt; VPNs encrypt the traffic between the user and the VPN provider, and they can act as a proxy between a user and an online destination. However, VPNs have a single point of failure: the VPN provider. A technically proficient attacker or a number of employees could retrieve the full identity information associated with a VPN user. It is also possible to use coercion or other means to convince a VPN provider to reveal their users' identities. Identities can be discovered by following a money trail (using Bitcoin does not solve this problem because Bitcoin is not anonymous), or by persuading the VPN provider to hand over logs. Even if a VPN provider says they don't keep logs, users have to take their word for it---and trust that the VPN provider won't buckle to outside pressures that might want them to start keeping logs.   
  
VPNs do encrypt your data and hide it from your ISP, but it puts all your traffic with the VPN provider. Not to mention any VPN worth it's salt is going to charge money, which makes it even easier to identify you. If you do anything that arouses suspicion, now all your traffic and information is all available in one place.  
  
**Why wouldn't VPNs be a good idea? 2 layers of security is better than one, right?**  
  
Using a VPN before TOR means that you now have a dedicated entry and exit point prior to entering TOR. If you ever get compromised in TOR, LEAs now know you're using a VPN and they can freely subpoena the VPN for your traffic. Now they have ALL your data, not just the data from one session. Although having a VPN in another country might complicate things for an LEA, they'll still get the data, all that does is give you more time. Even if it's the best VPN company in the world, the LEA can simply force them to start to track you and forbid them from warning you. They've done it before and will certainly do it again. (more on this below)  
  
However, if you stick to tails + tor, the LEA may eventually compromise you but will likely only be able to show whatever shady thing you were doing in that one session, as you have no trace of it in tor, and no trace of it on your machine. The only other place is whatever you accessed while on tor, but that's not relevant for this discussion. You are much better off just sticking with regular tor with tails.  
    
**But I want to hide the fact that I'm using TOR from my ISP!!!**  
  
VPNs do not do this. Yes your data is encrypted, but it's easy to tell from the metadata (packet sizes, etc) because TOR uses three layers of encryption. So even though your data is encrypted with a VPN, the ISP can still reverse engineer that you're using TOR. If you need to hide the fact that you're using TOR, a TOR bridge is your best bet. But unless you're in a autocratic state where using TOR gets you thrown in jail, this isn't necessary. Also, it's not illegal to use TOR. The more people use TOR, the less ISPs gain by knowing people are using TOR.   
  
**But the VPN website says it doesn't log!**  
  
This is just blatantly false. Logs are necessary for anything to function. Otherwise, how would they investigate if something goes wrong? When a VPN provider claims not to log, that just means they don't log more than necessary. There's still plenty to de-anonymize you. TOR, however, is truly anonymous.  
  
**But they said they'll never give away my data**  
  
Would you go to jail for a random stranger you've never met? If any law enforcement agency comes to the VPN provider asking for your data, you better believe they're going to hand it over. That's EXACTLY what happened to the hacker group [Lulzsec when they used a VPN](http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/VPN-provider-helped-track-down-alleged-LulzSec-member-1349666.html).  
  
**Well what about PIA? They got subpoenaed and told the government they couldn't provide any data!**  
  
[Context](https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-providers-no-logging-claims-tested-in-fbi-case-160312/). Firstly, they did give away some information. It's just that with shared IPs, the amount of information they gave was limited. Secondly, the FBI had already identified who the user was, so they had no real reason to pursue the VPN service aggressively as they already had enough evidence. Lastly, and most importantly: **The FBI can order a VPN service to start logging and tracking users, but not warn the users they're doing so.** This is called a gag order, where the FBI suspects someone using a VPN is doing something illegal. This is exactly what happened to [lavabit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email). Although that guy has (so far) managed to stay out of jail, he was legally harassed by the FBI and narrowly escaped. There's no guarantee another VPN company is going to want to go through all that. Your best policy is to assume your VPN is already compromised and to not do anything you don't want the government finding out about on your VPN. 
  
**But the VPN is not in my country! So I'm legally safe!**  
  
Yup, that's why FIFA was safe from that US investigation. Law enforcement (especially American law enforcement) have a large array of options from legal power, to financial power, to political power when it comes to putting pressure on VPN companies to give up data. No way your hacktivist VPN company is going to be able to stand up to that. No matter how much they promise you on their website.  Don't get me wrong, going with another country is still a good idea, but it's not going to stop law enforcement. You're just buying yourself time.  

**Well then I guess I'll cancel my VPN service**  
  
No, not necessarily. VPNs still have their usage in that they encrypt your data, they let you pretend to be from another country to get around geo location limitations and they make it harder for you to be compromised by hackers. They also hide your data from your ISP. (However the ISP can still reverse engineer things from the metadata). The important thing to understand is that although VPNs and TOR use similar technologies (such as encryption) their purpose is fundamentally different. VPNs make you more secure, but less anonymous. TOR makes you more anonymous, but less secure.  
  
#TL;DR: Use a VPN for your normal day to day stuff where you don't care if the government finds out about it. Use Tails + TOR (with the possible addition of a TOR bridge) if you're doing anything you don't want the government to know about. Using both at the same time makes no sense at all.

&gt; The soft limit default was raised prematurely

The soft limit `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_SIZE` is [still set to 750k in Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.14/src/policy/policy.h#L18). While it's been raised in the past (from 250k and 500k), the [most recent attempt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6231) to change from 750k up to 1mb were blocked by the likes of Luke. In the end, it didn't matter though, it just taught miners not to rely on Core's default settings (today it's very rare to see a miner that doesn't mine blocks larger than 750k).

&gt; [Lightning Network] improves efficiency of blockchain usage by magnitudes, possibly reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k.

This is completely unfounded. Lightning will still require onchain transactions in order to open and close channels, which means that with 10k in block usage, there would only be 4 channels being opened or closed per minute globally. There is simply no way that 10k of blocksize will be enough to match even the modest amount of transaction capacity that bitcoin is currently serving.

&gt;  Most of the community has rejected bigblocker hardfork proposals, and even a recent minimal increase proposal by myself (set 7 years into the future) saw significant opposition.

Another doozy. Luke's proposal actually *reduced* the block size before eventually raising it - *of course* the community rejected this shit. But of course, Luke uses this rejection of his insanity as some sort of twisted justification for his insanity.

&gt; Polls show that at this time, no block size hardfork is acceptable.

Luke's polls (which he set up and administered) actually showed that a majority favored a hardfork within the next year. Of course, Luke twists the definition of ""acceptable"" to require unanimous approval.

dfjww2g,DisReddits,35,"We're at the correction phase from the multi-year run up to 1336.4. Both sides of the scaling debate blaming each other for the price drop, however the reality is - the correction was caused by an overbought market fueled by ETF FOMO, especially after ETF was denied and delusion of moonkids shattered. Though FUD revolving around scaling debate was likely to increase the depth of initial drop, so one cannot ignore shaky fundamentals.

Another notable issue is market dominance, which dropped far more rapidly and lower then I expected, furthermore it is closing in on the ""point of no return"", which, IMO, is ~60%; however in the coming months I expect Bitcoin to regain some of that dominance to about 75-80%, as the userbase &amp; recognition of alts is massively below that of Bitcoin and doesn't justify the valuation, even though the tech, in some cases, is debatably superior, though there are some caveats in all of major competitors. The damage is done and Bitcoin won't return to &gt;90% dominance for years, if ever. My only regret is not holding to some of these coins for longer, even though I've been a fan since their inception and increased my net worth by a lot with them over the years.

*Warning! Controversial paragraph incoming.*
So if Bitcoin doesn't step up its game, especially regarding on-chain scaling, I'm certain it'll go the way of MySpace - still there, but for years barely holding on its lifeline (aka the road to irrelevance). Personally I've lost any remaining confidence &amp; trust in Core developers due to their latest actions (suggesting UASF and POW change, and Peter Todd's *invitation* to attack BU, thus indirectly attacking the whole network) and some of the absurdly ignorant statements of LukeJr, regarding blocksize and the allowed/true use cases of bitcoin, so I doubt we'll see any substantial improvement from that side of the table (though sometimes people can change for the better). Hopefully other teams will step up with both ideas and code quality.

**Current status:** Market looks like it's about to drop further, however an inverse head and shoulders is forming. Sitting in a miniscule long since the latest drop to ~1010, which is pretty much a gamble trade. So either this pattern plays out and we could see 1200$, or we could see a crossover on the 3d MA, which would be an extremely bearish scenario (I'm talking about either low-500's or mid-600's in a few weeks/months before any other prediction can be made).

Now you are on the front page of Reddit... I surely am your target demographic. 

Question: How do you feel about regressive taxes that are meant to promote health, wellness, the environment, etc.? In Philly (I live near Philly) we just implemented a per oz soda tax on all sugary drinks. The problem is this includes anything with a sugar substitute (sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, etc) and there are many food deserts in Philadelphia. It is great for public health.The tax is used to fund public schools, but the burden of the tax falls mostly on poor people who doesn't have access to grocery stores. There is also some controversy on the soda companies saying they have to lay people off but that is all BS in my opinion- propaganda to get it repealed. I don't really give a shit about them. They make so much damn money. 

There are other examples such as the recent gas tax increase in my state of NJ. Again it is good for the environment, but really only hurts poor people. Money goes to a highway fund. I constantly find myself torn when forming an opinion on these specific types of taxes and would appreciate your input. 

I appreciate sin regressive taxes as long as the money goes to a good cause and have a way of addressing the ""sin""- alcohol taxes should go to prevention and treatment (as well as marijuana). That's great- but where do we draw the line in what a sin is? Fossil fuels? Soda? Plastic bags? Where is the line where we switch to a progressive alterative?

dfn05a0,Michiel83,37,"Bitcoin is a network of 'trust', and the fact that it isn't easy to changes the rules increases the trust enormously. I totally agree with this tweet. Because it is not easy to change the basics of Bitcoin, the market will be forced to come up with other solutions like second layers and efficiency increases. These 'harder' solutions will also bring other positive side effects and will expand the use cases. BU might be a short term solution, but will harm the trustworthy reputation of BTC and slow down innovation (because the pressure to solve problems will decrease). Please people take the slow, secure and innovative way to build this till now very successful Bitcoin network! ",2017-03-31 13:57:00
dfma7ck,Blindweb,34,"This has become the worst way to make extra money.  It was once one of the best.  It's very similar to bitcoin mining in that regard.  Unless you dedicate massive amounts of time learning a good system you're going to make like $5/hr.  There's millions of people like yourself who wanted to make extra money and they drove the pay rates way down, oversupply of labor.  

$50/day is $18,250 per year.  That's enough for a person to live a lower middle class lifestyle in most of the country.  The people making that kind of money built their setups or learned their techniques back when in the pay was like triple what it is now.  The pay justified their time investment back then.

dflzl85,gr8ful4,27,"no matter how often you repeat this bullshit - it's not true.

Bitcoin was designed that way. It was always meant to represent the majority of hashes because that is the most difficult thing to fake. Miners are the ones with the most skin in the game; which means they act accordingly in the interest of the economic majority or otherwise fork themselves off the network.

IMO acting in the interest of the EM means enabling bigger blocks (highest priority) to not lose more market share to alts. And enabling second layer tech immediatly after that (high priority) in order to bring Bitcoin to the masses.",2017-03-31 01:31:46

We're still in consolidation from $1300 to $900 as alts are chaining their bubbles together. The baton has now been passed to LTC due to it's exploration of segwit. I would love to see LTC come into its own as the testing grounds for bitcoin, it's good for Litecoin holders and bitcoin development alike.

Does Jihan really not understand that solving malleability is an absolute must for Bitcoin to move forward? Can't he really not grasp that if malleability is not fixed lots of us developers are stuck and can not deliver better applications? This blockade of the malleability fix is costing developers and companies a lot of money.
