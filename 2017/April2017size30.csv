Edit - humor aside I think that this post highlights a simple common premise that a lot of people have a hard time admitting. I am constantly engaged with people here who think that they know and understand Bitcoin despite the fact that they have spent very little time at all trying to understand the complexity of the system. There are people that sub here that have been here for years you don't even know the acronyms let alone the complexed nuances of how the different parts of the system interact with each other to make Bitcoin function. 

It's okay to not know Bitcoin because really I think no one knows ""all"" of Bitcoin other than maybe a few people who have reviewed just about every line of code. And it's good to admit that you don't know Bitcoin. I don't know all of Bitcoin. I don't even know remotely all of Bitcoin and you will never hear me claim to be an expert. But after spending almost 4 years daily studying the web of interconnected mechanisms I have a rough idea of how the system functions even if a lot of the underlying technical debt and trade-offs I don't understand.

Make /r/Bitcoin great again by going back to the way it was before when I think most of us acknowledge that we don't understand Bitcoin. It makes for a much more humble setting where we can all get along better.",2017-04-01 14:36:17

I don't see the other large ASIC manufacturers like Bitfury selling miners to the public. Bitmain releases ASIC batches to the public all the time when they very well could just keep it all to themselves to make a higher profit.

In the end however, both parties joined together and made a flag to mirror the first, and New Zealand took the mirrored one.
It really is quite beautiful.*

**PSA** If you have a revision please send the imgur link in the reply, like for something Idk what it is, so its easier for me to reference, also send one wholesome reply to tell me what to update, its hard to manage message chains with so many replies

**PSA** I will credit people later on their responses, when this is all over and I have more time

&gt;Talking about ethereum to a strong Bitcoin hodler is like talking about Bitcoin to a Banker in Mid 2013. They don‘t know anything.

dforuut,mmeijeri,40,"SegWit looks like a true compromise if you take its opponents' stated goals at face value. But they appear to be dishonest about their goals, the real goal being to neuter Bitcoin by adding a governance layer and massive on-chain scaling. The insistence on a hard fork is intended to set a precedent for subsequent hard forks. All this will come to naught if SegWit activates, so in reality SegWit is a surrender for its opponents, not a compromise.

Similarly, a hard fork is a surrender for those who want Bitcoin to remain an impartial and immutable ledger that is beyond the control of political processes.

The big difference of course is that the pro-SegWit side has honourable goals and is completely open about them, while the anti-SegWit side lies about its dishonourable motives.

The question should be when and how a &gt;1mb fork will activate. Nobody (or very few) wants bitcoin to be stuck on 1mb capacity forever.

Does it take a year to be done safely? then set the activation date a year from now. Does it need 2 years? alright, let's agree to have it activate 2 years from now.

Get started on the hardfork wishlist, don't deny every single hf proposal.

People want bigger blocks, not just segwit, so let's get through the obstacles to eventually make it happen.",2017-04-01 21:30:39
dfot5a7,SergioDemianLerner,33,"I respond yo each of your statements: 

1. segwit2mb gives companies one year to  review, implement, test, re-network validate the hard fork. Yet it can be tested in much less time.

2. I took one year for 91% of the companies to upgrade to 0.12+ when there was an operational pressure to do so (dynamic fees). So the industry is ok with one year in advance.

3. The cost of validating a 2-4Mb block (including segwit) in the current state of Bitcoin Core (which has been greatly optimized for this) was discussed several times (including in ScalingBitcoin) and the results shown to me and the community by core devs were all positive.

4. It does NOT delay segwit. segwit is activated as soon as 95% of the treshold is reached. IT can be locked-in in one month. The proposal uses a second nVersion versionbit to signal both activations (segwit+2mb), but the activation times are different. No upgrade has to take place now.

You say ""How about a compromise: activate the existing compromise.""
Don't tell that to me. Tell that to the people who do not want that compromise. I'll be 100% ok with segwit if 95% of the community also approved it.

As of the amount of work required to deploy Segwit2mb, take into account that several core-developers reviewed the patch in about 30 minutes. It's 120 lines in length. I has 220+ lines of test cases. The patch can also be easily ported back to 0.13.1., so upgrading is even easier.

dfosc0c,adam3us,30,"Right I think that is one of the confusions of new comers to the trade-off and design space: there is probably no path forward to be had if the rationale for delaying segwit so far, is not understood.

What reason would anyone concerned have to believe that those delaying may not in 12months time find new excuses to delay compromise v2 also.  Or they may just enable segwit after 6mo and flush that work, once their reason for delay has passed (eg if it is delay in manufacture of a big ASIC investment, perhaps, and the delivery is made 3months late).

My money is on the reason being a mining economic tussle about time to market of ASICs, in a consolidating and maturing market, with real-politic and business confidential information we are not party to.

In that context, it would make far more sense to talk frankly with the people involved to understand what they actually want and see if they can mediate between the mining cartel members to not hurt bitcoin users and bitcoin confidence and find a path forward via compromise or co-investment, stock-swap or something among the mining manufacturing and pools.  Of course less mining centralisation would be far better, but changing proof of work is too drastic and messy of a path, and simpler paths forward exist for the ecosystem and community to move forward, for example UASF is less bad than a 12mo delay with no understanding of real-politic rationale.

NB probably most of the proponents including Roger, of the various ""hard-fork"" proposals are themselves pawns and also not understanding the real-politic.  Well compounded by that some also do not seem to understand that user validation is necessary for Bitcoin to be secure - the pivot to datacenter IOU mindset, it'll be alright because economics, and if we break it maybe the tech community can repair it.",2017-04-01 19:43:46

If I had never touched my initial ETH from ICO I would have ~$1mm right now, instead I have $15k. LOL. Painful lesson learnt, but I'm young so I know for next time.

I've gone from $3.5k at ICO to nothing ($0K, I have some post history which shows I was suicidal at the time, it really does get better after the initial sting btw), then to $500k (margin trading and putting my whole salary into ETH when I could between sept 2015-Dec 2015) to $17k to $350k to $50k to $210k and now I'm down to $15k. I'm done gambling, I haven't checked the prices of anything for a long time. My complusion is gone, especially now that things are critical.


I've put the rest of my money in Digix and will hodl till boom or bust.

The team are professional and results orientated. They don't care about getting their token on the best exchange ASAP, that's stupid and short sighted to think it's important during the early stages/ technical development.

I've lost the majority of my life savings twice. First time was when ETH came out onto polo and I margin traded it all away in July-Aug 2015, second time recently fucking about during these bubbles. I know now (and I should've known earlier) that trading is stupid, investing is smart.

I don't want to get my money back now, because I know where that leads. I would rather invest my $15k into something I believe in and wait until the company shows signs of major weakness/incompetancy, or  major success.

I believed in Ethereum mainly for the team, and because everyone looked genuine and a bit nerdy, also the idea obviously. I've put my money in Digix because I see the same thing in them, albeit they are perceived differently but hold the same characteristics I know to be dear.

It's true Digix isn't purely a protocol, but when it comes to stablecoins and goods linked to the real world, the way Digix is going about connecting real world assets to Ethereum is the smartest way. Gold and metals are not going anywhere, they are needed in the real world.

Bitcoin is great, it's a store of value yadda yadda yadda, but humans needs clothing food shelter medicine. Metals are a part of the process of getting shelter and communicating with the real world, they will always have value unless our machine overlords take over humanity and suck us into the matrix...which at the end of the day is also run by metal and electricity.

Good luck all, I'm taking a break, and for the first time in 1.3 years, I need to get a job again. I have no career prospects, but I'm learning 'computers' and will work myself up to learning Solidity. Knowledge is power, being aware of my gambling addiction is power.

So here it goes, from not even knowing how my computer actually works, or how a website exists, or what HTML or javascript is, I have started my journey. 

See you on the other side, remember, it's only money, fortune and misfortune land on all of us. Appreciate what you have. Appreciate your health, the people you love. Even appreciate your struggles as they always teach you something.

My teacher was Greed. It taught me a valuable lesson early in life, and going forward I will be generous in all aspects of life. I've started by donating $1k of my $15k to various charities, because I could die tomorrow.

I could die tomorrow or today, who knows, so live a life you believe is noble. 

It's been a pleasure trolling, but I bid thee farewell ethtrader. Whether I succeed or fail does not matter, as long as I tried.

dfrmvtl,starslab,27,"In a nutshell, per my understanding:

Right now the consensus rules have a well defined format. Let's call it ""Bitcoin 1.0"".  Bitcoin 1.0 does not have SegWit, and is fixed at a max 1mb blocksize.

Let's call SegWit ""Bitcoin 1.1"". It's mostly backwards compatible with Bitcoin 1.0, but fixes some protocol bugs and enables 2nd-layer networks to be built on top of Bitcoin. It also makes some future protocol improvements easier/possible, and is a one-time blocksize increase done in a backwards-compatible way.

As Bitcoin is a decentralized system, here's how Bitcoin 1.1 is supposed to activate:
In any one of the 2016-block targetting periods, ending November 15th, 2017, 95% or more of mined blocks must signal that the miners are ready for SegWit. If that doesn't happen, SegWit activation dies and Core gets to go back to the drawing board.  Once SegWit signalling meets the criteria, there's a 2016-block ""pause"" where SegWit activation is pending, but voting no longer matters. After that point, the network will accept SegWit transactions and miners are expected to accept them into blocks. Bitcoin 1.1 is now ""live"".

Unfortunately, we have a hostile mining cartel which has decided to use the ""SegWit Readiness"" indicator as a ""SegWit Willingness"" indicator instead.  The entire rest of the ecosystem is ready to go, including years of development time by 3rd parties.

All BIP148 does, quite literally, is refuse to accept blocks that do not signal SegWit-ready after August 1st, 2017, until SegWit activates. That's it. That's all it does.  In so doing, it forces the existing activation mechanism to deploy SegWit.

dfqvd4z,forgoodnessshakes,23,"To answer this question you have to ask another question - what is behind core's obstinate refusal to even consider increasing the block size limit? To the extent of reneging on the HK agreement and arguing that SegWit is the promised block size increase (rather than an increase in capacity) and threatening their former allies the miners with a suicidal change away from Proof of Work.

I think the answer is that any increase would demonstrate that further on-chain scaling is eminently possible. This would be good for price, but would pull the rug out from under all but the most important second tier projects in the short- to medium-term and all the commercial ones.

The argument has moved on. It's no longer about a step increase in throughput, it's about whether self-interested hash power will force through a system that optimises blocks or whether we should have a Federal Bitcoin Reserve dictating block sizes. It's possible that 2MB blocks would only buy us a few months.

It's the will of the developers versus the will of actual users and businesses (most SegWit supporters don't seem to use bitcoin for transactions).

The hubris that made core assume it could get 95% support for SegWit has clouded their regard for their market. They have squandered their goodwill with everyone.

I have spoken in the past about 'opportunity cost' - profit that could have been made but wasn't. This is a difficult concept to prove, but it is becoming evident every day another company chooses to leave bitcoin for pastures new.

I think a lot of BU supporters would support SegWit but the small-blockers have one thing correct - any block size increase that was successful would be the thin end of the wedge. And we don't want to go through all this begging and pleading every year.",2017-04-03 08:02:34

dfs7jgz,Kanibe,177,"Bilan personel : 

Pour être honnête, je trouve que c'était du bon travail. Oui ça pourrait être beaucoup mieux, mais sans ignorer le contexte difficile, on s'en ai mieux sorti que d'autres.

En gros 

1. On a fait plusieurs tricolores un peu partout sur le canvas.  
2. Celui le plus éloigné du coin bleu s'étend le mieux.  
3. Malheureusement, nous étions sur la même latitude que les allemands, un coup de r/all blitzing sur nous nous la mets assez mal.  
4. Heureusement, on arrive à s’éjecter vers le nord, et à passer un traité avec les cœurs pour faire un background tricolore ET des cœurs tricolores.  
5. Un embarquement est organisé pour récupérer notre lot de terre, r/Europe résout le conflit instantanément, avec une pincée de rainbowroad.  
6. La menace d'une autre invasion, (le void) nourrit les projets d'expansion vers le plein sud, tout en continuant au nord.  
7. L'expansion vers le sud n'est pas annoncée, et Megaman + Bitcoin paniquent et contre-attaquent, des conflits s'en suivent, notamment avec r/europe et r/all qui entament un projet européen avec l'Italie et L'Espagne sans demander l'opinion des deux territoires français et allemand en place. Une rejection réalisée avec succès. 
8. Au sud, la tour Eiffel sur la frontière avec Bitcoin est le summum du conflit avec Bitcoin, il m'a fallu aboutir à un traité pour qu'ils fassent un nouveau logo (qu'ils avaient déjà prévu) 3 pixels un peu plus loin sur la gauche. Nous avions aussi un traité avec placestart pour une bonne intégration de la tour sur l'en-être de la fenêtre Gogh (ils ont éventuellement supprimé le nom original - starry.bmp).  
9. Au nord, le projet de baguette selon le schema en diagonale de u/loulan aboutit avec grand succès. Le projet de vin de même. Malheureusement, les italiens nous ont fait gaspillé beaucoup de pixels, il aurait plus judicieux de ne pas ajouter de drapeau sur la bouteille, et si besoin est, de ne réparer le drapeau, qu'une fois toutes les 1 ou 2 heures. Des pixels ont été gaspillé sur le vin+croissant à notre gauche, là où le drapeau espagnol prévoyait de s’implanter.  
10. JVC arrive. Ils prennent unilatéralement la décision de supprimer tout les arts qui ont été acceptés et protégés par le discord. C'était un vrai coup de pute, si je puis dire, mais faute est de constater que nous avions ainsi plus de place pour un projet de la Liberté guidant le Peuple - dit ""Marianne"".  
11. Par la suite, un vandalisme des traités en place avec les placehearts se met en place par nos mêmes camarades. Sous le même air qu'avec les bitcoin, moi-même et quelque camarades ont dû négocier, et apaiser leur fureur, sans quoi ils étendraient du rose sur l'espace tricolore. Un nouveau traité a été mis en place, avec la conservation de 4 lignes de cœurs, et la prise en charge des couleurs (notant que les pays étrangers se servaient sur les cœurs, engendrant un chaos indésiré de leur part). La colorisation avait été décidée sur une tricolore, cependant, les régionalistes ont férocement défendu leurs couleurs.  
12. Du coup, une nouvelle période de paix s'est installée, malgré quelque chamailleries pour du croissant et un bout de baguette avec l'Espagne et la surprise d'un nouveau drapeau des Iles Féroé sur notre sud. Et des projets se sont mis en place. Dans la dernière nuit, les r/saints ont quémandé leur logo, qui par la suite a été supprimé par les lève-tôt sous prétexte de royalisme. Nous avons ainsi décidé d'une collaboration avec l'Espagne, impliquant le déplacement de la baguette. Et un immense projet de Napoléon ou Astérix s'est mis en place, malheureusement avorté par le bong final.


Au final, nous avons eu beaucoup de souci, rien de massivement dangereux comme le void, le manque d'organisation, de leadership ou d'entente commune était sensible à gérer, mais le resultat final, bien que moins propre que les allemands, mérite un moment de fierté.

J'éclaircie nos relations avec les factions ici 

* r/Bitcoin : nous avions peu de contact à l'origine, et beaucoup d'entre nous étaient biaisé contre bitcoin car ""muh argent, cey mal d't'façon"". Les intentions étaient réactionnaires, mais peu agressives.  

* r/espana : leur installation à notre ouest nous a pris de court, ayant déjà un artwork nous appartenant, leur présence n'était pas bien vue à l'origine. Par la suite, c'était amour, merci à r/andora pour ça.

* r/ainbowroad - r/FinalFantasy : JVC a failli nous tué pour le coup, après l'élimination du Blackmage, heureusement, le projet Asterix n'a pas abouti, et ils ont pu refaire leur bonhomme, avec même un rainbow tricolore, et une cape à la française, ainsi qu'une jolie cocarde  

* r/megaman : Il était très très français, mais pas globalement accepté par leur mainteneurs, on a pu se contenter d'un slip

* r/placeheart : Les traités originaux ont été d'une part érodé par les pays étrangers, d'autre part par JVC, on a frôle une guerre totale, vu que beaucoup de promesse ont été cassées.

* r/eu et r/de : Après, le conflit initial, la situation était pour le moins neutre, personne ne tentait l'initiative, de peur d'une grosse contre-attaque.

* r/italia : ce sont des cons qui volent le travail d'autrui, on s'est jamais entendu nulle part

* r/iceland : un petit moment d'incompréhension, mais l’absence de réel support au sud a permis une implantation non-problématique des Iles féroé.

* JVC : le discord avait prévu d'offrir un :noel: pour leur contribution, et pour leur promesse de ne pas tout casser par la suite, r/france n'était pas au jus de ce contrat, ainsi, des soucis sont nés. C'est vraiment dommage.

* r/ireland : :love: :love: (dommage que la proposition du ballon de rugby n'a mené nulle part)

Bref, c'était un bon moment de r/france, on peut être fier, pas besoin de se comparer à r/de pour le coup. Nous sommes top 5 des drapeaux les plus rapidement visible, et nos arts sont pas dégeu du tout. Voilà, je retourne dans mon trou.",2017-04-04 04:36:07

&gt; There is no full validation for all nodes (possibly in relation to point 2?).

This is because some nodes perform a fast-sync procedure where they use block headers to determine the longest PoW-chain, download the state and authenticate the state against a header near the tip of the chain, and then validate from there. This allows them to skip validating the mass of historical transactions that no one cares about anymore. Tricking a fast-syncing node would require a 51% attack, and even then if you're really paranoid you can always check block explorers to make sure you're on the same chain as everyone else.

&gt; It is prone to centralized governance.

I'd argue in some ways that's true, though in other ways ethereum is _less_ prone to centralized governance than Bitcoin. For example we have multiple independent implementations of the ethereum protocol being built by independent teams working for independent companies that are being actively used as clients, so the developers of one client cannot easily seize control of the protocol in their own direction (or for that matter obstruct progress).",2017-04-04 14:58:04

dfsr5h2,theymos,55,"SegWit basically *is* an extension block softfork. That's how it increases capacity. Doing an extension block softfork that is somehow separate from SegWit (as implied by the table in the article, but not really by the proposal it links) makes zero sense.

I recently wrote a [long post on extension blocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zwci3/about_extension_blocks_increasing_the_max_block/). It's not a bad idea, but it has drawbacks. The draft proposal linked in this article is of the sidechain-like variety. The general idea is that your Bitcoin wallet would show two accounts which can be thought of as a ""savings"" account (Bitcoin as it exists now) and a ""checking"" account (which will be a reduced-decentralization=reduced-security sidechain-like thing). You can move between the two accounts for an on-chain fee on both. Sending from your checking account to someone else's checking account will be cheaper. If the extension chain dies or becomes horribly centralized, you may lose the BTC in your checking account, but your savings balance will be unaffected. This general idea is very reasonable, and one which I've been advocating for a long time, since it provides the best of both worlds. (You can do this two-account system in several different ways: extension blocks, proper sidechains, blinded bearer certificates, hub-and-spoke systems, etc.)

As with any sidechain-like extension block proposal, you have to ask: Why not add complete support for sidechains? This proposal is like doing just one special case of sidechains, when adding complete sidechain support wouldn't be a major additional leap. (But this isn't a major issue IMO.) This particular proposal also modifies SegWit in a way which is probably not going to be acceptable. (And there may be other issues -- I only briefly looked through it.) But the general idea isn't a bad one.

If the idea is for the extension blocks to be more than a few MB in size, then it'd probably be better to do something like [federated sidechains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4xy0fm/scaling_quickly/) or [blinded bearer certificates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ksu3o/blinded_bearer_certificates/) or even [my miner-controlled semi-joke scheme](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1568065.0) instead. Otherwise you're going to get the worst of all worlds: extension block verification is going to end up centralized to miners and maybe a few big players, but you won't get instant confirmations, increased anonymity, or super-high capacity in return for the centralization. (Due to latency and perhaps a desire to create fee pressure, miners probably aren't going to want to create blocks more than tens of MB in size. But federated sidechains or blinded bearer certificates could handle basically unlimited transaction volume without much trouble.)",2017-04-04 11:05:09

In STEM for example, in particular programming, there's virtually no barrier in front of ANYONE. You can pick up the shittiest cheapest laptop find free tutorials on the internet and learn and produce something. That's how many programmers learn and begin.

Some of the most important software that runs the world today was created by nerds typing during late nights in their mother's basement (Torvalds, Stallman, Gates, etc).

Communication, if there was any, would be on mailing lists and IRC behind usernames. No one can even see or care what kind of genitalia you have or how fluid your gender is you can call yourself ""precious_programmer_182"" no one knows who you are no one cares about it other than for your work.

It's the ultimate meritocracy. Another good example of this is the Bitcoin network. Created by an anonymous entity (Satoshi) may be a person may be a team who knows.

* Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency.

* In 1998, Szabo designed a mechanism for a decentralised digital currency he called ""bit gold"". Bit gold was never implemented but has been called ""a direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture.""

* A participant would dedicate computational power to solving cryptographic puzzles. In the bit gold network, solved puzzles would be sent to the Byzantine fault-tolerant public registry and assigned to the public key of the solver.

* Each solution would become part of the next challenge, creating a growing chain of new property. This aspect of the system provided a way for the network to verify and time-stamp new coins, the majority of the parties had to agree on the new solutions, or they couldn’t begin the next puzzle.

* When attempting to design transactions with a digital coin, you run into the ""double-spending problem."" Once data has been created, reproducing it is a simple matter of copying and pasting. Most digital currencies solve the problem by relinquishing some control to a central authority, which keeps track of each account’s balance.

* This was an unacceptable solution for Szabo. ""I was trying to mimic as closely as possible in cyberspace the security and trust characteristics of gold, and chief among those is that it doesn’t depend on a trusted central authority,"" he said.

dfs9j8x,jeanduluoz,42,"Bitcoin has always worked on this ""emergent consensus"" mechanism. The blocks have always been limited to 32MB since day one, as a side-effect of the data transfer protocol. 

Before the limit, miners made whatever sized blocks they wanted. Following the introduction of the temporary 1MB limit, miners weren't impacted at all. Why? Because there was no demand for blocks that large. They still made 0.01MB blocks when the 1MB limit was introduced. Miners have *always* followed an emergent consensus mechanism that is more frequently called a ""market."" 

Make blocks larger, and miners can increase their marginal revenue by adding more transactions with fees. However, adding transactions also has a cost - the additional time increases the orphan risk. And transaction fees are a very small part of miner revenue anyway. As a result, miners reach an equilibrium where blocks are optimally sized. 

Bitcoin has always worked this way. We know that markets *always* lead to better outcomes than technocratic edicts from unilateral governors. The idea of limiting the bitcoin economy with centrally-planned quotas and requiring ""consensus"" from approved bureaucrats is about as foreign and dangerous to bitcoin as anything i can think of.

dft57nm,ForkWarOfAttrition,41,"The fears in this post are **identical** to the fears people had about SegWit and the Lightning Network.  They were unfounded then and they are unfounded now.  You can't have it both ways.  Either SegWit and LN is unsafe for these *same reasons*, or extension blocks are as safe as SegWit.

Let's break down each argument:

&gt; Instead of the extra data being reasonable to ignore if you choose to not enforce the soft fork's rules, all of a sudden a majority (or at least significant chunk) of transactions on the network are happening in the data you've chosen to ignore.

This is the *same fear* people had about SegWit being called opt-in.  Users who did not run a SegWit full node would be unable to verify the majority of transactions.  (In order to reach that 1.7MB number, the majority would need to use SegWit.)

&gt; Instead of being able to reasonably walk back transaction history to identify risk based on potential censorship-enforced-transactions (ie transactions in a soft fork you're not aware of, potentially that only miners are enforcing), all transactions will look risky.

This is the *same fear* people had about the Lightning Network.  Bitcoin is and always was pseudonymous.  You were never able to walk back transaction history to assess risk.  Any off chain transaction that occurred during this history would have also been unaccessible for assessing risk.  All you could ever do was count confirmations and hope for the best.

&gt; Instead of being able to enforce fundamental network rules like the 21 million coin limit, you're left to trust that what is happening on the extension block (which all miners are largely forced to mine due to the fee revenue opportunity cost).

There's no way to increase the 21M cap with this since every coin sent from an extension block to the 1MB chain must have originated from the original 1MB chain.  A node not enforcing extension blocks will still enforce this.  The only power the miners have is to decide which UTXOs to use.  Off-chain Lightning Network transactions don't increase this limit either for the exact same reason.

&gt; Finally, this sets us up for some pretty terrible precedent. As we noted in a footnote of the original sidechains paper, the idea that miners will start soft-forking in sidechains is a massive risk - it allows individual large miners and individual economic users to force others to switch to new consensus rules, with potentially little consensus or review.

That's the nature of *all* soft-forks.  I have no say in what the hashrate majority decides to do, nor should I.  As long as the miners abide by the rules of my node, they can do whatever else they want and I am not forced to do anything.  The precedent that the miners can soft-fork was started long ago.  For all we know, the miners are already enforcing some soft-fork that we just have been chalking up to coincidence.",2017-04-04 18:50:40

dftffqc,pyalot,38,"The contradictions you mention are absolutely correct. But let's not forget that BS-Core also fails at the most elementary economics as well.

There is a demand and supply for blockspace. Blockspace needs to be produced, and it is consumed for various purposes (chief among them to implement a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account, i.e. money).

Everybody who wants blockspace (demand) for the purpose of consuming it wants to get the best (lowest) price for that blockspace. Everybody who supplies blockspace (by producing it), wants to get the best (highest) price for that blockspace. Producers of blockspace stand in competition with each other. This is a typical free market problem. Supply and demand. Price competition between producers. Maximum benefit delivered to all involved. Let's call it a blockspace market.

In Bitcoin the blockspace market is currently broken. It's broken because there exists an artificial limit (block-size limit) that makes for a situation where no amount of demand (and hence higher price, i.e. fees) can prompt supply of blockspace to increase. That's what's known as a market failure. Market failures are not good, they are inefficient. Where inefficient means that the demand side pays more than it should have to for the product, and the supply side has lower profits from the products they sell because increased prices can't compensate for decreased volume.

BS-Core likes to pretend as if the broken Bitcoin internal blockspace market doesn't matter, as if Bitcoin was the only source of blockspace. This would only be true if Bitcoin had some kind of monopoly barrier to providing blockspace. But bitcoin does not have that. Therefore the demand for blockspace that is not satisified with the blockspace market failure internal to Bitcoin, simply moves somewhere else (ethereum for instance).

That's what you get for ignoring even the most elementary and widely accepted economic theory that any kid intuitively understands. The result is the gradual obsolescence of Bitcoin to the trashheap of history.

dfta8zk,ulyos,36,"For the past year I have been actively tracking all the best sites to buy bitcoin on https://www.bestbitcoinexchange.io/ It's an interesting space as things move fast, sites come &amp; go, people get really passionate about which exchange they use. 

From what I've learned so far, here's what may suit you best: 

- **Kraken** tends to get excellent reports form customers in Europe and the USA. It mixes the best and lowest fees with easy deposits / SEPA withdraws. Liquidity is always high for large purchases. **Downside:** they go offline when the price booms. 

- **Bitsquare** - a fully decentralized peer to peer marketplace. Highly recommended and regarded by advanced bitcoiners. The client software actually offers more language choices than any other centralized exchange does right now. This is the best place to buy bitcoin if innovation, safety, and emerging trends are priorities for you. IMO these type of exchanges represent the path forward for digital currencies, especially so with the coming of lightning networks. **Downside:** volume is lower than centralized exchanges. The learning curve may be slightly steeper - relatively speaking.

- **Coinbase** is a love/hate story, especially on this sub. They have done much to advance adoption for new bitcoiners. The site UI is easy to use and offers credit card purchases along with multisig vault storage for advanced users. Works great in many countries including the USA, UK, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Canada. **Downside:** much criticism for accidental account freezes &amp; support can be slightly slow to respond. They also have little to no presence on reddit. 

- **Blockchain** is the largest &amp; most trusted web-wallet service and have recently allowed for buying bitcoin with a credit card. Remember - never store all your coins in an online wallet or on an exchange. **Downside:** purchasing BTC only available in EU countries, but more coming. 

- **Gemini** are gaining traction, especially for large buyers. Their system works through auctions and regular exchange trading. Very safe and well established. Founded by the Winklevoss twins. **Downside:** only available for North America

- **Localbitcoins** is a good site to buy bitcoin with cash and meet other bitcoiners in person. Bank transfers are the norm too. They're really popular in places/currency zones where most other exchanges don't or won't accept deposits. **Downside:** there are safer places to get BTC than through Localbitcoins. 

- **WeSellCrypto** is a lesser known exchange, but allows you to buy bitcoin with PayPal (you can also do this on Localbitcoins). This is great for just getting 15usd worth, but any more and it gets cumbersome. **Downside:** as with any PayPal to bitcoin site, fees are huge.  

- **Bitfinex** is the go-to site for day traders and large volume purcahses. They have recently made the headlines after refunding all customers following a hack last year. You could therefore argue that this is a very safe site to buy BTC. **Downside:** situated in Hong-Kong and only really worth using if you're looking to make revenue by day trading

- **Bitstamp:** based in the UK (the site uses euros), I really like this site and I often recommend to friends wanting to get bitcoins with a credit card that this is the best place. It's a very safe platform with plenty of good feedback from customers. **Downside:** ID verification can take some time

The argument is called “the block size debate”.

**The argument is not about the block size**.

What is being debated is the power over Bitcoin's future. How it can be changed and who decides those changes.

The hard fact is that hard forks keep power in the hands of the users and soft forks keep it in the hands of the software developers. And that worked great for Core. At least, it did, until those pesky miners stopped just doing what Core told them to do. So now miners are “attacking Bitcoin”. So it suddenly becomes Ok to [discuss a PoW change](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/843448818259709952). I invite you to play devils advocate and see how many of their tweets and actions make much more sense in the described scenario.


In short, this “debate” is about power. And this is not just any power, this is the power over money and how it could be created.

Anyone that **wants** that power is not to be trusted. The Classic / BU clients are advocating giving only purely economic power to the miners. The small blockers refuse to let go of this power. And they have been banning / censoring a lot of people for a very long time now.",2017-04-04 04:55:25

dftzc30,Savage_X,97,"I think the overall approach to architecture is something worth talking about.

Bitcoin's approach is not a bad one. A simple base layer protocol which is extremely secure, reliable, decentralized, etc. Then more complex networks can be built on top of them - payment channels, smart contracts, data storage, exchanges, etc.

Ethereum's approach is to build more complexity in the base layer protocol.

The problem for this approach for Bitcoin is that these second layer systems do not benefit much from the network effects of the base layer protocol. In fact, in some cases, the solutions include more ""friction"" for end users because the layered systems do not work all that well with eachother. These solutions could eventually be optimized, but this takes a significant amount of time and effort. 

If we look at some of the early use cases that people conceived for Bitcoin like asset tokens and look at the solutions built for that use case, we see things like colored coins in the base protocol, counterparty, Bitshares, and Omni. These projects were interesting, but had a lot of sticking points that prevented widespread asoption. Plus, since you had multiple competing solutions in the second layer, none of them could really establish a significant amount of networking effects and they each had to essentially start from scratch in their own separate silos. Ethereum came along and offered competition for those use cases and has been taking over the market ever since. 

Further more, since Ethereum is offering this functionality in the base protocol layer, it is building network effects that can then be extended even farther. All these asset tokens are cool, but honestly not all that interesting - we've seen crwodfunding going on for years now after all. However now people are starting to build things to work with these tokens - wallets, portfolio managers, exchanges, payment channels, and a bunch of other stuff that is just... wierd and hard to understand (like say Bancor or Maker). There is a lot of networked innovation going on here that would be completely impossible in Bitcoin's siloed second level layers. 

Ethereum is definitely able to deliver more of what the market ""wants"" in terms of this use case, and is delivering it much faster than Bitcoin is. The biggest risk will probably be whether it is secure enough - particularly as we extend it into new territory like PoS and Sharding. But I think that when you look at the security of second layer stuff on Bitcoin... it is severely lacking, mostly centralized and kludgy... its generally not as good as Ethereum and even though it makes claims to inherit Bitcoin's security, it really does not.


I share similar thoughts as the author in that I think there will be one blockchain that will come to dominate, but I think this will largely be based on use cases, and I allow for the possibility that the network effects that would drive one network to dominate will primarly only extend through one set of use cases. So we may end up with several very important blockchains that each dominate various types of use cases. Bitcoin currently dominates the ""storage of value"" use case while Ethereum is dominating the ""asset token"" use cases. As far as I am concerned, everything else is up for grabs - and there are a *lot* more blockchain use cases.",2017-04-05 05:44:01

If we were to have bitcoin's current market cap (~18.5 Billion currently) we'd be at $200 a pop for a single ETH. 100 billion is a relatively small number when we're talking about a global concept though. Remember this is a particular blockchain by Ethereum, as all block chains it's a public ledger but what makes us more integral and relatable/gives us more usage is smart contracts. This goes from Hospital records, to Real estate markets, even to the banking industry. Putting all the DAPPS and cool projects aside. Raiden, Metropolis, Casper/Serenity. Big events in Ethereum's growth are to be released this coming year. Raiden for one gives us the possibility of doing +1million transactions per second.

Despite location, country, religion, culture, language, etc. I mean think of the possibility of it replacing credit cards. How big an industry is that? A few trillion right.

It's changing as you see. And when every day people start investing, or better yet actually start using eth. That's where we will see the growth of $1,000+. But we still have to format, and build the program, the foundation, the usage of the blockchain, of eth in particular. We are the future, and as another person has said, black swans are coming. Remember why bitcoin and the blockchain were made. Decentralized, currency. Publicly regulated. And so much more. There's much potential in the blockchain technology and Ethereum.

We can use this to create the next generation of economic activity between humans, and organize on a local level much larger than ever before possible. We can find new ways to disempower banks, politicians, lawyers, police, judges and institutions.

&gt; Note the title of the Bitcoin 2013 conference which calls Bitcoin a ""payments innovation"". This is their way of slanting Bitcoin so it's not a challenging new currency, but a safe addition to help banks streamline. A way to paper over the cracks in our current financial system.

&gt; These people are dangerous because of the influence they wield over Bitcoin that can destroy it as a free and open system. Recently Gavin made a post calling to raise the blocksize limit which is connected to this vision of Bitcoin as a system for payments.

Other uses coming up such as gambling (etheroll, edgeless, etc), which bitcoin cannot compete in, and other dapps like golem and augur. Without smart contracts and a fast blockchain, bitcoin will fall behind faster and faster. Get in cheap while you can.

&gt;Are there ways to quantify the differences between Ethereum’s and Bitcoin’s security model?

Sure, one way is to ask the question: which blockchain is being held hostage by its own ""security providers""? Which blockchain's security is 90% centralized in China, where all the big mining pool owners know each other?

&gt;What are potential analogies with historical protocol wars?

Myspace vs Facebook

&gt;Future inflation rate unknown

2% for PoS, if you stake you're effectively making 2% to 6% per year.

&gt;Segwit can be activated via UASF, circumventing miners and allowing immediate activation of alpha status lightning payments.

UASF is a misnomer. UAHF is more accurate, and if UAHF is activated, the miners will attack the forked chain. Good luck recovering from that one, if you change PoW to something else bitcoin loses even more legitimacy (aka ""firing"" all the people who invested hundreds of millions in its infrastructure). 


And *even if* bitcoin core survives forking itself off and the chinese attacks, then the *same problem will occur a few years later*. Chinese will buy up gpus (lowest manufacturing costs in the world) and set up mining pools (some of the lowest electricity costs anywhere) leading to re-centralization of the security model, allowing them to make demands in the future. PoW is fatally flawed for this reason.

&gt;Rootstock could port Ethereum’s tech to Bitcoin.

Rootstock is shit and you have to trust people not to steal your money to use it.

dfu6ndx,UserOfMagic,39,"*sighs*

*sighs profoundly*

Ok.

See.

""Turing vulnerable"" makes absolutely zero sense, and seeing that being spread like truth makes me mad. 

There is nothing at all in a turing-complete scripting language that makes the blockchain more vulnerable in any imaginable aspect. Contract code is ran completely sandboxed. You won't have your Ether stolen because someone found a bug on Solidity or something like that. Buggy code can only affect a particular contract. If you're using a buggy contract, yes, you're in trouble. If you don't, then you have exact the same safety as Bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't has the ""buggy contract"" problem, yes... because it doesn't have a fucking contract system! Which is ridiculous! How a fucking global economy will work without contracts? Making centralized services on top of a pseudo-decentralized currency, like Bitcoin does with Satoshi Dice and whatnot? That, sighs, that makes no sense. Either you decentralize your services, or you go full centralized. There is no point in a centralized currency for centralized services. 

Anyway, back to the point: buggy contracts don't interact at all with Ether. If you don't use contracts, Ethereum is at least as safe as Bitcoin. If you do, just make sure you fully understand the contract's code. Simple contracts aren't hard to analyze. The DAO wasn't a simple contract, and trusting it so much money was a mistake and a valuable lesson.",2017-04-05 08:06:15

dfu1lmg,heliumcraft,38,"&gt; 3) Bitcoin has 100 core devs, ETH has ???

I actually looked into this with some depth. The main problem is that the scope of the projects are very different:

* For instance the concept of ""DApp developer"" and DApps doesn't really apply to Bitcoin. It feels like comparing apples and oranges. Yet Ethereum has undoubtedly a ton of developers. One certain Ethereum company alone reportedly has something like 200 to 300 developers. It's fair to assume 500 full time DApp developers at least, but this number might actually be thousands. 

* What counts as a ""core"" developer? If you look at most of the contributions in Bitcoin, they are documentation stuff, or UI changes or tests, etc.. Some known developers like peter todd has 4 commits in the last release, while others had hundreds. It's hard to judge the exact scope of contributions and the amount of changes. Geth has several releases a month, Bitcoin is around every 6 months or more. The EF it self has around 50 developers working in what is considered - in ethereum world - ""core"" stuff, that is not even counting other orgs like brainbot, all the stuff under consensys, ethcore, among others. (which incidentally, makes ethereum far from ""centralized"" as assumed in the article)

* What about infrastructure? Does working in metamask/mist/raiden/truebit/swarm/whisper count? Those matter a lot for Ethereum, but don't really apply to Bitcoin and it's hard to compare (the only exception is Raiden / Lightning perhaps). Ethereum has tons of projects for its platform. Bitcoin on the other hand essentially has 2: Lightning (Blockstream) and Rootstock (with 3-5 devs).",2017-04-05 06:24:46

dfuspvi,FitGirlLV,30,"TL;DR

* NFO says audio is untouched, yet not bit-perfect
* Some audio files in this repack are lossy
* NFO (and group) are lying


Well, since Reality decided to keep silence and not answering to my simple question, I had to download their repack and extract files.


As I thought, this repack IS lossy. Not ""Not MD5-perfect"" as stated in their NFO, it's actually LOSSY.


Here is the proof and ways you can check their repack vs original game files.


* GTA5 on PC uses two different audio compession techniques: one is lossless PCM and one is lossy ADPCM (saves 4 bits for a sample). Most of audio files are ADPCM, most of those also covered with encryption (my bet - for copyright reasons, but whatever).
* There is a public tool, called OpenIV, which supports extracting and modding of GTA5 files. Among it's capabilities is audio replacement, both PCM and ADPCM.
* The thing is, that by design ADPCM _is lossy_. When you convert any lossless or lossy audio to ADPCM, it loses even more data. ADPCM is a very-very old format, back from the 80s. It's good when used on lossless source, most people won't hear the difference. But if the source is already lossy, and, moreover, this source WAS already in ADPCM format...
* It's a pure mathematics. ADPCM leaves only 4 bits out of 16 bits of any source sample. When you repeat this operation a second time, you leave only 1 bit of 16 of original data. And that is exactly what happened in this repack.
* Here's the screenshot with visual comparision of original ADPCM-encoded file (roundabout.awc from RADIO_01_CLASS_ROCK.rpf file, all other radiostation files are also processed, I guess). http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/205640
* It shows that both files are different in terms of content (not-bit-perfectness doesn't matter here). And also it's visible, that re-encoded Reality audio have smaller peaks on some of frequences. Which is one of the problems of ADPCM re-encoding.
* Here's the archive with sample file I used for comparision: http://www85.zippyshare.com/v/UK2r46P9/file.html 

It contains two files: 
ROUNDABOUT_original.wav - direct export from original roundabout.awc (md5: 8e37538906816d528ec82dcbe7fde8b6)
ROUNDABOUT_real.wav - direct export from Reality's roundabout.awc (md5: 7551451748e929e8e20d416838530d5e)

* Here's how you can recreate the process Reality used and get the same 7551451748e929e8e20d416838530d5e md5 hash for re-encoded file.

* Download OpenIV: http://openiv.com/
* Start OpenIV
* Open x64\audio\sfx\RADIO_01_CLASS_ROCK.rpf from your original GTA5 installation
* Navigate to roundabout.awc inside that resource. Right mouse button -&gt; Export to Open Formats
* Switch OpenIV to Edit Mode by pressing F6
* In this mode select ""New\Import from OpenFormats"" in main menu
* Select roundabout.oac you've exported earlier and press OK
* Wait a little bit while OpenIV re-encoded audio
* Now RMB and select extract on that AWC, save the wav file with any name you like
* Now you can make bit-by-bit comparision with ROUNDABOUT_real.wav with command line: fc /b file1 file2

In conclusion.

Reality, you're a young team, you've yet to gain your experience. Please don't become another Corepack, who make lossy repacks and rips and never acknowledge that, lying through their teeth. If you fuck up - grab your balls, say ""We fucked up"" and fix it. In this case - label your repack with proper lossy information and edit NFO.

It's not a problem to make lossy repacks, it's a problem when you lie. 

You lied. 

Maybe it was an honest mistake and the repacker simply don't know how ADPCM works, I give you benefit of a doubt on that.

But never lie in the future. This particular repack in the beginning of your team career is already damaged your reputation after you've made pretty good fast version.

Don't ruin it.

dfvkj0h,hblask,271,"To start, you need to know what a blockchain is.   Basically, it is a ledger, a record of transactions.   Normally, this function is handled by a central authority, such as a bank.   You put money into the back, they write it down.   You spend it, they write that down.   If you try to spend it twice, they say no.

But central authorities provide a single point of failure, and require trust in that authority.   This is a weakness in many cases -- especially regarding regulatory uncertainty in many parts of the world.   But without a central authority, who will keep you from spending your money 5 times, or even know if you have any to begin with?

The answer is a mathematical and computing breakthrough called a blockchain.   The first successful one was called ""Bitcoin"".   Basically, it replaces the central authority with some complicated math and majority rules and some interesting economics, so that the ledger is public and its state is determined by computers.

There are many blockchains, Bitcoin is just the most famous.   Bitcoin is suitable as a transfer of value and not much more (and increasingly unsuitable for that). 

Ethereum took the ideas from the blockchain, and said, what if we attach a computer program to each  entry in the ledger?   So instead of ""address 123 has 400 coins"", it could have a program that says ""Address 123 has 400 coins, and they will be released 5 coins per week to Address 155 and 175 on alternate weeks."" 

This program is now a contract: offline, a couple people agreed to this payment schedule, you write it into code and are guaranteed payment over time because the Ethereum network enforces it.

That's just scratching the surface, though.   What if you could attach any program or file or contract between any two people, and it is enforced automatically by the network, and nobody could shut it off?

Want to gamble but your country doesn't like it?  Too bad, they can't stop it. The blockchain cannot be shut down by a central authority.   Do you live in a third world country where property rights don't mean much, but you want to get investors in your business?   Put your business on the blockchain and they can give you money securely.

There are thousands of ideas of what to do with Ethereum, but it is very young and it is likely that its most valuable uses aren't even conceived yet.

Those could be subject to forfeiture, depending on how far the court wants to go making the plaintiff whole. 

Maybe 100% of everything they've got is in Germany. Next step is to freeze the ways they move funds from the US to Germany - having payment processors (credit card companies, PayPal, etc) forbid transactions from US residents to Bossland GmbH. Lock down the international dollar flow.

But just being in Germany might not be a sufficient safeguard either. A [1954 Treaty between the US and Germany](https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%20273/volume-273-i-3943-english.pdf) has provisions that allow for legal contract enforcement and binding judgments in either host country to be enforced aboard so long as they're in line with public policy - i.e., a default judgment on copyright grounds in the US can't wildly violate German policy on the matter.

Assuming that no new news is in the immediate horizon for Ethereum, we could test much lower levels until profit takers finish selling off. In the immediate case, we will probably test $39.

It makes mining empty blocks appreciably more efficient than mining blocks with transactions (and explains why AntPool mines so many empty blocks, relative to other mining pools). In other words, it creates perverse mining incentives that hurt Bitcoin's transaction capacity (no matter how big blocks are able to be).

It is incompatible with many, many protocol improvements and upgrades. It therefore provides an incentive for miners taking advantage of this exploit to block or oppose such upgrades (which do include SegWit, but also include numerous other unrelated upgrades).

It is also patented, and on top of that, Bitmain does not appear to be allowing ASICs outside of their direct control to take advantage of this exploit (even if they originally manufactured them). This has a severe centralizing effect on mining.

This claim is not one that anyone should take likely its near impossible to reverse engineer any 16nm ASIC chip without a huge lab. In one of those chip there are billions of transistors 16nm in size. The microscope needed to even see they exist isn’t exactly bought at Walmart. Without having access to the code of the chip it would be futile

The person to make this claim....Gregory Maxwell....what did he suggest you do...run segwit...this is just more desperate sneaky tactics to try and get more adoption of segwit... 

&gt; So why do some miners have more empty blocks than others. The larger the miner the larger chance they have of finding a block in the first few moments after a flush. It has nothing to do with ASICboost its just miners looking after their machines

All the hostility towards Ant Pool / Jihan when actually he is just conducting his business efficiently...which helps secure the network...

&gt; ASICBoost has a potential to produce 30% lower cost of CoC but
1, Mining with free energy has the potential to reduce the CoC of coin by 95%. 2, Mining when its cold outside can also drop the CoC by 30%
3, Using a lower process node (7nm is next) can reduce it by 50%

There are numerous parameters that affect the cost of mining, each miner will have a different mix, but all are trying to optimize their operation and stay profitable.  People need to grow up and stop spreading baseless fear.

We didn't do this for 3 reasons;

1. Malleability is not in any urgent need to be fixed. Nobody needs this on chain in the next year or more.
2. The idea to call them a hard fork is confusing as that makes them look the same. They are not. Please call them ""protocol upgrades"" and so you can look at each individually. The block size increase upgrade doesn't require any wallets or SPV clients to upgrade, and as such is rather cheap to do and will likely be quite easy to roll out.  
on the other hand, a protocol upgrade with FlexTrans will require some thinking on roll out and it should likely be planned 18 months ahead of actual activation to allow wallets and SPV clients to support it and people to have upgraded to it.
3. Bitcoin is a pretty big project and doing things carefully and one step at a time is the best approach. Make the blocks bigger and after 3 months re-assess your priorities.

**Is keenly sitting on the 1MB limit not properly verifying transactions for personal gain?**

&gt; 2) it's NOT about being optimized or more efficient...that's the right of all miners

I don't see how. The essence of Bitcoin's mining is SHA256(SHA256(*stuff*)) &lt; value. With full freedom to select *stuff* by any miner. I can't see how anything can be called an *attack* here unless SHA256 itself is broken. That is *not* the case.

Or 3) not care because Bitcoin is working just fine, despite all the talk to the contrary.

I expected the denial, the unfortunate thing about covert boosting is that its very difficult to prove its actual except by what it blocks. The proposal I made was specifically constructed with it in mind.  If they aren't using the covert boost then they should vigorously support the proposal because it would prevent others from using it and gaining an advantage over them with it (while disrupting protocol improvements).

What I didn't expect was the sheer level of adhominen and personal attack, and the attacks against the Bitcoin project.

Step (5) is installing the generic display however if you've purchased another display then the manufacturers software should be installed here.

Steps (6)-(8) Installs the desktop and auto-booting to chrome in kiosk mode. at this point it is essentially an auto-booting PoS display

Steps (9) and (10) Allow for and install the bitcoin full node.

Steps (11)-(13) Are extras that give smoother running, auto-boot the node on power-on, increased security and a HOWTO of changing the displayed webpage.

Here is an image file on my google drive that skips out steps (1)-(8)

&gt; https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4DJvoZvN6ZLMVB6LWYyRWp6RW8.

If using that then start at step (9*). The image file does not depend on using a Pidrive (I think), in theory any USB drive will work. At step 9 when we migrate files it will be drive specific. Step 9 onward in the easy bit anyway.

*This image file doesn't have your wifi settings in it and will need either an Ethernet connection to ssh into it to change those (step 2), or when it boots to the screen and terminal use a keyboard attached to the pi and change those on the screen.

**step (1)**


connecting peripherals 

I used: USB drive (pidrive and it's included power cable), USB mouse and Ethernet

Get a Jessie-lite 2Gb image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

On a PC rename SD card to ""BOOT"" if necessary

SD card formatted using SDformatter

Raspbian lite image installed to SD card using Win32DiskImager. 

Add ""ssh"" file to Boot main directory to enable ssh.(Jessie-lite as default has ssh disabled. To enable it use notepad, save a blank document called ""ssh"" (with quotes) as file type 'all files' to the highest level of the sd card.


ssh into raspberry pi user""pi"" password ""Raspberry"" 192.168.1.x (raspberry pi IP can be found using IPscanner software or connecting it via HDMI, it will display it's IP on the HDMI output once loading is complete)

(2)
**Enabling Wifi**

	sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Go to the bottom of the file and add the following text:
	
	network={
    	ssid=""YOUR WIFI ROUTER NAME""
    	psk=""YOUR WIFI ROUTER PASSWORD""
	}

save and exit using

	ctrl+O
	then 'enter'
	ctrl+X

	sudo reboot 

remove Ethernet cable

(3) **expand the file system**

	sudo raspi-config

select ""expand filesystem""

select 'finish' system will reboot

check file system expanded by using command below (the -h flag means human readable, showing size in 'G' gigabytes, 'M' megabytes, etc)

	df -h


(4)
**Updates**

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade


(5)
**Install the screen**

credit for this section to http://www.spotpear.com/learn/EN/raspberry-pi/Raspberry-Pi-LCD/Drive-the-LCD.html see their page if more info needed.

	sudo wget http://www.spotpear.com/download/diver24-5/LCD-show-170309.tar.gz
	sudo tar xvf LCD-show-170309.tar.gz
	cd LCD-show/
	sudo ./LCD35-show

...takes some time (""LCD configure 0"" displayed for a while)

**rotate screen credit to http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/55934/3-5-kuman-touchscreen-rotation**

system will reboot, so re-ssh to pi and direct yourself back to LCD-show folder

	cd LCD-show/
	sudo ./LCD35-show 180

It's an operational challenge when they perform an act such as this, but we're taking action to re-institute outbound wire transfers as normal. It's precisely why we have expanded our legal department.

The decision to initiate legal action is because we cannot allow precedents in this industry where clearing houses can disrupt businesses that are by all metrics complying with the rules in place.

dfywd0q,MisterYouAreSoDumb,52,"First off, fuck Coinbase! Second, I apologize to everyone affected by this. It seems a customer of ours opened a ticket with Coinbase for a missing transaction, and mentioned our name. I guess they then not only closed his account, but went back and closed the accounts of anyone that sent to that wallet address. We've obviously ceased use of that wallet address now. They can only link wallet addresses if someone tells them who owns it.

Coinbase should only be used as a way to purchase BTC. You should never send BTC directly to vendors from your Coinbase account. They can and do frequently shut down accounts for things they don't like. They are just like Paypal in that regard. They like to blame it on FinCEN, but it's their overzealous terms of service that is the real issue. However, I suppose FinCEN is the ultimate cause for them to be overzealous in their caution. The laws are vaguely written, and they err on the extreme side of caution to protect themselves. It's a shitty situation all around.

I always suggest people use an intermediate wallet, like Electrum, to send directly to any vendor. Never use the same account for purchasing BTC and paying for things with BTC. This goes for any vendor, not just us. They close down accounts all the time for other industries they deem ""high risk."" 

For anyone looking for an alternative to Coinbase, Coingate is who I would suggest for the time being. They are not a US company, so they don't have to bow down to FinCEN.

The last Gonzalez fight I could find online was from 2015. But from the ones I've seen, I don't see how she can threaten Calvillo very much.

Even with the quick turnarounds since she started as a pro, Calvillo looks a little better each time out. I had her at either 90% or 95% against Amanda Cooper and that paid off huge. The way she's able to adjust positions while maintaining control is amazing. I hope they don't push her along too quickly, but I feel like there's girls in the top ten she could beat right now.

Cummins is an awful striker. He also gets hit a lot, gets hurt a lot, and gets knocked out a lot. But that can only be exploited if he can't land takedowns.

Blachowicz fared very well on his feet against Gustafsson, but it was shocking how easily Gus took him down and controlled from there. This seems to be a theme with Blachowicz.

- **Gregor Gillespie (75%) to defeat Andrew Holbrook.** ☔️☔️☔️

Holbrook looks like he really sucks, but he's not terrible. He's tricky and he's good at impressing judges with submission attempts when there's a stalemate on the ground.

Holbrook gets taken down very easily, but that vulnerability hasn't hurt him much. I think that changes with Gillespie, who is under the radar as one of the most decorated wrestlers in MMA. He wrestled at a Division I school, where he was named four times an All-American and one time a national champion in his weight class.

- **Katlyn Chookagian (80%) to defeat Irene Aldana.** 👻👻👻

Late money is arriving on Aldana, but she's the underdog for a reason against lifelong martial artist Katlyn Chookagian.

Aldana tore her way through everyone in Invicta until Tonya Evinger held her close and grinded her into corn muffin mix. With that string of nice performances, Aldana made her UFC debut as a significant favorite against the underwhelming Leslie Smith. Prior to the Aldana fight, Smith's stoppage of awful Jessamyn Duke was the single impressive performance in her 2-3 UFC tenure.

Smith proceeded to floor Aldana in the first and outworked her the rest of the way home; the final significant strike count was 169 to 108. Is it more likely that 34-year-old Leslie Smith finally put it all together after almost a decade training, or that Irene Aldana simply fattened her resume on subpar challengers?

A couple months later, Aldana's Lobo Gym teammate and sparring partner Alexa Grasso was a huge favorite over Felice Herrig. The strength of Grasso's game, like Aldana's, is supposed to be in her boxing. Yet, in a fight that was almost purely striking, Herrig cruised to a no-doubt victory.

Aldana and Grasso are Lobo's only notable fighters. If they're getting tuned up in their own wheelhouse by modest competition, I think it speaks to the gym being ill-equipped to take them any further.

Both Aldana and her opponent tonight, Chookagian, were born in 1988, and took their first fights in 2012. But whereas Aldana started learning the sport a year prior to stepping into the cage, Chookagian started karate before she started kindergarten. She took a Golden Gloves title in Pennsylvania at age 16. And while your state Golden Gloves tournament isn't exactly murderers' row, she was still a kid beating adults to win it.

Through two UFC fights, Chookagian has put up a defensive mark of 69% (Aldana is at 58%). She doesn't stand and trade, she moves laterally and snipes at you. She's elusive and frustrating and it wins her rounds. Her kicks, knees, elbows give her a more varied arsenal than what Aldana's shown.

Chookagian's biggest vulnerability is she still has a hell of a time getting off the ground, and she's also prone to being pushed up on the fence. But while we saw her manage through that against Lauren Murphy and Liz Carmouche, it's not likely Aldana throws anything of the sort in her direction.

- **Fight goes over 2.5 rounds (65%).** 🍆🍆🍆

Prop bet! Katlyn's style should allow her to dictate the pace, which should mean far less action than Aldana's last go. I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Katlyn put Aldana out late with a hard kick or knee, but it's more likely we see the cards.

- **Magomed Bibulatov (80%) to defeat Jenel Lausa.** 👻👻👻

Jenel Lausa showed fast hands and crisp boxing in his UFC debut last November, dismantling Chinese losing-record little guy Yao Zhikui. But Zhikui was just one those people they stash away for Asian shows, and was undoubtedly the weakest touch in the division. [His only UFC win was a controversial split decision,](http://mmadecisions.com/decision/6168/Yao-Zhikui-vs-Nolan-Ticman) so he's someone you *should* beat the mutton out of.

Bibulatov is not only a highly touted prospect, but is also an electrifying combination of Islamic first name / Russian last name. Very willing and athletic striker, and shows good ability to quickly backpedal out of range of his opponents' combinations. He has some effective sambo skill and the strength to make the most of it. He can't do the Khabib thing where he keeps you pinned to the floor, but they're effective in scoring points and giving his opponents something to worry about. Watched a bunch of his recent fights and I've never seen him in significant danger.

dg18pdg,Casteliero,44,"It really amazes me how clueless most of you guys are about the technology you have invested in. I would even be little disappointed with $250 end of the year if all goes well what is planned. Here’s few reasons:

First, supply and demand. This isn’t all happening this year, but still important. Here’s things that decrease supply: 1. PoS will lock a lot of ETH 2. More companies join Ethereum, more they will buy them to pay their future gas cost 3. ICOs. They will also lock huge bunch of ETH and amount of ICOs are increasing heavily in the future.

And things that will increase demand are of course: 1. Companies joining Ethereum and buying ETH for their future gas costs. 2. ICOs will increase heavily and people who wants to participate will need to buy more ETH.

So the most important thing for supply and demand will be enterprises, companies, governments, banks etc joining Ethereum. And right now there is what, 50 companies joined in EEA? If Ethereum became to be dominant blockchain platform, there will be tens of thousands, hundred of thousands, millions of companies using the platform and they would all need to buy ETH for their gas costs.

And where there is companies there are individuals investing as well. For people, trust is most important thing when investing money. I know quite a lot about this, because of my job. So when they see big companies joining on this new technology and investing in it big time, people will follow. This is why I’m excited about future announcement of EEA. We might go up heavily because of this. And it is completely new money for cryptospace, not just Bitcoin money.

And if you look backwards. Whole market cap for every crypto has gone up 5x in last two years. And we are just beginning. First big companies have just joined in, in last couple years. And when tools and platforms are ready, and we hit mainstream, till then it will be heavy rise yearly. How the new money will spread inside cryptospace is different thing, but platforms will definitely get the biggest share of it.

And the cryptospace market cap. We are under $30bn and Ethereum market cap is just $4bn. Those are drops on the ocean, monopoly money. Facebooks market cap is $400bn and that is just one website, we are building whole new internet for fucks sake. Cryptospace market cap will be trillions in few years, and as I said, platforms will get the biggest part of it for sure. It’s just a race of the dominant one for now and Ethereum looks god damn fine from my perspective.",2017-04-09 23:46:04

Regardless whether this idea has consensus, is conservative or has any design or data to back it up. This idea is getting rammed through regardless, and it is getting pushed through hard. 

Now there are people who believe that is the best plan forward. There are people believe this is good, regardless of the (temporary) bad consequence because Bitcoin being hard to change is good. There are people who simply follow authority and just parrot whatever is being said. And there are those who know this will end Bitcoin and promote this agenda because they are not invested.

So, almost everyone wants bigger blocks. A majority thinks you need to super-supermajority to change Bitcoin, and thinks hard-forks are a last resort and bad. A minority follows Core wherever they go. An even smaller minority beliefs in full-block economics, and that giving a finger (small blocksize increase) leads to infinite blocks.

2.) Bugs in BU? Here's two examples that *I* found just by some browsing of the code base that are illustrative of Core's code quality:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10172 and
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10106



If you are a C++ programmer worth anything, you can see that these are things that should have been fixed *a long time* ago.

If anything, you can deduce from this that *all* software has bugs, new software especially so (Xthin was the thing exploited twice in BU) and step back from SegWit. As that's lots of new code.

But comparing BTC to almost any other missed opportunity doesn't work. Sure, there are plenty of random investments that boom and quadruple in a year or whatever. If you were spending a lot of time online, bitcoin was slapping you in the face every day, and then went on to  have a 10,000x return in just a few years. Investing $100 would have changed almost anyone's life permanently. Even buying just $10 of bitcoin as a young person and selling nearish to a $1000 could meant retiring a decade earlier. $10 for a DECADE of not having to work.

dg4chor,MrSuperInteresting,29,"There are technical reaons why a hard fork is problematic and then there are political reasons.

Technical first :

* Any fork will be at a high majority hash rate (say 75% or more) and the minority chain (with 25% or less) will suffer from slower block times depending on how much remaining hash they have (4x slower if they have 25%). This will adjust automatically but this might take weeks.
* There are various solutions to the above (other than wait) but they all require changes which will result in a second hard fork. One example given by Core devs is to change the PoW calc.
* Nodes which haven't upgraded will be left on the minority chain and they will reject blocks which do not follow the same protocol (inc. if the PoW is changed).
* Addresses will initially be valid on both chains creating the possibility of a so called ""replay attack"". This can be easily avoided by moving BTC to new address you control after the split. 

Political :

* Core have alot of political face invested in their plan and roadmap which they stand to loose if there is a hard fork.
* There is a ""control"" issue over the source code and I believe Core would like to be the ""one true source"" for all new releases. Note that there might be ""100s of contributers"" only 3 or 4 people have the right permissions to commit changes to the main release.
* The BU version does not include Segwit which again is a politcal issue for Core since they have plenty planned which relies on this (not least Lightning - the micro payments magic bullet).
* There is a big debate over who controls future protocol changes. Mainly between miners and nodes resulting in the UASF idea. Note that a UASF still relies on miners ""coming around"" eventually and implementing the changes nodes are voting for.

So sorry for the big breakdown and I'm sure there are factors I've missed but from where I'm sitting this is why there is such a big fuss and so much politics and FUD kicking around. As a result there is the fear, often not even fear of a hard fork but fear of loosing control and fear of loosing face.

I also need to add that in the technical list all but the ""replay attack"" point is how bitcoin was designed from the whitepaper.  The miners are supposed to be selfish, they are supposed to pick the solution which benefits them most and they are supposed to want to bail from a minority fork (probably dropping them down to 5% hash). A minority fork is then supposed to die out since the blocks will take hours to process. 

A miner who is running the implementation which suits them is going to invest more money into better chips and bigger server centers. They are also likely to back whichever new changes benefit Bitcoin because this benefits them too and protects their investment. Security through selfish mining is a cornerstone of satoshi's vision and this is the first big test of that.",2017-04-11 23:44:59

You see it in online games, business relationships, many places where western cultures expect China to play fair.  I really think that any Chinese miner would simply not understand the fuss over AsicBoost.

Honestly, I myself don't get that wound up over it either.  I believe Bitcoin must stand strong against ANY advancement in mining, and never depend on a level playing field.  This won't be the last mining patent, or the last shortcut.  Mining should be anonymous and competitive.

dg37ww2,5tu,25,"Here are some thoughts in case it helps.  Generally well written even though I may disagree with your conclusion ;)


""The Bitcoin community hopes that because of the deflationary pressures, the value of Bitcoin will increase until the next halving event and keep mining profitable""
That's not actually accurate.  it's a positive feedback system, if the price of bitcoin drops or the supply reduces due to halving, or electricity goes up... it simply means it's not profitable for miners so some will drop out and turn off their hardware.  At this point mining gets easier and profitable again until the equilibrium is reached once more.  I.e. it's by design that mining is only barely profitable on average.



""A medium of exchange should have a constant intrinsic value and a stable purchasing power""

Are you seriously saying that the GBP is not a currency?  You know it dropped 10% in a day last year?  Pretty sure it's still considered a strong currency.


""Moreover, a big disadvantage of accepting Bitcoin payments is a minimum 10 minute waiting time until a conrmation is cleared.""

This is only if you want to wait for a confirmation.  In LN and multisig setups this wait is not necessary.  Equally a confirmation is the same as the 6 month confirmation time for credit cards, the difference is people wouldn't consider waiting 6 months for a confirmation hence trust the other party to a small degree unless it's a substantial purchase like a car in which case they may also ask for a contract to be signed or done with a 3rd party involved like a bank... the exact same thing is true for bitcoin.  The difference is with bitcoin we have an opportunity of removing even this 10 min wait confirming time too.


""Bitcoin serves as the best store of value for individuals who are lookingfor  an  unregulated  and  relatively  anonymous  store  of  wealth""

I'm afraid I have to totally disagree with this from my own experience and many of my technical friends.  Anyone who has put savings into Bitcoin has seen their store of value increase generally and I know a lot of people investing in bitcoin simply because it's got a vastly better track record than any other currency.
I believe it has been shown to be the best performing currency in the world 7 out of the 8 years into the experiment, that should speak volumes on why people do this for legitimate law abiding reasons.  The tricky part is investors can't get easy access to it or are scared by the unknowns and haven't researched it because they don't want to or don't have the time.


""dsicusse""  should be discussed I expect?


""Currently, the biggest weakness is the blocksize  limit  of  1MB. ""
This is not a weakness at all, it allows for decentralisation and is encouraging Layer2 protocols to be built now rather than when it's frantically trying to cope with a surge in demand.
Bitcoin is an experiment and a solid basis for future technology built on top of it so would strongly question the word 'weakness'.  Perhaps consider 'constraint' or at a push 'limit' is a more correct explaination.


Conclusion:

""The biggest obstacle preventing Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to other fiat currencies is its volatility.""

There are many fiats out there with worse volatility than bitcoin so not sure this argument holds up.
Equally you've shown that volatility is decreasing and additional financial tools such as margin trading further reduce volatility which directly contradicts this conclusion.


"" it will reach the volatility levels of fiat currencies approximately in 2019-2020""

I disagree about this volatility argument, but I do agree in the 2020 timeline mainly because the next halving will put bitcoin's inflation rate below most western countries.
At this point it becomes less of a speculative asset to appreciate and more a reasonable store of value that out performs a bank account.


The main 3 items preventing bitcoin replacing a fiat right now are
1) Inflation rate is above US/China/Most of Europe.
2) It is only viable for mass adoption when Layer2 technologies are available.  Currently it could only replace a settlement layer such as being part of a global reserve currency.
3) A fiat currency is a key part of a nation, this is not going to be relinquished.  Bitcoin is more likely to become a global reserve currency on it's current path than a direct competitor to a working fiat.

* Self-driving electric cars will be hot and new at that point. They'll be very expensive, and only driven by a very small portion of the population. But production will stop (due to energy and credit shortages). So existing owners will hold on to them as long as possible. Also, unemployment, unreachable bank accounts and high debt load prevents people from buying anything non-essential.

* Renewable power sources will be *valuable* but won't be *produced*. That generally just means rising prices, not rising sales.

* 3D printing: certainly has a place in the future. May become much more expensive than today, though. New plastic feed is based on oil (which will become much more expensive), and recycling isn't cheap either.

* Hydroponics and vat-grown food: Has no future at all. Both are incredibly energy intensive (Hydroponics requires 30 m² of solar PV to insolate one m² of plants) and depend on high tech which won't be produced any more. Cities that can't manage the logistics required to import food from farms will be deserted quickly. In cities that do, food prices will stay much higher than in rural areas. This may be a viable option for the middle and upper class.

* Bitcoin: Relies on uninterrupted power and internet. Most of the population will have neither. Cash is much simpler, and provides all the anonymity and fungibility. Now, for banks, Bitcoin is great. They'll have issues with their central server model because the network is becoming more expensive and less reliable. So they can build their transaction backbone on some crypto currency. I don't think they'll use Bitcoin; transaction costs are too high and too much mining power is located in China. Maybe even something with proof-of-stake. That banking network definitely won't be public.

* Automation: relies on high-tech machinery, which in turn requires credit and cheap energy to build. I actually expect the opposite: companies generally moving away from high-tech machinery. With parts suppliers going bankrupt and logistics becoming slow and expensive, robots are a liability rather than an asset. Yeah, there may be some robots working well into the 2040s, but they'll do jobs that require super-human precision. Most other jobs will be done by humans; much more versatile and replaceable.

* Climate change: doesn't move as fast as you think. First, the whole system has a lag of 40 years, which means we're currently experiencing the effects of the emissions from the late 1980s. Yeah, a fuel shortage (but much more importantly, an economic crisis) is a godsend for climate change. But we're only going to feel the effects of that in the early 2060s.

dg5nyin,Desegual,143,"You do realize that mining is still very much profitable? For ASIC-resistant implementations like Dagger-Hashimoto (see Ethereum) the only way to mine is GPU power and GPUs don't get cheaper. Which is what video editing PCs are good at. I have a small rig running in my home and while it does heat the room it's in (-&gt; pay less for actual heating costs...) it also makes me around 10 bucks a day profit with around 20$ of electricity. So no, at around 300$ per month is not much for hardware that was about 2500$. But if I wasn't paying for electricity (like OP) it would be closer to 1000$ per month. Go figure. Literally any form of mining will be profitable if you don't pay for electricity and don't care about the hardware being in use. There are less risky, more legal and much cheaper ways to get huge amounts of hashing power though than to use the university's computer lab.

Edit: For people who want to know more: Look for a profitability calculator like [this](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc) one and enter your setup. It will give you a very rough idea. I personally use a few Radeon RX480 which are ridiculously cheap for what they do. Each one makes me about a dollar a day in profit with my quite expensive ~0.20$/kWh. I got the CPUs, mainboards and other stuff like PCIe raisers to fit the cards, PSUs the racks etc. mostly for free. All in all it's about 2500-2700$ in hardware. I also have a 1080 Sea Hawk in my main PC which I sometimes use to mine. But that's more for fun than for profit - it makes me about 2$ per day. But it being quite expensive I don't want to have it run 24/7. You also will need either good doors or something for the fan noise. It takes some time to get back the initial investment but if you have some spare money and want to know stuff getting into a little bit of mining is a fun project.

Another option would be a dedicated bitcoin miner which you can also buy for 2000-3000$. It could or could not be more profitable - I haven't looked into them too much.

Yet another option to get hashing power would be to buy it from other people. As an example there is nicehash.com where you can buy and sell your hashing power.",2017-04-12 18:17:38

Yes, lets fire the most competent doctors scientists and engineers who engage in public peer review and instead rely upon the people who have been proven to be completely reckless and lack all credibility. That makes so much sense. /s

Thanks for making your position clear. I will be sure to spread this as far and as wide as possible so that users know that you are putting politics infront of progress.

&gt;it's just that the Core has wasted its time for three releases now putting out features that users have not requested and don't want, while ignoring the sole problem that is preventing us from using Bitcoin.

I cannot express how sad and frustrating it is to have a miner in this industry express such non-factual statements compounded by such excessive stupidity/ignorance.

Core has pushed out SegWit, which is a enormous upgrade to bitcoins capabilities both present and the ability to upgrade in the future. It allows for Lightning Network like layers to compete within a free market to redistribute resource costs to economically incentivized nodes, a problem that bitcoin *cannot fix* and will always remain a problem.

Your ignorance of demanding to burden the alturistic bitcoin node operators with resources that would surely cripple the network is ignorant at **best** and sounds more like malicious behavior to me, considering that you should know better being within the industry.

As I explain it here in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/645w7l/im_not_exactly_procore_im_antibullshit_and_core/dfzz7k9/) -

&gt;*research on the topic, such as the [bitfury whitepaper](http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/block-size-1.1.1.pdf) clearly shows substantially negative effects upon node count even with minimal upgrades to blocksize. The paper shows an immediate 40% reduction of node count and 50% over 6 months.*

&gt;*That becomes 80% when we go to 4mb.*

&gt;*The reason the numbers are so drastic is because it is RAM that is the bottleneck, not hard drive space, the former being expensive and the latter cheap.*

&gt;*Fortunately, SegWit realigns UTXO cost by understanding this hardware cost matrix, which should greatly help node count not diminish as much as indicated within this research paper.*

Substantial reduction of node count decreases bitcoins security directly by reducing decentralization and making censorship more probable. Ironically, SW fixes this by re-aligning UTXO costs, so it actually kills multiple birds with one stone. Yet we are still fighting its activation despite all of the major positive benefits it has towards not only the security of the network, but the *progress* of the networks capabilities.

Detractors complain about the state of being, all while blocking the upgrade that resolves that state of being.

Its simply madness.

Also need to add that quadratic hashing (cpu ddos attack vector), while fixed in SW, is not fixed for old-style transactions on legacy bitcoin addresses. So the reason SW increases the blocksize in the way it does is to allow for a blocksize upgrade without decreasing the security of the network by opening up quadratic hashing attack vectors. So if we were to do a SW + 2MB HF, then miners could construct a block that takes 12+ minutes to verify. This would ddos nodes off the network.

This is why anyone who advocates for hardforking to upgrade blocksize is either being purposefully ignorant to the point of recklessness, or is showing their ignorance by demonstrating that they do not understand the cause and effect of engineering changes to the system.

If you get what you want, then you'll have bitcoin lose almost half of its nodes overnight, miner centralization (as if that was not already a problem with Bitmain monopolizing the industry) and the censorship of bitcoin.

As [Nick Szabo has gone on the record saying](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html)

&gt;**In computer science there are fundamental security versus performance tradeoffs. Bitcoin's automated integrity comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage. Nobody has discovered any way to greatly increase the computational scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain, for example its transaction throughput, and demonstrated that this improvement does not compromise Bitcoin’s security.**

I know you want transaction fee's to be cheaper. So why dont you support the pending upgrade that allows for **near free transactions of unlimited capacity with 0-confirmations**. It blows my mind that someone could be so stupid as to not see how incredibly valuable a upgrade that is for bitcoin.

It blows my mind that people cannot get past their reckless ideologies and political positions to see whats best for bitcoin.

It blows my mind that miners, such as /u/ProHashing can see the positive $ effect that even just the **anticipation** of SegWit activation on LTC, and **still** reject the premise, knowing in full effect what positive price action that catalyst would have upon LTC and BTC.

Its quite obvious that these miners are no longer working in the best interests of the system, and we must fire these miners from acting against the best interests of the system. We expected miners to operate based on doing what is within *their own* best economic interests, but its clear that miners like ProHashing either have hidden anti-competitive agenda (like asicboost) or are working against their own economic interests (which is hard to swallow).

If you do not activate segwit, all you will do is force a showdown with a user activated softfork. You **will lose** against the industry. Your coins will be worthless and you will mine yourself into bankruptcy, and good fucking riddance to poisonous rats like you and Jihan who are putting politics ahead of progress.

Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, both old bitcoiners and long term advocates who together have probably done more for the ecosystem through all the years than anyone else - are apparently the evil people trying to destroy and take bitcoin over?? WTF .. their wealth and future fortune depends on bitcoin surviving, how can anyone think they want to destroy it.. and they are the bad guys..

And then AXA, one of the pinnacles of what Bitcoin stands against, with EVERY reason to want to destroy bitcoin literally funds a company named 'blockstream' to .. block ...the..stream .. these people are somehow the champions of Bitcoin.. wtf happened?

Is there some cognitive dissonance with some people that if you make it too fucking obvious then they just glaze over and go with whatever the highest $$$ tells them to do.. brainwashing by the Almighty USD ..

dg7ksw1,s1ckpig,29,"The fact is that even without SegWit LTC as already 4x the throughput of BTC, block interval is ~2.5 minm rather than ~10min.

The real problem for LTC is that actually its block space (i.e. onchain txn demand) is almost 0. Just have a look at this:

It is then understandable Charlie's willingness and ""urge"" to help OB1 guys to get LTC integrated, that will mean getting some real value to LTC blockchain. 

Needless to say that having a bigger block for bitcoin in place would have avoid the existence of all these chances for the other cryptos to catch-up. Unfortunately this is not the case and even more worrying the inertia, or network effect if you will, backing Bitcoin is inexorably fading. Not saying we are getting to the point-of-no-return but I fear we are nearer that most would admit.

dg6o4ef,Connortbh,27,"A few years ago, a Spice Girl and an NFL star were accepting bitcoin to sell their wares. Comedian Drew Carey tweeted about trying to buy breakfast with it, and Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen testified about bitcoin in front of Congress.

Now, the virtual currency still feels more virtual than real.

More than eight years after it started, bitcoin isn’t living up to early hype as the payment system of the future. It has failed to emerge as a mainstream payment method among consumers. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied two applications last month for bitcoin-related funds, nixing an avenue for widespread investor adoption that could have boosted bitcoin’s relevance and profile.

And while an array of technologists are trying to adopt bitcoin’s open-ledger “blockchain” tracking system, it is mostly to transact in items besides bitcoin.

“It doesn’t feel like it’s going in the right direction,” said Brian Hoffman, chief executive of OB1, which runs an online marketplace called OpenBazaar that accepts bitcoin.

Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by an anonymous creator calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto, is a digital currency that operates through a computer network. It is designed to allow for users to transact with each other directly, bypassing governments and banks that act as middlemen in financial transactions.

To a certain extent, bitcoin has found an audience. It has a core group of dedicated backers who believe in its future, and it has attracted traders who like the challenge of an asset that never stops trading. It has also found a home among people who want to move money without being detected.

These groups have pushed the price up by more than 100% over the past year, currently trading at about $1,215, and the currency’s network is handling more transactions on a daily basis than ever, roughly 250,000 a day, up from 164,000 a year ago, according to data from the news site Coindesk.

[Bitcoin Shuffle](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AP676_BITCOI_9U_20170411111206.jpg)


Still, bitcoin faces an existential question—what exactly is it for? Some of the early adopters pushed for it to be a viable alternative to government-backed currencies such as dollars, yen or euros. Others see a digital version of gold or a payment system to rival Visa Inc. or MasterCard Inc. Proponents envisioned bitcoin as a way for poorer countries and citizens to bypass banks.

So far, it hasn’t fulfilled any of those goals.

Another fan base has been largely driven offline. More than 90% of global bitcoin trading last year took place in China. That has changed dramatically since the Chinese government earlier this year forced local bitcoin exchanges to add transaction fees—trading on these platforms before that was free—and adhere to anti-money-laundering regulations. The move has pushed more trading to Japan and the U.S., with China’s share falling to 13%, according to research site CryptoCompare.
Meanwhile, a battle among bitcoin’s insiders has erupted over its future. One side wants to keep it small and outside the purview of governments. The other side wants bitcoin to go mainstream, and is willing to accept more transparency and government oversight to make it happen.

Bitcoin hasn’t caught on with U.S. consumers. That is in part because bitcoin’s followers are diffuse and never really had a champion committed to persuading both businesses and individuals of its merits.

At Cheap Air, an online travel agency, bitcoin purchases comprise less than 10% of overall purchases, roughly flat in recent months, said Chief Executive Jeff Klee. “If you step back and look at the big picture,” he said, “it certainly hasn’t taken off.”

Mr. Klee was personally involved in the decision to accept bitcoin in 2013—after a customer suggested it—and praises its utility and advantages for merchants, but said it hasn’t yet been able to find a large audience outside loyal core backers. The typical customer staying away from bitcoin “loves their points and their miles,” he said, referring to credit-card perks. “That alone is tough to compete with.”

At satellite-TV company Dish Network Corp. , which began accepting bitcoin in 2014, bitcoin represents less than 1% of its total payments, the company said. “We have not seen growing enthusiasm,” Dish Chief Marketing Officer Jay Roth said.

As an investment, bitcoin has drawbacks as well. Even though its volatility is down compared with its eight-year history, it is still far too volatile, and opaque, for many mainstream investors. In March, the SEC rejected two proposed exchange-traded funds, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and SolidX Bitcoin Trust, citing the lack of transparency around trading on bitcoin exchanges, many of which are overseas.

The SEC said that without the ability to monitor trading activity, it couldn't approve an investment product aimed at retail investors.

Other government regulators are also taking a harder line. The Internal Revenue Service recently ordered bitcoin-services company Coinbase to turn over all records of its customers between 2013 and 2015, a sweeping summons the government said was intended to root out potential tax evaders. The company is fighting the order.

Competitors aren’t standing still. In February, a consortium of banks and tech giants including Microsoft Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. announced a new financial platform based on Ethereum, a bitcoin competitor.

If bitcoin was a company, its growth would be managed by executives and shareholders. It isn’t a company, though, it’s an open-source software project, and one without any recognized leader. That makes controlling its growth especially difficult, said OB1’s Mr. Hoffman.

“You see the evolution from when it was so small, it was easy for everybody to be on the same page,” he said. “Now there are so many competing projects, it’s so huge, it’s a mess.”

This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin’s largest discussion forums, along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core’s current roadmap. After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core’s tactics.

If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.**

1) Horrible grammar and spelling


2) unwillingness or disinterest in meeting you in person (even though they are trusting you with a large amount of money)


3) the fact that they want you to use your personal bank account as a passthrough handle their company funds. No legitimate company ever does this, certainly not with a stranger on the internet.


The money transfer will either be faked (most likely) or it will be reversed/cancelled. Once you withdraw the money from your account and pass it on to the scammers, you will be hit with NSF charges and be stuck repaying the full $2000 - $3000 to your bank. You'll never hear from the scammers again.

I opened an unleveraged long at 44.30 that I closed at $47.50 for some quick profits. If the 6h candle closes above the $47 level then I will re-enter with about 1/2 of my initial position. If bitcoin breaks below $1200 then I will likely triple my initial buy in amount for Eth with a target of ~$55 &amp; possibly higher depending on how things look around that time.

Litecoin is also looking pretty solid so long as it holds above $10. This one is my favorites right now, mainly because of the higher % moves given its lower value per coin. Segwit is a step forward for the crypto space as a whole and if Litecoin can pull it off then I will be even more bullish for the future of crypto in regards to scaling

Bitcoin, as noted above, is looking weak, and I'm waiting for a dip. Long term I'm still insanely bullish on bitcoin though. Love it or hate it, none of us would be here now if it weren't for Satoshi and his creation. Lets not lose sight of the fact that bitcoin was created to help humanity in the fight against financial tyranny, and so far it has not failed us on that front yet. 

IMO there's more than enough room for us all here in they crypto zone. We should strive to work together, because after all we all share a common end goal.

The existence of the Bitcoin Foundation was 100% to prevent the situation where a company like Blockstream comes in and buys a bunch of developers, and creates a conflict of interest.  I'm pretty frustrated that the Foundation got shit on for trying to be a central authority, and Blockstream, a for profit VC funded company, was able to waltz in and take their place unopposed.

dg7xbk8,dooglus,109,"&gt; Bitcoin.com is of the opinion that the current ""Bitcoin Core + Blockstream"" Bitcoin development team

What is this nonsense? ""Bitcoin Core + Blockstream""? Some of the Core developers are funded by Blockstream, and many are funded by other companies. Some aren't funded at all.

&gt; is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with Satoshi's original white paper

Core proposed Segregated Witness, which is the most promising improvement I'm aware of. It fixes many of the existing problems with the protocol, is a stop-gap effective blocksize increase, and paves the way for enormous scaling in the future.

&gt; and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin’s most pressing problems.

The efforts you are referring to are dangerous hard forks which make an already bad centralized mining problem much much worse.

&gt; Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call ""a settlement layer"", defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.

This is nonsense. Core's plan is to keep the base layer as secure and decentralized as possible while allowing safe trustless almost-free offchain transactions to be layered on top of it. ""Scaling"" by simply making the blocks bigger whenever they get full isn't really scaling at all. Scaling implies increasing the throughput without correspondingly increasing the resource requirements. Making the blocks ever bigger isn't safe. Using off-chain solutions is clearly the better solution to the scaling problem.

&gt; This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin's largest discussion forums

The development team doesn't have any control over discussion forums. The people who do have control for the most part don't want to see your dangerous anti-Bitcoin propaganda, and so disallow it from their forums. I don't have a problem with that. Go spread your lies elsewhere.

&gt; along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core's current roadmap.

How do you ""ban"" a developer? Mike Hearn quit of his own free will. Gavin lost his commit privs after a year or so of inactivity but is still allowed to contribute to the project.

&gt; After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core's tactics.

Positive change is constantly coming from the Core project. Just check the release notes of any recent release. Huge amounts of work are ongoing, with real tangible improvements in every release. If it wasn't for big miner blocking of SegWit we would already have a much more functional Bitcoin.

&gt; The following article cites a thorough history with specific examples of the rampant censorship on the ""r/bitcoin"" sub-reddit

Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. Nobody denies that. Call it censorship if you like. I call it moderation.

&gt; As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
&gt; By unsubscribing to /r/bitcoin, and subscribing to sub-reddit \r\btc you take a stand against censorship.

\r\btc is a cesspoll of lies and hate. I lose several IQ posts each time I visit. No thanks.

&gt; By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, or Bcoin, you are casting a vote against the current development team.

BU is poorly developed and has already been found to have multiple critical bugs in its official releases.

&gt; There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin.

They perform better than Bitcoin because they are mostly unused. If they ever gain widespread use they will face the same scaling problems that Bitcoin is currently facing.

&gt; The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.

So stop blocking progress. Get out of the way of the experts who understand the system.

dga23u4,papabitcoin,54,"&gt; and why the hell are people posting meaningful ideas to Reddit?!? (Alan Silbert)

Let me attempt to answer this gem :

So some of us thought bitcoin was peer-to peer cash. Freeing individuals from having to rely on (aka get ripped off by) intermediaries such as banks.

And some of us though that we could control our own money and not store it with third parties who pay us nothing and charge us for access and, even worse, take stupid risks with our money.

And some of us thought bitcoin would allow us to preserve our wealth because unlike money supply controlled by government or institutions it would not be endlessly printed everytime there was a crisis (such crises that are usually precipitated by the reckless actions of businesses and government).

So we, individuals, saw bitcoin as something for individuals to regain some sovereignty over our financial destiny.  We saw a revolutionary and better way to operate our lives and undertake transactions - in a transactional timeframe that was not beholden to when banks feel like sending our money, to any point on the globe, whether or not our bank has an affiliate at that location, for a cost approaching the actual cost of conducting a transaction - not at a cost that helps some intermediary purchase their beach houses and sports cars.

Bitcoin was not meant to be yet another avenue for governments to exercise their distorted, dysfunctional, business-captured policies and nor was it designed to allow third party business intermediaries to interpose themselves on it and seek to control or influence it or to profit from it without actually providing meaningful services at a cost equivalent to the service provided - ie not creaming off windfall profits by manipulating bitcoin into relying on their services and then holding users hostage to their services.

That is why I think more attention should be paid to real people on forums like reddit (at least the uncensored parts).  We, the ""ignorant"" masses, are the users of bitcoin, the holders of bitcoin, without us what purpose and value does a private blockchain have?  How would it ever have initiated and gained value and use in the first place?  

Why should some person who runs some kind of bitcoin-related company have an opinion that matters more than our opinion as grass roots users and holders.  Just because someone operates a business and calls them selves a CTO, CEO, Entrepreneur or Whatever-Fancy-Title makes them feel important - it does not actually make them important - and, the desire to centralize importance and authority in such business leaders is antithetical to the aims of bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electrronic cash system and as a system of one cpu one vote.  

Because Alan Silbert runs some kind of company to do with bitcoin I do not accept his opinion is more important than mine - sure, one can profit from bitcoin without properly understanding it.  After such brief time all I see is that there is an attempt to establish a class system in the bitcoin ecosystem - where once again the views of business owners are given more importance than mere individuals and where a select group of devs seek to impose themselves as the high priests of bitcoin.  What other explanation can there be for (experience suggests) a vacuous idiot like Silbert and others feeling entitled to pontificate on twitter and denigrate all people on reddit and particularly r/btc?",2017-04-15 10:07:47

Months and months talking about the technical aspects and the impact it may have on the original philosophical idea that has built Bitcoin and its community.

Lately, an alternative has come around to SegWit, according to my understanding. Something they call a ""user activated soft fork"", or BIP 148 if I'm not mistaken. Once again, this alternative is bringing lots of new talking about the technical aspects, ideals and philosophy. 

But this doesn't matter here. What matters is that the reference to Ethereum has been increasing for months now. 6 months ago I could read their discussions for weeks and wouldn't find a single reference to Ethereum. These references are usually regarding some technical aspects of the Ethereum implementation.

When even the most savvy members of their community start looking at Ethereum for alternatives and start talking about it as the thing that may present a solution to their long-term and exhausting problems, that surely means that a very strong shift is in progress.

dg9dazx,purargent,28,"Ive never paid first when a seller is brand new over on Pmsforsale. I have had at least 7-8 new sellers ship to me first and they got paid the same day the package arrived. Its always for enough weight/value that it has to be shipped priority mail so its 2 days before I get the package and the seller gets paid. If they were new sellers on eBay they would have to wait much longer then that to get the funds released. If someone isnt willing to ship first to a person that has loads of flair/feedback then either there not a motivated seller or possibly a scammer. 

Yes, PayPal G&amp;S is always a option with new sellers but who really wants to go through the hassle of making a claim and having their funds held up through the claims process.

I know that deals go fast over there so a lot of people are in a hurry to be first to private message and get in on the deal before someone else nabs it up. When transactions are rushed, people make mistakes and dont check into things properly. That is why a lot of scammers will list things for cheap but not to cheap to draw attention. This gets people to rush the deal which falls right into the scammers plan. 

**Things to look for when dealing with new sellers:**

1. Flair (This person had none)
2. Feedback (This person had none)
3. Reddit account history (This persons account was over a year old but had very little post history and karma which is a sign of a throw away account)
4. Payment forms they accept (If they only accept PPFF, GW and prefer bitcoin these all would be bad signs.)

Just going off from the first couple of signs to look for I wouldn't do business with this person unless they shipped first. Another good sign of a honest new seller is when they only offer for you to pay via PayPal G&amp;S and offer to eat the fees themselves.  

On a side note: I messaged this seller and asked if they would ship first and got no response. ",2017-04-15 01:33:04

The first world will always be slow to wake up to an idea like this and kings will rebuke all threats to the throne. There's a level of privilege that veils its necessity.

dgbancv,papabitcoin,30,"Wouldn't we all like to know exactly what is going on.

When people won't explain clearly what they are doing you need to step back and look at what we do know, look at actions more than words - words can easily be twisted and used to obfuscate:

**Fact - somehow &gt; $70m was put into blockstream - this was not done by a charity, or father christmas, but by hard-nosed business men who would not be in business if they gave out money and never expected to get a return.  As Venture Capital investors they aim to make 10 times or 100 times what they invested - they are not like you or me who might be happy to make 10-15% per annum on an investment.**

Blockstream is a private company, they are not going to go public with all their plans for making money, that might make it easy for people to compete with them.  They would regard having the involvement of key technical leadership figures in the bitcoin development space as a strategic asset - even if that is just to help make sure bitcoin doesn't go off in a direction that is antithetical to their business plans.

Founders of blockstream were a group of like-minded devs who believed that bitcoin can never scale on chain - so obviously they saw an opportunity in forming a company that would address the off chain scaling and at the same time make lots of money.  They may have felt that since bitcoin can never scale to high levels on chain there is no harm in them getting heavily into the offchain solution space.  (Having perhaps missed out on windfall amounts of bitcoin through early mining perhaps they feel that given their expertise here is a way to make big money - perhaps they feel they *deserve* it.)

There is a massive opportunity cost in putting money into blockstream which these investors could have employed into numerous other opportunities for generating big profits.  These types of investors have people knocking at their doors constantly.  If they invest millions in their bitcoin venture and all it does is burn cash and give no significant returns when they could have invested it into some other technology which actually made lots of money then they have missed out and backed the wrong horse.  We do not know if there are deadlines, performance hurdles that must be met, what the milestones are etc - but I would bet that there has to be some point at which it is decided in a hard way as to whether it is worth keeping going with the funding line for the company.  So we do not know how desperate people may be to get some key changes locked in or what they might do if deadlines start to approach.

The entanglement of key dev leadership figures with a private company has made the situation very confused and made it so that you can never be sure of what certain people's real motives are.  Even if a person says that are able to be independent and not acting in anyway that is a conflict of interest, how can you actually be sure?  In these situations people don't suddenly switch from 100% good to 100% bad - what happens is that, at first, tiny inconsequential decisions might swing a different way, then other decisions follow, until ultimately many decisions are flowing in a beneficial direction to the private company.  

Does a thief tell you he is about to rob you before he enters your home?
Does a terrorist announce he is going to hijack a plane before he gets on board?

You cannot expect that people will be open with their intentions in the bitcoin space any more - when bitcoins were play money it was different - now that big money is involved human greed takes over, people go dark about what they are up to.  

Even if a person never actually acts against the interest of bitcoin the mere fact of placing themselves into a position where they have a substantial potential conflict of interest affects the ecsosystem and the dynamics of the discourse.",2017-04-16 07:47:27

dgd0deu,BitEther,90,"That's about $100 billion market cap, 20x it's current price. 

[Here](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-sp-500s-100-billion-club-2014-3) are the companies with such a market cap (or greater). Now remember, ETH is not a stock. It's not easy to buy stocks. You need a broker. In contrast, many people around the world have access to crypto at some level. It's a much larger pool of potential investors. Also, you don't stake stocks. You don't lock stocks away for things like ENS, etc. You don't use stocks as gas to run applications. You don't use stock to create DAOs. You don't use stocks for ICO (which also often holds coins for longer periods). Most important, stocks are not a currency, especially not one that you can do microtransactions and even run automated payment systems (Raiden, IoT, etc etc etc).

So, Ethereum will not need to reach the impact of these companies to have a market cap on par with them. That should be VERY obvious given that Bitcoin has an 20 Billion dollar market cap and remains near useless outside of us decentralized zealots willing to sacrifice ease of use for privacy and freedom. Thus, from speculation only, Ethereum, which is far more useful and technologically superior than Bitcoin, should easily hold a market cap comparable or higher, IMO, any day now. It's earned it already. It's scope of development, use, and developer mind share is dominating. (no disrespect of Bitcoin, it has a potential role in the future that's quite strong, but it need not be the dominate market cap to be there, and it would probably be healthier for Bitcoin to loose that position sooner than later). 

But if we assume Ethereum is successful in the PoS transition (likely). Then it WILL be used, a lot, even by people without even knowing they are using a blockchain (such as Google's new book, IoT, etc). With the extraordinary progress we're seeing, Ethereum could be as strong a product in two years time as anything made by these companies.

What is relevant to know is 

- who controls the transaction,
- where does the transaction happen, 
- what will be the transactions cost,
- what are the costs to reverse a code (e.g., SegWit)
- and more importantly, who is going to have code authority and freedom to make adjustments.

Blockstream has played well to offer these solutions and they openly and tacitly attack other ideas that compete with their ideas.

Although various plans were proposed by devs, the debate has taken way too long time.  F2Pool always favors Segwit + Big Blocks.  Segwit can solve some technical problems and can bring some benefits. Big blocks are also beneficial to the bitcoin network in the long run.  However the reality is that we have not achieved Segwit + Big blocks up to now.  We see the strong demand of scaling, and many foreign users are supporting Segwit.  Therefore it's time we move on and activate Segwit first.  Then we'll leave the big blocks for future discussions.  We believe by that time, we will naturally arrive at a (good) result.  Bitcoin will keep evolving.  Let us witness the miracles of bitcoin.",2017-04-18 16:36:14

Why aren't we reading anything in the press about them partnering with banks or other FIs?

It appears that Blockstream is either spinning out of control (plausible, Adam Back does not have the skillset to be a CEO), or their true business plan is different from the one they advertise.

It seems very likely that their unstated objective is to keep Bitcoin from growing or scaling.

Think about it.... When XT became popular, they attacked Gavin. When Classic became popular, Adam Back flew to China and had an emergency closed door meeting with miners where they agreed to 2MB HF + SegWit.

The proceed to not work on that, but Soft Fork SegWit with no blocksize increase - which we all know was almost guaranteed to not sell broadly to the users and businesses in Bitcoin. 

Then they set the activation threshold to a ridiculously high 95%.

When extension blocks and BU come around, instead of working with these teams to scale or come to a compromise, they attack and divide.

And now they support UASF, which blatantly divides the community and will split Bitcoin into pieces.

Their actions indicate that they want to split Bitcoin and stall it. Blockstream is a malicious actor. Period. Not everyone on their payroll may realize it, but that's what is going on.

Think of how greatly the world would benefit if some international consortium or system could be established to host fair, unpartisan, trusted, and secure elections.

Imagine if this system could maintain security but make voting an easy few taps on a smartphone app - an app that notifies you of live elections that you are eligible to participate in, and informs you of the issues and the candidates. Knowing the election is fair and secure would provide great peace-of-mind for both winners and losers. It would result in greater voter participation knowing elections aren't simply rigged. And for better or worse, life will be shaped by the will of the many. 

----
edit

Yes, I realize there are realistic qualms with the security of voting electronically. I was simply musing - *if there was a way, how nice would that be.*

That said...

If electronic voting meant submitting your vote directly to the election curation platform, which was developed and handled by a consortium of scientists, cybersecurity, and technology giants like Google, IBM, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks; that adopted transparent and verifiable methods (think - bitcoin block chain).

How is that less secure than handing a paper ballot to a bunch of strangers at a polling office in some small town in middle america?

I don't get how you could argue that electronic elections would be hacked in a heartbeat, and then turn-around and engage in something like online banking. 

Lastly, the system doesn't need to absolutely guarantee that it's 100% hack-proof. It just needs to (1) employ prevailing modern security standards (like say, Google or Bank of America), and (2) it needs to recognize if it was hacked (at least on a scale large enough to sway the outcome of an election; there will be obvious markers for this) so it can patch the vulnerability and rerun the election (which would take 2 seconds, because you can vote from your phone or online). 

In fact, there should be a bounty program for this e-vote system much like Google has, where they pay $$ to anyone who can prove they found an exploit/bug/vulnerability in their systems.",2017-04-19 09:17:14

dgfkffy,killerstorm,52,"Statefulness is, basically, an ability to keep track of things. In this context, on blockchain level.

E.g. let's consider an example of a trustless lottery: people put money into a contract, and after some time a randomly chosen participants receives the whole sum.

It is very easy to implement it using Ethereum model: a lottery contract can _keep track_ of who put money into it. I.e. you have a stateful contract with state automatically updated on blockchain level. Then having a list of participants, you can select a random one and award him a payment.

You cannot use this model with Bitcoin because Bitcoin does not have any ""updatable"" (stateful) things. Bitcoin only has transaction outputs which are either fully spent or not, and scripts which are stateless.

So if you do it with Bitcoin, you gotta maintain this state elsewhere. Perhaps you can make a server which keeps track of _intent_ to enter a lottery. Then it will build a transaction involving participants coins. Then it requests participants to sign it. If a participant is offline, it needs to be kicked out, and then you rebuild transaction without him.

This huge transaction will pay out money to an output which will eventually give money to a random participants. (Not sure if it's possible to do it with Bitcoin script, but at least it's theoretically possible with Bitcoin model.)

So as you see the difference here is that in case of Ethereum you have statefulness on the blockchain level. It might be more ""expensive"" in a way, but it is very easy to work with, as you have same mental model as with normal software. It's a ""rich statefulness"" in sense that it's not just a couple of variable, but an associative array of unlimited size at your disposal, so you are not restricted in any way.

With Bitcoin model you have to maintain state outside of blockchain, which requires:

1. a special server to be built (and hosted) for each application
2. wallet software which is aware of the protocol of said server

On top of that, it is much more fragile because states of different participants might be out of sync (e.g. one can drop out after registering), as they aren't synced using blockchain.

Since it's so complex, very few such applications exist.

I was trying to design a trustless Bitcoin derivative platform in 2011. I got stuck because besides implementing the service, I had to implement a wallet to work with it. Standard Bitcoin wallets would not work.

With Ethereum, a similar platform can be implemented in matter of _hours_. So yes, statefulness is important.

It's so sad that people in Bitcoin community prefer to play dumb when they discuss Ethereum. Yes, Ethereum has different goals and priorities, that doesn't make it OK to shit on something you do not understand.",2017-04-19 03:42:32

&gt; Majority miners will deploy hash power as needed to ensure the minority chain includes only empty blocks after the forking point. This can easily be accomplished if the majority miners maintain a secret chain of empty blocks --- built off their last empty block --- publishing only as much of this chain as necessary to **orphan any non-empty blocks produced on the minority chain**.

&gt; One persons bug is another persons feature. In the case of transaction replay, this is a **feature to make sure that the core team won't be able to keep a chain going**. Because on their low-mining-power chain it would be a disaster to have 1MB blocks coming every hour or so, while still having most of the transactions of the main Bitcoin standing in line to mine.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; Tl;dr It is obvious to see why core coin wants the BU team to add replay ""protection"", because doing so castrates a **feature that will kill core-coin**.

**Gavin Andresen**

&gt; **It would be even more destructive** to mine an eleven-block-long empty chain, then wait until the slow chain gets 9 blocks until announcing it to the network.

&gt; Or keep them guessing; choose a chain length at random, from 1 to some secret N, and orphan that many blocks at a time. Allow a couple normal blocks, then do it again.

&gt; **It would be impossible for exchanges** to know how many confirmations were safe for deposits and would be a nightmare for their withdrawal accounting.

&gt; **I'm not even sure this kind of thing should be considered immoral**-- majority hashpower acting selfishly for their own economic benefit (both short and long term) is the basic incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work.

dgials8,nullc,184,"&gt; If ""Core"" signed this supposed agreement

It didn't under any shade or color.  This is such an absurd and abusive lie... it's infuriating to see this repeated.

Several people who sometimes contribute to core went to go have some mutual communication with miners (after being urged to not go by others...) and agreed that they would personally work on some less crazy blocksize hardfork proposals after segwit if the miners didn't signal the crazy classic hardfork.  This was a personal commitment they made, for activity _after_ segwit, and they had neither the right or authority to commit anyone else to anything, and they didn't. Once the whole thing was made public they were criticized for being politically naive, and that the whole thing would be misrepresented... ""I told you so."" 

In the week after F2Pool outright broke the agreement by signaling Classic, but Luke and some others trucked on and [implemented](https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/compare/bc94b87%E2%80%A6luke-jr:hardfork2016) what they said they [would](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-August/012936.html).  But it went over like a lead balloon, Luke even went on to try to make several other alternative proposals-- but continued to run into the same problem:  The only people really urgently clamoring for this stuff are people who want unrealistic 'effectively no limits' proposals, either out of ignorance, or because they active want to split the system.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Classic's BIP109 proposal caught fire on testnet-- months after they wanted it activated on Bitcoin-- and failed all on its own with a bit of help from Bitcoin Unlimited's flawed 109 implementation triggering the split.  But do we hear a ""Gee, thanks for the bullet dodged there""? nope.

Bitcoin reached that milestone ages ago - so it should already have prepared for a hard-fork to raise the hard-limit.  Should have been first priority.  And it could have been achieved cooperatively, peacefully and in an orderly fashion.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/closer-look-bip100-block-size-proposal-bitcoin-miners-rallying-behind-1440792099/

&gt;“The Bitcoin economy is composed of several groups, and no single group should be given complete power over the protocol. Miner interests are not completely aligned with those of users and node operators,” Rosenfeld told Bitcoin Magazine. “Users want transactions to be cheap and plentiful, nodes want blocks to be small and manageable, and miners could want either big or small blocks – whatever maximizes profits. If given the power to vote on the block-size limit, miners are likely to abuse it, disregarding the other groups. In every single market, giving producers the power to artificially limit supply and competition can lead to disastrous consequences, and Bitcoin is no different. ”

They're just rehashing all the old rejected proposals. Extension block, and now this (and they don't even attempt to hide their effort to protect ASICBOOST lol)

His company also has patents for ""confidential transactions"", but those transactions have huge signatures. That means that the transactions would require large fees to get miners to include them in the blocks. So Greg has added a discount for signature data into segwit. This means that miners who seek to maximize their profits will have to charge fees for signature data which are one fourth as large as the fees for transaction data.

That means that there will be an effective subsidy for Blockstream's patented transactions built into the bitcoin protocol, making regular bitcoin transactions more expensive for the rest of us. This will make Blockstream's patents more valuable.

dgkggkj,Lejitz,65,"**This is important to understand regarding the political implications of BIP148 on Vertcoin and a MASF on Litecoin.**

Vertcoin is the new battleground.  Here's why:

The only reason Jihan wanted to block SegWit on litecoin was to make it politically easier to block SegWit on Bitcoin; a favorable precedent for SegWit makes arguing against it more difficult.  Blocking SegWit on Bitcoin is all about protecting ASICBoost.  Ultimately, however, Jihan is fine if Litecoin activates SegWit, so long as Bitcoin does not.

A UASF is the biggest threat to successfully activate SegWit on Bitcoin, therefore, Jihan would like to show a UASF to be dangerous.  Accordingly, Jihan needs a UASF attempt to fail in order to set an unfavorable precedent, making it more difficult to win support for in Bitcoin.  But this can only happen with a majority of hash power willfully attacking a UASF after activation.  Jihan does not have the ability to successfully attack Litecoin, so he is better off miner-activating SegWit on Litecoin.  Otherwise, a favorable precedent will be set for BIP148.

**Enter Vertcoin.**  Last week, it appeared that Vertcoin was about to miner-activate SegWit (and Litecoin was likely to implement a UASF).  All of the sudden, someone blocked activation by adding more than 100% of Vertcoin's prior-existing hashrate to their network.  This miner now has more than 51% of the hashrate and is signaling against SegWit.  As a response, Vertcoin is implementing BIP148.

Now, the roles are reversed, Vertcoin is implementing a UASF and Litecoin is miner-activating.   But unlike Litecoin, it is possible to successfully attack Vertcoin.  First, the hash power is readily available to successfully 51% attack.  Second, the market cap is low enough to successfully manipulate the price action to give the post-attack impression that the market is accepting the non-SegWit chain.

In essence, by switching the roles of Litecoin and SegWit, Jihan could establish enough FUD against a UASF that the only option for activating SegWit on Bitcoin is through miners.  Of course, in order to protect ASICBoost, this will never happen.  Bitcoin will be stuck with Jihan as its ruler.

Right now, Vertcoin may need some help to thrive through the coming attacks.

So yes, when it comes to Bitcoin being digital cash as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is definitely dying. There is no denying. It needs to get its act together quickly if it wants to turn the tide. And that includes making Lightning viable as a solution, because pushing use-cases out before they can transition to LN, and increasing the barrier to entry with high fees, doesn't help LN at all!

The question becomes, how important are the underlying features of each coin to their long-term value?  Why do these technological features need to be tied to a specific cryptocurrency?  Is the USD valuable because it is a more technologically advanced currency than others?  Obviously the answer is no, it's valuable because it's widely accepted across the world, and it's widely accepted across the world because it's supported by the world's largest economy.

Money gets its value from a network effect.  The more people who use it and accept it for goods/services, the more valuable it becomes.

But don't worry, bitmain said they aren't using it for the good of bitcoin although it's built in their miners, they filed a patent for it and are defending both the use of ASICBoost and the patents.

&gt; Bitmain holds the ASICBOOST patent in China. We can legally use it in our own mining farms in China to profit from it and sell the cloud mining contracts to the public. This, however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin.

Don't worry, since they don't use it for the good of the network, they will back a ""counter-optimisation"" i'm sure. Oh wait:

&gt; Gregory Maxwell’s recent proposal suggests changing 2^32 collision to 2^64 collision to make ASICBOOST more difficult. The result of this would be a loss for the patent owners and the Bitcoin protocol. 

How can it be a loss for the patent owners if they won't use covert asic boost on the maint network? Do they sell the license to use it instead so they can continue saying: ""We never used asicboost in **OUR** mining farms ?""


Btw the above quotes are taken from Bitmain official statement: https://blog.bitmain.com/en/regarding-recent-allegations-smear-campaigns/

To be fair, it's almost understandable from bitmain's point of view, after all they're a for profit company, it's just a big disappointment to see people (like r/btc) still supporting Bitmain and hailing covert Asicboost despite the above statements and the huge risk on the network. Even bitmain clearly imples that covert asicboost is not good for bitcoin in that statement. ",2017-04-23 08:00:28
dgmwele,Deadwing888,37,"It is becoming more and more common for ""bitfinex is of course insolvent"" to be thrown around this thread. I have not seen the evidence to believe that is the case. It is good to question solvency, and I think a lot of people woke up to this after gox; however I believe what we are currently seeing on finex is fundamentally different from gox.

With Gox you have an exchange which was insolvent even as far back as Jed McCaleb selling it to Karaples (he was basically like: uhhh we're missing some of these btc things, but they're dirt cheap so you should probably drop 150k and buy the missing ones). This insolvency was widened further still by MtGox company purchases and salaries over and above what exchange fees were bringing in.

Now As long as people didn't withdraw a lot of bitcoin at once, this insolvency would not be an issue for them (much in the same way fractional reserve banking isn't an issue for the banks most of the time). Now as the price of btc goes up so do does goxes insolvency priced in USD. This became a horrifying problem for them first in 2011 during the run-up to 30$. 

Back in the days when 80% of the bitcoin trading happened on gox, what they discovered they could do was: after organic demand drives price up &gt; unload goxbtc at the top and start a massive crash (covering what was basically a USD margin long) &gt; panic people with exchange issues (price goes to one cent, fake DDOS their exchange, etc) to crash the price drastically &gt; use the USD profits to buy back goxbtc at the bottom in efforts to help cover their btc insolvency. This happened again in April 2013 as the price rise started to blow their btc insolvency liability sky high. Tl;dr: when the gox price and the btc price are the same thing, you can manipulate that price to mask your insolvency.

When Gox started to lose its dominant exchange status in late 2013 btc withdrawals started outpace the income of fresh btc deposits (even with the credited goxBTC staying put). Gox proceeded to buy btc with nonexistent USD on their own exchange (withdrawals were frozen so they knew they wouldn't have a run on USD). This in the short run will help them because: freshly mined btc will go to the highest priced exchange to sell. If they were higher than btcChina they would have more deposits than withdrawals. This postponed the ""emperor has no clothes"" moment, but had a runaway feedback loop effect on the price. A combination of real china demand, and gox juicing the price had a market hype effect on the entire planet and real USD poured in everywhere to buy btc.

This was the begging of the end for Gox because unlike in the old days (when 80% of btc trading happened on gox), other exchanges now have a voice in the price discovery as well. With their hot wallet completely bled dry in Febuary, Gox freezes btc withdrawls, publishes their ""transaction malleability"", and slams their orderbook with with all the goxbtc they'd been buying to maintain the gox premium. This rolls their liability to their creditors from all that fake USD into fake BTC while at the same time making that liability smaller priced in dollars. If Gox was still the dominate exchange, everyone panic selling their btc would all deposit them at gox for gox to then buy and keep the ball rolling (this is why gox didn't freeze deposits until the very end). Not so. The transaction malleability was discredited as not terribly significant and the other exchanges were still printing a price in the 500-700s even after days and days of gox dumping goxbtc into their orderbooks. With the jig now up mtGox finally comes out and finally says ""we lost the btc"". Everyone scours the block-chain looking for the big hack, which of course no one can find because, of course it never happened.

I think this is fundamentally different from the situation Bitfinex is now in. Consider:

1) Gox did not keep up the insolvency jig long when the other exchanges began to have significant market share. Bitfinex has never been in a position to fraudulently manipulate the price to nearly the extent Gox did. Price manipulation on bitfinex is tame (by crypto standards) with no smoking gun that even links the manipulation to the exchange proper.

2) The Bitfinex hack was an actual hack with actual btc moving on the actual block-chain. Furthermore, they came out and said they got hacked immediately and attempted to make their customers whole again either through company equity or shares of future exchange fee profits. As soon as they exchanged hacked btc for bitfinex tokens they aren't by definition insolvent.

3) Gox never traded altcoins (for reasons which, in hindsight are all too clear). Finex's trading of altcoins gives them an extra layer of equity, it gives them an extra layer of exchange fees. If there were a wide market concern about btc solvency you would expect the altcoin ratios to be out of wack, and they are not.

4) Coupled with the higher USD volume of crypto traded these days, it is less likely in my eyes that they would need to fractionally reserve for business expenses, especially after seeing where that lands you (gox).

So what *is* happening on finex? During the period where withdrawals were haulted but deposits were not, I believe USD was introduced on the exchange and began sloshing around. Even with deposits halted, there's only one exit (coins) leading the cash to pile up, only really getting soaked into the accounts of the people willing to sell at the premium speculating on both finex solvency and withdrawal normalization. 

The arbitragers are dutifully borrowing BTC to short and hedging with longs on the other exchanges. What they're not banking on is: the cash sloshing around wanting out badly enough to overpower them. Basically if the higher premium doesn't bring in enough crypto deposits the price will start to run as shorts are margin called into an ever-shrinking order-book. Other exchanges will go up slowly as people buy to deposit into finex and sell north of 2k to continue to bet on finex solvency and withdrawal normalization. This is far from a guarantee, but the people closing shorts on finex at a loss and the plain ole bulls all see it as a distinct possibility.

Now that I'm about done with a generally bitfinex-favorable post, I'd like to say that it was irresponsible of them to get hacked in the first place, and the minute they put their USD margin lenders on the hook for btc holder losses was the minute I knew I'd never trade there (and I'm not even a margin lender). Finex had a fiduciary responsibility to shield their margin USD lenders from losses until everyone else had lost everything and there was still an outstanding liability. They only partially redeemed themselves with their token/equity shenanigans in my eyes, and I know I'll never trade there.

tl;dr: Gox did shady shit I don't see finex doing. Buy btc, there might be a big short squeeze.",2017-04-23 17:48:53

dgnnqw6,udecker,37,"One of the co-founders of Tether here - this is a good write-up of why the price of BTC at exchanges with fiat movements troubles are trending higher - it’s about the time value of money.  

Couple of things to point out, though - there is no way that Tether can run a fractional reserve (read the Tether white paper on details).  The whole purpose is to ensure that any “bank run” could be fully covered with funds on deposit.  Tether doesn’t create tethers unless the money is in the bank.  (If it did, even once, the entire model would fall apart and the social contract would never be believed ever again).

&gt;they send their tether to the company and the company deposits real dollars into their bank account no questions asked

Not quite.  Per the TOS, someone can't just “show up” with tethers and expect to get fiat wired to them “no questions asked.”  Tether has some serious KYC/AML procedures that you have to go through and become approved to get that benefit.

Quick note on how we came up with Tether in the first place - it was exactly the issues that Gox had with fiat withdrawals.  The question we asked was “why can’t I withdraw my USD balance into my Bitcoin wallet?”  And then worked to figure out how to make that possible.  The 1:1 pegging methodology was by far the simplest.

Tether just put out an announcement (https://tether.to/announcement/) about the banking issues, and redemptions are happening now for Taiwanese customers.  Not much consolation for international customers, but evidently a nice arb opportunity for those who can take advantage of it.

dgn5voq,jstolfi,33,"Presumably you mean *decentralized* cryptocurrency.  (Centralized ones probably can be successful, like centralized non-crypto digital currencies.)

Computer scientists have been trying to design a decentralized payment system (DPS) since they invented public-key cryptography.   Preventing theft and ensuring existence of funds was easy.  The stumbling block was preventing double-spends without some central database.  Some even proved that it was impossible.

Satoshi thought he had a solution, using a new fiat currency with a journal-like ledger maintained by a network of miners who vote with their hashpower and were motivated to cooperate by fees and seignorage.   

And indeed his system almost worked.  But it had some flaws that were discovered only years later.  Some of those may be fixable, but some have no known solution.

One fixable flaw is the lack of inflation.  That mistakenly causes people to expect that the value will go up indefinitely, and therefore turns the currency into a pyramid-like investment scam.  One consequence of that is extreme value volatility, that renders the new currency useless for legal commerce.  The  potential rise in value with time is also an incentive for the creation of hundreds of alternative currencies, that are generally very lucrative for their creators, even if they fail right away.

One flaw that no one knows how to fix is that his solution is inherently anonymous, and easily usable via Tor or other hard-to-trace channels.  That made it (and probaby any DPS) a boon for criminals, and enables many crimes -- like illegal internet commerce, ransomware, and new modalities of tax evasion, money laundering, ponzi schemes, fraudulent ICOs/IPOs, and the like.

Even if one were to make the currency inflationary, there is no know way to adjust its emission rate to the growth of the economy.  Therefore there is no way  to ensure that its value will be stable enough for use in commerce.

Another flaw without known fix is that transactions are irreversible, making theft, scams, criminal payments, and plain mistakes impossible to correct.   That is compounded by the fact that a DPS by definition requires each user to ""be his own bank"".  That requires the user to be fairly computer-savy, and still exposes his coins to loss by hardware failures, operation errors, hacking, phishing, key loggers, and malicious bitcoin software (and hardware, e.g. phony Trezors).  Indeed, there seems to be no way for the average person to use the system without trusting software provided by a third party.

Scaling may be considered another flaw without known solution.  Satoshi's answer to those who pointed out that problem was that Moore's law would allow the traffic to grow up to 60% per year without the system becoming more expensive for the individual user.  But many people consider that rate too low -- ""success"" for them means 10'000 transactions per second or more (instead of the current 4) in a few years time.

A related and equally unfixable flaw is the lack of a governance mechanism to decide necessary protocol changes, including the fixing of transaction fees.  

Yet another potentially fatal flaw is the lack of incentives for the propagation of transactions among miners.   While it is in the miner's interest to spread his own blocks to all peers, and even forward blcoks solved by other miners, there seems to be an incentive for each miner to keep for himself any fee-paying transactions that he receives from other users. 

There seems to be also an obscure flaw in the protocol that gives each miner an incentive to delay the confirmation of some high-fee transactions, instead of including them in his next block candidate.

But the biggest unfixable flaw may be that, as long as the financial incentive for mining is effective, this activity will inevitably become centralized into a few companies in places where electricity and salaries are cheapest.  That's because a bigger miner has many advantages, economic and technical, over two miners half its size; and none of the factors that prevent centralization in other industries applies to crypto mining.  One technical advantage of a big miner is that, when he solves block N, he can start to work immediately on block N+1 on top of it, while his competitors are still wasting time on their versions of block N.   

Once a majority of the hashpower is in the hand of a dozen companies, as has been the case for bitcoin since 2014 or so, the protocol does not work anymore, and all the complexity of blockhain and PoW becomes a huge pointless waste of electricity and time.",2017-04-24 00:05:30

While let me tell you a wee bit more about me since you know just about everything already but don’t let this information gain hands to anyone else or every single ”naughty” picture I have of you will go viral and there won’t be an way to stop it. It all started back in 2011, freshman year. I found a jailbreak repo that allowed me to get anything and everything from Amazon for free. Once I received my items, I went back to amazon and sold them as a third party vendor. This lasted for about 8 months until a patch was developed. At that time, I had about $25,000. I had to do more. This is when I learned about the deep web and Silk Road. I found an Amazon employee on the deep web with verified credentials whom allowed me access to his 50% off discount for a small fee. I used this to kick-start my earnings for a while later. Scamming amazon eventually got me into the market of selling hacked Paypal accounts via bitcoins as well as skimmed credit cards and very, very, small amounts of counterfeit currencies. By Q2, 2014, I met you. I stopped everything and devoted everything I could to you while staying under the radar besides selling a few fake IDs. I decided to change every aspect of my life to better myself and just sit on investments, cashing out small percentages at high points in the market and then reinvesting. I recently got back into the market and found a guy on the deep web who has doubled my earnings. By August 9, 2016, FDA regulations on vaping devices are going to and all manufacturers to sell their products on the deep web, which, in return, will triple my bitcoin exchange. You sending me this text has allowed me to clone your SIM. If you tell anyone, I will know. I have extracted your IP and MAC address from the friend request you have sent me on Facebook.

dgqr243,jimmywales1,37,"*Well ideally if we get big, we'll be multilingual and in lots of places.  Initially we are launching in English but also looking to hire reporters with strong language skills.  You've given me the idea that if we could only hire 1 bitcoin reporter, it might be kind of awesome to find someone fluent in both English and Chinese.  But we should also look into the costs and possibilities of hiring in China as well.  (Hiring in China is cheaper than in English speaking countries, so...)

Basically I guess the more ""big picture"" answer to that question is that I'm open and flexible and want to think about how to be highly effective.

*One of the things that I'm interested in is whether the ""engaging a community"" model that I'm talking about for bitcoin can also work for local journalism.  Let me give an example.  

I was recently in my home state of Alabama and met someone (a journalist) who was telling me about a couple of small local towns where they have 2 newspapers who used to have about 4 journalists each.  Now both papers share 2 journalists who work half-time each on stories in each down.  This has to be devastating in terms of having proper accountability for local corruption, etc.

So, can those communities get together and say hey - let's become monthly supporters of Wikitribune and indicate our interest as our small town?  The two towns have a population of 50,000.  A few thousand supporters could make a big difference.

And here's the thing - because our content will be published under a CC-BY license, we might be able to coordinate with the traditional papers and let them use our content for free.  Why not?  It's paid for by the community, so let's let it go out to the community.

*We're launching in English, but that's just because we have to start somewhere, and that's the language I speak.  I think one way to deal with the bias that may come with that is to look for a broad base of community members to oversee things, but also to think about that issue in terms of hiring (see above for my desire for hiring people with 2nd language skills). 

But I also think it means a lot - not that it is perfect, just that it means a lot - to have a principled dedication to neutrality and a culture of encouraging it and checking ourselves for bias.

*I think community can help, yes.  But yeah, there are no really magical answers to these tough philosophical problems!",2017-04-26 04:48:57

dgsk6cf,petertodd,209,"So Sergio and Slush both noticed that there's a remote code execution vulnerability in this backdoor. The backdoor has **NO** authentication, so any MITM attacker or DNS attacker can trigger it.

With remote code execution you can reflash the firmware on those miners, and once you do that you can permanently brick them. In fact, it's almost certain that you could permanently destroy the HW - I used to work as an electronics designer, and I did that by accident w/ bad firmware quite a few times.

So tl;dr: we have a backdoor that could permanently kill ~70% of the Bitcoin hashing power, and it can be triggered by anyone with MITM capability or the ability to change DNS records.

edit: They think this one isn't exploitable, but apparently Bitmain has [another way to remotely reflash firmware](https://twitter.com/f2pool_wangchun/status/846802584698441728) on Antminers anyway, so the above is still quite possible. :(

Sadly this kind of fuckup is far from unknown... Tesla for instance has the ability to quite literally kill all Tesla drivers and their passengers with over-the-air firmware updates. Both the accelerator and brakes are fly-by-wire - and the steering assist motors could probably overpower most drivers - so you could reprogram every car on the road to all accelerate out of control until they hit something at the same time without warning.

While let me tell you a wee bit more about me since you know just about everything already but don’t let this information gain hands to anyone else or every single ”naughty” picture I have of you will go viral and there won’t be an way to stop it. It all started back in 2011, freshman year. I found a jailbreak repo that allowed me to get anything and everything from Amazon for free. Once I received my items, I went back to amazon and sold them as a third party vendor. This lasted for about 8 months until a patch was developed. At that time, I had about $25,000. I had to do more. This is when I learned about the deep web and Silk Road. I found an Amazon employee on the deep web with verified credentials whom allowed me access to his 50% off discount for a small fee. I used this to kick-start my earnings for a while later. Scamming amazon eventually got me into the market of selling hacked Paypal accounts via bitcoins as well as skimmed credit cards and very, very, small amounts of counterfeit currencies. By Q2, 2014, I met you. I stopped everything and devoted everything I could to you while staying under the radar besides selling a few fake IDs. I decided to change every aspect of my life to better myself and just sit on investments, cashing out small percentages at high points in the market and then reinvesting. I recently got back into the market and found a guy on the deep web who has doubled my earnings. By August 9, 2016, FDA regulations on vaping devices are going to and all manufacturers to sell their products on the deep web, which, in return, will triple my bitcoin exchange. You sending me this text has allowed me to clone your SIM. If you tell anyone, I will know. I have extracted your IP and MAC address from the friend request you have sent me on Facebook. I have also documented your MAC address and IP from a Skype conversation you had with a certain somebody not to long ago.

Its time to stop, recognize that a lot of people have been duped into siding with a clearly nefarious actor, and to move forward with a clean slate.

Its quite clear who the enemy of bitcoin is. From [Chinese miners admitting opposing SW is done for political reasons](https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/verified-chatlogs-why-jihan-and-jiang-want-to-block-segwit-at-all-cost-bbf068c5ce0f), then admitting that it would cause a massive decrease of profits (the only possible reason is asicboost),  to now installing back doors into mining rigs.....

This is exactly the threat that bitcoin has always faced, and its called Miner Centralization.

Clearly this is the biggest threat bitcoin faces and the time for a divided community has ended. Anyone who tries to argue against the evidence has their head stuck so far in the sand that they will deny the sun rises and water is wet.

1. There is absolutely no non-malicious reason for implementing something like this.

Everyone should update their miner's /etc/hosts file to add this immediately:
127.0.0.1 auth.minerlink.com

So here's the relevant code. As long as the address doesn't resolve it's fine. If it does resolve but doesn't send data it's fine. If it does resolve and sends data but the data doesn't contain ""false"" it's fine.

However, if it resolves, and sends data, and that data has ""false"", it queues things to stop.

It's worth noting that every time you update your firmware you're probably going to have to readd this DNS exception in /etc/hosts. Additionally, they could change the address in future firmwares to get around people editing their /etc/hosts files, too. Usually once a manufacturer does something as incompetent as this, you can never trust them not to try to sneak it in again, even years down the road.

&gt; How could it possibly be argued that this is anything other than malicious with just an exceptionally thin veneer of plausible deniability (not plausible in my opinion).

In Jihans latest blog post he indicates that it was his intention to have all of the miners call his server, and he would then remotely shut down miners at the request of the customer (if, for example, they were to get stolen). Similar to the iphones remote wipe features, which is executed by apple at the customers request.

If true, this would explain the hard coded domain name and the absence of any UI configuration.

But even so, in a decentralized and trustless environment such as bitcoin's, it's completely unethical to implement such a feature. I think Jihan is smart enough to know that.

You know that the folks working on core are responsible for multiple orders of magnitude scaling improvements already. Right?   The capacity document lists many scaling tools which I and others think are interesting.

Probably the most pressing after segwit is signature aggregation, which is a 28%-ish increase in capacity straight away.

&gt; proposed by respected researchers with real credentials

Most proposals radically change the security model which makes them non-starters.  I think the key idea of Bitcoin NG in separating the mastership race from transactions is very useful, but think that it should instead be done like weak blocks, since it is both compatible and doesn't change the security model to do it that way. (e.g. doesn't introduce miner identities).

dgu4haq,xxDan_Evansxx,25,"I remember Roger talking about introducing people to Bitcoin by hanging out at Starbucks and telling people about how they could save money buying coffee by using bitcoin and an app that bought Starbucks gift cards for 80 cents on the dollar.  The giftcard was loaded onto your phone and you sold back whatever you didn't use.  I never used it, but it was a pretty cool use case for Bitcoin.  It was a solid example of Bitcoin saving people money with relatively little hassle on something they were buying anyway.  This might have been Purse, or if not it was something similar.

Anyway, Roger was quite a Bitcoin evangelist and some of what he preached about Bitcoin is really not true right now.  The use case I mentioned wouldn't work well now because of the transaction fees.  I think Roger really believes bigger blocks would work well to allow Bitcoin to still be useful for small payments.  I think he also really believes that bigger blocks are being thwarted because of the Blockstream business model and influence on Bitcoin Core development.  So even though he believes Segwit would help, he opposes it because he doesn't ""trust"" Core and he thinks adopting Segwit makes it less likely for larger blocks to be adopted as well.

Obviously there could be more sinister motives, but I don't know why there must be.  Both sides tend to assume the absolute worst about those on the other side of this debate.  I don't think that is helpful overall.  There is a ton of confirmation bias in Reddit conversations.

Because the ""person"" who is being ""attacked"" in this situation has not resorted to technical facts or arguments and is a business, not just a individual. You can't have this both ways.

Roger staked his reputation on vouching for Mt Gox. If you think that his intent was to not vouch for Mt Gox, then what was he doing? You are trying to use semantics to create a red herring to distract from reality.

The **only** purpose of Roger's Mt Gox claims were to assure the community that ""everything is ok"". If you are going to deny this then you should not even be trying to participate in the discussion because you are living in a alternative fantasy reality where we pretend common sense things are not true.

&gt;So the claim that some act of Rogers ""resulted in massive losses to thousands of Bitcoiners"" is utter and absolute garbage.

Rogers assurance that he ""looked into Mt Gox and everything seems ok"" resulted in investor confidence during what was supposed to be a bank run. He directly added to the misleading conclusion that Mt Gox was not having problems when they were having problems.

Instead, Roger should have been advising everyone to remove their assets until a professional audit could be done.

Roger made a mistake and risked his reputation on that mistake. Now, roger is doing the same thing again, and **again** its turning out that he is colluding with the worst people in the space. Maybe Mark K is totally innocent and was just a bumbling idiot, but that does not take away liability, nor does it take away Rogers involvement with what became the largest liability issue of all time in the bitcoin ecosphere.

Now here he is at it again, **again** defending Bitmain when Bitmain has clearly gotten caught in multiple malicious acts. Roger is obviously a poor judge of the situation and his reputation has been greatly diminished because of his continued advocacy of malicious actors within the bitcoin space.

Roger is a entity and he needs to be attacked specifically because he is acting beyond the scope of his personal self. He is using bitcoin.com as a propaganda machine against the best interests of the community and is colluding with 9 figure chinese cabals who are hellbent on monopolizing the industry.

And he justifies it how? Because these people say they want big blocks?

Roger has engaged in clear cognitive dissonance by refusing to acknowledge that Bitmain has a anti-competitive monopolistic $$$$$ reason to want big blocks and it has nothing to do with big blocks and everything to do with preventing the upgrading of the bitcoin network which would invalidate their chinese patented asicboost and prevent them from further monopolizing the industry.

If Roger was just Roger then I might agree with you. But he's not. He's a pool operator and multiple domain and multiple social media platform operator who has made it a war to infiltrate and spread propaganda for his ideological perspective.

You are a limp banana bruce and you are supporting the wrong side. When there are clear malicious actors with resources in the space you *must* stand strong against them or they will prevail. Grassroots resistance is the only way that the people can stand up against specialized interest groups. Bitmain is clearly a malicious specialized interest group and Roger has made it his personal war to support them because they support his cause.

If we allowed this kind of behavior we would all be wading through dick picks on a 20mb blockchain right now that could only be hosted on datacenters. If we allowed the Gavin mentality to propagate we would no longer have a decentralized bitcoin. The fight must be at a social level because who else is going to stand up for the little guys?

We do not sacrifice security for short term profit.

dgwh5s2,Adrian-X,41,"I would agree with this.

Adam Back - the CEO of Blockstream started the FUD and accused Gavin of doing a coup when he released BIP101 for review.

to quote exactly what he said: 

&gt;Adam Back: ""[Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/the-bitcoin-for-is-a-coup)""

**Contention was manufactured where there was none** - people can choose to support or not, Gavin was a Bitcoin developer not some outsider.  

BIP101 which included the  following features which should make **it obvious it's not a coup**: 

* 1 year of preparation before it could be activated.

* it required 75% of miners to agree to the block size increase. before it could be activated.  (75% support to activate segwit was perfectly agreeable.) 

* if activated a grace period allowing the network to upgrade before a &gt;1MB block could be mined. 

* an additional implementations of bitcoin called XT - Effectively more distributed control over development - less centralization the opposite of a coup and centralized control takeover.

* if more than 25% of miners found it **contentious** - it would never have an opportunity to activate.  

* at the time Gavin held full control over Bitcoin repo on GitHub, and did not dictate what happens in bitcoin development


Ignorant small bock fundamentalists proclaiming this was contentious and would split the network. that's not what is splinting the network.

u/adam3us could maybe give us a definition of what he meant when he says ""coup"" he sounds very aggressive as if his control of bitcoin was under threat - classic psychological projection: 

What followed was a closed door Hong Kong meeting where the CEO of Blockstream Adam Back meat with 80% of the bitcoin hashing power. After a 17 hour meeting an agreement, to block any hard fork proposals and wait until BS/Core releases segwit, was made. 

&gt;**what Adam said:**

&gt;Gavin naively thinks he'll do the coup, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

&gt;**what Adam did:**

&gt;He went behind the community's back, force the issue, and then invite people to participate in the coup.

dgwiw3x,DisReddits,33,"Closed/hedged 50% of my position yesterday at ~8% gain from my latest entry position. Price level is still artificially elevated due to Bitfinex withdrawals and it may continue rallying, but I think it's all just a game of musical chairs and price will drop, unless 1. we're seeing deflation in action; 2. impending short squeeze will be cause for another FOMO rally; 3. on-chain scaling is resolved.

Something far more alarming is that we're getting to the ""point of no return"" regarding to Bitcoin market dominance (which, IMO, is sustained drop below 60%). BTC daily volume against FIAT is already less then 50% and ALT/FIAT pairs are growing steadily, increasing amounts of money is going past Bitcoin. Sure, some are looking for the next big thing, though most of this rally is fueled by people diversifying and we've come to the point where talking about BTC/ALT  pairs is more than relevant to this subreddit, then talking BTC/FIAT.

Do I think that alts are in an extreme bubble? Undoubtedly. Closest thing to a competition (marketcap-wise) for bitcoin is overhyped and extremely overvalued. [General public](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin,ethereum) is essentially unaware of it. I call this momentum ""a clear case of Tesla"", where, while the product looks good and works fine for the time being, price is essentially built on future promises as developers are yet to deliver their final product. Ripple is one of those rare cases, where I want to use term sh&amp;tcoin and I'm puzzled by the fact that people are buying that piece of crap for anything other than speculative purposes. Anonymity-centric coins will always have their place (for good and bad reasons) and with clear use case they are direct competitors to Bitcoin. Litecoin... why is it still relevant? Oh, yeah, enough liquidity to transact, when Bitcoin fees go over $1, FFS.

Market dominance, is not a fallacy as some have suggested, neither is ""having smaller piece of a bigger pie - a good thing"". Valuation of alts is as good of a metric to where the money is flowing into, as it was for Bitcoin a couple of years ago. The premise of majority core devs and bitcoin maximalists is that bitcoin is the only main-chain necessary and their roadmap is built around it, yet without sidechains and LN it's all just a wishful thinking and while bitcoin users/devs/miners continue fighting about future development discourse, other coins, just develop better and better tools for their intended tasks. It all boils down to this question... Why use bitcoin if any other coin does what bitcoin do faster/safer/more efficient/less-expensive?

&gt; In addition to the bomb threats to Jewish centres, the indictment said Kadar made a bomb threat against an El-Al flight to Israel that sparked fighter jets to be scrambled, and threatened a Canadian airport, which required passengers to disembark in emergency slides and left six people injured. 

&gt; Reports in the Israeli media have alleged Kadar took payments for some of the bomb threats from students who wanted exams postponed. He reportedly had almost $500,000 in his bitcoin account at the time of his arrest.

&gt; The indictment said he posted set fees for calls to police stations, schools or airports.

Your bank will (is required to, by law) release the funds to you within a short timeframe after you present the check, on the basis that you are responsible to your bank if you present a bad check and can therefore be trusted not to do so. Validating the check normally takes longer, often weeks.

The check will be a bad check, and will bounce. However, you will have been asked to move the money out of your account, and to send it onwards by wire transfer to someone else, where it will likely either be withdrawn as cash or sent onwards via bitcoin or Western Union. That money will be gone, more or less unrecoverably, and when the check bounces, you will also owe your bank all of the money back again.

dgy1j13,Nooku,80,"Satoshi Nakamoto was discussing the details of Smart Contracts with Mike Hearn and how to implement them in the future on the Bitcoin Protocol, **in 2010**

It's todays Bitcoin community that has abandoned the ""Bitcoin as Programmable Money"" that Satoshi was building. 

What I've been noticing lately ( in the past year) is that the Bitcoin community is losing / rewriting this history. Todays Bitcoiners are claiming that Bitcoin is only supposed to be a currency. No. It's only **since 2014** that this whole ""Bitcoin is supposed to be only a currency"" mantra was started, by Blockstream, Theymos, and co. 

It hasn't always been like that. It's just what the later generations have turned it into. 

So they can laugh at this as much as they want, but they don't know why Bitcoin got so popular from 2010 through 2013. It was the Programmable Money proposition that made us promote Bitcoin so hard back in those days. But then **it got bought** by investors who could only understand the currency explanation and they've turned it into a religion, where it's only about the currency. 


Don't forget that Ethereum was invented by people who grew tired of the fact Bitcoin turned into a currency maximalism path. Ethereum would've never been invented if the Bitcoin protocol had stuck to its Programmable Money path as Satoshi Nakamoto had started building.

This is also why Ethereum wasn't (and still isn't) being promoted as a currency officially by the developers, because we don't want to have the same thing happen all over again.

And if we go with his plan and switch to emergent consensus (BU) and fully scale on-chain (which is impossible, but let’s assume it isn’t) we will indeed be left with only a few full nodes.


At that stage the government can simply ban Bitcoin. There will be no nodes running behind TOR, so it will be very easy to discover who is running those 12 nodes by just looking at the IP address.


Having centralized mining isn’t ideal and with bigger blocks the mining centralization will become even worse leading to more and more governance issues. But all of that is sort of manageable, because miners can’t change anything as long as the community doesn’t support it. But when we only have 12 nodes there no longer is a community.

dgxrnw3,ethereumcpw,41,"Bitcoin has almost no utility other than being digital gold.  But I think it will retain that advantage because it is so resitant to change.

And despite declining in relative importance, dIgital gold is a perfectly valid use case and a valuable one at that.  

Ether, on the other hand, will/should have a lot of utility over time.  It can't be rigid now because in order for it to accommodate all the different use cases, it needs to handle scale.  And that means changes to the protocol and, in turn, that means it doesn't satisfy those same rigiditly conditions that digital gold investors require.
