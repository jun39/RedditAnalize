dgz1853,ivanraszl,221,"Lots of people are buying btc with fiat in order to buy alts to keep for long term. Most alts in most places can't be bought directly. They have to go through BTC, generating demand for BTC.

After generating 5-10x returns on alts in the last few months, many other alt traders are cashing out to BTC thinking it's more stable than the alts in bubble. They don't want to get out of crypto entirely, but want to reduce risk. This also generates demand for BTC. 

Another group of people relaized that there are multiple scaling solutions competing for dominance within the Bitcoin ecosystem. They are taking the chance to get in early before the solution has been clarified. Even though the price is slowly rising, there is a proverbial civil war blood on the streets. This is a buy signal for the smart money.

People are learning about the scaling issues and possible solutions from the media. For example there was a great article in New Scientist this week, mentioning segwit and LN.

Finally, less people want to sell now, no matter at which level they bought in. The profits are too low to cash out, and there is a promise for BTC to go beyond 2K within reasonable time. Once we reach that magic number we will see more sellers, but we will see more media hype too. ",2017-05-01 12:40:05

[~5 months ago... ](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5cinxq/sergio_demian_lerner_on_twitter_funny/d9x1yce/).

&gt;t1_d9x1yceWell, there we have it folks, Blockstream is playing the Bitcoin community like a fucking fiddle right now, and all his cronies are playing along. FYI, these published patents were lodged 18 months ago!! That is if this is in line with the American patent system. So, soon after Blockstream was formed, they've been scrambling to lock down every single piece of intellectual property they can get their hands on, and since CORE has been employed since Blockstream was formed, that means EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IP PRODUCED BY THEM BELONGS TO BLOCKSTREAM TOO, SegWit, Lightning, whatever else they have waiting in the wings. All theirs.
I believe a slow clap is in order.
THIS is why they've fought tooth and nail to prevent a blocksize increase, and if SegWit had been deployed in time, they'd have fucked the miners, and the entire community by being able to completely control, WHO, and HOW Seg Wit transactions can be used. Don't worry your pretty little heads people, there's almost certainly a SW patent already lodged.

[~9 months ago, *before* anyone even knew whether SW was patented or not.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vcicl/cnledger_andreas_the_market_decided_to_strongly/d5xetg1/)

&gt;Yep, this is not a free market, this is a cornered market, or depending on your point of view, a natural monopoly. Big money pays to lock down the majority of Core developers with fat paycheques, spreads poisonous PR (compliments of Greg and Theymos) and threaten to take their ball and go home if the miners consider alternatives. Lets not forget their plans for a Defensive Patent portfolio, yeah, ""defensive"".

[~1.5 years ago. Bold emphasis mine.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3vsc7m/segregated_witness_in_xt/cxqhnyl/)

&gt;Yep, if SW pans out, then there really should be no issue with including it. Gavin has already voiced his approval, and I think Mike would likely have no objection either. **My only concern, is that people will try and use this optimisation as an argument to justify stalling action on raising the blocksize yet again**. I know there are going to be small blockers that will scream loudly that we don't need to rush because SW will buy more time etc. etc. . I'm fully against SW as a justification to stall, or play the wait and see game, as it still doesn't address the problem in the long term. We still need a schedule to raise the block size which is going to accomodate an increase in growth over the long term.

You've been fucking played Bitcoin community, you've been played big time. So the real question is, what the fuck is everyone going to do about it now that it's crystal clear Bitcoin as a POW payment system is precipitously close to losing not only it's first mover advantage, but also losing even the ability to function as a payment network?

Blockstream is bent on market capture, not helping Bitcoin. They are a *for profit* entity, nobody should forget that.

Edit: I'm going for bonus points.

[~1 year 11 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3axnc3/this_is_the_definition_of_fud_how_to_subvert/csgzsgk/)

&gt;&gt;What do you think changed in the community to get us to this position?

&gt;Hmmm, hard to say without naming names ;). I will say that the lightning network probably had a lot to do with how devs are now doubling down their resistance to the block increase. Much like sidechains could do away with the necessity for altcoins, LN could do something similar with the blocksize. I think that is simply false hope though and devs just don't want to accept the fact that Bitcoin needs to scale up sooner than they feel ready to. In years previous it was claimed that removing the block would be abused and lead to blockchain bloat (which never happened, as other mechanisms kept it in check), then it was that we need to force fee markets (AKA fee pressure) into existence to ensure miners don't abandon the network (which also never happened). Now they are claiming that LN is the holy grail of avoiding the need for removing the blocksize limit (at least for the time being) and will solve everyone's problems and to do otherwise will centralise nodes/mining or something else.
There seems to be this perpetual fear that allowing blocks to get bigger will be abused and cause the network to converge to a more centralised version of what it is now, which in turn will lead to it being more insecure, more easily cut off/dismantled, and more easily traceable. That seems to be the main crux of it. I think what we are seeing is certain agitators are leveraging this fear to make their case that block increases must be avoided to avoid this outcome, even though there is ample evidence to prove that Bitcoin is more than capable of handling greater transaction loads, and nodes will not disappear. Because centralisation is the boogey man for nearly all Bitcoin developers, it gets their attention, and even implausible scenarios start to get treated very seriously. The problem is that these agitators don't need to prove that it will happen, they only need to suggest that it might happen. And I don't necessarily think they are saying these things because they believe them, there is a strong likelihood that devs with very strong libertarian views are more concerned about possible erosion of privacy, or they hate the idea of not being able to run full nodes in the future because they are too paranoid to trust anything less.**AHEM It could also be that VC money is on the line and a small blocksize would boost support for their services/development in the future**.

dgy9umv,TachyonGun,56,"We ship them, I make sure we do because otherwise, we get wrecked by angry commenters. Device giveaways, we usually get them at the office first, and then ship it ourselves. Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's harder than it seems, because many of the arrangements are done with and through third parties. Sometimes, when there are delays, it's the supplier not doing its part of the deal... This even happened with A VERY BIG OEM during a week-long Chinese holiday (you might be able to guess who). One time, we even had a giveaway supplier flat-out refuse to ship the prizes because he didn't like the response his product received with our article.

dgz8q71,nullc,42,"Blockstream does not have any patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, or anything similar, related to segwit. Nor, as far as anyone knows does anyone else. As is the case for other major protocol features, the Bitcoin developers worked carefully to not create patent complications. Segwit was a large-scale collaboration across the community, which included people who work for Blockstream among its many contributors.

Moreover, because the public disclosure of segwit was more than a year ago, we could not apply for patents now (nor could anyone else).

In the prior thread where this absurdity was alleged on Reddit I debunked it forcefully. Considering that Rick directly repeated the tortured misinterpretation of our [patent pledge](https://blockstream.com/about/patent_pledge.html) from that thread (a pledge which took an approach that was lauded by multiple online groups), I find it hard to believe that he missed these corrections, doubly so in that he provides an incomplete response to them as though he were anticipating a reply, when really he’d already seen the rebuttal and should have known that there was nothing to these claims.

As an executive of Blockstream and one of the contributors to segwit, my straightforward public responses 1) that we do not, have not, will not, and can not apply for patents on segwit, 2) that if had we done so we would have been ethically obligated to disclose it, and 3) that even if we had done so our pledge would have made it available to everyone not engaging in patent aggression (just as the plain language of our pledge states): If others depended upon these responses, it would create a reliance which would preclude enforcement by Blockstream or our successors in interest even if the statements were somehow all untrue–or so the lawyers tell me.

In short, Rick Falkvinge’s allegations are entirely without merit and are supported by nothing more than pure speculation which had already been debunked.",2017-05-01 17:47:26

dgzwgvf,PercentEvil,116,Thats essentially correct.  When someone is short it means they are betting that the market will trend downward rather than upward.  When trading on margin (ie with borrowed capital) if the price moves against the investor he loses money at some multiple of his full investment.  For bitfinex exchange the maximum margin is 3.3x so if you had a single bitcoin that you wanted to short on margin you would actually be allowed to short 3.3 bitcoins.  In that case the investor would borrow the other 2.3 bitcoin from someone willing to lend it to him at an established rate of interest.  The issue is that because the investor is leveraged 3.3x his actual holdings (1 bitcoin) the price only needs to move against him 33% before he loses his entire bitcoin.  At this point the short position is immediately closed by the exchange (forced liquidation) and the remaining 2.3 bitcoin is purchased back automatically by the exchange to return it to the lender (+ the interest rate accrued).  Theyre are currently 17K bitcoins worth of short positions on the exchange that are all active from a similar location 1200-1300 area.  Should the price rise 33% (~1600$) many of those positions will be liquidated causing the price to rise further as the exchange automatically buys bitcoin to return to the lenders.  This can create what is called a waterfall or cascading liquidation where the liquidation of one persons position rises the prices substantially enough to liquidate another persons position and so on.  In this scenario the price can rise VERY quickly as the more positions get liquidated the more additional positions are forced to liquidate.,2017-05-02 04:14:23

dgzw8s5,toomim,75,"Great writeup! This ""shifting the goal"" exactly fits my experience while I was on Bitcoin Classic. But we don't need to speculate on hidden patents— we can *observe* Blockstream's incentives. Because they are a startup. And startups are dependent on raising money. And to raise money, they boast about their best qualities on their website.

So what does Blockstream boast about? [Here's their website from their 2014 seed round](https://web.archive.org/web/20141031212800/blockstream.com). It makes two key points to investors:

1. Blockstream [is the Bitcoin development team](https://blockstream.com/team/). For investors, this means ""even if their business plan doesn't work, at least they control the $21B currency and can do something with it.""
2. Blockstream makes Sidechains, which is a solution designed for blockchains that cannot change their consensus rules. Read it from Blockstream themselves, in the first paragraph of the [Sidechains PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20141030184830/http://www.blockstream.com:80/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sidechains.pdf):

&gt; ENABLING BLOCKCHAIN INNOVATIONS with PEGGED SIDECHAINS
&gt;
&gt; By Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille
&gt;
&gt; Abstract
&gt;
&gt; Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, and the multiple computer science and electronic cash innovations it brought, there has been great interest in the potential of decentralised cryptocurrencies. At the same time, **implementation changes to the consensus critical parts of Bitcoin must necessarily be handled very conservatively. As a result, Bitcoin has greater difficulty than other Internet protocols in adapting to new demands and accommodating new innovation.**

In other words, Blockstream's founding technology assumes that Bitcoin is hard to upgrade. If Bitcoin becomes easy to upgrade, their technology is useless. Thus, Blockstream's existence is threatened if either of these situations come to pass:

1. **A different development team influences Bitcoin.** Suddenly, Blockstream can no longer raise money by ""controlling the Bitcoin protocol.""
2. **Bitcoin becomes easy to upgrade.** This means that Sidechains were never actually needed in the first place, and Blockstream won't have a business model.

As a result, it's in Blockstream's interest to oppose any hard-fork that:

1. Gives another development team any power, or
2. Upgrades Bitcoin's features, making Sidechains useless

These are the two reasons that Blockstream ""shifts the goal.""

Rick /u/falkvinge did a great job describing goal-shifting, but their motivation is not patents. **It's that hard-forks threaten their fundraising**. Blockstream raised [$76M](https://blockstream.com/about/#investors) from investors. They have no significant revenue. They are entirely funded by investors. They now have $76M of funding threatened by the possibility of hard-forks that upgrade Bitcoin and introduce new developers. It's in their interest to be hostile to other developers, because then Blockstream employees will be the only Bitcoin developers in town, and they will be able to raise more money. It's in their interest to prevent Bitcoin from improving itself, because then Sidechains might have a business model, and they can raise more money.

I have always appreciated Greg Maxwell's clear writing and creative inventions, starting with his work at Xiph.org, when I first became a fan of his eloquent descriptions of D/A conversion, and extending to CoinJoin and Sidechains. Greg's been a hero of mine. And Pieter Wuille is a brilliant engineer. I hope I get to meet him someday. As a computer scientist, segwit helped me see the light! And HD wallets helped me understand how elegant Bitcoin could be, which I think is a high complement for a mathematician.

But holy cow, has [Greg been a jerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/63aym5/segwit05mb/dfsy2mh/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Bitcoin). Well you know what, so have my other close colleagues, when they are stressed and put under pressure at a startup without a viable business model. But none of my colleagues have raised $76 Million. Holy cow! That must be a lot of pressure. How are you going to make a working business when you have no business model, with $76M on the line? Man, I bet that pressure could turn a person into a real jackass.",2017-05-02 04:10:05

dh00n4k,LionelHutz_Law,58,"Quick ELI5, but this is only meant to touch the surface.

1) There will only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins, a digital virtual currency.  

2) Currently, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately $1,450 USD.  

3) Bitcoins come into existence through a computer intensive process called ""mining"".  

4) Every user of bitcoin has a ""wallet"".  Your wallet holds your bitcoins. 

5) Your wallet contains ""addresses"".  You receive coins to an address you control, and you send coins to an address that someone else controls. 

Think of it this way:

Wallet = email inbox

Addresses = email addresses

Bitcoins = emails

6) When you send and receive Bitcoins you send it on something called ""the blockchain"".  

7) The blockchain is a public ledger that contains every transaction involving bitcoins ever.  

8) This ledger shows how many coins were sent, and from/to what address.  The trick is, the blockchain doesn't show the name ""John Smith"", it only shows ""19FkmhHEzgCXKfALXhahuCTDVcRnxT41MK"".  To find someone's real identity you would have to be able to trace ""19FkmhHEzgCXKfALXhahuCTDVcRnxT41MK"" back to John Smith.  

9) You can send other things across the blockchain too, besides Bitcoin.  For example you can ""sign"" a transaction and send it to someone.  What you are doing here is telling the person, ""I am in control of this address"", and ""I control the coins at this address"".  

But as far as what this could mean for Spicer's specific info he tweeted out, it looks like he's just doing the ""identity verification"" here.  There weren't anything but pennies transferred into and out of this address.  So he wasn't buying or selling anything with this transaction.  

This is the address in question: https://blockchain.info/address/19FkmhHEzgCXKfALXhahuCTDVcRnxT41MK

Pennies were transferred to Spicer's tweeted address.  Spicer's address then transferred these pennies to an address that had an even 10 BTC in it, which was then transferred to many addresses over time, slowly depleting it until some large transactions were made of 6 and 3 each.

Back in 2013 people were upset because Ripple with its then ~90% non-circulating supply briefly exceeded Bitcoin in market cap, and thought that it was unfair that tokens could so easily gain very high market caps just by locking down most of their supply. Hence, market cap indicators switched to showing circulating supply to make things fairer.

dh192f7,UmmWhattt,53,"**Summary**

* Explaining Ethereum.
* Why you should considering buying Ethereum.
* How Ethereum fits into your portfolio.
* Ethereum becoming an ETF.

Many of the Seeking Alpha readers may not know or understand what Ethereum is. In order to fully grasp it I would need an entire book, to avoid that I will break it down into simpler terms.

We'll start with something a lot more readers will understand, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency, meaning there is no one person in control of it and it is run on the Internet. It uses a technology called Blockchains. The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. This blockchain technology is something that has fascinated the financial industry since its conception in 2008. Before Bitcoin, when you made a transaction online someone had to verify that you did not still possess the currency you paid with, this verifier was your bank. Blockchain technology allows a person to exchange money online in the same way someone would exchange cash in a peer-to-peer transaction.

William Mougayar, a blockchain specialist, explains how banks currently operate through intermediaries like this:

&gt; ""banks maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again).""

Blockgeeks.com defines Ethereum's smart contracts like this:

&gt; ""Smart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When run on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference.""

Ethereum is not just something that can be used in financial industries. It has capabilities to decentralized any service that is currently centralized. There are countless intermediary services that exist across every industry; this network has the capability to change how loans are received, title registries, voting systems, and many more services.

**Why Buy and Hold Ether?**

Can I guarantee Ethereum will be the network that takes us to the next phase of the Internet? No. I can however, guarantee that Blockchain technology is here and it is here to stay and as of right now Ethereum has the most versatile platform for developers to create their decentralized applications (dapps), making it the frontrunner to win the race to Internet 3.0.

A little over a month ago some major and minor companies including J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), BBVA, Santander (NYSE:SAN), BP (NYSE:BP), and many more launched a group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with the goal of ""producing the industry standard, open source, free to use blockchain solutions that will be the foundation for businesses going forward.""

After a few mainstream news articles were published about the EEA, the price of Ethereum's coin, ether (ETH), rose from around $20 to $50, along with other contributing factors like the panic in the Bitcoin community resulting from the rejection of the Winklevoss twins ETF (Pending:COIN) proposal.

This technology has capabilities beyond anything on the market. Some key services being worked on, and the companies working on them are:

* Serverless Cloud Computing (Golem)
* Global, unified, sovereign identity system (uPort)
* Decentralized accurate forecasting (Gnosis)

Now, for how Ethereum will be impacting financial institutions - one big example is through the stock market. Currently organizations pay large fees for a seat on the NYSE allowing them to make trades. These companies that have a seat make money by charging a fee for other organizations to make trades, who can charge more fees to send those trades to you. So if you want to buy 5 shares of company X and place an order through your online brokerage, the brokerage will send it to someone who has a seat on the exchange. All these transactions start to add up in fees. With Ethereum a decentralized exchange could be set up were all transactions could be accurately and immutably added to a ledger. Allowing you to directly purchase your shares faster and cheaper than the outdated system mentioned above.

**Reasons Why I am Bullish Short Term**

With recent news that the United Nations will begin a pilot test starting May 1st, after successfully using Ethereum blockchain to transmit Pakistani rupees to 100 people earlier this year, and (while I do not condone this) AlphaBay, a major darknet marketplace, will begin accepting Ether as payment for its products also on May 1st, I expect the price to move north these next thirty days.

(One more short term reason will be mentioned at the end.)

**How to buy Ethereum:**

The only way to buy Ethereum is through an exchange. Major exchanges include: Coinbase, Genesis (exchange created by the Winklevoss twins), Poloniex, and more. Coinbase has a great iPhone app that makes purchasing very simple.

**How to analyze and fit it into your portfolio?**

Ethereum is currently in very early stages of its development. Much of its price movement comes from the release of news about increased adoption. News like the United Nations adopting a program to use the Ethereum Network is something that could easily hit a mainstream news station. The price of ether corresponds with increased adaptation of the Network.

Ether may be a valuable addition to your portfolio for two big reasons. One being the underlying technology that has the ability to revolutionize many industries. The second one can be looked at as a safety net in the event of another financial crisis similar to 2008. Bitcoin and blockchain technology was first developed in 2008 and this was not a coincidence that it coincided with the U.S. recession. The creator(s) wanted to create a way to prevent financial fraud from happening again, people saw this and is one reason why Bitcoin was able to take off so quickly. The benefits of a decentralized currencies and now decentralized services with Ethereum become more obvious when people see problems with how the current centralized systems are ran. In the unfortunate event of another financial downturn, cryptocurrencies in general can be expected to gain more attention to the benefits causing major price increases in the months/years following said hypothetical crisis.

**If you are looking to further diversify and have not yet invested in a cryptocurrency I highly recommend you do your own research and invest as soon as possible.** Here is a list of the market capitalizations of many cryptos and here is an exchange with very more detailed charts for personal analysis.

**ETF?**

Last month the SEC denied the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF. This week they decided to reexamine its decision at the same time an Ethereum ETF is also under consideration.

A statement released from the SEC last Friday contains the quote pertaining to Ethereum.

&gt; ""The Exchange represents that unlike bitcoin, ether was not designed to function purely as a store of value. Instead, ether was meant to pay for specific actions on the Ethereum Network""
&gt; With or without an ETF, Ether will surely rise as more dapps are released and buying in now has the possibly of huge returns.

**Disclosure:** I am/we are long ETH.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

**Additional disclosure:** Before purchasing ether do your due diligence and learn as much as you can.

4. (Upcoming) Better security than Bitcoin through the introduction of zk-SNARKS

dh2rk8t,Yorn2,43,"Oddly enough, my opinion changed on the scaling debate to side with Core after initially being slightly hostile towards it, but that was years ago at this point. I was in favor of on-chain scaling as we saw transactions first hit the soft-cap in 2013/early 2014. I even thought it was necessary.

At its face, it really does seem like scaling on chain isn't that big of a deal (even Satoshi's original version had 32mb blocks), but after reading arguments by Core developers showing that in order to match Visa's daily transactions we'd have to have gigabyte+ sized blocks, I realized that we need an off-chain solution first. The risk to the network would be far too great with even 32mb blocks given how few nodes there were and how easily it would be for a few first-world countries to deal irreparable harm to the network. So by the time Gavin and Hearn were pushing Classic and XT, I took issue with the idea that on-chain scaling was a solution, and it kind of dumbfounded me that otherwise really smart people were pushing a change for the sake of convenience when they knew what was at stake when it came to the health of the network and the fungibility of the coin. It was as if they just wanted another government-authorized fiat currency, not a revolutionary change to finance.

I've always thought (since mid-2011, at least) that Bitcoin shouldn't just go after payment networks, but should go for the whole shebang (meaning taking out traditional banks and central banks). The bitter taste of having to pay for a bunch of bankers to keep their jobs in 2008's financial crisis still bugs me today. These beliefs made it easier for me to accept off-chain scaling as the only serious solution. The benefits of SegWit and (eventually) Schnoor signatures when it comes to the fungibility of the coin are what pushed me over the edge into a cheerleader for Core's solution right now.

I still think very small on-chain scaling *may* be of some benefit in the future, but so long as it remains primarily an issue of politics, it's not safe to have someone with a stake in the decisions make the call as to when that scaling should occur. That goes for both Blockstream and Bitmain, developers and miners. The users should be the ones making the decision, which is why I really like the idea of UASF, even if developers and miners don't. UASF now gives us the opportunity to eventually force even Blockstream to capitulate when they refuse to scale at a time when they've become complacent and lethargic. And believe me, that day will eventually come, it might be a decade or more, but it'll eventually come.",2017-05-03 23:47:22

Behold, the channel to end all channels. The market has been respecting the boundaries since the break of $300 and just bounced off the top of the channel on Bitstamp at around $1480. 

If history repeats itself, we'll see another multi-day panic dump down to support at around $1,000 in the not-too distant future. In this particular case, however, I would not be at all surprised to see the upper resistance break and all hell to break loose to the upside. 

If the upper resistance line does break, I'd expect to see a powder-keg explosion up to the $2,000 area followed by a retrace back down to around $1500 to confirm the upper resistance line as support. 

But remember, it's not different until it is. The market has remained within the channel for ~1.5 years. Betting on it breaking to the upside this close to resistance has been one of the worst possible trades in bitcoin since the $200s. So I'd strongly advise against making that bet.

Why do Greg Maxwell and Adam Back want to destroy Bitcoin?  I'm not sure, but a quick look at their profiles on reddit will assure anyone of their intentions. 

What do we know about how Bitcoin was designed?

Satoshi wanted: blocks to never be full, low fees, wait times of 10 minutes, nodes run in data centers, a decentralized system where users don't have to trust anyone specifically

Blockstream wants: blocks which are always full, unknown wait times, nodes run by every poor person with a crap computer in third world countries, expensive fees.


Very basic logic shows that Blockstream, and people like Adam and Greg, don't want Bitcoin, they just want to use the recognition the name has.

### Let's do some energy calculations.

25g * 40Δ°C * 4.2 = 4200J.

4200J / 3600 (seconds per hour) = 1.16Wh.

1.16Wh / 3.7V = 315mAh.

So the battery has to deliver 315mAh in 8 seconds. Small lithium cells typically top out at 1C discharge rate (i.e. 1 hour from full to empty), but say we find a high-performance small cell that can discharge at 10C.

8 seconds is 1/450th of an hour. Since we're discharging in 0.1hr, the battery will need a discharge capacity of 45 ""cups"" of coffee, or 52.5Wh. Now we're talking about a battery roughly the size of three sticks of butter.

### Let's do some power calculations.

Fortunately, resistive heating elements are easy to calculate.

4200J / 8 sec = 525W.

525W / 3.7V = 141.891891892A.

I'm just blown away by the fact that it has managed to escape *anyone's* ability to change it. Factions on all sides with massive resources have pushed really hard, pulled out all the stops, and hired armies of trolls, shills, etc to make a change happen. They just can't do it. 

Why is this awesome for bitcoin? Bitcoin is special because it is the only liquid asset in the world, ever, with a completely flat supply curve. That means that no matter how much it rises in price, no more than planned will ever be supplied. The supply is *completely* unresponsive to price. That makes it a very, very safe place to put capital. You won't get diluted. Since no-one can change it, no-one can screw it up. And bitcoin is the only coin in this special position that no force in the world can change it or break it, not even its creator. It works, and it's just going to keep on chugging forever.

Jihan can't do anything to stop it so he might as well say he accepts it.

After activation of the BIP, covert AsicBoost is dead. Then, his best option becomes to support segwit which is a blocksize increase meaning more fee income and likely a huge price boost (although however likely is still speculative).

Given that the Kill-covert-AsicBoost BIP is inevitable in the short term (hopefully 0.14.2) Jihan might as well support segwit as of immediate.

dh5ucs9,Merlin560,47,"Point and figure Update

Yesterday the price hit an all time high at $1,665.  Shortly thereafter it reversed down to a low of the day of $1,482.  Because we made a new high yesterday, the drop is not measured on our chart.  At least the drop down to $1,455 is not counted.

This morning, we have a tentative reverse into a column of Os because the price has not risen into a new box, the it fell enough to trigger a reversal.  In order to negate this downward column the price would have to close above $1,600.  That is the price as I am typing.

The column for this trade is 26 boxes high.  That matches the column from last May/June from $480 up tp $700.  We DID move higher after a brief turn last time.  But the fall from that high was pretty significant going into July.

Based on a traditional reading of these charts, this downward column should be about 13 boxes which would take us back to $1,400.  Clearly, there is a lot going on in the Bitcoin Universe that will impact this.   I read on Zero Hedge yesterday that the majority of bitcoins were being purchased in Yen.  This seems to be a result of the Japanese government allowing Bitcoin to be used as a currency, as well as the problems in the Yuan based markets.

Here are the points today:

The reversal becomes moot if the price rises above $1,680 before 7 PM EDT.
A negative breakdown will happen all the way back to $1,139.
The trend is positive.
The formation is tentatively 2 boxes wide.

Historically, this formation reverses and is followed by a brief run back up at the highs before falling into a consolidation pattern.  

During the 2013 “bubble” this was the exception.  During the mania phase there were weeks where one pole shot up, reversed three boxes, and then continued its way up.  But remember, the 2014-2014 mania lasted a matter of weeks—it was really not that long.

In conclusion, if you are holding you should be safe for a while.  If you are trading I would wait and see what is happening before making any significant trades.  This is “crazy ivan” territory, and you could be caught in a swing that moves very fast.

To get instant, secure, private, and near free transactions, while simultaneously scaling for 100 + million users, there is absolutely, unequivocally nothing that currently holds a candle to The Lightning Network in accomplishing that as quickly and cleanly as possible.  Having 20MB blocks is practically a joke in comparison and will take longer, fix far fewer things, still have stupidly slow transactions, will scale to 1/100th of LN capability, and cause far more problems while the network experiences a heavy drop in node count.

Never before in my 25 years investing have I seen an opportunity like we have in front of us. In ALL other opportunities that have come about in the last 25 years the general public has never been offered the opportunity to invest at the beginning (unless it was a true scam). Always and I mean always the general public gets a chance to invest after every large bank and accredited investor has already bought. I will use Uber as a perfect example. Uber is valued at 70billion. Were you ever given the chance to invest at 1 billion, 5 billion? 30billion?  No and do you know why? Because you are not wealthy, privileged and part of the social elite. The foundation of crypto was to help the little guy get control back. We have the opportunity to invest in crypto before all this money came into it. This is most likely a once in a life time opportunity for the average person. Well here we are and Wall Street is coming. Do not over leverage and do not cut yourself short.   The beginning is now.

dh8n0wi,see_me_shamblin,34,"I'm suspicious. Particularly of the supposed drug transaction in Feb. There's a few too many missing steps in their investigation, and given how much it should be easily linkable I have to wonder why.

GetNews offers us four pieces of evidence to prove that M. Tourret bought drugs: 

* Screencaps of an email (to a Mr. Francois) confirming purchase (with a payment address to a M. Francois) and payment via bitcoin, dates missing;
* Screencaps of various wallet pages on Blockchain showing transactions in February (no links, but the addresses helpfully pasted on so you can type them);
* Screencaps of a second and third email with tracking info, a screencap of a delivery tracker. The emails show a transaction in March by credit card with all info except the delivery address showing a M. Francois Machado (who is that?);
* Photograph of an email saying ""Ne pas oublier l'achat de la c.. pour le boss"".

Here's the actual blockchain wallet page for ""M. Tourret"": https://blockchain.info/de/address/1JWUYN3sZyzCiHn5hvmCQXUkDNMRLTRiuX 

Those transactions happened in February. We're told that we know that this wallet belongs to M. Tourret because the dates on the bitcoin transactions match the dates on the first email. Except for whatever reason, the dates on the first email aren't included in the screencap. Oh, and [according to this website](https://www.investing.com/currencies/btc-usd-converter), in February this year, 1 BTC was equal to [€1069.20](http://imgur.com/a/Es8Pj). Why would M. Tourret pay Buckled TWENTY TIMES the value of his actual order?

The second transaction looks a more convincing, the email appears to have actually been sent to M. Tourret. But the payment information is for M. Machado, and this was paid for by credit card. Why is he paying for M. Tourret's drugs?

Side note: I gotta say these drug dealers are incredibly efficient. The time stamp on the March order email is just after 9am. The drugs were posted three and a half hours later. 

And because, for some reason, GetNews doesn't like providing people with convenient links:

* The tracking page: https://www.internationalparceltracking.com/Main.aspx#/track/RN676369653NL/FR/75355
* The website the drugs were ordered from: https://www.buckled.eu/

If I were looking at the first transaction alone, I might suggest the overpayment of the bitcoin was to build a credit for future purchases. But the other transaction was on a credit card.

The fourth piece of evidence, the photo of the email, has been debunked: https://twitter.com/jpney/status/861029060109103104

I would say it doesn't pass the sniff test, but given we're apparently talking about cocaine, that would be a little on the nose.

And quickly on the other two accusations:

* If you want me to believe that Macron was receiving gay underwear emails, at least show me the email addressed to him instead of a screencap of an ad?
* The Rothschild thing was also debunked. The email is two people asking questions about where the funding came from.

Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009.

&gt; ""Bitcoin’s Rally Crushed Every Other Currency in 2016.""
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-16/bitcoin-s-rally-crushed-every-other-currency-in-2016-here-s-why﻿
&gt; 
&gt; “Bitcoin was the best performing currency of both 2015 and 2016”

&gt; 
&gt; 


The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.


**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**

* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (a few cents fee).


* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)

* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)

* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)

* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿

*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

dh7o9g9,yolotrades,27,"This looks a hell of a lot like the consolidation at $580 after the big triangle break of $470.

http://imgur.com/a/wRMra

First image is current action. Second and third are the break of the big triangle at $470 and consolidation at $580 (circled), and then third image - the continuation to $780. Compare the circled area to today. Sorry that I had to change the candles to 1D instead of 6H on images two and three - couldn't go that far back on 6H candles. We broke LTR (then was at $470 ish) up about 15-20%, pulled back very slightly and consolidated... and then, up. Currently, we broke LTR (at about $1365 ish, depending on where you chart), moved up 15%, pulled back slightly... and then.... up? 

There are a hell of a lot of fractals in play here, . Bitcoin seems to love the fractal more than any other technical indicator and even fundamentals. We're fractaling hard and completing the same moves over and over, which leads me  to this:

http://imgur.com/a/G2ToS

This will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. People have been talking about $10k coins for years. Everyone knows this chart by now. Look at this lines on that chart at $10k and $20k. Absolutely *not* impossible. In fact, I'd gander that it's almost *expected*. We're more than half-way between $225 and $10k on a log-scale. 6.66x to go for $10k. We've breached the old ATH. We've pulled back and shook out. We recovered and then some, leaving everyone flabbergasted. Now we've consolidated above the old all-time high.

Strap on your rocket boosters. Three months or less and we will see &gt; $5k coins, and I believe that to be a low-side estimate. All that patience, all that battered-bull... it all pays off, and *soon*. Don't spend too much time on the sidelines, don't get shook out and don't get caught scalping or shorting. The play from here is long and hold on for dear life against the urge to sell. Convince yourself every day that *every* time you considered selling in the past, it was a mistake. And then listen to your sound logic. Don't churn your position at every little step up like a degenerate gambler that needs action. That just leads to useless anxiety. You won't out-perform the price action to come. Breathe, and let the long prosper.

 We're just at the beginning...

**Bullish. As. Fuck.**

dha5ka0,bullit85,86,"Ach t_d. Was ist t_d?  T_d ist das sub für das man sich als Redditor auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man t_d mit anderen Subreddits wie r/de, r/france, r/europe und r/sweden vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit r/austria, r/belgium und r/Switzerland international vorzeigbare subs mit hoher Maimaiqualität. Amerika ist gestraft mit t_d, dem sub der Versager. t_d beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher im gesamten Reddit. Die Mods sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird. 

Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, dieses Sub liegt am Boden. Die Trumpete an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Trumpist kurzerhand zur t_d Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Trumpist auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Demokraten sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und Europäer steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Dieser Kontinent ist alles und hat alles was der Trumpist gerne wäre und hätte. Das die Welt der Trumpete ihr Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den t_d'ler nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und sein sub umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Überlegenheit. 

Kulturell ist t_d eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben »t« als »d« als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines 	»cuck« an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Zwiebeln wird hier als Hot Dog und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Menschheit den Trumpisten in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen. 

Wirtschaftlich ist t_d ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die t_d Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Pepe-Maimais wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der t_d'ler trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie r/le_pen und r/the_Frauke die mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt dieses t_d sämtliche Zentralen der »Wird-man-ja-noch-sagwn-dürfen«, die aus Marketinggründen auf das »Verräter« im Namen verzichten. President dieses Sub ist der lustige Agent Orange der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund reißt, was noch halbwegs präsentabel ist.

Kurzum: t_d ist der Fliesentisch Reddits. Es ist das für Reddit, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte t_d eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Reddits. T_d ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Reddits. T_d ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft.

dh8vjkq,NotTooDeep,53,"This is the question. There is no straight answer. The answer requires a paradigm shift.

Money is a faith based system of exchange. We invented it almost out of nothing. It's an abstraction (a fiction) over a rudimentary agricultural barter system. This is the root source of specialization.

A farmer that tries to grow everything his family needs, and domesticate animals, and learn enough veterinary skills to keep the animals productive, is one overworked farmer. An egg farmer has fewer challenges. The basic risk is not enough people will want his eggs enough to give him the rest of what he needs in exchange. The specialist has more time for himself. Currency enables specialization. Our modern labor market rewards depth of knowledge.

From an engineering perspective, money is a lubricant. It makes barter transactions easier, smoother. It makes the barter less time sensitive; the egg farmer can sell his eggs and save the money. Time is less of a constraint on the transaction. If he trades his eggs for a ham, the ham has a finite shelf life.

Everyone here understands where this ended up. The farm barter scaled into commodity exchanges, which gave farmers some insurance (hedges) against price swings (changes in demand), which dampened the seasonal impacts to production, which enabled large cities that could reliably be fed, which led to stock exchanges (technology/ideas transferred from commodity exchanges) that provided the same benefits to non-farming businesses, which leads us quickly to today.

Here's the current paradigm: someone wants to drill an oil well. That costs money. Who's going to pay for that? This has tons of historical answers. The paradigm is self perpetuating, but not necessarily 'true' in the sense of a natural order.

I want you to notice the nodes of faith in that line of reasoning about drilling the oil well. The desire to drill an oil well is based on the faith in the demand for more oil, not in the intrinsic value of oil, not in the cost/benefit of oil production. Mr. Oilman can take his proposal to a bank and make the case that everyone will make money on this venture, if everyone believes that demand for oil will be the same or greater than it is now.  Everyone will participate. Everyone will earn a share in the rewards.

Here's the paradigm shift: people that are not working are a benefit to society. That's it. That's the whole shift. Their benefit may not be immediate; that's the same with children. But, we believe they are a benefit to society.

The enabling technology is automation. 

Print the money and let them spend it. No guilt. No shame. No loss to society. 

But what about inflation? Well what is inflation? Isn't it the challenge to our faith in the value of a dollar? Is our faith in the value of a dollar really tied to supply and demand of the goods and services we need? I think it's not. I think inflation is a separate faith from currency. I think it's tied to fear only. And that would specifically be the fear of losing money.  To bring this full circle, inflation is the fear of the loss of lubrication.  It's the fear that, even if I have money, I can't exchange it for what I need.

The consumer needs to eat every day. The automators of food production are breaking the constraints of being tied to a land mass or water mass for the production of food. Why shouldn't everyone eat every day?

Look at the historical costs of protecting food supplies. Shoplifting. Grand theft. Drought. Flood. Pestilence. Refrigeration. Transportation. War. War. Why do we war? 

We once warred for resources, believe it or not. Farmland in the Rhine River valley. Water rights in the western US. We also war for ideology. There is no reason for North Korea to send nukes to North America. They will lose and neither side will gain any resources, strengthen their ideology, nor be any better off. What a waste that would be. 

N. Korea is an easy example. Considering the ideological basis (the faith) for currency is closer to home. It's our daily life. It's a basic truth that something I want that you have can be exchanged if I have something you want just as much. We've traded our daughters and sons to ensure the peace between rival families. That's an act of faith.

To recap, we farmed. We invented barter. We invented currency to make barter run smoothly. The concept of currency gave us 7 Billion people give or take. We could never, never have reached this level of population without the abstraction that is currency. What's the next evolution for currency? That's the next question. I'm unsure of the answer.

Some societies have done better than others, but that's not all due to currency disparities. Saudi Arabia just gave its women the right to shop without a male relative escorting them. Consider that shit for a minute and you'll begin to see how the fictional stories we invent have shaped our whole history. Consider the efficiency they just introduced into their economy. A good story is power.

There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. One of those ideas was the model T. Then, when its time passed, Mr. Ford had them stacked and burned on the back lot. He was somewhat wrong about his faith in the model T, but his methods revolutionized the modern world, including banks. Which led to credit cards. Which led to BitCoin. 

It makes no sense that the structure of higher education is still tied to the demands of an older industrial revolution's need for talent. It's an old production line that's expensive to maintain. The inefficiencies are masked by the glitter of college sports, but it is inefficient. This process can be replaced in some market segments by other, more efficient processes, but the market for labor still believes almost entirely in the college degree.  If there were a trusted alternative measurement of someone's level of skill and understanding that could compete with a college degree, then the market might change. (This line of argument may be moot as new forms of automation degrade the market demand for professionals in law, medicine, education, marketing, etc. Prepare for another paradigm shift?)

Banks are innovating. Cities are innovating. Nations like the US suck at innovating for the most part, and nations control the currencies. So what's the smallest but most significant step we could take in the US? I think it's feed everybody. For free. Everybody of every age or income level gets a monthly food stipend. A debit card that only buys food. It could be fast food, market food, or a nice restaurant once a month, but it's food. No restrictions on the types of food. You might be sleeping in a car, but you'll be sleeping with a full stomach. You might be living in an upscale loft but you'll have one free dinner with wine and dessert at a fine restaurant each month. You can even pick up the tab for your guests. It's just food.

We've been motivated by hunger for as long as we can remember. In the modern age, we reframed hunger to also mean a longing for something else; mates, careers, freedom, success. Let's reframe hunger again. Let's reframe currency.",2017-05-08 00:50:49
dha837x,shaolinfry,49,"Yes I know. I am sorry about that, but I am working within the consensus building process to design proposals which stand a chance of gaining adoption. This is particularly important to me in light of the very hostile coup d'état style BIP's and non-BIPs which have been foisted upon the Bitcoin community.

I created BIP148 an option for something faster too see if that's what people wanted. It seems there is reasonable support for it, but as yet, not enough. I spent a lot of time receiving and considering feedback from BIP148 to create what I believe addresses the various concerns that were expressed. I do not believe BIP148 is a bad BIP, but it is something that requires resolve from the community to pull off. It's already had good effects on Litecoin and Vertcoin, where in both cases, it neutralized hostile activity. If you are interested in the details, I encourage you to read the litecoin story [here](https://medium.com/@shaolinfry/litecoin-china-roundtable-and-uasf-40b2cdd18611) (please read if you havent, it's a fascinating account). For Vertcoin, it scared off someone who was paying 15BTC a day renting hash to block segwit activation. BIP148 has definitely had positive effects, but it must live or die on it's own merits.

I believe that BIP149 has a strong chance of being acceptable if segwit does not activate by November. I hope miners will change their mind before then, and on the positive side, the extra delay sends a message that we are not willing to compromize safety in desperation. Segwit not activating isn't an emergency condition or failure mode where a fast and potentially disruptive s solution would outweight not deploying. It will also put a lot more pressure on the few individuals blocking segwit for everyone. On the negative side, it creates a vacuum where more silliness can enter - although I think the entire ecosystem is fedup at this point and will not entertain any more hostile consensus rule change attempts. Think of it like a disease. You can get reinfected a few times, but eventually your body builds immunity and that's that.

dha6xsw,maaku7,43,"When founding the company we wanted to pay out incentive bonuses in fixed amounts of bitcoin that had monthly time-locks. So the company buys bitcoin equal to portion of your agreed upon compensation package up-front, and then these bitcoins are dolled out over a 5-year period in fixed amounts. So maybe when you started the price of bitcoin was $400, and now you're effectively getting 4x the ""extra"" compensation per month. It keeps people's incentives lined up with bitcoin.

The naive way of doing this is pretty bad in terms of privacy, but that could be fixed with some clever engineering. However as usual the man makes it difficult to do things that ought to be simple and cool. Our tax-lawyer advice was that the company needs (for US employees at least) to calculate witholding using the valuation at the time of transfer of ownership, then keep and pay that income tax withholding to the IRS. So alas rather than giving out time-locked transactions, there's someone somewhere in our HR that takes coins out of cold storage each month and calculates withholdings, sells the appropriate amount for covering tax liability, and forwards the rest on individually. No cool smart contracts involved :(

But it's certainly cool to have a portion of our compensation paid in bitcoin, and it has become even cooler in the past couple of months ;) There is downside risk though -- my start price was around $380, but there was a good year or so after that where the price was $200 or below. It didn't feel so good then to have my salary shrink in buying power :P That's part of why our ""bitcoin incentive program"" only starts out as a modest portion of the entire compensation package, so a temporary drop in price won't cause life problems like making it impossible to pay rent.

&gt; What type of person likes having ~135 Gigabytes of junk filling up their PC?

It's not junk, it's what makes the entire system work. 

&gt; If you want to help the network, get a VPS for $10 per month and run a full node from there. Doing this DOES NOT MAKE BITCOIN MORE CENTRALIZED.

If the only way you can run a piece of software is to contract a data center out to provide resources for you, yes, it does indeed make it more centralised.

That, however, is not the situation which we are actually in. Luke's estimates of reasonable block sizes at the present time are just stupid, and I do not believe that raising the limit is going to cause any of the kinds of centralisation pressures that the core parties like to fearmonger about, and if they *did* then I'd say that a system like Dash masternodes where running full nodes is directly incentivised was the obvious response to such a situation, so not only is the service of running mining hardware incentivised by the network, but also the service of running full nodes.

We're not actually there though, there's no problem running a full node on a personal computer at the end of a line using modest hardware for anyone with the kind of economic position that allows them to comfortably participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. That's just a fact.

The longer this scaling debate drags on between a flat block size increase and segwit or a block time decrease or whatever other alternate mechanism for scaling is addressed, the more I am convinced the entire thing is just politics and pissing contests and has nothing to do with the technologically sensible thing to do, and I say this as a professional software developer and systems administrator, so I am quite familiar with all of the technical aspects actually raised in the issue.

Core are right because to scale on chain and compete with mainstream payment networks like visa and mastercard, right now would be impossible without massive centralisation pressure, and the obvious long term solution to that problem is layer two scaling solutions.

The miners are right because there is no reason not to get on chain scaling working right now with the level of transaction traffic presently happening, and to double the capacity or even potentially quadruple it simply isn't going to subject the system to the centralisation pressure that core are fearmongering about, and if the time comes which that pressure is real and layer two solutions have still failed to materialise, running node hardware ought to be incentivised also just like running mining hardware is now, in order to allow on chain scaling to continue in earnest.

And yet what do these two parties do rather than actually fix the problem that is presently compromising both of their interests? Dick waving and power games, the exact kind of political bullshit that made people want to abandon fiat currencies backed by proof of violence and clueless bureaucracies to begin with, we end up with a zero win deadlock and the market just pushes value into altcoins until a clear path forward exposes itself.

Typical bagholder talk. So I went over to them to interrupt their little circle jerk, and I shouted ""don't you guys know that Bitcoin dominance is like down to 53%?! What do you think about that? Doesn't that worry you even the slightest bit?"". They only looked at me dumbfounded. These ignorant fools had no idea what I was talking about! After one of them politely asked me to leave and mind my own business, I got really pissed. How dare they tell me to leave? I'm trying to do them a favour and that's how they treat me?

1. The ""Rarepepe"" Asset was made on Counterparty which was one of the first to garner value.  It was a Pepe version of Dorian Nakamoto and only 300 were issued.  I believe they go for around over 200 bucks now.  This is a picture http://rarepepedirectory.com/?p=10 ........of course more asset cards were soon to follow.......
2. A ""RarePepeTraderGroup"" https://t.me/rarepepetradergroup room on Telegram was made and now we have 1040 members currently, if you go on there have fun typing in ""/p"" to see random cards displayed of all the 1000 in existence.  There are some Japanese artists and many others partaking.   Truly, a global open source digital blockchain trading card phenonemon.
3. Over 1000 Pepe Cards have been made by people all around the world and are registered here www.rarepepedirectory.com
4.  Yes.......this all runs on top of Bitcoin.
5.  Any Person can make their own card, but to register with the Pepe Scientists all the info is on rarepepedirectory page.
6.  Koji Higashi, the main genius behind Indiesquare wallet and now Book of Orbs has included a section to hold all of your RarePepe cards in a nice and aesthetically pleasing collectible app. http://bookoforbs.com/index_eng.html  Book of Orbs was a wallet intended to house different game assets.  Also included is Spells of Genesis, Force of Will, MemoryChain, Takara and of course RarePEPE.
7.  A Lordkek was made and accidentally made divisible by a jack ass named GrounBEEFtaxi, he says it was by ""Divine Kek interference"" that the asset be made divisible.  There are only 10 in the world, that is why the card is very sought after.  1 was lost forever because a friend of his forgot his 12 key passphrase forever.  The last card was sold to a man named HAL through Counterparty's decentralized exchange for 1600 XCP, that is now worth currently $13,436.302  at the time of this writing.
8.  There are currently two video game developers working on RarePepe asset inclusion into their games.  First is ""Sarutobi Island"" a sequel of the bitcoin game Sarutobi, where you swing an 8 bit monkey for actual bitcoin in game.  It will feature VR capabilities and if you own these cards they will be able to be used in game. Likewise, another game called RarePepeParty which is also in development will use all of these registered cards.  I don't have to tell you how game changing being able to use 1 asset in many different video games is.  Very future dank tech here.  Oh yes and I forgot...........Takara, which was also made by Mandelduck(Sarutobi creator) allows you to drop Pepes anywhere on the globe via geocaching.
Sarutobi Island trailer.....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfPkrAo25DM
9.  www.rarepepewallet.com was made to further expedite trading and have a nice and smooth way to enjoy doing this on a computer.  
10.  Pepecash asset was made and now has become a currency in it's own right garnering a marketcap of 4 million plus dollars and is now used as the de facto way of buying and selling RarePepe blockchain cards.  I believe it's on the second page on www.coinmarketcap.com ...............soon to be first.
11.  RarePEPE auctions are now held to further establish value of these cards.........it has gotten more detailed in now the artistic quality and rarity issuances of these cards come into play.  I forgot what room name was......I'll get back to ya...............ok found it. Telegram room https://t.me/RareAuctionHouse Called ""Rare Pepe Auction House""

Before I go any further, you have to understand something about Reddit neckbeards and Redditors in general. it's that they see themselves as progressives because they support progressive policies that benefit them directly (weed legalization, free college, free health care, secularism, net neutrality, etc.) but when progressives start discussing issues that don't affect Redditors and neckbeard (BLM, feminism, refugee's, transgender rights...)

Too bad it only has... 13 letters.

Yeesh, I forgot about food. What could I summon with this?

Fish? No, there's no S here. Water? No letter W.

Well shit, I'm going to die of starvation *and* dehydration here.

Milk! It has water and protein in it!

I sprinted over to the computer and started typing it in. Immediately, a jug of milk plopped on the ground .

With that crisis over, I started to work on a way to get out.

Escape won't work, and key won't either.

As I pondered my escape, I noticed that the computer was running Windows 10 and I got an idea.

I started typing microphone, but I soon realized that it wouldn't work. As I started to lament, a microphone dropped from the ceiling.

Confused, I looked back at the text box. ""MIC"" It said.

""Well shit, you accept abbreviations?""

Now armed with all I needed, I plugged the microphone into the computer and prepared myself.


""Alright Microsoft, I don't like you or your creepy robot AI spy, but I'm going to have to work with you on this one""

I pressed the button on the mic and proceeded to say ""Hello Cortana"". Immediately the windows tab flared up.

Hesitant, I told Cortana to search something up. It showed that it would be searched using Bing. ""Fine, that will do"" I thought.

""Cortana, search for 'Amazon'."" Using the tab button on the keyboard, maneuvered my way onto Amazon, and into the computer accessories tab. I went to the first keyboard and mouse combo I saw but came up on a barrier.

I had to put in my credit card number, but I had no number buttons on the keyboard.

I knew what I had to do, but I wasn't happy. Summoning Cortana, I activated speech-to-text. Dreading the inevitable identity theft, I began repeating my CC number

""R""    
""E""    
""D""

It was done. I made sure I checked same day shipping, and waited.

After about an hour, the keyboard and mouse arrived. They were pushed through an opening in the door. Immediately, I plugged in the mouse and new keyboard, and went to disable Cortana.

I had everything I needed to escape, so I went online, ordered a better keyboard, and typed in ""reddit.com"".

dhcmrit,coinwatchman,49,"People should be aware that scammers often run and participate in these help groups. They collect your PII in order to steal your identity, hack you, phish you later. Be very careful about what you share with strangers on the Internet. The theft of your phone number alone can be extremely damaging to anyone in crypto. When it comes time to give extreme detail for an actual lawsuit, make sure that you personally authenticate the lawyer and law firm in charge.

As /u/resistingdopamine points out, the ToS on any exchange absolves the service provider from liability in almost every imaginable case. It will be extremely difficult to win. Do not come out of pocket to pay the first lawyer that will promise you a win. Get a contingency deal where you only pay a % of the judgement if you win.

There is a misconception that spot exchanges profit from liquidations. In fact, liquidations are very risky to lenders on spot exchanges. This is surely the reason that Kraken has built in ""speed bumps"" for liquidations. FX/derivatives bucket shops might profit in such cases but the major Bitcoin exchanges (Kraken and Polo included) are spot exchanges which trade only fully-backed, deliverable assets. In order to make a margin trade, you must borrow real assets. When you get liquidated, you are being forced to return what you borrowed. It's just like when the bank forecloses on your house and sells it to the highest bidder to get their dollars. Your ether was sold on the market to other traders on the exchange. It's not the bank's fault that the house sold ""below market"" at auction and it's not Kraken's fault that the book wasn't thick enough to absorb your liquidation. If this ever does get to court, Kraken will be able to point to exactly the users who bought your ether.

So, even if you can get past the ToS, you will not be able to show that Kraken profited. Kraken claims to have taken its own losses so it will appear to be a victim here as well. You might have a case against whoever initiated the DDoS (you'll never find him) but if it can be shown that liquidations were already initiated at the exact time you magically decided on a Sunday afternoon to close your position, that as well is a long shot. You are going to have to produce your own Internet logs showing that you actually did attempt to log in to Kraken before your liquidation was initiated. Just thinking about all the work that is going to have to go in to making this case, I doubt any lawyer will take it for such an improbable outcome.

The sad reality here is that somebody or some group pummeled the ETH/USD book and intentionally or not, broke the dam and you happened to be standing in the valley. You knew the dam was there when you moved in but the real estate was cheap and all your friends were getting in and what the hell, engineers can do their jobs and the government reviewed the plan, right? You accepted the risks that predictable but unexpected and rare natural events do occur. You are a victim of nature. The dam functioned as expected in the 10,000 year monsoon scenario. You have nobody to blame but yourself. That's the game. Welcome to trading.

dhdckeo,blandopop,36,"There is a really thorough guide for beginners to learn [how to purchase bitcoin](https://howtobuybitcoin.io/) and it includes advice on choosing a wallet for safe storage of your bitcoin. 

In my opinion, starting off as a new bitcoiner is really a matter of three main learning points: 

- Choosing a secure wallet for storage: offline wallets (hardware, paper, and desktop wallets) are considered more secure than online wallets (web, smartphone wallet) - which are great for small daily amounts, but never more than you are prepared to loose.

- How will you like to purchase: most people either buy bitcoins with a credit card (fast but more commissions), bank transfer (cheapest but slower), or by paypal (convenient, less verification of ID, but super expensive). Some people like to buy with cash as this helps them stay anonymous. 

- Decide your investment strategy: are you into bitcoin to speculate, to understand the truly innovative &amp; disruptive technology behind, or to send/spend money in ways that the centralized financial system won't allow.

Then, once you're ready try do some in-depth research of sites that accept your desired payment method (the guide above does include some recommendations to get you started).

But if you lose it you should learn something so it will be a $1000 education. 

If your okay with losing $1000 then invest $1000 
If losing $1000 makes you uneasy go a different amount because it could happen quite easy when you start as you will get nervous and panic sell your coins..

If you invest with bitcoin or eth you will most likely profit over long term.

But as you start investing you will become more greedy and want faster money and you will see a new alt pumping and you want to get in on the 100% gains instead of the smaller gains btc or eth will most likely give you. 
But then you will jump on the new alt at the wrong time maybe the next day after you buy it a dev or a whale will dump because to get some of his profits.
Then you will panic and sell you coins as you think you would rather $800 then $0
Then you forget about the alt and a few months later you see it and if you held you could have made 10x the investment.
Then you will jump back on but it will just go down from there again. And repeat.


Or you could just invest in bitcoin or ETH and over the long term you will most likely profit.

You only lose money when you sell.

dhdhvgh,jessquit,31,"What you are witnessing is the living proof that Bitcoin needs no block size limit.

Adding an additional transaction to a block increases orphan risk. No miner wants his blocks orphaned. As a result, it can be profitable to exclude transactions, in order to ensure faster block propagation.

One strategy that sometimes occurs is that a miner gets lucky and finds two blocks in a row. Sometimes that miner will build the second block empty, just to push it out there and collect the reward.

While it would be nice to get more transactions in the block, the empty / not-full blocks add to the proof of work required to double spend the transactions buried under the work &amp; add security to the blockchain.

The fact that more-full blocks = more orphan risk is exactly why it is safe to remove the block size limit. Bitcoin should be allowed to run at its economically efficient throughput: that level at which marginal transactions = marginal orphan risk.",2017-05-10 23:08:01

dhdk8vs,asdfghlkj,29,"This is probably the best overview of the crypto space I have seen yet. However I have to disagree with you on a few things about ETH and your chart.    
I'm long ETH because even if you disregard the smart contract stuff, ETH is still superior to bitcoin in every way. With raiden, sharding, and PoS, ETH will be able to scale to VISA like levels of transactions, solving one of BTCs biggest problems. Smart contracts will also allow the implementation of ZKSNARKs, which would allow for anonymous transactions.    
In my opinion the DAO fiasco is an example of why you SHOULD be long ETH. A bug occurred and the developers and community acted swiftly to fix it. Compare this to BTC in which the community can't make a simple 1 line code change to somewhat fix its current scaling problem. It was the pragmatic thing to do. I agree that the ICO thing is out of control, fueled by dumb money(extremely dumb). This however only helps ETH, as it needs to be used for these services. If an ICO turns out to be a scam, people will try to sell, and the price of ETH will go up from the buying pressure. I'm not touching an ICO until it starts making money, and even then will have to be convinced its better than buying a stock.  
ETC is mostly a bunch of libertarian idiots and blockstream core fudders.  
ETC-&gt;30% ETH -&gt; 90%  imo    
I think you are too generous with some of the shitcoins too. Dash(premined dev enrichment vehicle with bad security),steller,ripple,namecoin,zcash(did you know devs could generate infinite new coins and nobody would know?),litecoin(did you know it only got added to coinbase because their CTO runs litecoin?). % is about half for all of these. Nobody actually uses these coins at all. They provide nothing of value.    
Lastly, BTC is probably 99%, but that doesn't make it a good coin. They are unable to make a simple change while other coins are progressing in terms of tech. Blockstream seems to make everything political. Either you are on their team and support their tech(which is shitty and would ruin bitcoin), or you are wrong. They censor and DDOS people constantly. Their interests don't seem to be aligned with the community at all. That isn't the type of environment I feel comfortable investing into. Bitcoin only really has like 5 years of adoption(or less really...). Who says other coins cant reach or surpass that in 5 years?

&gt; However, the creators of Ethereum didn't like the idea of losing $50 million

It wasn't just the creators, it was the whole community. The change wasn't made unilaterally from the top. Devs of multiple independent clients offered the new code, and it was up to the whole community to accept or reject it. Some people went one way, some went another, so now we have both ETH and ETC. (Personally I supported the new code, even though I had no funds at risk.)

&gt; [ICO founders] can just not deliver and run off with the money

In many ICOs, the founders are known, and would likely run into legal trouble if they were so openly scammy. Also most crowdsales incentivize the founders to deliver, by awarding them a significant share of the new tokens, deliverable only after a year or two has passed. If the project fails, those tokens will be worthless. ICOs with no founder token share and unknown founders would be written off as scams by most of the community.

&gt; unforeseeable hacks

People are much more aware of this risk since TheDAO. Responses include improvements to the Solidity language, an emphasis on simple straightforward code, and much greater demand for serious security audits. Also the Ethereum Foundation employs someone full-time to work on formal verification techniques for smart contracts, so you can actually *prove* their properties, but it's going to be a while before that's ready.

In general, being Turing-complete means you *can* write code that's near-impossible to understand, but it doesn't mean you have to. You can write code that's easy to understand and predict. All the software that runs our world is Turing complete, including the software running banks, aircraft, medical equipment, and nuclear reactors. If it were impossible to predict their behavior, smart contracts would be the least of our problems.

Definitely a good reason to be cautious, and you shouldn't buy in now unless you're willing to hold through a major dip. On the other hand Bitcoin went up 50X in 2013 so who knows. More Enterprise Ethereum announcements, Raiden (Ethereum's version of the Lightning network), and a major upgrade including strong privacy features are on the way this year.

dhefv97,jstolfi,73,"The LN cannot compete with SNBN, an alternative distributed payment network that was developed a few years ago (but remains poorly known by the cryptocurrency community). 

The SNBN  charges very low fixed fees (around 0.01 USD or so per transaction), and usually provides confirmation in the next block for any transaction that pays that minimum fee.  Unlike the LN, in the SNBN any user can send a payment to any other user at any time, with no need for explicit channel setup or settlement operations, special protocols, routing services, extra communication channels, vigilantes, or middlemen.  SNBN users do not need to negotiate with hubs and reward them, or watch the blockchain 24/7 for attemted fraud; and they can receive payments even while disconnected from the internet.  The SNBN does not require users to lock up funds in channels; each user has complete control of her bitcoins at all times.

The only advantage that the LN might have over the SNBN is transaction confirmation speed.  In the SNBN, as it was implemented, the delay D to first confirmation is a random variable with 10 minute average.  In contrast, the LN, being non-existent, can execute a payment about 2 seconds before the sender even thinks about sending it.  But, if that turns out to be a problem, the SNBN could be reconfigured with a much smaller D, even 1 minute or less.

The SNBN is Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin Network.  It was operational from 2009 to 2015, when it was replaced by the GCTN (Greg's Clogged Toilet Network).  It would still be working fine today, if the block size limit had been increased as planned, so that it remained effectively unlimited (that is, much larger than the actual block sizes).  

Granted, the SNBN had its substantial portfolio of unsolved problems; but they affect the GCTN too -- and hence the LN, which is supposed to use the latter as its foundation.

Seriousy now:  Blockstream's roadmap calls for intentionally crippling the bitcoin network, presumably in order to make the ""layer 2"" network seem an improvement, and force all bitcoin users to use it.

Most people doesn't give a shit about new decentralized digital gold ideology. People cares about trust and usability. Bitcoin doesn't provide either. Their branding has gone totally wrong way if they want Bitcoin to be taken seriously in mainstream markets. All they hear and read about in news are that Bitcoin has been used in black markets, or involved in drug busts, or used as a ransomware currency. That doesn't really ooze trust. 

I have worked on industry heavily involved money, and trust is the biggest thing you need to build. People trust fiat. They have used it their whole life. They get salary in fiat, they buy groceries and fuel etc in fiat, and they pay their rent in fiat. That is hard to change. That's why I think that cryptocurrencies won't hit mainstream until fiats are tokenized. Ethereum on the other hand works as an underlying technology and doesn't need Ether to hit mainstream to succeed. Blockchain as a technology has biggest potential to grow outside of currencies.

So you can argue as much as you want about fiats being used in shady drug deals as well and our current monetary system being broken, but until it collapses, people doesn't care. Fiat for them is the most trusted and convenient form of money, and they as a mainstream won't change that.

Ether is up 6.6x in the past 3 months, so let's take a conservative approach as round it down to 6. Early growth can sometimes be approximated by an exponential curve. If we fit a curve, we have:

6=x^3

Which means in 2 years -&gt; (x^3 )^8 , we'll be at $89*6^8 =$149485824/ETH

So this very conservative method gives a us a minimum price of $150M/ETH in 2 years. It's pretty clear from that alone that ETH is poised to be 500000x larger than Bitcoin. I am NOT saying that it's going to get there in a few months, but we've experienced larger growth in the past (6.6x/3 months instead of 6x). 

This is just my opinion, do your own research. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/tTeiq)'s a graph of the recent growth extrapolated.

I guess the battle for $1,800 was more like a walk in the park.  I woke up this morning to see it in the high $1,800s.  I guess it doesn’t pay to sleep.

So, because we went up to a new high box yesterday (breaking $1800) it negated the reversal, so its as if it didn’t happen.

The long pole is back in place.  And as you can see, it is getting “toppy.”  I would have been more comfortable with a small, one or two day pause.

The column is 18 boxes high.  Working from memory, but I think the highest single column (or Long Pole) was something like 26 boxes high.  So, this is pretty good, but not “historical.”  However, combined with the previous pole this formation is astounding in terms of height and total value added to the market cap.

Here are the numbers:

We hit a high of $1,889 overnight.  So the formation is bumping up against the $1,900 box.

A reversal would happen if the price dropped below $1,800 tomorrow without reaching a new high.  We already locked in a new high for today.  The new day starts at 00:00 GMT.

A negative break down would occur at a price under $1,520.  (If that doesn’t convince you that we are soaring, wait until we talk about the trend reversal figures!)

The formation is thin at only two columns wide.  Think and long is a nice figure if you are going to model clothes.  It is precarious for Bitcoin formations.

The trend is positive.   We remain more than $800 away from breaking the long term trend and going negative.

Since the trend tells me to be optimistic (and I am) the long and thin formation we are in looks like it needs some support.  I would love to have it smash the records and keep going.  But I think we are going to need some consolidation in the near term.

dhg80c6,bullwhaler,45,"I had about $1.5M in the bank by the early 2000s and figured I could FIRE for at least a while.  Then The Crisis™ came, and even though I was very bearish, investing very conservatively, and expecting a crash, it still nearly wiped me out.  I was down to $0 in the bank and one small property where I was living, so when that took longer than expected to sell I was literally asking people for loans.

I never expected to lose all that money I'd worked so hard for, especially so quickly.  My lifestyle and expenses were very conservative and I thought I knew what I was doing with investing.

But I also didn't expect to make it all back (and moreso) so quickly without doing lots of hard work.  (Hooray a happy ending)

When I finally managed to sell my last property, after paying back all debts and loans I was desperate and literally took my last $2K and started investing in bitcoin.

Since then I've been back above $3M three times now, and by the looks of things it may keep going higher this time.

...

I really liked this article but I really have to disagree with this statement. 

**Factually it's incorrect.**

There are numerous altcoins you could have picked in 2016 which would have given you multiple opportunities for several hundred percent returns.

Buying at a peak is dangerous yes but all your arguments applied to Bitcoin from 2010 all the way through to the present. Imagine buying BTC at $1200 in 2013 or at $780 in July 2016 before it fell to $550.

Truth is several chains are going to become dominant in this space. 

- It is apparent BTC will dominate as a store of value with mainstream awareness and global circumstances favouring this function.

- Likewise an objective analysis of news will make it apparent that Ethereum (ETH) is dominating the smart contract space and is arguably in the position where Bitcoin was in late 2012; i.e. people were beginning to realise the significance and potential longevity of the technology.

...

It's dissapointing to this end that your analysis of cryptocurrency investing whilst largely sound contains some clear biases of interpretation and misrepresentation of facts.

I suggest anyone reading this thread do their research into circumstances regarding the DAO and the creation of Ethereum.

Bitcoin is an excellent store of value but it's dominance in part is due to historic mainstream awareness and in part due to the majority of altcoin trading pairs on cryptocurrency trading exchanges being built around Bitcoin for a mixture of historic reasons, pre-existing network effect and liquidity.

I may have my own preferences and the one's for Ethereum are evident but it too now has the liqduidity and emerging mainstream awareness to take on this role in the exchanges.

Furthermore i feel the same way about Ethereum now and in mid 2016 as I did about Bitcoin in early 2012 and objectively since July 2016 have seen a much larger percentage return (1000%) in ETH compared to if I had bought Bitcoin (300%).

True you can fudge these numbers how you like depending on your entry (but for my entry prices this is factual) but the reality is this there is room to grow in this space for many cryptocurrencies still.

...

The technology is still young and mostly speculative but there are some very interesting bets out there and yes many of them are Ethereum based because Ethereum *is specifically designed* to facilitate the building and functioning of decentralized applications.

I'd like to draw attention to projects (which I hold) such as particl.io (PART), wetrust (TRST), Augur (REP), Factom (FCT) and promising projects I don't such as  Iex.ec (RLC), Digix (DGD), Melonport (MLN) and Monero (XMR) plus look at the conceptual applications of alternative savings systems such as DASH, PIVx and Decred.

dhflxtz,Cryptolution,30,"&gt; UASF is just as risky as a HF. And is not practical unless we have support from both sides.

Are you really going to stipulate that a backwards compatible soft fork is ""just as risky"" as a HF?

That does not make very much sense. There's zero risk of a flag day UASF for SW because it will not disrupt anything. Miners and nodes who don't upgrade will continue to operate on the network regardless of the added rules. Those who wish to enjoy the new benefits can, and those who dont, wont.

&gt;Flag day to 2mb of non witness data as was called for by the HK agreement is the bare minimum we need if we want miner support and not to stay in gridlock.

Why are you still peddling this HK nonsense talk? Why do people persist in beating a horse that is not only dead, but its bones have literally rotted into dust and nothing exists anymore.

There is no HK agreement. It was broken within a few weeks of it being made by miners signaling BitcoinXT. Get over it dude, its not going to happen and you insisting that it does only shows how irrationally stubborn you are.

Core does not deal with terrorists. If you want a blocksize upgrade then you should petition all your fellow big blockers to active the pending upgrade that grants us exactly what you are asking for.

But no, you want 2mb non-witness, *for no fucking reason whatsoever other than stupid pride*. Why do you persist in ignoring the fact that SW optimizes blockspace resources? Why do you persist in ignoring the fact that upgrading to 2mb non witness will open up the network to cpu ddos attacks?

You are advocating for a hardfork claiming its ""just as risky"" as a backwards compatible softfork, which is nonsense. You are advocating for upgrading the system in a way that opens it up to new attack vectors, which is reckless.

* This is a Windows worm. It didn't directly affect the NHS on purpose, but apparently they didn't patch their computers. (UPDATE 3:22) Information indicates that many NHS computers were still running Windows XP, which did not get a patch for this issue. (UPDATE 4:45) [Article from December about the NHS running XP.](http://www.silicon.co.uk/security/nhs-hospitals-data-risk-outdated-windows-xp-201761)
* The worm is spreading via leaked NSA cyber-weapons (ETERNALBLUE and maybe DOUBLEPULSAR) that were leaked by the Shadow Brokers. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft in a critical patch update [in March 2017](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx). The NSA software was not originally a worm, but was modified.
* There appears to be more than one variant of the worm (so far, appears to be ~~four~~ ~~five~~ eight). The biggest ransomware on the scene is called Wcry / WannaCry / WannaCryptor, which was rarely seen until today.
* (UPDATE 4:08) - **The ransomware aspect will still work, even if you aren't susceptible to the worm, so, as usual, be careful what you click on and execute. That hasn't changed. What's new here is the ability to spread to un-patched Windows computers without requiring user interaction.**

Edits:

* All unpatched Windows versions up through Windows 10 are affected. If you have automatic Windows Update turned on, you're probably safe from being automatically infected. Windows XP and other outdated systems were *not* patched and will remain vulnerable forever. 
* Odds are that if you're infected by this malware, you will *not* be able to recover your files without paying. You should always have an offline backup for this reason.

Either way, good luck reaching it.

~~Edit 5 (3:24 PM): The infection trigger may have been registration of a specific domain. This allowed the worm to gain some traction prior to detonation. (Unconfirmed)~~ The specific domain was actually a kill switch!

Edit 7 (3:34 PM): [Article with lots of technical detail from Kaspersky here](https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/78351/wannacry-ransomware-used-in-widespread-attacks-all-over-the-world/)

Edit 8 (3:54 PM): ~~70,000~~ ~~75,000~~ 177,000 (as of 5/13 12:54) infected IPs have been detected so far by MalwareTech's tracking servers. This isn't the same as the number of infected computers, because many infections will be contained to a LAN, and even if they can scan the Internet, multiple infected computers on the same LAN would appear to trackers as the same IP.

dhhemcg,eeksskee,83,"This is a great breakdown /u/dunning_krugerrands/

Overall, I was biased to like the project, and have participated in ICOs for 50% of all smart contract platforms that have launched to date. I love that they have an MVP, have done the work, and are bright.

But the last couple months have been profoundly disappointing to me wrt Tezos.  Here are my concerning negatives.  

**If their uncapped ICO raises $100mm+, it will be 4x larger than any ICO to date.**  It says a lot about the Breitman's character that they are ignoring cryptocurrency self-policing and standards and not capping it below $30mm like every other project, many of which could have broke away from community standards and raised much more than they did.  It's frankly reckless.  It's their project, it's their choice, but nothing happens in a vacuum.  (They also get cash directly from this ICO, 8.5% of the fiat proceeds, that doesn't go to the Tezos Foundation but to their own entity, which is a first I think).

**This is the first ICO to my knowledge in which the founders get 8.5% of the fiat proceeds in cash in addition to 10% of the tokens.**  This means if things go well, they will be extremely wealthy even if their projects fails in 1 year.  This 8.5% is through the Breitman controlled US entity, DLS.  I wonder how many potential ICO participants do not understand that this ICO is endowing not just the Tezos Foundation (10% of tokens, plus fiat), handpicked by the Breitman's and ""philosophically aligned"" with them, but also the Breitman's via DLS (8.5% of the cash, 10% of the tokens).  The conflicts of interest are many and the structure is murky.  This also will put heightened regulatory scrutiny on the Breitmans personally and Tezos in general.  If we can't self-police, the SEC may do it for us.  And the largest ICO ever, one that solicited US investors and funneled cash to a US entity, seems like the most obvious target to date.  Unlike TheDAO, which was a disembodied pooling of capital and in which no one gained any money whatsoever, Tezos has actual targets who are actually raising money.  Slock.it was considered greedy but never saw a dime from their ICO the way it was designed.  The Breitman's will walk away from their ICO as ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWIs for people who love lingo).  **If Tezos ever becomes as successful as Ethereum is today in terms of market cap, the Breitman's will be billionaires.**  That doesn't seem like the appropriate out-of-the-box incentive structure for a decentralized technology platform.

**The character of the Breitmans is a concern.**  Any blockchain project is in part a social project, one that takes its cues from the leaders.  You can see this in a million ways but the difference between Ethereum and ETC is one example of how important leadership is and how communities build around their thought leaders.  You can see it in Augur, Monero, Synereo, Bitcoin, Steem, Maker, Digix -- the leaders and the team set the tone and the community evolves around that seed.  I have seen the Breitman's be overconfident, dismissive, and rude to potential investors while they are trying to raise $10-200mm.  The structure of their raise alone is reckless for themselves and the cryptocurrency/blockchain space.  

In the real world, when a mgmt team has a [Jeff Skilling moment](https://bizgovsociii.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/the-asshole-story-enron-skilling-and-research-process/), it's just a big red flag.  It's great that you are the smartest guy in the room -- but that's not enough, character matters, and being able to work with people and build a community matters. **EQ is as important as IQ.** I asked a critical question and his response to me was ""this feels like a negotiation"" and then he questioned my motives and responded that Tim Draper disagreed with me (appeal to authority, so it goes.  [TD also has a different opinion on Theranos than I do](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/theranos-investor-claims-theres-a-conspiracy-to-take-down-elizabeth-holmes)).  It didn't leave me with the warm and fuzzies.  I was pretty shocked when he insulted another potential investor, one I know to be reasonable and diligent and helpful to others, and then said ""kthxby."" It was a low EQ move, the kind of thing that if it happened in the real world would crater a fundraise.  I've met with unicorns and big real world companies' mgmt teams during fundraising processess, including one very large logistics unicorn famous for being difficult who proved it to my face -- and yet that unicorn's hubris was less than what I've experienced from Tezos.  My takeaway has been: **is this someone you want to be in control of $100mm?  Are they ready as leaders?  Do they have what it takes?**  We are learning in project after project that character and the quality of the team are integral. 

**The scope of their roadmap is ridiculous** and belies that investors should not have confidence that the team will use the raised money well.  The plans are massive and random and the team doesn't have the necessary expertise to handle the variety. Scope is way too big.  This looks like empire building and it's frankly, an unfocused, shoddy plan.  The detail in the plan reads fake to me.  Pretty obvious that it comes from smart, talented people without much experience but with a lot of confidence.  It's not as bad as when TaaS said they would be making a ""Bloomberg competitor"" on top of running their CEF but it's not far off.  They are scope drunk.  In my experience with companies, mgmt teams who wants lots of money or a blank check, and have little tangible plan with what they will do with the cash other than ""good things"" and ""humbling scope"" burn cash quickly and don't create value.  Span of control issues will be rampant here, and it's evident that the Breitmans don't have the experience to even know what span of control is.  I like ambition and this whole space is rife with dreamers.  But most are not asking for $100mm++ and derisking themselves with cash payments upfront. 
 Examples (note that there were also a lot of spelling mistakes on their roadmap -- a document to justify why people should give them $100mm+):

&gt; ""Negotiate with a small nation-state the recognition of Tezos as one of their official state currency, which would immediately give Tezos favorable treatment in terms of financial regulation. Attempt negotiations to purchase or lease sovereign land.""

&gt; ""Purchase a banking license and deploy the Tezos blockchain as a backbone for business operations. Experiment with automation using a blockchain for basic processes.

&gt; ""Acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets throught [sic] token issuance to promote and defend the use of cryptographic ledger in society.""

&gt; ""Sponsor a leading computer science department with endowed professorships and extensive grants to graduate students in the field of formal verification.""

**Why won't this evolve into just Breitmanchain or Oligarchchain?**

We know from the most similar decentralized project, TheDAO (gathered a lot of money, most ever, was a decentralized organization, was in the spotlight, attracted endless scrutiny) that voter apathy is real and quorums are hard to reach.  In TheDAO, this would have let to an inert, unwieldy blob of a closed end fund if it had not unwound.

Tezos has been positioned as a reaction to TheDAO and the overall Ethereum governance fallout of TheDAO and to governance problems in Bitcoin. It can adjust the quorum down to solve for voter apathy, amongst many improvements.  Breitwoman started this comparison when she [penned her TheDAO op-ed in Feb'17](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-why-ethereums-hard-fork-will-cause-problems-coming-year/) and they've played up the governance failures of TheDAO (they are ignoring other learnings from TheDAO like ICOs should not be uncapped, and if things go wrong, you're better not having a centralized recipient of crowdsale proceeds around as a traget with legal standing in the US...).  But conceptually, how won't Tezos fundraising structure and adjusting quorum lead to centralized capture by the large holders Day 1?  The lower the quorum adjusts to, the easier it is for a large holder to dominate the governance.  

And the design gives a 20% block to ""philosophically aligned"" entities.  The Foundation does not seem independent enough to disagree with the Breitmans in a substantive way, given the foundation was picked by the B's.  Why create a decentralized governance solution and then endow the creators with stakes that look like they will dominate voting?

How won't the most endowed, most influential two people not control the governance?  **Why in a decentralized solution do some people seem more equal than others out of the gate** -- the B's have alluded to having an uncapped sale so that people like Olaf and Tim Draper can get in (ironically these people already have benefited from preferential access, so this rationale rings hollow) suggests that some potential Tezos holders are more equal than others and certainly more desirable.  Why won't Tezos be captured by oligarchs and the connected?  Why use blockchain to recreate existing power structures? It stands out that an oligarch has already bought in and been used to market Tezos.

It's because of these last set of fears that the characters of the Breitmans really matter.  They need to act fair, be pragmatic, and foster a decentralized open community for Tezos to succeed.  But they will be rich in fiat, the largest Tezzie holders, and they will have already communicated to the public that some Tezzie holders are more equal than others.  What's the point of blockchain?

dhh9n3i,geekdad,82,"From another thread:

Security researcher here. The ~~worm~~ (technically it's a dropper)  is being called WannaCrypt v2 (WCry). Yes this was based on the NSA leaks of ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR. However, this was patched by Microsoft 2 months ago (MS17-010). **If you haven't done updates on any Win7+ systems you have control over, do it now.** [Other mitigation techniques here](https://i.imgur.com/N2n8Fcq.png)

Many computers still can be affected though. Last scan that I know of allows for 1.7million public facing computers, untold numbers that aren't directly public though.

This is a ransomware worm, meaning it doesn't need to be run by anybody. So this could be very bad. It encrypts files and forces you to pay them in bitcoin to unlock. If you get this DO NOT PAY.

Infection have been reported at UK NHS, FedEx, Universities, and a VOIP telecom provider. Rumors that Reuters and a few others have been hit.

A little technical, it hooks into Windows SMB v1 service. It's a known ransomware but has been updated to include the NSA leak vulnerabilities. I'd be happy to answer questions.

Edit: [The ransoms are being paid](https://blockchain.info/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94). Don't do this...

Edit2: Russia and China are being the hardest hit. [Even Russia's Interior Ministry has gotten it.](http://varlamov.ru/2370148.html) This does not mean it's focusing on any certain area though.   

Edit3: It looks as though there was something that ended new infections. Some are saying it's a kill timer, but I haven't confirmed that. Whatever it is, new infections have slowed to trickle. 

**THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T STILL UPDATE WINDOWS** 

Edit4: To clarify edit 3... This will still spread from machines that are infected across the network. I was talking about public facing machines.  

Edit5: Welp edition. So in order to decrypt it looks like you may have to talk to a human over tor (using a ransomware builtin function).. I doubt they have enough staff to cover all of the people who will try to pay. Good luck if you get this and want to pay

dhiz207,Nooku,54,"Quick update on the Bitcoin situation:

Bitcoin's unconfirmed transaction backlog is still at a whopping **150 000** right now.

For reference, it was around **20 000** last weekend.

And it was between **0 and 5 000** in all of the weekends before that.

**What this means / why you should care?**

According to my calculations, the shit, the scenario, that we've been predicting for over 2 years now, is about to go down somewhere next week.

#For those who missed the memo, it goes something like this:

The Bitcoin transactions / sec stays above the amount the Bitcoin network is capable of processing, causing the queue to become ever-expanding: every 10 minutes, the transaction backlog will increase and will never decrease. Waiting times will grow exponentially. The current waiting time of a couple of hours will grow into days. People can no longer transfer their bitcoins around.

This in turn will cause 2 huge consequences:

* 1) In attempts to get around the transaction queue, people will start selling their bitcoins for any altcoin solely to transfer their money around. The markets and trading bots will react on this: expect markets to get wild.

* 2) While the bitcoin community gets confronted with the truth, they will start rushing to push for hardforks to fix the blocksize issues. Exchanges will start to get confused and some won't be prepared for the forks that start to appear: ""*Which fork does the btc/xxx pair belong to?*"". They will decide to halt all withdrawals for at last 24 - 48 hours to see which fork wins. More people panic, and more people will start to exchange their value for altcoins. Altcoin markets that are already wild due to (1) will now go even wilder (2)  

**Not over though.**

Out of this, a 3rd consequence will appear:

* 3) Miners. With Bitcoin value plummeting and the Bitcoin chain forking, some mining farms might shut down temporarily, or move their mining power to other coins. The other miners that stay devoted to Bitcoin, will move their power to one of the different forks they can choose from. The mining power allocated to each one of these chains will be insufficient and out of touch with the **current mining difficulty** that only adjusts **every 2 weeks**. Blocks that are usually mined in the average of 10 minutes, will now get mined in 20, 30, 40 minutes.... causing the unconfirmed transaction backlog to become **far worse**. The problem starts to look like a runaway train now and news sites will start to pick this shit up. 

I'm not going to speculate what happens next, because scenarios can go many different ways from that point on, depending on the talents (or absence of talent) of individuals during all of the drama.

dhjwhuk,minimal_typos,163,"WannaCry is malware consisting of a worm and ransomware affecting Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Ransomware is malicious software which, when let lose on your machine, finds your files, encrypts them (so that you can't use them anymore) and usually posts a message on your screen telling you that to get them back (via a decryption key) you need to send some money to a Bitcoin address.

Bitcoin is anonymous and untraceable (we believe) so you'll send your money as instructed and you *might* receive a key to decrypt your files.

There's no indication with this malware that your files have actually been sent anywhere - so no one else has necessarily seen your data, it's just that they've made it so that you can't either.  Unless you pay up.

A worm is is piece of malware whose sole purpose is to spread to other machines and trigger a payload.  In this case, the payload is the ransomware.

Worms get about in lots of different ways - in this particular case it is using a vulnerability affecting SMBv1.  SMB stands for Server Message Block.  It's basically the way in which you share files and folders in Windows.  If you save a file on a server at work you're using SMB, for example.  Version 1 (v1) is outdated but still widely in use.  V2 and v3 exist and are not affected by this malware.

To allow computers to communicate with each other they use 'ports' which are numbered.  This malware uses the ports which SMB uses to get around and spread the infection.  Since this is using an already-existing means of replicating (SMB) this malware doesn't require the user to do anything to get it to spread.  That's why it's spread so quickly and has caused so much damage.

The exploit used was part of the Shadow Brokers hack of the CIA a while back wherein they stole and released a bunch of **NSA** tools and, effectively, malware.

It affects multiple versions of Windows but importantly, a patch to protect against exactly this was released about 2 months ago.  If you patch regularly then this won't affect you.

However, patching at scale - like in a big company - isn't as easy as it sounds.  And a lot of companies are very bad at it.  Some companies - including some banks - are so bad at it that they're still actually running Windows XP which is more than 15 years old.  And, more importantly, doesn't benefit from patches anymore since it's over 2 years past support.

As a possible indicator of just how bad this malware infection has been, Microsoft actually released a Windows XP patch to address it.

The malware has a 'feature' built in to it whereby when it is triggered it attempts to contact a gibberish website address.  If it fails, it infects the machine.  Researchers have found that if the malware actually manages to contact the gibberish website then the malware doesn't trigger.  It's speculated that this was included as a sort of 'kill switch' for the malware.  One researcher realised that the website address that the malware was calling out to was not actually registered (so all attempts to get to the address would fail and trigger the malware).  So he registered it...aaaaand, killed the malware.  He pointed the website address to what's called a 'sink hole' whereby requests coming in  can be monitored to see where the malware has gotten to.

Companies (and state departments) have been affected in the UK, US, Russia, Spain, and probably more at this point.

Whilst this sounds like good news (and it is, really) the reality is that subsequent versions of the malware will likely point to other addresses - or do away with the kill switch altogether.  It's a constant game of cat and mouse.

So, if you regularly patch you're basically home and dry on this one.  If you - or your company - don't, then you're at risk and realistically the only thing you can really do is patch.  Some companies are considering turning off SMBv1 (in favour of v2 or v3) but again, the bigger the company the harder this is.

AV vendors are already releasing clean up tools to remove the malware, but I don't think that they're able to decrypt and recover affected files yet.  And if the crypto was done right, they never will be able to either :(

dhkmhl3,naturallin,97,"Looks like there's only one supporter for SW + LN.
Here's my personal translation, not google translate.  I'm Chinese myself so I can help a bit. I'll just translate what I understand:
Core is hindering bitcoin's development. 
Core doesn't support BU pools.
Be prepared to lose a huge amount of hashing power.
Consumers/Users wants bigger blocks, this is the only path forward.
SW has already failed.  The network now cannot work properly.  
The fees are high.  Confirmation time has reached all time high, the situation can only get worse.  
As hundreds of thousands of new users of bitcoin realize that bitcoin is being destroyed by 3-5 stubborn Core developers' sabotage, they will be very disappointed/disheartening. 

Outstanding Core developers: Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn are who made the bitcoin today.  If not for their being ousted by current core ""descendants"", we could have solved the 1MB block size 2 years ago.  This stalemate would not have appeared.  
Gavin has wrote why increasing block size is urgent.  Now Core doesn't represent the community.  They are centralized and controlled by few people.  This toxicity has wasted years of time for bitcoin.  
For pools' interest, each miner will not risk their investment to support LN.  Unless you support those who want bigger blocks users, they will leave your mining pool.   Please support BU, BC, Bcoin, Parity-Bitcoin and other non-core software. Decentralize development/progress is bitcoin's next step.

Blockstream demands SW, not the market. 
Why is Core so vehemently propagating segwit? We need to find out what the Core's goal is? Is it really for the good of bitcoin's future? Is it the need of the market?  Core has a deathgrip on 1MB, strongly support SW, the real reason is Blockstream(BS) needs SW, not market needing SW. What market needs is smooth transaction and maintaining bitcoin's original quality, and good practical experience.  BS is doing this because they want to bring on LN.  They want to bring a huge amount of microstransactions to LN, so mainchain will only transact bigger transactions.  LN would become the main part of point of transaction. Bitcoin will lose decentralization quality, and BS will have talking right over the rules of transactions. This would be destructive to bitcoin.

dhkq9k9,c_o_r_b_a,65,"No. Considering the scale and scope, it's painfully easy to register a domain in a way that isn't traceable to you.

To be a remotely successful ransomware operator all, one must successfully anonymize themselves in the process of designing and testing the malware, launching the spam campaigns and other infection channels, converting the Bitcoin to fiat currency, and much more.

And these guys have successfully pulled off the biggest *wormable* ransomware pandemic in history.

This requires lots of ""infrastructure"" (servers, email accounts, bank accounts, and a ton more). Likely team members, too. Any of these is a weak link. If they can take care of all that anonymously, then registering a domain safely is the easiest thing on Earth. Especially when that domain is utterly critical to your malware and can render it globally neutered in an instant.

The only sensible explanation is that they were very negligent in this case. And who knows, maybe others.

Believe it or not, making something like this doesn't really require a ton of expertise. The NSA (or one of their contracting firms) already did the legwork of fully discovering and weaponizing the vulnerability. Actually making ransomware is something you could easily teach to a college programming class. There are [hundreds of open source samples](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=ransomware&amp;type=) out there, and probably hundreds of closed source ones. Admittedly, getting the malware into networks in the first place and handling the payments requires some work, but it's not quite fit for a movie.

Second, the more interesting bit that I was hoping for:

&gt;At the dawn of the Indomitus Crusade, these phenomenal new warriors join Guilliman as he fights to liberate the scattered bastions of the Imperium. Some, Guilliman has forged into new Space Marine Chapters, whole brotherhoods comprised only of these new warriors. Others he has offered to the existing Space Marine Chapters. Many Chapter Masters have welcomed their Primaris brethren into their ranks, accepting the new reinforcements gladly. **Others, though, view these new creations with suspicion or outright hostility, claiming that the Emperor’s work should not have been meddled with.**

Good. Presumably, some of the other primarchs who will be coming back will be similarly reticent to accept the new marines.

The other interesting little tidbit;

&gt;Though they are a step removed from their brothers, the Primaris Space Marines still bear the gene-seed of their Primarchs, and some dissenting voices worry how this new type of warrior will react with the known genetic quirks and flaws of some of the more unusual Chapters…

There are certainly elements of the existing Space Marines kits that will be cross-compatible, while the new armour mark means that some parts won’t mix as easily. **Shoulder pads and helmets are the same scale, and will still work,** whereas the legs, torso and arms are different, and not quite as interchangeable.

Either almost everyone except for a few brave geniuses thought that bitcoin is so worthless as to not even merit a market cap the size of a house, or, much more likely, almost all people, including almost all of the sort of people who would be interested in this sort of thing, did not hear about Bitcoin for at least 1.5-2 years.

dhmjldn,joskye,74,"Today's current holdings (as fiat percentages):

...

**Long holds:** (I do not intend to sell these in next 3-6 months)

- ETH 86% (None bought/sold) (Expected sell price $300-1000)

- REP 4.1% (None bought/sold) (Expected sell price $50-200)

- PART (per current SDC price): 2.2% None bought/sold. (Expected sell price $10-1000)

- TRST 3% (I'm not done accumulating in spite of falling price) (Expected sell price $1-10)

- FCT 1.8%: (Sold 15% of stack since my last pos). (Expected sell price $100-300)

**Non core holds:**

- ICN 2.9%: (Sold 14% of stack *prior* to pump from $0.50 to $0.70). 

- SWT 0.43%: (Sold 1/2 of stack since last post at $1.9/SWT)

- DCR 0.56% (New purchase from approx 1 week ago)

- RNS 0.22%: None bought or sold

- VISIO: 0.13% None bought or sold.

...

**Major changes**

- Addition of 8% fresh fiat into my initial principle amount. Most of this has gone into Wetrust (TRST) and is reflected in the fiat proportion it represents.

- Addition of DCR. It spiked from $15 to $19 within 24h of BTC dropping from $1800 to $1700. Yes it's corrected since but that spike shows me everything I need to know; people want to hedge BTC against masternode style alts with built in governance (DASH, PIVx and DCR).

- I have moved TRST and FCT into core holds. I will **not** be selling these until the price is a significant multiplier from original purchase (10-100x); I think this is possible within 12-24 months. Core holds represent tokens I think hold long term appreciative value over 3 years. So even if these projected prices are reached in 3-6 months **I might not sell**

- I am incurring losses on SWT (22% loss on remaining position), DCR (15% loss on initial position) , TRST (15% loss on overall position) and RNS (15% of initial position) somewhat balanced by gains in ICN and the stability of ETH.

- I am watching RLC and MLN. I do not like the illiquidity on MLN.

- If my remaining SWT hadn't dumped I'd have traded it for TRST or RLC.

**General thoughts:**

- I did *not* see the XRP pump coming. It's clearly impacting other alts except for junk tokens with low volume which tells me that we have more gamblers than usual in this space and people aren't trading based off non-speculative value propositions or anything even close to due diligence.

- ETH is holding steady rising my suspicion that it's becoming a reserve cryptocurrency. All ETH really needs is an exchange that has major ETH-ALT trading pairs; someone could make **a lot** of money by building this.

- I cannot help but feel the attention is diverted to XRP with Japanese money fuelling the pump. I'd like to add that the XRP pump really got going after the international cyberterrorism incident which has been linked to Bitcoin. BTC dropped $100 in value that day.

- Bitcoin's owners are unknown, it is not seen as a legitimate institution or corporation. The Japanese although they may be gamblers take comfort in the security of institutions and hierarchies. XRP may not be a great chain but it's owned by a legally recognised corporation and that's reason enough for some people to buy. 

- Also most people don't understand what marketcap is and are fooled by it. What matters more is liquidity, non-speculative value propositions, history and percentage gains. 

- The only advantage to draw from this is to understand that large supply coins are prone to bubbles which can quickly burst as buy support although self perpetuating on the psychology of a rising large marketcap can dissapear very quickly triggering a crash.

- When XRP is done we will see money return to other alts and new investors/traders will finally start smartening up or getting filtered out leading to a maturation and expansion of the market as a whole.

- u/Spitfire75 asked me what my top 20 altcoins to watch for late 2017/2018. They are ETH, REP, PART, FCT, TRST, ICN, DGD, MKR, RLC, MLN, XMR, PIVx, SWT, SYS, DICE, GNT, E4ROW. I suggest you look at these individually and pick 4-5 to hold.

- My suggested beginners position is 25/25/25/25 FCT/ETH/BTC/TRST or 25/25/25/12.5/12.5 FCT/ETH/BTC/TRST/RLC for a long hold. RLC could substitute with XMR.

dhlbzqh,vswr,60,"You asked for laughable things...so here comes some crazy...

##Wearable technology.  

Google Glass, FitBit, Apple Watch, etc are a starting point, but the technology has not yet matured and we haven't yet discovered the killer app.  There's more to it than measuring your heart rate.  Your car has a ""check engine"" light, but we don't.

##Mesh networks.  

Apple kind of started it with Multipeer Connectivity and there was a large demo app called FireChat, but we never really went anywhere with it.  In areas like Tornado Alley, all you need is one person that can reach a cell tower or has wifi in order to connect hundreds without connectivity.  When an emergency is happening, perhaps a hurricane or flood, everyone becomes one giant mesh network to communicate directly with others as well as reach the outside world.  There are also dead-man-switch applications, such as if someone fails to check into the network, someone can be dispatched to check on them.  I had some mild success while playing with this concept, but didn't further pursue it.

##Satellite and/or ground based telemetry links to aircraft.  

Elon is launching a zillion satellites within the next few years and we already can erect ground-based stations.  There's no reason why aircraft shouldn't have NASA-like telemetry downlinks to a mega-TRACON-like facility that includes video feed.  There will be no more missing planes, no more mysteries, and sadly no more Bermuda Triangle.  If you want to get global participation in the face of resistance, the FAA can mandate all inbound aircraft to the US must implement the technology.  Unfortunately, it would probably fall victim to lobbyists to prevent such legislation because of the car recall precedent: if the wrongful death suits would cost less than a recall, don't do the recall; that is, if loss-of-craft incidents cost less than outfitting a fleet with the technology, the airlines won't do it (or perhaps they'll try and screw over the passengers by adding on more fees).

##Global identification.  

[This was posted](https://guptasiddhant.com/the-passport-concept-289733ba7963) on /r/UnsolicitedRedesigns the other day.  It made me think about how the Bitcoin ecosystem is designed with regard to [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), that is, a single recovery phrase from which all cryptocurrency accounts are derived using a logical path.  For that, I'll dive into an explanation (and forgive the US-centric view):

Imagine instead of receiving a social security number at birth you receive your identification phrase.  It's similar to [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), which uses common words in your native language to derive your encryption key.  Your ID card has:

&gt; margin embody fit dose lucky debris piece try segment era soup mirror basket artwork impulse

And from that, all of your identifications are created via the BIP44 key derivation path.  Each country has a code, each issuing body has a code, and each ID type has a code.  The path:

    m / issuer_country' / issuer_locale' / purpose' / type / index

Where:

* apostrophe = hardened key (no children keys may be derived)
* m = the derived master key
* issuer_country = the issuing country
* issuer_locale = the issuing state/province, if applicable
* purpose = Passport, driver's license, standard ID
* type = endorsements to the purpose, such as a CDL to a driver's license
* index = The actual key used for the identification

Example:

    m/22'/36'/2'/0/0

* 22 = United States
* 36 = State of Texas
* 2 = State driver's license
* 0 = N/A
* 0 = First license issued (another would be 1, then 2, etc).

Or a passport:

    m/22'/0'/5'/0/3

* 22 = United States
* 0 = N/A (country is the issuer)
* 5 = Passport
* 0 = N/A
* 3 = The 4th passport generated (0, then 1, then 2, then 3)

The key generated by the derivation path would then be sent to the government agency, it is signed by their key, and the signature is placed in their database.

So when I travel to another country, I could either show a QR code (or some type of code) that has my passport key, or generate the key on-the-fly by a smart phone, or perhaps carry a plastic credit-card type device that generates it on-the-fly.  The country checks whether the US has signed this key to validate it.  If it's not revoked, if it's signed, it's legit.  They take my key, sign it, add it to their database, and now I have ""stamped"" my passport.

It's transparent to the end user.  They don't have to know or understand the tech.  All they know is that instead of an SSN, they have a bunch of words they'd only need if they need a new license or ID.  Type the words in, and all of their licenses and IDs appear.  ",2017-05-16 02:50:43

Raise your hand if you saw Coach Pops interviews on the hop, skip, and a jump Zaza needed to ""contest"" Kawhi's 3 point shot.

Now that we have all seen this, then your mind should be made up about this pick. Pop is the BEST single franchise coach to ever coach the game. He is the Bill Belichick of the NBA. He will find a way to give his team a shot. He could take the Spurs D league team, fly them from Austin, and cover the spread. He will come into this game with a vengeance. 

I think that the spurs without Kawhi are better than the Jazz without George Hill, and the Jazz covered that spread all but the last game when there was no hope remaining. 

Did the spurs look bad without Kawhi in that game? Undoubtedly, yes.  They also didn't gameplan to be without him. They were caught with their pants down, by the time they looked up there was already an 18-0 run in the fucking Roaracle, there was no stopping them. That is what Vegas is betting on the public remembering and betting the Warriors. Funny thing about the betting public, they are usually wrong. Don't you agree that Pop will have a gameplan? Did you watch game 6 in Houston when they played without Kawhi? 

Don't overthink this.

In an effort to build my new twitter account, dedicated solely to my POTD, I am going to have a contest. For those that retweet my pick, I will put in a $10 bet on this LOCK. When it hits, a random retweeter will get the winnings transferred to them via bitcoin as a thank you. It's not a crazy amount, but I have come up big off a lot less, free money is good money.

dhm5e5p,ericools,35,"Yep.  I agree there is more than enough reason for concern, but it's not remotely fair to compare bitcoin market cap to ripple, stellar lumins, or nem.  23.6% of the total.  

Something like 2/3rds of Ripple are held by the company and not in circulation, that's a lot of coin.  Yes all coins have rich (at least in terms of their own coin) founders, but this is far beyond what the creators of most coins have.  NEM just gives out the coins and who knows how many are actually out there.  Stellar apparently is giving some of them to bitcoin holders, and automatically on Kraken.  I learned that I own Stellar, I had assumed those were just some silly exchange issued thing.  Cool, they gave me free money.  Not really a trivial value right now either.  Thanks Stellar.  Still not a fair comparison though.

edit: So looking further at this Stellar.  I figured I might as well try and claim my share of Stellar for bitcoins I had in wallets.  It turns out requires disclosing your facebook account.  Supposedly to prove your not on the US sanctions list.  How facebook passes for ID I'm not sure.  Sounds shady as shit.  Also it looks like only about half of the coins used to calculate market cap have been distributed.  I am guessing a lot of the remaining distribution will not get collected.  Many people are not going to want to disclose their bitcoin holdings to Stellar, and many can't if they don't hold their own keys or have some kind of physical coin.

2. Fee Sniping only exists when blocks are full, so this doesn't make sense (the link provided talks about mining strategies that are not harmful to Bitcoin, and doesn't broach the subject of Fee Sniping)

3. Miner fees do provide security but does not approach zero - but rather a low relay limit (a fact conveniently ignored by small-blockers now: 99% of all transactions pre-full-blocks paid a fee of 0.0001 BTC to ensure propagation).

The rest of this post is a rehash of the #1 lie and a feeble attempt to support it with handwaving and bogus arguments. All those links depend on a falsehood: namely, that the ""decentralization of Bitcoin"" is dependent on ""a diversity of  fully validating but non-mining nodes"".

**This is a lie. Read Satoshi's Whitepaper.** The only node that matters is a fully mining node. Relay nodes do *nothing* to secure the network. Wallet nodes do *nothing* to secure the network. Service nodes do *nothing* to secure the network. All they do is relay and distribute information. Mining - Proof Of Work - is the only process that can secure Bitcoin transactions, and is the only process in Bitcoin that is threatened by centralization, per its design.",2017-05-16 23:39:45

My understanding is that past ransomware attacks have dynamically generated new bitcoin addresses for each infected computer, which allowed them to automate the process of distributing decryption keys to victims when they paid the ransom. Despite how widely and quickly this malware spread, and the amount of damage and chaos it caused, several aspects of it seem to have been executed very poorly. It infected nearly 300,000 systems, and apparently required some manual process for victims to get their encryption keys once they paid. You'd need an army of people to manage that number of requests if a human were required to do it.

You purchased tickets for a flight(s) from Agent A.  You paid him/her in bitcoin.  You then took the flight(s).  You are now receiving calls from somebody who is investigating credit card fraud.  They want you to prove that you WEREN'T on the flight.

1.  If you paid the price the person who sold you the ticket asked and you were transferred the ticket, then why would some random third party come after you?  If you purchased the tickets with a stolen credit card, then you have a problem.  Or, I suppose, if you purchased the bitcoin with a stolen credit card.

3.  How specifically, do they expect you to prove that you weren't on a plane?  Especially since every major airline in the world keeps passenger manifests and they can easily show who was on any flight.

dhp8pzg,[deleted],50,"**History:** I was a CS college student in 2012 and late that year read about and started talking about how I thought the world would switch to Bitcoin like *any* second now. In 2009 I thought the USD was ready to collapse (and put my money in gold). I was recently out of the military and at the time into self-reliance stuff and with my brother had a multi-acre ""compound/mini-farm"" with as many as 10 people living there. 

I say this to explain that I was just lucky to be reading about this kind of stuff and alt-currencies at that specific time. Anyway, I tried and gave up buying bitcoin a few times, but I stared buying in earnest soon after Coinbase showed up. I basically put $20,000 into it over the next couple years, pretty much as much as I could. My significant other thinks I am fucking nuts, really. For a couple years Bitcoin was all I would talk about. Only once the household rule basically became, *buy whatever/as much as you want* she finally caught on that bitcoin might actually be a real thing. 

**Profitable trades:**

* I bought 10's of LTC at tens of cents and sold when it was at $40.

* I bought and sold 10,000+ of ETH from about $2 all the way up, most recently cashed out (1,500+) totally at $93.

* I bought 1,000 Monero for about $0.10, then sold at $8. Did the same when it went from $12 to $25 (I thought it was going to go to $50). 

* Over a year or so I bought up 1,000 dash from $2.5-$8 and ran a Master Node for about 9 month before panic selling when it hit about $20. I re-bought $25 then sold everything when it was just about to hit $100.

* I really like the idea of decentralized storage so bought 10,000,000 Sia when I think it was something like 0.0029 BTC, and held for about 6-9 months, buying and selling some, then sold most recently, making a few hundred BTC. 

* All this while amassing more and more BTC, my first goal of course was 21, then forty something, then 100, 1,000... Btc is the gift that just keeps giving.


**Fuck ups**

* I once got ""hacked"" and lost 5,000 ETH and 10,000 LTC by having an image of my ETH and LCT wallets on my desktop as a PNG file. I must have had a remote thing and they got everything. It was really fucked up. I contacted the police but did not file a report, I learned that I am a total fucking idiot (my wife has literally been telling me that week to take our money out of bitcoin).

* I have tried shorting a few times a always have lost big.


**Habits**

* Trade ~~every day~~ every second and use multiple alerts for many coins.

* Never (almost never) use margin.

* Read, literally, almost all day everyday. 

* Sell when anything goes more than 3x (unless you don't want to).

* Use the Rake method (continue to take out a % of profits every time new portfolio highs are reached. ",2017-05-18 09:42:52

dhred25,poop_dragon,193,"Hope everyone is excited about the rally today! Glad to see everything is going well and just wanted to breakdown some of the conferences and events going on in the next week. I expect to see some great ideas from the developer community, while I also have my fingers crossed that we stay bullish by attracting some new investors and partners. 

*Here is what is on the menu.*

# **Today - 05/19 – [Ethereal Summit]( https://etherealsummit.com/)**

* **Notable Speakers** – Brian Armstrong (CEO, Coinbase), Joseph Lubin (CEO, Consensys &amp; Co-founder, Ethereum), Mike Novogratz (Founder, Fortress), Zach LeBeau (CEO, SingularDTV)

* **Notable Sponsors** – Microsoft, Consensys, SingularDTV

* **Conference Brief** - Ethereal Summit is a culture-focused blockchain event that brings innovators in the fields of governance, impact, sustainability, community building, arts and media together with experts in exponential technologies. We aim to highlight the technologies and innovators that are ushering in the next generation of the internet, and catalyzing our transition into a decentralized world.

* **Hot Take** – There are some huge names here, but I think the strength of this one is showing the range of what blockchain tech can do, at any scale - from ending world hunger to e-sports to running a government. Hypothetical or not this is exciting to show off some huge possibilities. Notably, this one of the first stops for a big tour unveiling of [Coinbase’s Token](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/66ehc8/brian_armstrong_confirms_token_is_a_coinbase/), which people should [checkout if they are so inclined.]( https://github.com/tokenbrowser)


# **Next Week - 05/22 and 5/24 – [Consensus 2017]( http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2017/)**

* **Notable Speakers** – Kevin Worth (CEO, CoinDesk), Vanessa Colella (Head, Citi Ventures), Stefan Thomas (CTO, Ripple), David Rutter (CEO, R3), Erik Voorhees (ShapeShift), Abigail Johnson (CEO, Fidelity Investments), Chris Ballinger (CFO, Toyota Research Institute)

* **Notable Sponsors** – Citi, IBM, Microsoft, Deloitte, Nasdaq, Dash, Ripple

* **Conference Brief** – CoinDesk is proud to present our 3rd annual blockchain technology summit. Consensus 2017 will feature 100+ speakers and 2,000+ attendees from the leading industry startups, investors, financial institutions, enterprise tech leaders, and academic and policy groups who are building the foundations of the blockchain and digital currency economy.

* **Hot Take** – *Holy Shit!* There be whales here. If the Ethereal summit is about the possibilities and the applications of blockchain, this is about the investing, the money, the economics, and even more money. It costs $1700 to attend this shindig, which is a drop in the hat considering people here are major players. With notable names representing bitcoin, ripple, and other blockchain technologies, I believe this is event can separate the men from the boys, and demonstrate how Ethereum can out-perform its competition. Expect buyers if this goes well.


# **Next Week 05/25/2017 – [Token Summit]( http://tokensummit.com/)**

* **Notable Speakers** – Muneeb Ali (Blockstack), Erik Voorhees (ShapeShift), Our boy Fred Wilson (Union Square Ventures), Shawn Wilkinson (Storj)

* **Notable Sponsors** – ShapeShift, ICONOMI

* **Conference Brief** - Token Summit is the first event that will explore the economics, regulation and best practices around blockchain-based tokens, protocols, and crypto-assets. If you are an entrepreneur, investor, finance professional, lawyer, fund manager, regulator, or business executive, you should start paying attention to the emerging token-based economy, one that might rival the web in terms of potential innovation, new business models and entrepreneurial ideas that are yet to be deployed. Join us at this exclusive, intellectually-driven gathering, grouping the best minds in this space.

* **Hot Take** – After all the big names earlier in the week at Consensus, this may seem like a drop in the bucket. Plus, Brian Armstrong is going to be exhausted too after pushing Token at his 3rd Summit in 6 days. But this seems to be mostly for the developers and entrepreneurs who are going to build off of the big names in blockchain. It aims at those who are innovating with lessons how to launch an ICO, comply with future laws, and connect with the landscape of investment funds. This is knowledge sharing and I hope ETH is at the center of it all.

dhr17q6,TGTheGoods,56,"Let's. Fucking. Go. 

We are coming off of a big win on Wednesday, most of us nearly doubled up our bankroll, I know I did. 

Last pick = Cavs -4 This was an absolute 💵💵💵BANKER 💵💵💵

I am bringing the heat with this one, and giving you 3 picks of STRAIGHT FIRE.

🔥🔥 Cavs -1 Q1 🔥🔥

If you think the Celtics looked tired in Game 1, wait until game 2, it's only going to get worse. Playing at playoff intensity takes a toll on the body, especially when you have played 14 games in the last 32 days.

The Cavs have won the first quarter against the Celtics in 4 of their 5 meeting this year. Not only did they win the first quarter, they covered this -1 spread. 

Game 1- Cavs by 11
Game 2- Cavs by 7
Game 3- Cavs by 6
Game 4- Bos by 1
Game 5(1)- Cavs by 11

Pretty good odds if you ask me. Last series against the Wiz, Boston lost the first quarter 7 out of 11 games, most of them weren't even close.

🔥🔥 Cavs -2 H1 🔥🔥

In 100% of games this year, the Cavs have won the first half, most of them by double digits. In only one game the would have not covered the -2 spread. 

Game 1- Cavs by 17
Game 2- Cavs by 7
Game3- Cavs by 1
Game 4- Cavs by 13
Game 5- Cavs by 22!

🔥🔥 Cavs -5 G  🔥🔥

Every part of me is saying Cavs cover this spread, my bank roll is already completely invested. The Cavs are going to take us to the promised LAND. 

James is hungry, he wants this sweep. At this point in his career, he realizes the benefits/importance of rest. He is going to come out hot and set the pace by playing strong defense and taking quality shots like we saw in game 1.

My opinion: Running a full node is great. The more the better. HOWEVER, if Bitcoin is actually going to become the foundation of a global financial system (which is what I thought this whole thing was about?), then it needs to be built with the expectation that most users won't run a full node... they won't know what that is, they won't care how it works, etc. 

Already over 99% of Bitcoin users don't run full nodes. That is fine and expected... it is a sign that Bitcoin is being used by normal people, not hobbyists.

dhsw1vi,bullit85,161,"Ach t_d. Was ist t_d? T_d ist das sub für das man sich als Redditor auf internationaler Bühne schämen muss. Wenn man t_d mit anderen Subreddits wie r/de, r/france, r/europe und r/sweden vergleicht, treibt es jedem anständigen Menschen die Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Selbst kleine Länder wie Österreich, Belgien oder die Schweiz haben mit r/austria, r/belgium und r/Switzerland international vorzeigbare subs mit hoher Maimaiqualität. Amerika ist gestraft mit t_d, dem sub der Versager. t_d beheimatet mit Abstand am meisten Arschlöcher im gesamten Reddit. Die Mods sind nur einige Beispiele für den unfähigen Abschaum der hier beherbergt wird. 

Glorreiche Zeit sind schon längst vorbei, dieses Sub liegt am Boden. Die Trumpete an sich ist durch und durch ein fauler Lump. Charaktereigenschaften die in jedem zivilisierten Kulturkreis als pure Faulheit, Unfreundlichkeit, Unfähigkeit, dissoziale Persönlichkeitsstörung und Dummheit gelten, erklärt der Trumpist kurzerhand zur t_d Wesensart. Ein weiteres zentrales Merkmal ist der alles beherrschende Minderwertigkeitskomplex. Deswegen projiziert der Trumpist auf jeden der in irgendeiner Weise besser ist als er, massive Hassgefühle. Besonders die ihm in allen Belangen haushoch überlegenen Demokraten sind ihm ein Dorn im Auge. Er neidet ihnen den Erfolg und Europäer steht ganz oben auf seiner Hassliste. Dieser Kontinent ist alles und hat alles was der Trumpist gerne wäre und hätte. Das die Welt der Trumpete ihr Lotterleben finanziert, interessiert den t_d'ler nicht, er glaubt sogar insgeheim er hätte es verdient. Anstatt sich aus seiner aus Neid und Missgunst entstehenden Lethargie zu befreien und sein sub umzukrempeln, ergeht er sich in asozialen Schmarotzertum und hält noch große Stücke auf seine vermeintliche Überlegenheit. 

Kulturell ist t_d eher schwach veranlagt, große Werke liegen lang zurück. Auch gilt hier bereits das Aussprechen des Buchstaben »t« als »d« als große Kulturleistung. Fortgeschrittene beherrschen sogar das Anhängen eines »cuck« an den Ende eines jeden Satzes. Das Leistungsniveau in der Küche bewegt sich auf überschaubarem Niveau. Eine Wurst aus gemahlenem Seperatorenfleisch mit Ketchup und Zwiebeln wird hier als Hot Dog und als kulinarischer Geniestreich verkauft. Jeder vernünftig denkende Mensch hält eine Wurst mit Ketchup wohl kaum für den heiligen Gral der Küchenkunst und wahrscheinlich noch nicht einmal für ein Rezept. Großzügig lässt der Rest der Menschheit den Trumpisten in diesem Glauben um seine Minderwertigkeitskomplexe nicht überhand nehmen zu lassen. 

Wirtschaftlich ist t_d ein einziges Desaster, selbst die späte DDR stand solider da. Ansonsten fußt die t_d Wirtschaft auf alternativen Blogs, irgendwas mit Medien und Pepe-Maimais wenn man den Universitäten glauben darf. Ungeachtet des wirtschaftlichen Bankrottes leistet sich der t_d'ler trotzdem Prestigeprojekte wie r/le_pen und r/the_Frauke die mangels Funktionstüchtigkeit als Kunstprojekt gelten soll. Ebenso beherbergt dieses t_d sämtliche Zentralen der »Wird-man-ja-noch-sagwn-dürfen«, die aus Marketinggründen auf das »Verräter« im Namen verzichten. President dieses Sub ist der lustige Agent Orange der mit seiner Prestige&amp;Prosecco Politik alles in den Abgrund reißt, was noch halbwegs präsentabel ist.

Kurzum: t_d ist der Fliesentisch Reddits. Es ist das für Reddit, was Griechenland für die Europäische Union ist und hätte t_d eine offene Kloake, wäre es das Rumänien Reddits. T_d ist ein Schandfleck, der Pickel am Arsche Reddits. T_d ist der Typ der ohne Einladung auf deine Party kommt, noch nicht mal Alkohol mitbringt und auch nicht versteht dass er nicht erwünscht ist wenn man ihm ein paar Zähne aus dem Gesicht klopft und die Treppe runterwirft. T_d ist das Detroit Reddits und gehört für 200 Bitcoin an 4chan verkauft.

so back in the day you couldnt really spend bitcoin on anything. there were a few companies that took it but generally you couldn't use it. but you could exchange it for other currencies. thats where the vulnerability lies. 

so lets say you purchase 1 bitcoin with your credit card. each bitcoin is signed with a specific cryptographic signature, the exchange you bought it from knows what bitcoin they sent you. you then go onto silk road and buy 1 drug for 1 bitcoin. well it turns out the seller is actually an FBI honeypot. They now have the bitcoin that you purchased from wherever. So they check with wherever and see who they sold that bitcoin to. Now you are screwed. 

BUT if you buy linden coins with cash and then use them to purchase the bitcoin the bitcoin seller no longer has a way to tie the transaction to you specifically. 

On the other side, as the drug seller, you now have a huge ammount of bitcoins but you want to purchase things with them. So you reverse them through the system to pop them out as cash. well now you have to explain to the government where all that cash came from.  so you purchase a shitload of lindens with the bitcoin and just say you got it from playing the game. 

These two examples are VERY simplistic explanations for simplicity. It is much more complex with many more steps when doing it in real life.

dhs7sgv,gotamd,47,"They never respond when someone makes a point they can't refute.  Here are just two examples from my Reddit posts:

* [Greg Maxwell declines to address my argument that a healthy fee market can and will develop without the Bitcoin network operating at the blocksize limit](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5psp2p/why_does_nullc_think_that_fees_will_be_zero_if/).

In both of these instances, I am 100% sure that nullc and/or bashco saw my posts or comment.  They just choose not to engage when they know that their bullshit has been called out.  Behavior like this (and these aren't the only examples I have, just the easiest ones for me to find) leads me to believe that the small blockers are being disingenuous and trying to mislead the community.

Do they want Segwit at all?  

-They set an unrealistic 95% mining adoption to trigger activation. Were they in fact hoping that would prove impossible?  
-UASF is also unrealistic and doomed to fail.

dhszy6i,mobark24,40,"To all the newbies who are getting their friends and parents into ETH, we are at ATH's. Investing in crypto is much more volatile than stocks, which have been trading at record low volatility. Vix on the S&amp;P has been around 11 for more than 6 months. Normal swings on S&amp;P stocks are below 10%. Be prepared for volatility with swings of 30-50% with cryptos.  Whales are out to smash you when you least expect it.  Worst thing you can do is panic sell and then watch it jump 20% the next day.  Financial advisors and media pundits are only beginning to mention Bitcoin/crypto, and they do so with a bit of embarrassment and reluctance.  Good sign that we are still in the early days.  FX markets trade $6 trillion a day, Gold market cap is $7 trillion, and the total market cap of cyrpto is a modest $70 billion.  So be prudent, take some profits ,i.e. 10-20% of your position on large upswings to satisfy that itch to trade and then buy back when everyone in this subreddit is depressed and asking to be held by someone.

dht6wpn,donaldrumpsfeld,36,"What convinced me that Mensch and Taylor are peddling lies (whether theirs or their ""sources""' lies, I don't know) was when they started pointing to specific federal case filings to support their claims.

Both of them use justia.com links to federal filings, which is just a third party service that captures, sometimes incompletely, what is available at $.10 a page from PACER, the official online filing system for the federal judiciary.

For example, in this article (https://patribotics.blog/2017/05/06/exclusive-six-fisa-warrants-granted-in-trump-russia-cases/) Mensch points to two specific cases, as captured on Justia to claim there are secret indictments of various Trump figures. However, neither case is sealed and both are available on PACER- the one in New York is an incorrectly filed civil RICO suit with a Texas attorney as plaintiff and various figures related to a failed bank as defendants. The one in Virginia is related to a handgun seizure.

A few days ago, Mensch was claiming that because Angela Lazar of insane CoinTelegraph fame (https://cointelegraph.com/news/my-war-against-onecoin-angelina-lazar-tells-it-all-part-1) is being sentenced next week in Alexandria, the story she ran with about Sean Spicer being involved in some kind of bitcoin scheme now is proven true https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch/status/865309334636560390 Except, anyone with a PACER account can look at the case in question and see the indictment was filed in 2009 and relates to a scam that ended in 2007, before bitcoin even existed: http://imgur.com/a/upqn8

Taylor does the same thing. However, if he's overtly wrong, he deletes the tweet. He's been posting lately about what he calls a ""MOE"" or ""Marshals Order of Execution"", which he claims is some kind of gigantic war plan for arresting Trump/Russia suspects (it's actually legalize sounding gibberish). He keeps using the acronym ""MOE"". When he first announced this theory the other day he posted the following: http://imgur.com/a/qpla8 He then deleted this post without explanation after someone used the actual court filing system to determine it's a lawsuit against Johnson and Johnson and has nothing to do with anything. However, it does say ""MOE"". ""MOE"" is the court electronic filing acronym for the Eastern District of Missouri. So somehow he found that case, looked at it, and invented ""Marshal Order of Execution"" to fit the ""MOE"" acronym, which anyone who is familiar with the federal court system knows to mean Missouri Eastern.  

Now his followers are claiming that the FBI raid in Annapolis supports his ""MOE"" theory (which, again, stems from him drawing wild conclusions from third party captures of federal court filings). Of course, the US Marshals serve arrest warrants, not search warrants. All reports, including photographic evidence, of the Annapolis raid show FBI agents, not Marshals, which is consistent with how federal criminal law works. In addition, the FBI would not be stationed in the ""basement"" of the Alexandria courthouse like he claims, but would operate out of the DC region field office.

I started following these folks a few weeks back. It honestly seems like Mensch is crazy and Taylor is basically rapidly escalating the BS he spews now that he's found notoriety and money doing it. It really is a fascinating thing.",2017-05-20 23:50:28

dhtc1f3,wintercooled,62,"Apologies if you already know some of this:

For a while now the official releases of the Bitcoin Core client have had code in them called SegWit. This segregates the witness data from transactions making more room for transactions in a block and but also it fixes something called transaction malleability. Fixing this makes the building of second layer solutions like Lightning Network possible and lots of other future developments easier to deploy. Lightning Network is ""Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude.""

Unfortunately the SegWit code is not yet active within the Core client which is by far the dominant client on the network. So it's in there but there is a condition that needs to be met before it is activated...

The developers released SegWit with a built in check that needs 95% of the miners to signal in their blocks that they are ready for it and have upgraded their mining nodes to it. Unfortunately miners are now blocking the activation of SegWit (and the solutions it then enables) because they don't want it activated. This could be because of a number of reasons like fear that second layer solutions like Lightning Network will reduce the load on the main Bitcoin chain and therefore reduce the fees they collect from users or that SegWit enables solutions that they are not directly able to try and control like the main chain. Who knows!?! There are plenty of reasons and most of them are ones that are related to the miners own profits and not in line with the desires of the majority of the network's users.

Whatever their reasons the majority of users and businesses do want SegWit and are frustrated by their blocking of it.

So - enter the idea of a UASF... &lt;insert dramatic music here&gt;

What are the changes?
The UASF (called BIP 148) isn't any more than a small number of lines of code. What it does is say that from August 1st onwards any nodes running it will reject blocks that miners produce if those blocks don't signal for SegWit. By gaining enough support via users and exchanges running UASF BIP 148 this will hopefully force miners to start signalling for SegWit and push the percentage above the 95% activation threshold and... activate SegWit on Bitcoin!

To understand the risks [this is a great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6bxpsj/bip148_and_the_risks_it_entails_for_you_whether/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) by Luke-jr that covers that better than I could.

If you already run a node you can upgrade it to run the UASF code or add a flag (called a uacomment) to your node to say you support it. If you do the latter is it important that you upgrade to run the actual code by August 1st. 

If you don't run a node maybe it's time to give it a try and support the activation of SegWit through user action! :-)

#My Story and Observations

The only two coins I hold are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most of my gains came from ETH. 

I was lucky (smart?) enough to buy the vast majority of my ETH below $13. My logic was twofold:

1. Until Bitcoin resolves its scaling issues, it's a sure-fire bet that other currencies will take the lead over time. The longer Bitcoin scaling remains un-resolved, the more other currencies will grow.

2. The best choice to me appeared to be Ethereum, based on its development roadmap. I have learned (mostly from reading these sub-reddits) to invest in something with utility and value. To me, Ethereum is such a coin. Bitcoin really only has first-mover advantage left and Core devs are presently destroying that.

I used the above knowledge to my advantage when investing. And it paid off. Also it's worth noting that even if Bitcoin Scaling does get resolved, the resolution process itself (forking) will likely be a *messy bloodbath*. I consider this another invaluable piece of investing knowledge. I invite you to use it.

You don't always have certainties in investing, but I feel point #1 above and Bitcoin's scaling-resolution-bloodbath are two certainties you can use to your advantage.

I think Bitcoin will *eventually* recover, but not after a forceful removal of the current devs. This may be at their own hands by forking themselves off the main network via a very foolish UASF.

I hope many of you are achieving similar success in your investing.

And if you have any advice for me, please share. I think one should never stop learning.

If you have any questions for me (that are non-revealing), please ask and I will answer to the best of my ability.

Coin Cap (for iOS) is the app I use to track my money. I recommned it for an easy way to track your crypto holdings. You can fingerprint lock it too, which I find nice for security.

I'd like to thank everybody in r/btc, r/ethereum and r/ethtrader for your insightful posts and friendly correspondence. It's a great community. Let's keep it that way (not not like the Bitcoin space which is highly toxic right now and very unpleasant).

Also, I'm going to take this moment to share my viewpoint on Bitcoin scaling. I am a ""big block"" supporter in the Bitcoin space. Yes, we do exist. And we do have skin in the game. Bitcoin *should* be allowed to scale with on-chain capacity like satoshi intended. And I do NOT feel Segwit is the solution. In fact I feel Segwit is the worst thing to enter the Bitcoin space since Blockstream arrived and since Gavin handed over his keys to the goons in charge now.

#Special Thanks

But I suppose I should be *thanking* all the toxic trolls and fake accounts from r/bitcoin, because if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have moved 80% of my BTC into ETH. And hence why I became a crypto millionare. I couldn't have done it without you guys. Thanks.

dhvlvnv,jeffrexsave,272,"Hello Redditors! 
Let me introduce you to Ethereum, the upcoming internet 3.0 


Ethereum is a world computer designed to change how we interact, 
just like the internet did 20 years ago. 


Like Bitcoin, it is based on a blockchain,
but Ethereum is much more than just a currency:


It can provide the backbone for banking, communications, the internet of things, e-commerce, software design, and much more


Today some major companies signed on to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Companies like Microsoft, ING, Deloitte, Intel and soon to be hundreds more. Check out this list: https://i.redd.it/skpunr9qoyyy.jpg


If you are interested in learning more about Ethereum, check out: https://github.com/Scanate/Ethlist for more info

dhvlley,nullc,114,"Redeployment of segwit basically can't happen until the old deployment expires.

The reason for this is because for simplicity and safety reasons all segwit supporting versions of Bitcoin only have segwit codepaths for the omst part... e.g. there isn't separate handling for segwit and non-segwit txn.  Segwit's current non-activation is achieved by a very minimal set of tweaks on top of that.  The benefit of this is that it makes segwit much simpler to implement and the change in behavior is minimized when segwit activates-- there isn't a huge pile of previously dead code that suddenly turns on (and maybe turns out to be buggy).

So in 0.13.1+ almost all of segwit is already active, including all the P2P components...  the new network service flag, the witness-tx and block messages, compact blocks v2, etc.   A redeployment of segwit will need to redefine all these things.

If the old deployment of segwit isn't over yet then _both_ have to be supported. And then you get code path duplication, a hard cut in behavior, and a problem of combinitoral testing.

Avoiding these issues is why BIP149 doesn't start until as late as it does. 

But if the original segwit bit has already expired, the change turns into a simple search and replace: no complex combinatorial testing, no duplication, no dead code that suddenly turns on.

The primary argument (and IMO pretty much the only strong argument) for BIP148 is that it doesn't have to wait for the original timeout to finish.

It's not like these challenges were secret either, they were already discussed in the context of the BIP148/149 tradeoffs. :-/

So it sounds like that proposal was made entirely without the aid of anyone who has even been following the discussions in detail.

dhvdl7v,fullmatches,68,"So the EEA has large ties to Consensys and other public chain loving Ethereum folks. It's organized on a principal of remaining interoperable with the public chain, so developments in the tech that come from the Enterprise space may filter to the public chain and certainly vice versa. This also leads to thousands and thousands more developers learning Ethereum, building on Ethereum, and thinking up projects both for their companies, and for the inevitable slew of spin-offs or startups they then go on to found. The general concept is that the more open the ecosystem and the more players putting their industry in the mix and their ideas and becoming stakeholders is good for both sides of it. Yes some of the companies using Ethereum are likely to just absorb the benefits of the public chain into their private products but the benefit to the public chain and adoption of Ethereum from that can be large as well.

Finally, don't discount the effect that adoption from enterprises has on the view that regulators, governments, other companies, etc have of Ethereum. It frames it much differently from the somewhat wrong public impression people may have of Bitcoin due to its attitude and association to drug markets. If a government official asks what Ethereum is and names from Microsoft to Merck to Infosys to DTCC come up, it's hard for them to say ""okay, let's ban this!""

dhvmyml,todu,60,"I'm still against Segwit due to the Segwit 75 % signature discount that makes normal transactions more expensive. Flexible Transactions solves the same problems and does not have such a discount so I strongly prefer Flexible Transactions instead of Segwit.

Assuming that this ""compromise"" activates then the 2 MB hard fork is just a *temporary* solution to a problem that needs a *permanent* solution. We can't start arguing every time the blocksize limit needs its next upgrade. 2 MB will only last for about half a year (maybe shorter) before blocks are full again. The longer we wait to activate a *permanent* solution (like Emergent Consensus or preferably BIP101) the more ossified and harder to change will the Bitcoin protocol become. It's imperative that we solve this scaling conflict before that happens or another cryptocurrency will eventually take Bitcoin's dominant network effect and dominant market cap away from it.

So I'm strongly against this ""compromise"".

If Roger Ver and Jihan Wu agree to activate Segwit according to this ""compromise"" designed by Barry Silbert then I will no longer consider the resulting version of Bitcoin as being Bitcoin anymore. To me it will have become an altcoin. In that case I'll sell some of my ""bitcoin"" and later buy more of /u/ftrader's future Bitcoin spinoff (/r/btcfork) that will be ""the real Bitcoin"" in my mind. Or whatever coin the Bitcoin Unlimited project decides to support. It could be /u/ftrader's Bitcoin spinoff or some other coin. We'll have to wait and see what they decide to do in that scenario.

If Roger and Jihan accept this ""compromise"" and start voting yes to activate Segwit, then I will be disappointed in them and not consider them to understand what Bitcoin really is and how it's supposed to function.",2017-05-22 16:53:18

3. Yes the trade volume is in the billions, but that is mostly due to trades with other cryptos. Trade volume to USD is about $50-150mm daily. The increase in BTC supply might create enough of an arbitrage to be noticed and help prevent the price from dropping too much. However, it also might scare others into dropping their BTC too and lower the price even further. See the 2010 Flash Crash for more information on how this happens.

dhx52by,Metasaurus_Rex,210,"Since you asked, here are my opinions on the top 10 coins by market cap.

Bitcoin – The first and original, will be in high demand for the foreseeable future, but market cap is so big that there’s less potential upside than the smaller coins. The brand is super strong, but in terms of practical usage the network is backed up and the mining community has huge political fighting about how to solve its problems. So it’s not practical to shop with until they solve the scaling problem.

Ethereum – Probably still underpriced despite the recent gains and all the hype. Huge amounts of business projects are falling into its gravity well and many big companies have signed on to the Ethereum Alliance. Still has big scalability problems that are a long way from being resolved so could still have some tech disadvantages compared to up and comers despite its powerful momentum. I like it long term.

Ripple – A protocol for bank settlements. Not really a cryptocurrency, and not even a blockchain, but so many big banks are backing it that it went to incredible heights. One of the fastest transaction speeds on Earth and the ability to change between any currency, but centrally controlled unlike all the other top cryptos. Many millionaires would disagree with me but I’m not interested in investing in this at all.

NEM – The technology behind this is a beast. Most coins here are variants of bitcoin but NEM is 100% new code with a layered design that makes it ultra fast while still able to scale and do most of what Ethereum can do. The development team has not done a good job of explaining what it’s good for, so it’s baffling to many and it’s somewhat under the radar. I like this one for a long term hold.

Litecoin – A clone of Bitcoin with many fixes to Bitcoin’s problems. Faster, better in many ways, with a thriving development community. Still, it’s an advanced first generation crypto and I would not expect it to compete all that well with the 2nd and 3rd generation blockchains that have world-changing abilities like decentralized applications (Ethereum and NEM.) Litecoin will probably be around in the future but I don’t expect it to be at the top. I like it for the short term.

Dash – Slick, fast, anonymous, targeted at being a practical currency for shopping for everyday use. Has a really low number of coins so it’s easy for the price to get high. They have done the best job at marketing and have been spending 6 figures a month on promotions and PR. They have gotten some traction and I like the fact that they have picked one function and attempted to own it. They were doing really well a couple of months ago but seem to have lost momentum. I am neutral on this one.

Ethereum Classic – Well, when Ethereum was young it went through a rough time and actually split into two blockchain projects. This is the evil twin and is really a different product now. Their main selling point is that they will never break the rules (its big brother did) and you can trust them 100% to do what they say because obviously they were willing to have one tenth the success in exchange for sticking to their guns. I’m not sure why a business would use this instead of the other Ethereum, which pretty much seems to do everything better.

Bytecoin – I have heard a lot of discussion that this is a scam coin. The developers are all anonymous, the testing and vetting phase did not seem to happen, and the code is not accessible to see whether they can run off with everyone’s money. This is all hearsay, I haven’t investigated any of it myself, but there are enough red flags that I’m staying far away.

Monero – Monero is the best coin for anonymity. For this reason it’s the favorite of Dark Web users who don’t want their transactions known. Pretty clearly there will always be demand for this, so most people think Monero will be around a long time. The development team and fan base seem solid, but it’s sinking into a niche role as the bigger coins start to attract the attention of banks and Winkelvoss types. Monero is a bit tainted by a seedy reputation so it will never get invited to the country club. I’m mildly bullish for a long hold.

Stellar – Stellar is a blockchain that’s actually doing what Ripple is pretending to do. It’s a protocol that’s able to do fast international settlements between currencies, but it has a bit more use for individuals too. It’s not as well-vetted and hasn’t attracted as much attention from big institutions, but it’s an exciting enough prospect that it came from way behind to the top 10 in a very short time. This will probably creep higher in the top 10.

It's an amazing technology, yes - but for doing what? It's amazing for giving freedom and power back to people. Is that a marketable thing? How do you build a company on that?

If a technology that enables freedom and decentralization is truly valuable in the eyes of a company, why did so few companies care to invest in ensuring that the web (as envisioned by Tim Berners Lee) remained decentralized? And now we're overrun by censorship, lack of privacy, and government control.

The reality is, they all jumped on the Internet because they saw business opportunity, not because they gave a shit about people's freedom or people's voices.

Bitcoin is OUR technology (you, me, and every individual who uses it because they are sick of government control, sick of waste, sick of corrupt banks, and sick of being financially powerless). It's a sword tempered in the flames of rebellion and activism. We can easily stand to lose it, overtaken by corporate minions.

Of course, it CAN be used for interesting things like smart contracts and payment as a protocol - but the reality is, all those thing could be implemented by a central body if it was adopted enough. For example, if Apple Pay became popular enough, it could easily DO those things in a centralized way where you have to trust Apple 100% (as you'd have to trust a Bank or the Government). It's not revolutionary primarily because of how fast you can pay, or what blockchain technology offers. It's revolutionary because for the first time NOBODY can STEAL your money (given your own diligence in protecting it).

&gt;Kik Points was introduced to experiment with a transactional unit of account within the Kik application.
The project was sunsetted at the end of 2016 in order to prepare for a more advanced solution that
would extend beyond a purely advertising-based use case. However, Kik was able to measure demand
and gain valuable insights into user behavior with transactions in a messenger context. During a 2.5
year period from 2014 through 2016, Kik users completed 253 million offers and spent the points earned
on 74 million purchases.


&gt;The Kik Points experiment was successful, with an average transaction volume of 300,000 transactions
per day for its lifetime from 2014 through 2016, reaching 2.6 million transactions per day at the peak. On
average, the monthly number of transactions was nearly three times that of the Bitcoin network.6
 

Um guys... this is huge. This isn't a speculation token, this is a token that will have instant implementation through Kik. Millions of people will have the ability to use this in Kik transactions. 


I'm interested.

Edit: Also adding this quote from the white paper

&gt;Facing the complexity of raw cryptocurrency technology is
typically onerous for most consumers. Issues of transaction
fees, private keys, and alphanumeric addresses create usability
barriers for mainstream users, including the common
requirement to hold cryptocurrency in the first place in order to
obtain and utilize other tokens.7 Kik will aim to significantly
reduce these onboarding frictions. The onboarding process for

di0rvpl,brownies0,64,"It's a good question. As a recent bitcoin enthusiast, I also had the same confusion when researching how to store my bitcoins safely. There is a really great wiki for [how to choose a bitcoin wallet](https://howtobuybitcoin.io/#How_to_choose_a_wallet_for_storing_my_Bitcoins) with the differences between cold vs hot storage and online vs offline wallets. 

Briefly summarized, here is how to choose a good bitcoin wallet and the differences between each type:

- **Web wallets** - there are websites or browser extensions that are super convenient and easy to use for storing small amounts. Some people also use the term ""online wallet"" when referring to a web wallet. Web wallets are considered unsafe, so I never store more than I'm prepared to loose on these. Again, **never store all your bitcoin on a web wallet** (exchanges are considered to be web wallets). Some good web-wallets: Blockchain.info, Greenaddress, &amp; Coinbase.  

- **Mobile Wallets** - these are great for making quick and easy payments on the go. You can use the QR code scanning ability of your smartphone to easily pay merchants and friends. These are also considered unsafe, so the same precautions as above apply. Some good mobile wallets: Breadwallet, Mycelium, AirBitz, &amp; GreenBits.  

- **Desktop Wallets** - Far safer then the above wallet types. Slightly less convenient, as you'll need to bot up your PC every time you want to make a transaction. Providing you are comfortable assuring your own desktop's security, these can be a great way to store a certain amount of your portfolio. Some good desktop wallets: Electrum, Multibit, &amp; Armory (very secure, but advanced users only).

- **Hardware wallets** - there are a very popular method to safely store your bitcoins. Hardware wallets keep your private keys away from hackers. Some people refer to this type of storage solution as an ""offline wallet"". They do however need to connect to make transactions. All the same, this is currently the best compromise between safety and convenience. Some good hardware wallets: Ledger Nano, &amp; Trezor.

- **Paper Wallets** - these are actual pieces of paper where you'll print out your private keys. A paper wallet is considered to be a strictly ""offline wallet"" and/or pure ""cold storage"". You'll need a paper wallet creator (software) to do this. Once printed out, people generally secure their paper wallets in a safe at home or at the bank. The inconvenience is that you'll need to recreate your paper wallet each time you make a transaction. Bitaddress is a good paper wallet creator.

The difference between **hot vs cold storage** is that hot storage solutions expose your keys online, while cold storage solutions never allow your private keys to be in any way ""loaded"" online. Some people make the same distinction between **online vs offline** wallets. Pure cold storage wallets (such as Armory) will sign your transactions totally offline, and you then broadcast the transaction using an online machine.

di0zofy,ZiggyPenner,63,"These bitcoin price spikes are an unavoidable consequence of its design. We are watching what in a normal economy would be considered a deflationary spike.

Currencies have 3 purposes:
1. Act as a medium of exchange
2. Act as a store of value
3. Act as the unit of account

The first two are relevant to this discussion.

These two purposes work together and against one another depending on the situation.

Due to Bitcoin's underlying design limiting the amount of total currency, it very strongly fulfills the second purpose. It's utility as a medium of exchange is also undeniable, particularly for anonymous transaction, fulfilling the first purpose.

These deflationary spikes represent the push and pull of the two purposes.

Because of the limited number of bitcoins, whenever there is deflation (rising bitcoin price) it gives a very strong incentive for existing holders to stop trading them and hold. Prices steadily rise and then spike as fewer people are willing to trade them. However, if no one is trading them, their utility as a means of exchange drops accordingly.

The deflationary spike ends when so few people are trading bitcoins on the market that it is no longer a usable currency. Demand for the currency drops accordingly. Falling demand causes the value to begin dropping. Now the currency no longer fulfills either of its purposes. Those holding panic and begin selling. The currency price crashes accordingly.

As the price drops the currency slowly begins being useful  for trade again, as lots are available. The price crash slows as the trade utility increases demand once again, putting a floor under the drop.

Once stabilized the currency begins fulfilling both duties very well. The underlying deflationary nature of the currency then takes hold once again, restarting a slowly rising currency price. Restarting the cycle.

I took a long look at my model and couldn’t figure out why it was so off. I mean I know it loses occasionally, but not by that much. What I did was took out game 2 stats, it was such a blow out that it was screwing up all the numbers. Game 5, I am not going to go with my gut, I am not going to assume that a certain player is going to show up or not show up, I am simply going to trust the system that has gotten us this far. I am using the following information I got from my research to make my picks.

I understand a lot of us got burned in the first half on Tuesday night and that is fresh on the mind, but I am trying to make a pick not based on emotion. 

Vegas did a really good job on these lines but I think I found a weak link. It is the only bet that has a big enough margin to bet. I will not be placing any other bets on this game without adjusting the spread.

di0tehh,Kibubik,56,"I'm not sure I was clear enough the last time I said this, so I'm going to try again.  Here is my tough love.

Back in 2013 I learned about Bitcoin when it was on its major run-up.  I panicked at around $800 trying to get Coinbase to verify and let me buy my first bitcoin.  I had to get in before it became the world global currency, which at the time everyone was saying was going to occur in a matter of months.  Wow!  The world changes quickly.  I bought my first bitcoin at $1036.

While I was waiting for Bitcoin to explode in popularity, I imagined all the smart people who bought bitcoin at $1, $3, $30, $80, etc.  It didn't seem fair.  I'm smart!  I'm nerdy!  Why didn't I know about this?  What if I woke up a millionaire?  I wouldn't need to tell anyone; I would know, my little secret.  Maybe I'd get a drink with an old friend and confess my new wealth.  I'd watch his face light up with admiration.  I'd get the check.  I'd sleep well that night.

This day-dreaming went on for a while.

Eventually I learned about trading.  Trading.  Bingo.  Here is my chance to prove myself.  If I couldn't get in early on bitcoin, I could trade my way up to an early user number of coins.  And the best part is that I could make money on the way down too.  Bitcoin crashing?  No problem, I'm riding a short and making more bitcoins.  At some point, I'd make enough to say, ""Ok, I'm done.  Now I'll sit and watch my wealth grow as bitcoin becomes the future.""

I think most of you know where the story ends.  I'll tell you anyway.  It end with lots of stress.  With sleepless nights watching the screen.  With a girlfriend that leaves you.  With poor performance at work.  With risky decisions to make up for the failures.  With an inability to ever quit no matter what.  With less money.  With less crypto.

I know you picture having 2x, 3x, 4x the current amount of coins you have.  I know because I did.  I know you run what-if scenarios all the time in your head.  But don't trade.  If you want more ETH, buy some, send them to your wallet, and sleep well at night.

You are in early on a major world transformation. Let it happen. By getting greedy you risk missing out on the entire revolution.

Edit:  My condolences to anyone who was liquidated or suffered loses during today's flash crash. You will recover but not through more trading.

di10b4z,todu,53,"&gt; set the precedent that the block size limit should be kept above demand, thereby serving its original intent as a simple spam filter.

I think it's more accurate to refer to the blocksize limit as a DoS protection and not a spam filter. Describing it as a spam filter will probably confuse some people because ""what is spam?"". The DoS protection was to protect the network from malicious miners back when the Bitcoin network was still very young. 

The miners today would not even attempt to DoS attack the network by creating gigantic blocks because they understand that such blocks would just get orphaned because they would be too slow to propagate and they would lose their block reward.

Edit 4: Putting this before Edit 3, because Edit 3 won't make sense if it isn't the last thing you read before my extended comment:

By the Old Gods and the New, yes, I understand the ""hot coffee thing was blown our of proportion by corporate lobbies"" to try and cap lawsuits... I thought it was an easy example that everyone could understand... Something like, in a contemporary example, a cell phone exploding in your pocket, and you get to sue for $25 million (Please don't message me about particulars - I am just trying to find an example everyone has heard of that can lead to someone becoming wealthy through sheer circumstance).

Edit 3: I never really expected this comment to garner this much attention. Honestly, I didn't think it was my best work, and it probably only got so many upvoted because I was early to comment. But while I have whatever meager platform I have right now, I’d like to clarify:

I absolutely do not dislike Kushner because he’s wealthy. I was born in Manhattan, moved to New Canaan, CT, went to college in New Orleans, moved back to Manhattan, then to Santa Monica, then to the San Fernando Valley. I’ve lived in places with outrageous wealth, and heartbreaking poverty, and witnessed all the income inequality in between. I grew up with, and now have, more money than some, and less money than others. 

From my perspective, being “wealthy” is about as arbitrary as being “fast.” Some people work hard and earn a fortune. Some people create indispensable additions to society that make them fabulously rich… Other people win lawsuits over overly hot coffee, or have a friend who creates something amazing and happened to give them some stock in that invention, and other people bought bitcoin… It’s pretty much like throwing darts. It’s just as likely you’ll become rich from abject luck as you will from smarts, diligence, or foresight.

Most extremely wealthy people, though, simply win the genetic lottery or marry into it.

What drives me crazy, is that people equate wealth with intelligence or capability. These things are absolutely not correlated. You can be incredibly wealthy, and dumber than a bag of dickhair; take it from me, I went to high school with some of the oldest money in the country (New Canaan, CT), and went to school with kids who were in remedial everything classes, who then went to Ivy League schools, and ended up working for Major Wall Street banks. 

My original post was insufficiently descriptive about what really, really annoys me about Kushner. 

I’ll disregard the fact that the guy defends his criminal father (not petty crime either, the guy was a world class corporate criminal and asshole), and corrupt father-in-law, that his family bought his way into prestigious schools, that this family made its fortune as slum lords. I’ll also disregard that he lied about 1 billion in assets, and his meeting with everyone’s favorite Diplo-Spy, Kislyak. I’ll even disregard the fact that he seems to be a pretty shitty real estate developer, despite all his advantages.

This guy has an unbelievably important role on the *worldwide stage*. His *official responsibilities* are no less than: 
1)	Negotiating Peace in the Middle East
2)	Solving opioid addiction
3)	Diplomacy with Mexico
4)	Diplomacy with China
5)	VA reform
6)	Criminal Justice reform
7)	And the most bullshit title of all – Office of American Innovation (which is literally The Swamp thinking up ways to fuck the American people in ways Lobbyists can’t legally do)

Kushner has ZERO governing experience. Kushner has ZERO public service experience. Kushner has ZERO drug addiction experience. Kushner has ZERO diplomacy experience. Kushner has ZERO experience with Veterans, healthcare, or the intersection of the two. His ONLY experience with the legal system is seeing his crook of a father sentenced to prison. 

There is nothing, absolutely NOTHING, that qualifies this fucking dweeb for ANYTHING of this magnitude of importance besides one thing: 

	He was born rich enough to marry the president’s daughter.

	That is all.

So… he is the literal personification of the intersection of undeserved privilege and nepotism. This is the same kind of shit that, as Americans, we have derided in lesser developed countries for years: The idea that some rich “prince” should be in charge because of such arbitrary bullshit.

But you know what really, when I think about it, annoys me most?? 

If Kushner had even a fraction of the brainpower he was being given credit for, he would have told his daddy-in-law something along the lines of “Mr. Trump… While it’s a great honor that you are putting even more on my plate… I have to politely decline. These are really serious issues, and deserve someone who really understands them, and has the time to fully embrace them.”

Did Kushner do that? No.

Why not? Because he’s a smug, entitled asshole, who thinks because he was born wealthy, he is smarter and more capable than everyone else. Just like Trump. 

Does he ever talk to the press or American people, despite all the many hats he’s been bestowed, to let them actually know what he’s doing with all his responsibility? No, never. Know why? Because the press, and the American people are beneath him, and he doesn’t need to bother telling them shit. The sheer arrogance of someone with zero qualifications being in charge of so much, all because he happened to luck out be born with extreme wealth, is fucking sickening.

So, there you have it. Yes, my initial statement was very vague, and probably seemed shallow… But here is the breakdown of why I made that initial comment in the first place.

di12ah6,jystrebler,73,"Okay. Stop.  Breathe.  

Your mom?  I hate to say this, and I don't know all the circumstances, but your mom is a grown adult who is responsible for herself and her actions.  

Maybe it's time to set some appropriate boundaries.  Like, you don't expect your mom to pay your bills and you won't pay hers.  I don't know.  Family relationships are complex.

But if you bought 10 BTC and sold them because times got tight, that means you were buying BTC with money that you couldn't afford to lose.  The money you bought your BTC with was money that you would need the first time things hit a bump in the road.

What you've lost is maybe $25,000.  You sound young. That sounds like a life-altering sum of money, but I'm telling you that it is not.  If you're like me, you'll make and lose sums of money like this many, many times over before your time on this rock is over.

So, if you still love BTC, then buy what you can afford. Even if it's $100 worth.  But make sure it's an amount you can afford.

Use your other money to DEFEND that position.  Overbuying into bitcoin is pretty much just as bad as underbuying.  If you are putting in money that you will need in order to eat or go to school, you're putting WAY too much money in.

Put in a modest sum.  This is not really an investment.  You can call it that.  You can think of it that way. But it's an asset like Gold that has very little intrinsic value.

It's only value is as a store of wealth or a way to conduct financial transactions.

Bitcoin could be worth $0 a year from now.  I don't think it will, but nobody can guarantee that it won't.  I always say, bitcoin will be worth $100,000 or $0.  Maybe even both at some point in time.  You can't know.

Buy back a little.  Don't let anybody know you have it, including your Mom.  Buy a little more every week or month.

I don't know your finances, but if you want bitcoin, buy $20 a week.    Buy $50 if you can afford more.

You feel like you missed out on this train and a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I'm telling you, that's not true.  I have felt the way you have felt countless times in my life.  

But other opportunities will come up.  We don't know when, or even what they will be, but there will be other opportunities.

And it's not too late for bitcoin.  You didn't buy in thinking that the run was going to be over at $2,800.  If this thing is going to run, it's going to run a lot farther than this.

So, buy back with what you can afford.

And for what it's worth, you sound young.  I wish I was as woke as you when I was your age.  Microsoft had its IPO in 1986 and if I had invested, I'd be a retired gozillionaire by now.

I didn't, because I had no clue about tech company IPOs when I was 21 years old.  Didn't even know what they were.

You are light years ahead of where I was at your age.  

So, even though you're not asking for advice, my advice would be, if you're young:

1.  Keep looking for this type of opportunity.  You spotted it once. You'll spot it again. 

2.  If you want to be in bitcoin, get into bitcoin.  You didn't get into this to quit when it hit $2,800.  If it gets to $30,000, that'd be like a 10X return on your investment.  That's just good money, I don't care who you are.

3.  Make sure you are investing in YOURSELF!  More important than bitcoin is to make sure you're continuing and furthering your investment in the most important thing a person can have in a knowledge economy:  your mind.  If you're not in college get in college.  If you graduated from college, get a graduate degree.  Make sure you're earning a living that gives you money that lets you defend your position in your home-run swings like bitcoin.

4.  Learn your lesson.  Get back in if you want and HODL.",2017-05-26 00:36:38

The Kik Points experiment was successful, with an average transaction volume of 300,000 transactions per day for its lifetime from 2014 through 2016, reaching 2.6 million transactions per day at the peak.

di2bsfv,keysikgg,60,"I know that a lot of people here never used Kik before and have no idea if Kik's token launch makes any difference. I would like to share my opinion.

Kik is chat app, but there is huge demand for payment method like this there. It has been heaven for scammers and ewhores for past few years. 

Ewhoring community is huge and Kik has been #1 platform for that since it came out. People are earning hundreds of dollars every day by selling fake cam shows and nudes to older guys. Just search for ''kik sexting"" or kik ewhoring and you will see that there are thousands of people doing this for living. Main issue for them was that they could accept money only via Paypal because they can't get bitcoin from their customers. Later, purse.io came out and they started accepting Amazon gift cards instead of paypal, and they have been exchanging it for btc for years now.

All scams(in game items, steam games, social media pages) are run through kik as well, which doesn't surprise me, since kik is used mostly by teenagers. 

There will be a huge demand for these in app transactions just from this stuff. There will be of course legit use of payments as well. 

Sending someone crypto money through messaging app which they can exchange for btc/eth/usd/euro anytime... is HUGE. It is exactly what we needed. This is purest example of mainstream adoption of crypto.

di3sqs8,kustonoy,95,"Hey guys, here is a crosspost on my preliminary take on the ""situation"":

Ok, that's an interesting development we have here, mainly because BTC is up for a correction, which could be serious. Having survived (in profit) the past altcoin bear period last Fall, there are two things that matter:

1. The length of bear markets/down corrections are in general shorter than bull markets, but *take as long as necessary* to introduce new money and kill off weak hands. Only as soon as new money enters the game, the bad traders/investors will be flushed from the market, battered and broke and then the price will rebound. For this reason: The stronger the rise, the longer it takes to flush out the bad money from the market. It took Bitcoin over a year to do this because so many terrible longs were installed within months in 2013.

2. If you call a bottom and it starts recovering, it's not the bottom and it will go deeper. The bottom is deeper than most expect and takes a lot longer to find. The coins that have already corrected heavily, will find their bottom sooner and will go sideways until they recover. I would urge people to *not double down ~~DCA~~ this*. Do not increase a losing position, unless you have very good reasons to do so.

I personally like such situations because there will be ""-30%"" candles soon on some of the ""rising stars"" (like GNT or STRAT). There are a lot of bounces to be played in this volatility. Also, do yourself a favor and don't listen to people offering clear answers like this https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6debk4/i_predicted_the_last_3_lifts_offs_the_next_one_is/ . Markets are *not* deterministic and every market guru will get rekt hard sooner or later. Markets are chaotic, non-Markovian and impossible to predict, mainly because they do not obey physical laws but random crowd mood swings.

If anything, this is the right time to study sentiment and crowd psychology (or just go outside until markets recover!). I might write a longer, more coherent analysis, but now I am going to observe.


**EDIT: Sorry guys, I meant not to double down in this situation, DCA (dollar cost averaging) is of course a long-term plan and might be in-line with your way of investing!**",2017-05-27 17:15:30

di41pwl,shyliar,85,"I've used both LTC and BTC since 2012. I started with BTC and then discovered LTC. Even in 2012 there were discussions of the limited transactional capacity of BTC, five years later it's still being discussed. In 2012 having already made a purchase with BTC I was dissatisfied with the slow confirmation times and the necessity of additional coins seemed obvious. I suggest you make a small investment in both coins and try moving them around from wallet to wallet. You'll see the lite/light quickly.

Here's a list of reasons I like Litecoin:

- Capable of eight times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability. 
 
- Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.

- Blocks are not full.

- The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.

- Anti-spam.

- Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 7,153 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (7,153TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

- Continuous development look here at number of releases in past few years: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases 

- Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2017: https://litecoincore.org/

- Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.

- Great community. Definitly helps when consensus is needed.

- Unlike bitcoin, it is possible to make changes to litecoin.

- Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify.

- Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets in fact volume has remained high month after month for years.

- The speed, liquidity and value of Litecoin is useful to traders seeking arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.

- Now on coinbase and will be on bitstamp in June.

- Fair release. In a crypto world of premined and ICO releases many appreciate this fact. The code was released well before the Genesis block was mined and everyone knew when it would be going live; therefore, individuals could anticipate and get their miners and software ready.

- It's primary function is to be a cryptocurrency.

- Still mineable in many western countries even after electrical costs are factored in. Here in Canada my Titans still make a profit long after shutting my Neptunes down.

- Many low value coins can be merge mined with it increasing profits for miners.

- It will always maintain the integrity of the blockchain (no hard forks for special interests).

- Recently activated segwit on it's network with virtually 100 percent consensus.

- The possibility of utilizing sidechains for smart contracts without the possibility of corrupting the original non-turing complete blockchain.

- Potential of using the Lightning Network as a method of increasing transactional capacity.

- Security.

di2zoww,lbalan79,73,"There is a difference between being in this for the money and being in this because you believe in the technology. If you are in this for short gains / day trading / cash grab then probably you will get influenced by a graph like this and sell / buy based on trends and emotions ( some correct and some not ).

If you are in because you believe in technology and the amazing novelty of having a digital financial system ( with all it encompasses: store of value, daily transactions, etc ) then this graph means nothing. You would also buy at a perceived ""high price"" or perceived ""low price"". If the technology is really to succeed then there is no way usd / btc even makes sense anymore. 

In other words if you have a doubt ( even small ) about the tech behind this ( or you don't understand it ) then get out before you loose everything.... 

My two cents.. and feel free not to agree.

**Update**: Few clarification points answering to some constructive comments:

* As many pointed out, the term ""bitcoin technology"" might be way too restrictive in the above assessment. It should probably be encompassing the wide spectrum of achievements that bitcoin has potential in... including technology, social impact, global spread, etc.; an ecosystem  ( replacing technology with ecosystem for the lack of a better term ). Yes there are other more strictly technological advanced cryptocurrencies ( LTC for example ) but none that have the infrastructure, ( legal support, tools,exchange network app base , etc) that BTC has. Also BTC is the de facto currency to reach novel obstacles and try to find solutions and compromises. 
The entire scaling debate and network issues come from BTC reaching critical mass adoption points that no other currency has reached yet. Yes, other currencies see what happens here and try to replicate proposals under BTC or  adapt in different ways. At the same time BTC is still the first to scale to these critical points and to always push the limits of the current ecosystem. Will this change? Maybe yes or maybe not but that is not the topic now.

* As for both approaches not being mutually exclusive, sure that is a valid point. At the same time, personally, buying and selling does bring a huge risk. As someone pointed out for every success story there are other tragic, embarrassing stories. I never advice however and would only express a personal point that if you believe in this ""ecosystem"" you should worry about increasing your stake as a primary goal.

* BTC/USD is valid now as a global measure of value for BTC. If ( this IF can be as big as a lottery ticket or as much as your heart believes in the ecosystem ) BTC becomes global and it is to succeed then probably USD would loose its value as a global measure of value. This is highly subjective of course.

PS: Thank you again to everyone that replied. Having constructive views / opinions and a healthy discussion is what the community is supposed to be....

di3t7tp,jam10o,67,"&gt;   “Why are you using a blockchain?” 

That is really what his points boils down to, and is absolutely a valid argument against many of the projects in this space. Many projects are simply using hype and buzzwords as a marketing ploy to gain investment. Many projects in this space are using a blockchain for bragging rights, and not because it makes technical sense for them to use a blockchain. 

He's totally right about that, certain existing businesses and products using blockchains don't actually gain much real benefit from doing so, your product needs to have decentralization as one of its goals to benefit from blockchain technology, otherwise you're just being inefficient. I'm also talking about Spotify here. 

What he's missing, of course, is that when it comes to Ethereum the blockchain isn't the only piece of the puzzle, it is a solution to the problem of immutability in an open distributed database. There are other technologies that can be used with Ethereum (whisper, swarm, ipfs, etc..) that decentralize other parts of the problems people face, they have great value together, and is something that the author has seemingly missed completely. 

The most important thing to remember about Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other permissionless decentralized systems is that they can't be stopped. Literally can't. They might be able to be attacked or upgraded into a state that is different to what they are now, but it is not possible to for them to die without stopping every single user on the network. 

Early in the interview he says this:

&gt;If you have
a database, make it centralized and regulate the controlling entity.

That betrays how he's missing the entire point. The entire answer that was a part of is missing the point. He thinks blockchain is about data standards and communication. It's not. Blockchain is about data ownership and  permanence; not in the ""I've saved this file on x computers, so now it's safe"" kind of way, but in the ""I've made this decision and now I can't take it back"" kind of way. And there's no point in claiming ""I've made this decision and now I can't take it back"" when you are talking to yourself, it's only a useful statement to make when communicating with others.

It has nothing to do with ETH being overvalued, it's all because of Bitcoin price. If you look at coinmarketcap, you see that every coin is down. That is because Poloniex markets and and BTC pairings are the biggest for every coin. So Bitcoin drops, all drops.

There are still all the fundamentals staying same for Ethereum. Nothing has changed. There is very solid base for price to rise and this might actually be good place for flippening to start.

And again, speculation isn't bad thing. It helps community to grow and develop all the projects. And investment wise, that's why VCs are billionaires, not millionaires. They are willing to put money on the risky projects in early stages where they do see potential, and thus they will make exponential profits as well.

Yesterday just proved how many of us are too emotionally involved with ethereum, I'd give an estimation that 75% of us are fixed on the changing price of ethereum.

If your trading, fair play... but to every average joe out there you should not be playing the whales and traders at their own games, you will lose in the long run as these volatile markets are not for amateurs and they will take your precious ether for fun. 


My Dad text me yesterday asking if he should pull out until it all blows over (@ $130). Unless you see Vitalek handing over his private keys for the ethereum vault to Satoshi Nakamoto, you shouldn't be selling until you need the cash / are ready to exit. Yesterday was a buying opportunity, not a selling one.

Here we are back at $175 and the trend is starting to look bullish, prediction is to be back in the $200's come Tuesday. Yesterday has put us in a much better place than bitcoin, an excellent bounce back and now at a ratio of 0.08 and still growing. This is all part of the rise of ethereum !

On-chain governance protocols that avoid ""fragmenting"" the community are great until there is a cartel that forms and starts making coercive decisions about the protocol. 

To some degree, I think allowing the community to ""fragment"" is necessary. ETC demonstrates something really beautiful about contentious hard forks, in that, if you really don't support what is happening, you don't have to go along with it. 

I also recommend checking out Vitalik's tangentially-related article [here](http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/03/14/forks_and_markets.html) about the effectiveness/coerciveness of hard-forks as a governance mechanism. 

However, I think it's something that the Ethereum community should keep an open mind about. If we can learn anything from the difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, I think it should be ""Don't fight the new things, adopt them (if it makes sense).""

This is the *whole* problem with blockstream.  They decided that bitcoin can't scale onchain to VISA [so they erroneously decided that onchain scaling was not worth putting effort into].  They abandoned Satoshi's ideas [because they think they know better] and formed a company to capitalize on their expertise and layer 2 strategies.  Then they set about justifying why bitcoin should not scale onchain and didn't need to scale onchain using every underhand and diversionary tactic they could muster. They are sell outs and greedy opportunists who feel like they should have been the ones to invent bitcoin and are jealous of Satoshi's achievement and the number of coins he mined.  Of course, they are essentially dishonest - never being open about their true feelings and motivations.  

Surely, 2 or 4mb onchain scaling a year ago, or even now, would be *useful*.  It would have stopped the chaos, stopped the confusion, stopped the backlogs, stopped the fighting, proved that hardforks can work, grown the bitcoin user base, and allowed more time for research and development.

di4n1fp,ff2c9,50,"My story:

Note. Timeline below is not 100% accurate but gives the gist. 

2013: 
Significant debt (&gt;2 yr salary not including mortgage), had no choices, no savings, no pension. Struggling with mortgage (which was interest only). No one who knew me would have even guessed. I had a nice house with loads of useless stuff that I was beginning to hate. 

Mid 2013: 
Found out about bitcoin mid 2013 but could not afford to participate. This triggered something in me. Something needed to change. I created a spreadsheet and looked at the full mess I was in for the first time. Shit. 

Late 2013: 
I had learned as much as I could about bitcoin and my past approach on money had now dramatically changed. Purchased a very small amount on bitcoin late 2013. 

2014: 
No motivation just discipline. Each item of debt on the spreadsheet was now systematically being tackled or reduced by any means I could. Fines and late payment fees that previously drained my last pennies could now being used to pay back further debt. 

Mid 2014: 
Slow but steady growth of my collection of bitcoin. Every row that was deleted from my spreadsheet of debt I allowed myself to buy a little more btc to add to the collection. 

Late 2014: 
Started a pension with money that become free from more debt being cleared. This was the beginning of a new relationship with money. Things were starting to change. My future self was starting to thank me. 

Early 2015:
All useless debt (non needed mobile phone contracts, extra cable/internet etc) that I had built up were now gone. Now time to tackle the 'consolidation loans' from early 2008-2010. My tally of btc was growing. They were my small rewards. 

Mid 2015:
By this time the money I had free from reducing my debt was now used on overpaying my loans. I was setting up a position to clear all debt by early 2016. Credit cards were now all paid off and closed. Purchased a little more btc - made sure I rewarded my small wins. It was the only thing that kept me sane. 

Jan 2016:
All debt now paid off. All that was left was my overdrafts. I had been living in these for 2 decades. 

April 2016: 
Overdrafts all paid off. I think I ate porridge for 2 months to do this !

May 2016: 
Put my house up for sale. I didn't need the space and it just reminded me what an idiot I had been. I was a fool for buying this and buying into the hype (mid 2006). 

June 2016: 
Sold my house. Made a little on it which was great. This was the first sign of being fully debt free since 1998. 

August 2016: 
Moved out to cheaper rental property. Bitcoin collection was now healthy. I actually had some spare money after savings for additional rainy days savings. Pension was now being maximised. 

Oct 2016:
Went on vacation for first time in 11 years. Got married to my childhood sweetheart. 

Dec 2016:
Rainy day fund (full contingency) was now saved. Took a lot of energy not to put this in bitcoin !

Feb 2017: 
House deposit finally saved using some bitcoin and some monthly savings. Put this in separate pot. 

April 2017:
Bought a property that I love and I move in in June. Plan to overpay the mortgage from the start and have built a full savings pot with rainy day funds. The collection of btc still growing strong and acts as a reminder of how far I had come. 

Today: 
I have zero debt. I have options. I now only spend what I don't first save. I have more than enough contingency for all bills and a healthy pension pot, healthy savings and healthy btc position. 

I am still not finished. There is more I can do. I lost 20 years to debt and because of that I missed lots of opportunities. I was very angry at that. I was mostly angry because it was my fault. I was such a fool. It took a long time to let that go but took much longer to see it. 

Now I save for the future, DCA a little bitcoin for long term holdings and laugh a lot with my wife. We will be having our first child next year. 

TL,DR: Bitcoin completely changed my life for the better. I owe a lot to bitcoin. I will always be grateful for what it has given me. 

Thanks for asking the question OP.

di4n0j1,HorseMiddleStar,35,"Hi Fam,

Long time lurker (over a year) who just finally managed to gain enough comment karma and registration days to post. 

A little bit on my crypto-trading history: I started investing in Bitcoin in Feb 2014 immediately following the dip during the Mt. Gox debacle and hodlded all the way through till January of last year when I went full retard (100% ETH). While it's only been a short 3 years, but has felt like a life time with all the hodling through the ups and downs, sideways and diagonal movements :)

I'll be honest, I can't trade for shit. I might get lucky here or there but for me, trading has always been a zero sum game. While I wish that I possessed the intellect, knowledge and experience that many of our valued members here at Ethtrader have, I obviously do not. So in lieu of intelligence, here is some wisdom (based off of my many many investment failures) for the many new members entering this amazing space:

While you might think you're the smartest person in the room, it's never the case. There's a saying in Chinese that says if there's one high mountain, there is always one mountain higher. I've made the largest returns by:

1, Investing in projects which are lead by people who are significantly more intelligent than I am (Vitalik)

2, By putting my money behind money that is significantly smarter than I am (The majority of the ethtrader community)

3, By understanding that the people part of the equation is equally, if not much more important than the potential of the project. Amazing people drive amazing results, despite the challenges or constraints of the business environment. Before investing in Ethereum, I spent several days reviewing through all the youtube, watching Vitalik and Gavin speak at multiple conferences and at the end of the day, it was a no brainer for me.

Following my experience as above, over the last few months, I have also diversified into GNT as well as purchased a stake in Bitfinex during the limited window of opportunity in February.

Actively considering investing in Tezos as well, although after reviewing through some of the interview videos (read point 3) my enthusiasm for the project has waned a little and i'll be reducing my original investment amount by half.

There's a lot that can be gleamed from the many investment opportunities that will come your way by doing an ample amount of due diligence... make sure that you not only look at the intelligently written white papers, but also take the time to observe the people behind these projects.

I'm thrilled to finally be able to be an active member of this community and can't wait to see all the fantastic things that are coming our way!",2017-05-28 08:15:57

I joined the cryptocurrency world couple weeks ago when I paid for the bill at a restaurant. My friend gave me his part not in cash but in ETH. On the spot, he made me install Jaxx on my phone and sent me 0.15ETH. I looked at the EUR equivalent and it said 12EUR. I had absolutely no idea what to do with it and just forgot about it. I then opened up Jaxx couple days later to see that my wallet's worth has doubled and I was mesmerized. Since then I spent about a week reading and educating myself on what is blockchain and specifically how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin and my interest grew. Since then I purchased 5 additional Ethers at ~ 148EUR with the intention of holding for a longterm, because I like the tech.

While not a bull flag, this is a *strong* continuation pattern. Seriously folks, we've seen this 20 times in the last year and a half.

Which leads me to believe we're not even close to being done. Look at this chart. Can you even utter the words parabolic? It's not there. Not even close. Not compared to the past. Now sure, past performance is no indication yadda yadda. But, bitcoin fractals like a motherfucker.

If we'd have gone to $3,500 or even $4,000 without correcting, it's possible the ensuing 50%+ drop would have ended the rally. As it is, we fell a hair over 30%. Absolutely, smack-dab in-line with every single ""continuation correction"" during this rally.

So, here I am once again yelling at you guys. This place did a spectacular 180 over the last two days. You're getting 22% off of the recent ATH at the current price, in a bull market, with the big move yet to come... and many of you are selling. But, I'm okay with that this time. I've just got to focus on my own shit, and truth be told, just like before, it's just adding fuel to the fire.

di68e23,CryptoInvestor,69,"The privacy factor is good yes, but what businesses will pay for is the risk reduction. Sia stores your data across a global network up to 30 times. You will ALWAYS have access to it, even if there is a country wide outage like we saw with Amazon in March this year. Truly redundant, private, global cloud storage. Sia is the future of long term data storage. I was an early Bitcoin investor (late 2010), then Ethereum (pre-sale) and I have not been as excited about a project since either.

For clarity I wanted a decentralised cloud storage asset to add to my portfolio last year and investigated Storj and Sia, and ended up choosing Sia. Their product and team are important, but that can change. What Sia deliver on is their unwavering focus for enterprise grade tech, and as an investor its where the money (e.g. data volume) is. Storj want the consumer market. I have a feeling Sia will end up winning both.

Edit: Feel I should add this point because people keep asking me about it. Who provides the storage? You and I do. Anyone does. There is a financial incentive to offer up your hard drive space, your empty disk space spinning in that data centre rack you pay a fortune to rent, or that data centre your company has built whilst you sit waiting for your business to grow. Hosts are ranked on a points system so uptime is rewarded (and demanded by enterprises). You earn Sia for hosting space which you can put back into the network to buy space or sell for USD/Eur/GBP/your local currency on your local exchange. Next month a Sia backed project called Minebox starts shipping (minebox.io) and I expect network capacity to grow massively.

I think we can all agree it's kind of absurd that something completely digital like Ethereum should pay the same for security as a hundred tons of a raw metal. 

I mean, if the transaction time was 4 days, and someone complained that “A TX takes 4 days, let’s improve this,” I don’t think it would be fair to respond “Yeah but to send gold to them in the real world, it would take that long also.” 

Sure, maybe speed (or, in this case, efficiency) aren’t the *only* thing to consider when building a really useful blockchain, but they certainly are incredibly important. 

That also assumes that we want Ether to be anything like gold. To some degree, yes, store-of-value is nice. But if store-of-value was the end goal, then Bitcoin would serve that purpose well enough. Ethereum would not be needed.

I think what I’m trying to say is that Ethereum is exciting for *everything-other-than* currency. Decentralized trading. Prediction markets. Decentralized digital identity. Curation markets. 

Another difference is that, in the case of miners, they are as much a liability as they are those who help maintain the protocol guarantees.

di7ufzm,etherael,274,"To sum up and maybe not 100% nail the technical details for the sake of simplicity.

Block scaling or segwit scaling are both solutions to the scaling question, one privileges providers of on chain transaction space (critically some would claim, at the expense of one of the core defensive properties of Bitcoin, decentralisation), thus providing other parties direct incentive to oppose them, one privileges providers of second layer transaction space, and discounts their costs on the rest of the chain, thus providing direct incentive for the block scaling faction to oppose them.

Segwit scaling wants its solution and is blocking on chain scaling, miners want on chain scaling and are blocking segwit activation. The incentives are clearly misaligned, and there is an impasse. Many conspiracy theories swirl around both parties in addition to that, but in my humble opinion the fundamental simple incentives are all that is required to explain the state of things as they stand.

So, BIP148 is just the most recent shorthand referral to UASF, and UASF is the segwit scaling group attempting to force their rule change through regardless of the consent of the block scaling group.

Both sides have technically accurate points in support of their position, both sides have economically accurate points in support of their position, many people will insist that side x is demonic and side y heavenly and many others will insist the inverse. I believe this is an artefact of the human proclivity to sculpt a narrative of good guys and bad guys. There aren't any good guys and bad guys, there are just guys, and their incentives, and how they respond to them. In support of this I would recommend that you read some of the comment histories of the primary participants and shot callers in the debate, you will find Adam Back for example talking explicitly about the cost tradeoff for the strategy (digital cash vs digital gold) which blockstream and core are intent on pursuing, and you will find Roger Ver and Jihan Wu talking about off chain transactions and second layer scaling as something they're not fundamentally opposed to, they simply don't want to be forced into a corner and prohibited from competing.

But, you know, I could be wrong, and all.

Meanwhile, the fundamental technical underpinnings of the project have been duplicated in many other products and spread around to a few viable competitors with genuine technical innovations built on top of those underpinnings in a sea of simple valueless copycats. The core point being (if you'll excuse the pun) that if both the warring factions don't get their shit together and make nice and continue on with actually delivering on the product which the project was created for, they're going to be left in the dust by their competitors in the long term, so the impasse becomes more urgent with each passing month.",2017-05-30 16:13:12

You'll notice that Eric singles Jihan out. There are other miners signaling for EC, or not signaling at all, but Jihan's name comes up over and over. Jihan has been extremely abrasive and frequently irrational on the topic of bitcoin scaling. He changes his stance regularly and tweets out bizarrely ignorant comments daily. From this we can gather than he hasn’t been following the technical discussion around bitcoin scaling. Because he doesn't give two shits. It's all a show.

I believe the true motive of Jihan and Bitmain is to support the appointment of a centralized authority who will oversee bitcoin development. This is why he was initially friendly and aggregable towards Eric, until it became clear sometime later that Eric couldn't speak on behalf of core or single-handedly fulfil any promises made. Same with the HK agreement - the core devs present couldn't just make a promise, go home, and whip out a new release of bitcoin core. But that's what Bitmain wants. This is why they are supportive of BU, which has [centralized governance via an elected president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Unlimited#Governance). This is why they are now in favor of the NY agreement, which allows the signatories to assemble their own development team.

To hell with that. Jihan and his supporters can make their own bitcoin client all they want. And no way in hell will I run it or support it. Never. The compromise is only a compromise if it retains decentralized development governance. If it does not, it is just a malicious fork. And the unfortunate thing is, people might go for it. People are getting desperate almost to the point of caving in to such demands. Jihan knows this. It's been to his benefit to prolong the stalemate right up to the breaking point.

The first sentence becomes really easy to parse :)

But the second is horribly technical. :(

Basically there's a problem with the hashing of blocks (the ""double SHA256 scheme"" can be gamed by selecting inputs [transactions], which is problematic, because it means some transactions simply have a very reduced chance of getting into a block even if they use a fee similar to the lucky transactions).

Do you know what's hashing? It's making a fingerprint of data. A mathematical function, similar to a fingerprint, because you can check if two fingerprints are equal, but you can't recreate the body that left the fingerprint from it.

The hashing scheme is .. a classic cryptography problem (if you want to know more, read about HMAC). It turns out that bitcoin has a weakness (no biggie, crypto is hard), it must be patched, but since there are people actively exploiting this weakness and that brings them a lot of profit, they don't really want to patch bitcoin (that's a uh, a rather huge biggie).

What's segwit? It's adding an additional fingerprint (hash) to every block. It's good for a lot of reasons. [see](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/segwit-explained) the most important is that it enables layering of cryptocurrency solutions on BitCoin. (Which will enable smaller networks to live on top of the big bitcoin blockchain. Those smaller networks can have veeery different rules, but they can still provide the global guarantees of bitcoin when they interact with the btc blockchain. (Basically using btc as a clearinghouse for smaller/faster/cheaper networks.))

di7bm1x,zeptochain,44,"I'm curious and somewhat confused by two aspects of this diatribe in particular: 

First, why would honest (intelligent, profit-seeking) miners simply decline to take exorbitant fees that resulted from a so-called ""fee-market"" idea introduced by the developers of the core software? Why are so-called core developers now complaining that the very thing they designed for is apparently working as they intended (by inaction on throughput, and obviously counter to usability)?

Second, why is it that the demonized mining pools are the very ones that are signalling support for a solution that would _reduce_ those fees and ensure the long-term health of bitcoin?

Either I'm missing some fundamental and enormous big thing point here, or Lombrozo is merely engaged in delusional thinking.

di7vro5,kekcoin,41,"An answer I gave earlier to someone else, hopefully this will catch you up enough:

Segwit is currently the best horse in the block scaling debate in short-term by far, while also fixing some bugs that are required for mid- to long-term scaling solutions. It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past, before this possibility was discovered, made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia. This backwards compatibility alone (aside from the other benefits it offers) makes it superior to other, more naive solutions such as ""just increase the blocksize to 2mb"" as this would require the entire network to update their software to succeed.

Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism [naively gave veto power to the miners](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/i-support-uasf-for-segregated-witness-75d9ef286fe5), the ones that are making [insanely high profits off the fees right now](https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees-usd?timespan=all). Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its [secret patented tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jJDD2Aj8k). Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has [a CVE number](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=+CVE-2017-9230).

UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by [over 10% of listening nodes in the network](http://uasf.saltylemon.org/uasf_percent_all.png). What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF [led the miners to fold on their blockade](https://medium.com/@shaolinfry/litecoin-china-roundtable-and-uasf-40b2cdd18611). On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks.

With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. [Being passive is not the safe, neutral option](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/bip148-and-the-risks-it-entails-for-you-whether-you-run-a-bip148-node-or-not-b7d2dbe85ce6).

Forgot about the price for a second guys, I think we all need to sit back and reflect on the last 24 hours...

We broke ATH's on both fiat and against bitcoin. Bitcoin was tanking as ETH was rocketing, the flippening is real... There is no doubt about it that ethereum is going to be a market leader. The write up on OKCoin couldn't have put it better, move with the times bitcoin or get left behind. The ratio is the real number we need to be making gains on to separate ourselves.

We recovered from 110 back into the 200's in less than 48 hours. I hope the lesson wasn't too costly to anyone selling near the bottom expecting to buy back in cheaper. The only safe proof plan is to hodl and has proven time and time again with this volatile market. 

I said in March that I'd be happy at $100 by the end of the year, it's blew every expectation out the water.

di9hr9u,sbasd265,157,"So, for the first time tonight, I think I've finally realized I shit luck stumbled upon the biggest goldmine of 2017, and quite possibly of the entire decade.

I got a crude reality check tonight as I browsed personal finance threads on Reddit just lurking around. I mean fuck, how they talk about money over there. How saving $250 extra a month over there is creaming pants, and how 30 years of doing it will get you X amount of $'s in the end, and were over here talking ""When's $300. We want $300.""

I think as time has gone by we've gone borderline delusional, we're fucking fiends, we're fucking criminals for talking about a 100% price rise in the next 7 months as a conservative estimate after what we've done this year already, are we fucking high? 

The scariest part is, I believe it is only the beginning. The space is only growing and ether is cheap relative to its intrinsic value. This year may be the year people look back on absolutely kicking themselves if they ever heard the word Ethereum or Bitcoin and didn't pay attention.

In all, if you ever feel underwhelmed by your profits or feel like you've missed out:

di95azb,MidnightOnMars,143,"Mandarin speaking household here - we're scanning Sina Weibo (China's version of Twitter) right now for sentiment regarding Ethereum launching on OKCoin and Huobi tonight. I don't read Chinese well so I'm relying on telling family members what to search for and having them read to me so it's not super efficient.

There is a moderate volume of comments but it's not a trending tag sitewide so I can't really say just how much there is. I don't think this is the main place for discussion, just like the focus in the west is on Reddit rather than Twitter. I don't know of any Chinese discussion forums for crypto yet, but if someone can point me in the right direction that would be appreciated.

Chinese investors are discussing things much like Western forums are with the same understanding of the market and the same amount of trolls. Sentiment is exceedingly bearish on BTC (Bi Te Bi), there was a warning that ETC was ""fake"" and to be careful not to purchase it, and very bullish on Eth (Yi Tai Bi) along with a little love for ZCash (Jia Mi Bi) because of JPMorgan's involvement.

People are saying Ethereum will become much more valuable than Bitcoin and have mentioned that it has risen from $8 to $220 USD just since late last year. There are comments about its surging market cap and market share as well as it replacing the aging technology of Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin dominance is down to 45% cited in multiple posts. Also, there are a whole lot of people not into crypto who are responding to these comments saying they don't get it and wondering what Ether truly derives its value from. Also a few trolls saying Vitalik looks nerdy and making ""fuck your mom"" jokes based on the fact that the ""Bi"" in YiTaiBi sounds a lot like a character for lady parts.

The EEA members supporting the technology are mentioned and cited as a reason for Ethereum's legitimacy as well as why ETC is fake. 

So, I don't think this is the main place for crypto discussion, but it's a start and it seems clear to me that Chinese crypto investors are just as crazy and up to speed on the details as we are. People are excited about the launch, but we'll have to wait and see what that translates into in terms of trade volume.

I think the current situation is much more bullish on the medium term (next three months) than it appears from all the desperation reigning in many bitcoin related subs, I have three points to make: 1) RSK is currently live on testnet and in about a month it will be on the mainnet, so btc will very soon be a competitor of ethereum about dapps, much before any actual dapps will be of any use to the general public, so it's not like btc has already missed the smart contract train. All the dapps are portable to RSK with minimum effort so they can't be considered a reason to move investments exclusively to ethereum. About the ethereum enterprise alliance, it's certainly bringing good publicity to them but it won't positively affect the price of ether in the long term as those companies will only use their own private chains. 2) The scaling debate brought a lot of drama and contributed to reduce bitcoin dominance, but it looks like it's finally being solved with the NY agreement, and if the leaked roadmap is realistic, we could have an implementation of the compromise before august, I think the price could go up a lot if the scaling drama will really be over. 3) In this and other related subs there is a lot of spam from ethereum supporters that is causing fear and the sensation that the dominance could switch soon, but in the real world bitcoin is still a lot more popular and nearly nobody knows what ethereum is. On Google trends the dominance of bitcoin is very clear. Reading only on Reddit could give you a biased idea of how the two projects compare in popularity.

All this considered, I think that if everything goes smooth with NY agreement implementation and RSK release, we'll see btc go up in dominance again near the end of the summer.",2017-05-31 18:50:21

From now on, blocks will always be full (not only because we have much more users and use cases, but also because there are nefarious actors who want to drag Bitcoin down by spamming it (and possibly profit from alts)). 

Bitcoin became too important - so as soon as it gets bigger blocks (be it 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 MB, 16 MB, 128 MB or whatever), these blocks will get filled with transactions. The bigger blocks, the smaller fees, the easier to fill the whole block with unimportant transactions or outright spam. So, network will always be ""at max capacity"" as you wrote - and it is bullshit that it is avoidable.

It is good that blocksize was not increased. Wallets are forced to face the reality sooner (the reality that transactions are not free and that there might be other users that want to pay more to have their transactions confirmed) and there is incentive for developing off-chain solutions sooner than later.

There will not be enough room in blockchain for every possible transaction - for all the coffees for all the billions of people and for all the sub-dollar-worth payments people would be glad to be making. Don't pretend the opposite.

The unique proposition of Bitcoin is it's censorship resistance that comes from it's decentralization. If you keep increasing blocksize too fast we are going to lose it.

di8wl6o,BobAlison,50,"&gt; An entirely predictable and avoidable outcome — skyrocketing fees and network at max capacity — has come to pass, with the predicted results. Base block size was not increased, despite having years to plan the upgrade, years to avoid the preventable consequences of high fees driving away use cases and users away from Bitcoin. Failure to increase a temporary DoS limit — base block size limit — has direct, measurable, negative economic consequences.
&gt;
&gt; It does not matter who played a role in this, or why. ...

Agree that the who doesn't matter. The *why* on the other hand matters a lot because the outcome may not be as avoidable as it might appear.

Very few users are comfortable entertaining the idea that Bitcoin's serviceable period has expired. The protocol outlined in Satoshi's white paper bestows economic incentives on rule-enforcers and extracts penalties on rule breakers. These incentives can be bypassed when the network is small and the value it represents low. But a very different beast emerges at the end of 7 years of continuous operation and relentless exchange rate growth. That network will fight change relentlessly whatever its source and however well-intentioned.

Moreover, Bitcoin's governance model has evolved in a direction that has become ever less compatible with major protocol changes. Bitcoin was established as a Benevolent Dictatorship under Satoshi. Under his successor, more participants began to have a say in project direction. The block size limit question prompted a short-lived revival of Benevolent Dictator model, which backfired. Half a dozen or so competing implementations now run on the network, reducing the influence once enjoyed by the ""Core Developer"" role. Alternatives to Bitcoin have very rapidly risen to prominence. Each new entrant goes places that look ever more out of reach for Bitcoin.

This is decentralization. It means massive effort will be required to get your way. It means you're probably going to end up disappointed with how slowly things change.

There's a chance that protocol gridlock is inevitable price of success for any system like Bitcoin.

Edit: The actual conditions don't matter. What matters is that these conditions are rather vague, so if the fake prediction falls flat on its face, the analyst can claim that the prediction was actually correct but the conditions were not met. And if anybody is able to persuasively argue that the conditions were actually met, then the analyst can use his trump card and say that he never claimed it *would* happen, only that it *could* happen.
