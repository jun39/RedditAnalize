Don't forget widespread memes about ""hodling"", buy the dip, and a cultlike following.  Now people genuinely believe it will replace gold as a safe haven asset.

dmdor1h,kuronekoi,55,"Your analysis is an oversimplification of the value of Bitcoin. 

Many people don't see Bitcoin as a currency to pay for goods, instead they see BTC to safeguard their money from the international economy. In this sense, BTC's value doesn't come from how useful it's to pay for stuff, it comes from how good it's to protect your money.

But, the value of Bitcoin doesn't extend to that sphere only. Think about how much miners are paying to produce 1 Bitcoin and then ask yourself if there isn't a relation between this value and some of the ""intrinsic value"" of BTC (in other words, I'm pretty confident that while the price is moving to the cost of producing 1 Bitcoin, the change rate decreases and it's probably very hard for the price to go below it). 

The other value (that's related to the previous one) comes from the fact that Bitcoin is a very secure network that's very hard to ""hack"", since there is a lot of miners with very huge investments in hardware and infrastructure and thus you would need a very very big investment to attack the network successfully at which point it doesn't even make too much sense to ""destroy"" it. 
You can't say the same about a lot of other altcoins that are mined, since their mining network is very weak. 

The final values I consider come from the technology and potential, and many people are speculating about it, but with rational reasons; it might be overvalued in this sense, but even if it was and the price faces a correction for this, I'm fairly confident the appreciation of the value of this technology will increase with the time just as the dot com bubble exploded, and then it just recovered with time.

dmdofh3,BTCrob,48,"Of course it's speculative. That doesn't mean it's in a bubble. It probably WILL bubble someday, but when most people have barely heard of Bitcoin, and probably less then 2% of the population own Bitcoin, and with very low institutional dollars invested (yet), we're not even close to a bubble. When the dot com bubble burst, EVERYBODY was in the market getting rich (on paper). You'd have janitors buying second homes and cab drivers giving hot tips. When that happens, I'll be worried.

About your use case, it may have been INTENDED to be a currency used to buy goods and services, I just don't see that as likely. It's inherent deflationary nature suggests that people will always be loathe to actually spend it. Why purchase everyday goods and services in a deflationary currency that will be worth more in the future when you can buy it at the same price in an INflationary currency that will be worth less in the future? It just goes against everything we know about human economic behavior.

I think it is much better suited as an investment asset class, as you say. But that doesn't mean it's a ponzi scheme. Is gold a ponzi scheme? Are bonds? Is the USD or JPY? The fact is, the global financial system badly needs an instrument to function as both a store of value and inflation hedge. Probably 90% of golds value is because it serves that role (the other 10% being jewelry/industrial use). But gold is an imperfect player, Bitcoin is much better at playing those roles.

It seems likely that in the future, it will be best practices for every investment portfolio in the world to hold some exposure to BItcoin, whether it's 5% or 10% or whatg have you, that's going to mean a market cap of trillions of dollars and a coin price well into the 6 figures, perhaps even 7.

dmef9jb,Becausereasons1,31,"Cryptocurrency only has value if viewed as a currency in itself. If the sole reason people purchase the currency is to cash out and make money in terms of fiat dollars, then the currency has no place in the future economy. 

Example:

 Say you buy one bitcoin and watch the price go up $1000 in a month and then sell the coin to make $1000 profit so you can buy a new TV. Good for you, you rode speculation and turned a profit that benefits you in the current state of economics. 

On the other hand, say you held onto the same coin to the point in time at which cryptocurrency is equally as useful in day-to-day commerce as fiat dollars. Not only would the bitcoin be highly valuable  as compared to a dollar bill, but it would be pointless to even NEED to ""cash out"". 

That's the overall hope of crypto and the reason these coins are valuable in the first place. It's all speculation until the day crypto is used as interchangeably as a dollar, yen, pound etc. 

That's the long term game of crypto investing. Of course, if your goal is to make quick cash by day trading then feel free to gamble on the volatility.  That's also an easy way to lose your hard-earned fiat.

dme38a5,joyrider5,28,"https://www.coindesk.com/f2pool-reneges-mining-pool-pulls-segwit2x-support-hard-fork/

Another miner is not going to fork to segwit2x.  F2Pool. That is 2 miners who have backed out now.  The majority of hashpower still commited to the NY Agreement which calls for a fork of bitcoin without broad consensus and arguably without majority dev, user, or coin holder consensus.

I believe this is long term bullish but could be short term bearish as it draws attention to the segwit2x FUD.

Segwit2x needs to have overwhelming hashpower support, which it never had (had 85% at one point), in order to kill the bitcoin blockchain and force the bitcoin developers to emergency fork to keep bitcoin alive.  Arguably forcing an emergency fork was the only way segwit2x was ever going to be considered to be Bitcoin, because as long as the Bitcoin blockchain is mined often enough to get a difficulty reset in a reasonable amount of time, exchanges will need to continue calling it bitcoin.  If Segwit2x could have gotten 95% hashing power it would have forced an emergency fork and it would be up in the air which of the forks was the real bitcoin.  It is becoming more clear now that Segwit2x is not bitcoin, but a forkcoin.

Edit: Sudden spike in transactions following the news, very inorganic, spam?  Enemies of bitcoin probably getting worried about the lack of user support for segwit2x.  Their best bet to get user support is to raise fees by either spamming the network or mining empty blocks. https://twitter.com/lopp/status/903343303193759744 ",2017-09-01 04:27:08
