efgk25z,Darxchaos,25,"This guy spends a lot of the article criticizing another study on Bitcoin's power use, rather than tackling the actual point. 

But when he does get to it, his claims get pretty retarded.

&gt;However, it is completely incorrect. Most of those who administer the Bitcoin network and provide security (called miners) are located close to cheap, and underutilized, hydro power facilities. I recently spoke several times and at length to former power industry colleagues in Hong Kong and their estimate is that more than 80% of all Chinese miners are located in Sichuan province. The vast majority of power produced in Sichuan is from hydro power.
Mate, this is entirely anecdotal. And even if it was true, it would mean China is basically running Bitcoin, as China has absolute control over everything in their country.

&gt;I was in China late last year and visited Sichuan and some of the locals told me that officials are extremely keen on crypto because it leads to more jobs and taxes. There was a policy to curtail renewables development, as there was so much overcapacity, until crypto arrived.

Hahaha, no. Crypto only brings in only a couple technician jobs and that's it. And crypto users use crypto to evade taxes, not pay them.

&gt; A recent report into crypto energy use, done by Coinshares, which is the only honest, data-driven report ever to be undertaken[4], concludes that almost half of global bitcoin mining takes place in Sichuan. Overall, they estimate that 77.6% of global bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy. My former colleagues in Hong Kong and I think that the real amount is closer to 85% and rising. This is mainly concentrated in cooler climates with abundant, and underutilized, hydro power, including: Quebec, Iceland, and the Pacific North-West.[5]

No, just no! I couldn't find any evidence of so-called underutilized power. It just isn't something that can work. If an area has too much power, it's sent elsewhere or exported to another country. Effectively, this means that every watt spent on mining is a watt that could have gone to someone's home or a factory.

&gt;Using his impressive ability to make up numbers, de Vries compares the Bitcoin network to the Visa network. It is a spurious comparison for at least two reasons. First, the Bitcoin network is stand-alone; it is the entire system. Visa needs the banking system to run, in case you hadn’t noticed. It isn’t stand-alone. (You can see him thinking to himself: Darn it, I knew I forgot to include something. Like, the entire global banking system.[10] Gosh, I wonder if it uses much electricity?). Second, he compares number of transactions but conveniently ignores the value of transactions. If you do the comparison based on value, not number, of transactions, his entire analysis falls to pieces.

This is complete nonsense. Visa is an entirely different beast, handling tens of thousands of transactions per day worldwide. If Bitcoin was used by billions of people, they would only get a few transactions in their lifetime. Even if those transactions were high value transactions, it would be completely useless. Numbers matter.

&gt;In most industries, low-quality speculative blogs written from home by completely biased people who know nothing about the industry they are talking about, like what de Vries has produced, would just be ignored.
I find this very ironic, given that I'm reading a low-quality speculative blog. Such a lack of self-awareness.

&gt; Crypto’s carbon footprint is extremely moderate for being the world’s largest computer network. Its energy efficiency gets better every day.

It's energy efficiency is improving, yes. Because miners are shutting down due to the low price. But fundamentally it is not.

&gt;It isn’t perfect, but its goals are noble: greater wealth equality for all, the reduced impact of a deceitful banking system, and an opportunity for financial inclusion for the poorest amongst us. 

This is the stupidest thing I've ever read. As has been proven over the years, Bitcoin is an oligarchy run by the richest to extract as much wealth as possible from ""investors"". Libertarian trickle-up economics at it's finest!

&gt; It doesn’t displace other users of renewable resources; it mainly draws from unutilized hydro capacity and it contributes to local communities.

You keep mentioning this underutilized hydro, yet there is no evidence of it's existence on the internet I can find.

&gt; At its heart it is honest money and a force for good in the world. To those of you in the community, hold your head high when questioned about crypto’s environmental impact. Your work is important. There is no reason not to be proud of the system that Satoshi created.

Really coming off as brainwashed here.

All I saw was more of a hit piece on De Vries' Bitcoin energy study and attacks on journalists than an actual cogent argument against Bitcoin's environmental impact. Coiners are truly the top minds of our society.",2019-02-01 03:15:45

efgg8wg,StdM39,24,"Well, it looks like for the last few years they bombarded the subreddit with racist trolls who make posts like ""why do niggers stink"".   The intent was probably to drive off a lot of libertarians, so the socialists could move in.   Also, the fact that things seem to change just after election season, in fact, it seems that every election cycle, some new radical change happens to the libertarian subreddits.  So this causes me to think, it's part of the lefts political machine that want's control over the subreddit.  Some of the top previous subreddit admins openly advertized their bitcoin address, which makes me think it was for sale, and and probably bought.  

I think the left is under a lot of pressure, because the culture and society is actively moving libertarian, and so they are under a lot of pressure to co-opt libertarian communication forums to push their agenda, and cut off dissent.  ",2019-02-01 02:34:02

You forget the password to your wallet.  
Decades go by, bitcoin is worth millions, you have several hundred on your wallet but you just can’t remember the 12 words you used as the pass phrase.  

You slowly go mad, sacrificing your health to discover the password, your relationship with your spouse and children degrades because of your obsession, leading to your children eventually hating you.  Your spouse commits suicide because you do not speak, instead just trying passwords on the computer.  Once your children hate you they are cut out of your life, just another distraction from your goal of getting that password.  You forget to feed, bathe, and engage with your youngest child and she ends up with horrific brain degradation as well as severe malnutrition.  

One day you get the password, in shock you have a heart attack and die.  Your children take the money from their hated parent and start a foundation for children who were ignored by their parents to the point of neglect, your name is forever associated with child neglect and poor parenting.  Your grave is pissed and spitted on by thousands, any positive memories anyone had of you are overshadowed by your neglect and refusal to help your fellow man.

Users are not willing to pay a $20 transaction fee. And so, they will demand lower fees. And the miners will demand they make more money.

The simple solution is just to do what they do today, give miners a block reward (&gt; $40,000) in bitcoin to process a block of transactions (2,000 or so transactions). 

The devs change one line of code to fix the block reward at 10 bitcoins per block, making the number of bitcoins unlimited and everyone cheers are the miners get more money and transaction fees go back down to a reasonable. There is no other way. It will happen.",2019-02-03 14:49:41

efnd1ik,SamRHughes,1,"Each programming language makes certain choices easier or more difficult, affecting the comparative advantage of certain ways of building your software.  For example, C++ makes it much easier to use a futures framework than plain C.  Haskell makes it way easier to define new datatypes than C++.

Doing this can teach you some stuff.  For example, from experience in Go, plus some general background with other languages, I learned that instead of trying to make my C++ datatypes perfect, with members private, constructors defined, using boost::optional/variant, up front, it's better to just slum it, putting stuff public in structs, making it cheaper overall (in dev time) to define new types and make use of them.  Of course you can tighten the screws later.

So, that's one advantage, it makes you better at programming, because you're more aware of how the tools you've used shaped your thinking, and how to overcome that.

What's not as useful is learning C# on the off chance that 10 years later you might have occasion to use it.  By that time the language will be a bit different.

What is useful is to learn a bit about substantially different technologies, so you're aware of what's out there, what tools can be used, and what problems other tools have.  For example, some developers used Mongo and never used a transactional database.  They never used SQL.  Well, I can tell you that they'd do better if they had used a DB with transactions.  (The classic example is that bitcoin company that used Mongo and lost a lot of money on a textbook transactions problem.)",2019-02-03 18:07:48

No need to worry about rest of the ""crypto ecosystem"" calling your chain a ""fraud"", because the rest of the crypto ecosystem has started waking up to all the developments on the SV side and now paying attention, and most of them see SV as a ""pure fork"" as well as an ""innovative chain"", and ABC as having added all kinds of shit for stroking protocol developer ego and no longer a Bitcoin anymore.

[Yes, it was.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611)

If you'd like to actually educate yourself about this subject, here are a few resources to get you going: [Link #1](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1427885.msg14601127#msg14601127), [Link #2](https://petertodd.org/2016/state-machine-consensus-building-blocks), [Link #3](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zvpi5/what_people_think_bitcoin_programming_is_vs_how/durjppk/), [Link #4](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7g4cep/10k_price_thread_november_28_2017/dqghz63/), [Link #5](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/a8s34v/why_i_think_there_will_be_a_blockchain/ecfwv5t/).

If you'd like to remain ignorant instead, okay. But stop trying to comment on subjects you don't know anything about.

&gt;Look at the tx/s and block time. 

Okay. Neither of those things have to do with programmability nor smart contracting, but I looked at them. The transactions per second figure is effectively infinite due to Bitcoin's smart-contracting capabilities supporting networked payment channels (as [mentioned upthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/amnmv0/if_ln_bitcoin_becomes_popularized_why_do_we_need/efo2nb1/)), and the ten-minute block interval was a rational and well-reasoned design choice to minimize deadweight loss (i.e. orphaned blocks); again, payment channels (not to mention external-to-consensus risk mitigation mechanisms) allow for effectively instant transaction settlement for those who are looking to achieve this sort of thing, so it's not clear what you think ""tx/s and block time"" helps to demonstrate (besides your own lack of understanding).

&gt;People are ALREADY using other systems that suit their needs better. Obviously you have a big problem with that.

I have no problem whatsoever with people speculating on whatever they'd like to speculate on. Once again, I want to recommend *actually reading what I write* if you would like to learn more or improve your understanding. When you make strawman arguments and misrepresentations like this, it just embarrasses you further (and, again, helps to hammer home the point I made above about so many altcoiners' willful ignorance).

&gt; We can talk forever about which tech is better or about meaningless stuff you bring up about stupid people picking winners and other bullshit. The point of this whole thread was why there are other blockchains and I picked ETH as an example which I and huge amount of people think is a solid.

Effectively every single statement or claim that you have made in this thread has been a misunderstanding on your part and demonstrably false. You've done nothing but demonstrate ignorance; the thread has been *about* people like you, who obstinately ignore the facts and bury your head(s) in the sand when confronted with truths that make you too uncomfortable to acknowledge.

Notice that I've been presenting you with *actual* facts, arguments, and meaningful insights, and you've just been lashing out angrily and ignoring what I'm saying, deliberately trying to misrepresent me and parroting verifiably-false talking points at every step of the way. If you were trying to make altcoiners look bad, you've succeeded admirably. If you were trying to do anything else, you've failed miserably.

&gt; I'm just saying, you're going against the fundamentals of crypto and hate on butters for it, but while you're hating, the smart are profiting. 

I didn't say whether I like or dislike crypto(bitcoin) fundamentals and yeah, some of them are fucked up.

&gt;Not to me, all I'm looking for is profit.

Yeah, while I'd like private transactions, they're not coming anytime soon, no matter what I do. For now, it's profit only.

&gt; I just bought a few hundred $$ worth of crypto, I suggest you do the same, just don't put a lot of money. 

I'm talking about right now, I bought so little, because it's risky, I'm not sure for how long my money will be trapped. I'm not about to dump a huge pile of cash on something as risky as this is right now.

efohtiq,MarchewkaCzerwona,1,"Thing is, that btc last time was pumped by tether and new users who actually have no interest in working bitcoin, but gains and lambo.
Only increasing price was what mattered to everybody as all were winners.

That was the case until btc choked and some investors decided to take gains only to be hit by high fees. Those were still acceptable as gains were far bigger than fees, but system has been proven unstable and reached its peak. On top of that options were introduced in which suddenly we had new side that benefits from price drop while tether couldn't hold everything together any longer.

Big wave of runners started and we pretty much from ath steadily are heading down.

New users are not users really, but people who are investors. Lambo investors. As btc has failed to be currency so only those kind of people are around btc and they will convince new alike to come to crypto world.

For them working Ln doesn't matter. They need assurance that future will bring gains. Ln is a promise. The fancier the words around the better. Just give it 18 more months.

Meanwhile, they might pump btc a little and that will start when those people will believe price reached bottom. Soon. ",2019-02-04 05:49:24

efoh5o2,fallenxwings,1,"One way to justify this bearmarket and its possible longer extension, is with the fact people buying during this bullrun had no idea of what's bitcoin or crypto in general. I have a friend who bought around 1k, and when bitcoin was around 14k I asked him if he knew what's the halvening. He had no idea.. even though he usually said stuff like ""I believe in crypto"" and other BS. The truth probably is he just believed in that he could make money in the pump and dump crypto was (and notice he bought very early, imagine the possible kind of people who bought much higher). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now you have these people who ""believe"" in things like EOS, Tron, XRP, tezos and other things... Despite the fact most of these are not aligned with the reason bitcoin is actually a technology breakthrough. This seems like a contradiction in their beliefs and the reason why we have this bullrun. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time maybe it was for maybe 95% of the people just a pump and dump, but in the previous pumps (2012, 2013) people had an idea of where they was putting their money, and I would say with totally confidence that overall there was more genuine believers than this time.

efo926i,CountOneInterrupt,1,"The choice of a log scale with absolute dollar amounts makes this borderline unreadable.  It's very hard to compare different values (why not fucking normalize so each bubble tops out at the same cap, so we can compare bubbles as a *fraction of max price*, which is what's really relevant here?  Oh, right, because Bitcoin's current price is higher than these things and number go up).  Plus, by compressing the non-Bitcoin things at the base of the chart, their peaks / valleys are compressed making it hard to determine what's going in their prices.  These ""bubbles"" really look like flat lines because they just don't have space to express anything about their behavior.

Also, log scales are tricky to read because they violate our inherent assumptions about the sizes of visual objects, and using those to convey information is **the entire point of dataviz**.   Here, the log scale makes the recent bitcoin price cratering look like a tiny downward deflection when it's really, like, an 80% drop.  Log scales can be well-used (I've produced plots where they're essential), but they're a very powerful blunt instrument, and any chart with a log scale should be *very* carefully executed.

Also, while I'm insulting this chart, it makes awful use of both ink and space.  Why does it need that watermark at the back?  It adds nothing to the chart except visual noise.  There's already a logo at the bottom, and this watermark would be trivial to remove in Paint anyway.

Another consequence of the absolutely braindead choice of not normalizing by peak height is that every line except Bitcoin is crammed at the bottom covering the other lines.  This make for visually-dense space where lines cover each other (this is not helped by the fact that gold and NASDAQ are similar colors), which makes the difficulty of reading the fucking tiny non-BTC lines even worse.

Also, while this isn't *totally* color-blindness unfriendly, it's not great.  Some line textures, differentiated points, and **not fucking bunching all the lines up** would go a long way.

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

No , there are many implementations and anyone can create a new implementation without permission. There are no default implementations or reference ones. Core is simply the most popular one at the moment because their track record and this can quickly change as we saw in 2017 with UASF. 

&gt;Somebody has to allow code contributions and decide what goes live and what not. 

No, anyone can change the code without permission. If the code breaks consensus with all other implementations than they create an altcoin, thus even the most popular node implementations need to seek consensus and approval from the community (for changes to the consensus rules) at large and other implementations or the network splits. 

&gt;But what happens if the governments of several rich and powerful countries decide that they don't like these systems and go after the developers or manipulate them to allow malicious code in the system.

This would be political suicide for these countries because code is speech. 

&gt;They only need to go to the 2-3 core developers.

Many people are independently reviewing the changes made to the updates and don't simply run the code on faith. I myself will review the changes as they proceed from RC1 to RC3 and later and than will do a final code review before compiling the binaries from source code . I am not a core developer, and people like me would sound the alarms quite quickly if something was amiss to the larger community. 

Also Bitcoin created a process called Gitian Building (that is now being used in other open source projects like linux,tor,mozilla, debian repos) to insure that the binaries are consistent across all developers for security

Because it involved a PR campaign that ended up influencing the course of how consensus rules evolved. Whether they changed it or not doesn't matter.

""worried"" is way too strong.

We have:

a)  *Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.* 

*-&gt;* like I said, he observes that if two use-cases for PoW chains aren't fundamentally related, they don't need to be on the same chain. 

&amp;#x200B;

b)  *BitDNS users might be completely liberal about  adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars  are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about  limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small  devices.* 

\-&gt; Satoshi says that Bitcoin might not be completely liberal about adding large data features (=storing files on the blockchain or something). In fact, it may get tyrannical and actively limit those possibilities. E.g. reduce op\_return size or disallow fancy n/m constructions.

But even if you read the above out of context as saying: people want to keep the chain small. **Even** if he did, it's just a prediction. There's no indication he's worried in any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The only instance of ""worry"" in that whole quote is:

*If you're still worried about it, it's cryptographically possible to make a risk free trade* 

Which refers to someone else, not Satoshi.

That money was lost, but not as a result of government injection of liquidity, which is what we're talking about.  Yea, that shit was bad, but it was private corporations in private contracts with private individuals; the government ""injection"" was paid back, and thus did not increase the money supply in aggregate.

&gt; injections of liquidity = printing money = general tax on people holding dollar dominated assets (or being payed salaries negotiated in dollars).

Not necessarily; as above, those injections were *loans*, not *free money*.  So the aggregate value of the dollar is not meaningfully impacted.

&gt; And if people start holding bitcoin instead of cash, injections of liquidity are not going to work anymore, which is why I think, when we get to that point, you are going to argue for making bitcoin illegal.

But aren't there certain situations where it can be a bad thing? Because the amount can never surpass 21 million, won't the amount always technically be declining (once the final block has been mined)? Whether it's people passing away, misplacing passwords, etc etc. 

Think of all the people who mined blocks early on and talk about how they were never able to retrieve their coins because they didn't responsible store their bitcoin and keep their keys (lost computers, etc). These situations will always happen, however infrequently. 

So what is to stop the amount of bitcoin from continuously diminishing? (Again, once the final block has been mined) Is it just that the total 21 million is so large and so divisible into smaller units that it won't matter? Or are there other factors I'm not considering? ",2019-02-06 00:12:19

You can see that it survived a spam attack of 250000 transactions yesterday.

The Nano stress test results are right here: /r/nanocurrency/comments/982bq9/stress\_test\_beta\_network\_v15\_results\_in\_here/

Vote Stapling reduces voting traffic by up to 12-fold so the next stress test should be faster still.

&gt;has nowhere the speed you describe (instant) when you want an actually secure transaction with verification (0 conf is fast on bitcoin or any other coin as well) 

You can test the speed yourself at https://nano speed.info

It's currently averaging 10.7s. That's slow by Nano standards but a broadcast-delay bug fix is already written, tested, and about to be released that removes a 4ms-15000ms broadcast delay. 

&gt;it can easily be ddosed for a relatively very low price making it a huge risk to store any money on that network

Actually someone has a go yesterday and failed against its spam-resistance. But v19 or 20 will contain the dynamic PoW spam-proofing that makes your argument even more absurd.

efwl65g,Robby16,1,"I’m laughing too. Nothing you said impressed me.

Seem very short sighted. All emotional crying and no real facts.

The blockchain has been around for awhile but solving the byzantine problem and adding a token to incentives has never been done before.

If you think sending money across the globe in a censorship resistant peer to peer way with an honest public ledger soon-to-be instant and almost free is a fad then you need to go back to economics school.

If you think it has real utility and how can you say it’s going nowhere. There has never existed a asset that has appreciated in price so much in such a short period of time. And you’re telling me that doesn’t impress sharks? You cannot destroy BTC, it’s not like a company which I don’t even know you understand that lol? Why would the market not pump again? If you count on human greed, there is one reason for you.

There will always be someone to come back and pump it there is too much money to be made. I don’t give a shit about ideology of it. I’m here to make money and every day there is a teenager that turns 18 and every day there is an old dinosaur that dies. 

There was a huge poll taken by a politician and over 65% said they would rather hold BTC than any other asset. Now that might not impress you but it sure is significant. The trend is going digital millennial‘s like crypto a lot more than traditional stocks and bonds.

My bad, when I said mainstream I meant mainstream awareness. People are now moving into the space because they recognise that it has some potential. No I don’t think it will get rid of banks, no I don’t think it’s going to make the rich porn the poor rich and yes I do think it’s going to take decades. It does not have to be currency, it can be a global settlement network it could also be a store of value. Gold was also volatile in the beginning. 10 years is nothing, look at every bubble, the.com bubble the railroad bubble the fundamentals with there and eventually recovered however long it takes. 15 years for the.com bubble. So why are you crying after only 10? Plus what do you mean it’s finding its legs? It works. Listing Plus what do you mean it’s finding its legs? It works. It’s going to work a lot better in time. Technology is not an issue, there is no software problem that cannot be solved clearly. We can go to the moon I’m sure they can figure out how to scale. You can’t expect after 10 years the world to start on the shift to a store of value or currency. Again shortsighted fits your personality because you are a gambler it seems.

The fundamentals for bitcoin are here. Nothing has ever existed so innovative in it’s field. Key work in its field. Not saying this is better than the Internet but if you can change finance that’s fucking huge. 

Here are some facts and not speculation.

Lightning network is growing exponentially.

Every few years the price of bitcoin is far greater.

More and more people are moving into the space.

Institutional investors are coming. You can believe what you want about them, even if 21 million rich people in the world purchase even half of one bitcoin just to hedge, you already have a massive increase in price. New York Stock Exchange, Fidelity I’m not going to make enough money just from fees. Whether they are going to steal money from the plebs I don’t care because the price will appreciate all the time.

Bitcoin started this entire phenomena so even if in your dream world it fails, it’ll still have value as a souvenir. Unless you think the entire blockchain is a fad. 

Because of bitcoin, we have smart contracts if you think they have no value then yes you are not technical can’t really say it any other way. Immutable code has value. STO is going to allow companies to raise capital on a global scale like never before. Cut off all the third-party bullshit all the red tape and all the legal crap. That will revolutionise that market.

Bitcoin has the biggest network, brand name and the most secure.

Actually I’m done, I CBF lucky I talk to my phone so this quick. I’m sure you have some clever response if you do please show some facts and maths not speculation and emotional reasoning like “ it’s had 10 years and it’s done nothing blah blah blah”

Done nothing LOL? It was on the tip of everyone’s tongue two years ago, it has made people start questioning finance and the financial industry and money. It has made more millionaires than any assets in the world and in such a short period of time. Obviously you were not one of them.

Get good morning and good night texts, unlimited chatting, tons of naughty sex stories, and I'll make sure to make your work days a little bit less boring, and one 20 minute standard KIK session every week, with live pictures and videos, in the weekly and monthly options.

If you live in a different time zone or are looking for a partial-time GFE, just DM me with what you're looking for and I'll be able to provide you with a different rate.

## Cock Ratings

Do you want to know how you measure up, or just want to hear me ramble about your cock? I'll let you know my thoughts on different aspects of your cock/balls in a very thorough rating, what I'd do to your cock, how it compares to the other guy's I've been with, and finish with a rating on a 0-10 scale.

I can give you a 100% honest cock rating, a cock worship rating for those who get off on hearing a girl drool over their cock, or a sph/harsh rating.

* $25 - Text-only rating. Around 200-300 words.

eg0md9h,satoshiscrazyuncle,1,"LN is an all new network where you *lock* funds into it.  Once you lock your Bitcoin Core (BTC) funds into LN, they become a totally different unit of account on an entirely separate ledger.   They are effectively converted to Lightning Coin.  

Presently it's possible to ""unlock"" or convert back to BTC.  But remember that BTC transactions are strictly limited.  As adoption increases, the BTC developers' transaction limit will begin to function as a denial of service (like it did in 2018).  

The whole idea is to keep you in Lightning Coin where there is no public auditability.",2019-02-08 22:41:59
eg0mc8t,midipoet,1,"Leveraging financial autonomy and independence was one of the primary motives of crypto, definitely. 

What happened in the interim was not fully envisioned for some reason. 

Data analysis tools and techniques have got so strong, incentives for centralised agents to data harvest so large, and the governments reach for data surveillance so strong, that Bitcoin and most other projects just couldn't (or refused to) keep up. ",2019-02-08 22:41:32
eg0ml6c,Raiz83,1,"BCH became confusing after the hashwar stuff and some exchanges listing it differently. Like, when I want to buy Bitcoin Cash and I’m not “into” the community, do I buy ABC? Or SV? I can imagine many people will just pick another coin, plenty to chose from. 

Also, the community is very arrogant: BCH is the real Bitcoin, so let’s call Bitcoin “Bitcoin Core” (however, the rest of the world only knows Bitcoin and they’ll always think of BTC anyway)

So yeah 2 reasons how the BCH community is digging it’s own grave by making it too complicated for the “normal” people (and you’ll need those for widespread adoption)

eg0pxz6,a_toad_a_so,1,"Not sure exactly what you mean, but assuming you're asking if an Aion dApp can accept BTC or ETH, the short answer is no, not directly.

Aion, BTC, and ETH each have their own independent blockchains. A blockchain is, in simple terms, a distributed ledger. All BTC is accounted for on the Bitcoin ledger; all ETH is accounted for on the Ethereum ledger. Moving a BTC to another chain directly is impossible because then you've changed the total supply on Bitcoin and mucked up the accounting on the ledger.

Indirectly, however, you can tokenize another cryptocurrency to account for it on another ledger. For example, a BTC can be locked up in an address on Bitcoin, a token representing that BTC (e.g.WBTC) can be generated/released and then tracked on Ethereum's ledger until it is locked/burned on Ethereum and released back on BTC.",2019-02-08 23:35:42

eg0ntxy,stablecoin,1,"That's a good question and I should have been more specific. You can't roll a dice like with Bitcoin to be completely electronics free (as far as I'm aware), but you can boot up a fresh Linux install on an old device that doesn't ever (or will ever) connect to the internet afterwards. From that secluded device you can use command tools like cleos, or even a trusted graphical wallet interface like greymass or scatter. Write the keys down on paper and wiping or destroying the device afterwards is probably the safest and possibly even a little overkill, but you would be assured that the Owner private keys never touch online. 

During the EOS ICO Block One had a key generation tool on their website as part of the process to register your ETH tokens and get your EOS main-net keys. During registration they made you disconnect from the internet as part of the key generation. As far as I'm aware this method proved safe for all genesis token holders unless you unwittingly used a non-B.1 phishing site to generate your keys. Some people have also installed fake wallets afterwards which stole their keys.

Main point is that if your keys are generated from a non-infected PC in an offline mode from trusted tools (cleos, greymass, scatter, etc), and then the Owner key is written on paper or stamped on metal, and remains offline always, then it is going to be pretty darn safe from online hack attempts. The amount of EOS you intend to hold will also determine the amount of precautions you take in key generation. For example my cell phone wallet is a separate account and I just generated keys from my regular PC (disconnected at the time) and printed them through my printer to store offline. Wouldn't recommend that for any significant amount though, my PC probably has something deep in it's memory and I'm sure my cheap printer stores some information too, but for less than the $100 I keep on the wallet I can still sleep easy.",2019-02-08 23:04:57

eg10rd1,CrasyMike,1,"SIM swaps are a real problem. It's how people can take over a ton of accounts that use a phone number as a backup method to authentication to an account. 

Less of a concern for 2FA through cellphone simply since they'd also have the password, but there are MANY tools to churn through accounts using common passwords or known login combinations(https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites). Many websites let an attacker know that a password/email combination worked, and then it's just a matter of being dedicated enough to execute a SIM swap.

It's to a point where it's somewhat decently known that if you're a potential target for attackers but you have a public facing identity that requires you to correspond by phone you MUST have two phone numbers - one phone number to use for phone calls, texting, and so on...and the other phone number you use for your ""accounts"".

&gt;As far as Tomlinson can tell, the hackers had only her name and her phone number. Over a series of eight different online chats, the hackers managed to obtain her date of birth, email address, account number, the last four digits of her credit card, and other details about her account.

It's not even like you can try to hide your authentication information. Customer service reps at large companies are not known for being super savvy about your private information. Hell, I remember authenticating myself with CIBC using my birthday and postal code (I think it was CIBC?). These things are known by...everyone I know? 

&gt; the hackers managed to steal the equivalent of $30,000 in cryptocurrency.

FYI - this money is GONE. It doesn't come back with cryptos. The hackers win, case closed. 

Cryptos have a major problem to solve which is basically what the response here will be today. There is no great way for most people to solve the security issue.

You have to store your coins offline, which is pretty inconvenient. Keep a minimal amount on exchanges because there is no reversing those funds.

You have to be smart about how you securely store them. You have to know what is considered safe or not.

You need to be savvy about the softwares you use to transact. Be in touch with the community on which ones are known to be safe.

You need to stay in touch on current security issues. Right now a well known, popular software for transacting in Bitcoin has an issue where hackers have figured out how to setup false servers that appear to work correctly, but push fake software updates out. 

You must be wary of whether your secure storage method is backed up, and no backup method works unless you've tested it recently. Continue to test your backup method is working, and safe. 

Cryptocurrency is secure, but only if you're savvy and the threshold for what ""savvy"" means includes understanding how cryptocurrency works, how your software of choice work, keeping things updated, keeping yourself up to date on the news, and always being skeptical. ",2019-02-09 01:49:50

eg3hwtc,PorcupineBum,1,"I think realistically the push toward environmental sustainability may cause some governments to outlaw Bitcoin mining, or restrict it. A possible threat if this happens is mining overcentralization. This could possibly lead to a 51% attack, which society will then have to decide if this new form of money is viable or still worth it.
The alt-coins seem to face the same issues (with the exception of some projects), but it will be interesting to see how the mining community reacts once the mining rewards are ""tapped out"" and the only source of revenue will be handling BTC transactions. 
I agree it will be around for a long time but it all has to do with public trust in the system. I think a 51% attack would be a major problem for the BTC experiment only because the public decides it's a problem.

##**Kik Sessions**

###^Live  
&gt;*Text only sessions*  
These sessions are perfect for roleplaying and exploring your fantasies. They do not include any pictures or videos(from me or you). I am open to pretty much anything in these sessions (hard limits can be ignored). We will discuss what the session will be focused around *after* payment is received, but it will not be counted as part of your time. 

&gt;*Sexting sessions*  
These sessions are purely for sexting. Both text and videos/photos. They are **video heavy** sessions!  It is expected that this will be a mutual exchange, I would like to also receive photos from you. Throughout these sessions I will send as many photos and videos as I can while we get off together. I'm very kink friendly (see [hard limits](https://old.reddit.com/r/lonelylittle/wiki/index#wiki_hard_limits) on wiki), but I am also open to vanilla. 


Time  | Text Only Sexting | Sexting without face (incl. pics&amp;vids) | Sexting with face (incl. pics&amp;vids)

eg6l1kf,murbard,1,"&gt;Take a look please  ZCOIN : ""..

It doesn't anonymize the amounts being paid which leads to leaks in privacy.

&gt;can you please write in the next days some medium article for everyone where you put your views in writing pro/contra?

Not in the next few days, but agree it's worth doing

&gt;How can you even state that when snaRks is the youngest tech of them all and you have not even long enough experience and obvservation of it.

I've been following privacy tech in this space since 2012.

&gt;SnaRks requires more novel cryptographic assumptions which have not been really been put under serious scrutiny.

Mostly they require you to be fine with pairing cryptography which has been around for a while.

&gt;You are like a politician and withholding critical information. NO, such bug like snaRks could not happen in ANY other major coin like bitcoin, ethereum, etc.

It did happen in Bitcoin and in Monero.

&gt; Why? Simple: in no other coin is the COIN SUPPLY MANIPULABLE!! How would you alter bitcoins total 21mio coin supply, how would you generate out of thin air 1bn ethers??

[https://zcoin.io/zcoins-zerocoin-bug-explained-in-detail/](https://zcoin.io/zcoins-zerocoin-bug-explained-in-detail/)

&gt;Many other tech have small sizes, and ""best privacy"" that one is highly subjective

It's really not, you learn strictly less with a zcash tx than with a zcoin tx or a monero tx.

&gt;privacy technique Small transaction size + great privacy + (!!) transparent COIN SUPPLY .

The best thing you can do to preserve the coin supply is to have a turnstile. Otherwise, any privacy over amounts will always entail uncertainty over what the total amounts are if there are bugs.

&gt;4  Arthur: """"I disagree that the flaws are ""cosmic"", you're stating it as a fact but that's your take on it.""""  
&gt;  
&gt;I use cosmic as synonym for catastrophic. 

Fine, I disagree that they are catastrophic.

&gt;If zcash team , coindesk article, lots of experts, say that this is a ""catastrophic"" bug, how can you ignore reality in such blatant way?

It would have been catastrophic if it had been exploited before they could put in a turnstile. In my opinion, the turnstile should have existed in the first place.

&gt;So to answer your question: ANY other major blockchain does not have this catastrophic risks of snaRks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;well, only because i started. You have the duty to start debate and inform the community about your motivations (if you intend to be transparent).

If I want to propose changes to Tezos, I'll have to convince people they are worthwhile, that's the bar. 

&gt;Because you are the brainchild, me, and many others think a lot of you. But with this comes the risk, that we wont challenge you, or blindly follow you. You should know this and try to be proactively transparent about important things.

I've literally been talking about turnstiles for years

&gt;But just ONE example: As evident in our snarks posts, there were even MANY people who did not even know about this coin supply issue in snarks.

It's literally mentioned in the Tezos Overview document from 2017. 

&gt; And therefore, you were forced to clarify some things...and it seems that many in the community are of the opinion that coin supply is not to be tampered with never. 

No one is talking about tampering with the coin supply.

&gt;7  Arthur: """"You don't own my time."""" I never claimed that, come on Arthur! Even though i write maybe in an ugly fashion, I and many others think i raise valid points.

You raise confused points.

&gt;Are you developing right now the snaRks tech for Tezos

No

&gt;, or áre you just ""researching"" privacy tech?

I read the papers when they come out

&gt;Because if you are actively developing with resources

Nope

&gt;And again: YOu have this idea, so you have the duty to inform the community WHAT your idea is about, or not? 

It may be wise to do so if I want my idea to go anywhere given the way Tezos governance does but that's about it.

&gt;First we must know about your idea, then we can debate

I've outlined my ideas on the matter at length, several times over

&gt;9  Arthur: """"I've been talking about adapting Zcash's library for years"""" YOu see, my bad. I did not know that.  But really, you must notice that people are uninformed yet (point 6)! again, lets DEBATE this throurughly with a decent proposal, PLEASE.

I propose opcodes in Michelson to manage a sapling circuit from within a smart contract.

&gt;Did i say other tech cannot have bugs? 

You implied that they were categorically immune to certain problems when they aren't.

&gt;They can.You are spinning words. Sorry, but this is a clearly untrue (see point 5). I am refering to snaRks-like bugs.

Define a ""snark-like bug"". 

&gt; I explain myself  again: USING ANY other major known technology/algorithm prevents the catastrophic issue of snaRks at hand, namely. the un-auditable hidden COIN SUPPLY!

It's not un-auditable if you use a turnstile.

&gt; Because not any other tech has a hidden coin supply (and thus, cannot have such a bug like snarks).

You don't have a hidden supply if you use a turnstile.

&gt;And not ANY other major privacy tech has the flaw of the TRUSTED SETUP CEREMONY!! (==TRUST IN CENTRAL PARTY!!)

There's a very big difference with ongoing trust with one central party and trusting that at least one person among a large number of parties, at one point in time will act honestly. Just one out of N. In addition, if you don't like SNARKs \*you don't have to use them\*.

&gt;Ok, this is interesting. I dont know about ""turnstile"".

I keep repeating turnstile since the beginning of the thread. 

&gt;HukusPukus above said: ""But you can't see the coin supply after the turnstile, right? So any unknown vulnerabilities could be used to counterfeit coins undetected.""

No

&gt;So, can you explain please: a) How is this turnstile preventing the hiding of coin supply? 

You define a coin as an unshielded coin, you force every unshielding operation to pass through a turnstile.

&gt;b) How is it preventing spending of counterfeited newly created coins? 

It's not possible to counterfeit coins but, if it were, you still wouldn't be able to inflate the supply.

eg6nhcu,Steven81,1,"Of course. I wouldn't expect this to happen by anyone other than some big miners bleeding money. I'd guess that they would have a stack of bitcoin to bet the falling of Bitcoin's price.

And sure the exchanges would expect such a manipulation, they just wouldn't care to stop you. After all you will be getting the longers' money not the house's. You'd basically bleed all the longers from all the exchanges dry. So if a few billions of $ are in Bitcoin longs right now they would basically end up to your pockets once their positions would start liquidating one after another.

As long as the exchanges will take fees from said action they would not care. After all for every long there is an opposite short, you'd merely happen to be to all of those, or as many of those as possible. And once the stage is set you communicate your longer chain and let the show begin.

Yeah it carries some risks. They are just far lower than the opportunity cost that switching off millions of miners carries.

I mean what do you expect? That big miners will just take it? If bitcoin goes to $1k or below right now, some really powerful stand to lose big. Amounts that you and I can't fathom (probably). I think that the possibility of them going down silently is 0. 

If Bitcoin goes too low we are going to see fireworks, I guarantee you that. We'll see at least one occation of blatant manipulation like the one I described, probably more. Those people played serious money, they won't just stand there and lose. They will attack.",2019-02-11 07:45:09

eg8gjm5,Salmondish,1,"So you are saying Mike Hearn is lying here?

Satoshi created the first rudimentary versions of RBF and even coded them specifically to create a layered scaling in the future.

&gt;""The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  **Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature**, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.""

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=69.msg614#msg614

&gt;When there's enough scale, maybe there can be an exchange site that doesn't do transfers, just matches up buyers and sellers to exchange with each other directly, similar to how e-bay works.

&gt;To make it safer, the exchange site could act as an escrow for the bitcoin side of the payment.  The seller puts the bitcoin payment in escrow, and the buyer sends the conventional payment directly to the seller.  The exchange service doesn't handle any real world money.

&gt;This would be a step better than e-bay.  E-bay manages to work fine even though shipped goods can't be recovered if payment falls through.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423.msg3819#msg3819

Where did Satoshi outline this layered roadmap you speak of? Because it doesn't exist in the white paper and online he clearly expressed a vision much more consistent with big block Bitcoin (BCH)

These sessions are perfect for roleplaying and exploring your fantasies. They do not include any pictures or videos(from me or you). I am open to pretty much anything in these sessions (hard limits can be ignored). We will discuss what the session will be focused around *after* payment is received, but it will not be counted as part of your time.

These sessions are purely for sexting. Both text and videos/photos. They are **video heavy** sessions!

I'm very kink friendly (see [hard limits](https://old.reddit.com/r/lonelylittle/wiki/index#wiki_hard_limits) on wiki), but I am also open to vanilla.

egdqo4d,Rampelflik,1,"To me it seems you are building on top of something (Ethereum) while not fully understanding the foundation or pretending there is nothing wrong with the fundamentals of Ethereum. All your efforts will be wasted building on the shoddy security theater that is Ethereum. Please reconsider and start designing and building on top of Bitcoin! 

[I](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/tuur-demeesters-bearish-case-for-ethereum) can recommend listening to the [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com) podcasts to get a better understanding of Bitcoin and Ethereum too.

Just snaps its fingers and the wealth rises from the crypts, where the name comes from.  


*Join my pump and dump group, we do not preload before a pump, only bad pump and dump groups does that. We are always honest and transparent so you can trust us.*  


In all seriousness. Bitcoin gave a probabilistic solution to the double spend problem, what people does with that over time will be judge retroactively. It is folly to say with any certainty if crypto as a whole will be a force for good by any metrics. So far I can not say that I have been particularly impressed.

egdtedv,speedcontrol,1,"oh yeah Stellar is totally the best investment ever...lets see the price now is 7.6 cents....let s see how well Stellar investors did. 

* If you invested into Stellar 3 months ago, November 13th, 2019, you paid 26 cents per lumen. This means you are now down 71% and need the price to go 3.5X to break even....that's a 3.5X pump in a bear market
* If you invested into Stellar 2 months ago, December 13th, 2019, you paid 11 cents per lumen. This means you are now down 31% and need the price to go up 50% to break even
* If you invested into Stellar 1 month ago, January 13th, 2019, you paid 10.75 cents per lumen. This means you are now down 30% and need the price to go up the same 50% to break even.

No other coin dumped this hard in such a short period without a black swan event. Founders dying and exit scams haven't crashed the price down this hard for any other coin. 

And most important of all, we still haven't found the bottom. Bitcoin right now is bullish, guess what happens to the price when BTC dumps again? And don't forget...SDF hasn't sent any lumens yet for February to the exchanges. Sure sounds like when they do and those coins hit the exchanges, that'll be the dump to push the price below 2000 satoshis. And once you break that support, that will turn into resistance and you can wave bye bye to Stellar as it drops out of the top 10 and the retail investor that tends to invest into the top 10 projects, stops giving their money to SDF. 

Right now Stellar is the WORST investment for a crypto investor. Thats because you have a single entity with BILLIONS of coins whose base cost is zero, with leadership that doesn't give a fuck what the price is when they dump. Lumen price can go down to 1 cents, and they won't give a shit because all it means is that they sell 10 million coins instead of 1 million coins. 

And don't plan on any announcements to save you...the Stellar foundation has proven that they don't give a shit about the price because they dumped into key support time and time again. Which means they'll be using any news based pump(that unlike you they know is coming) to sell into hard.

This is true. And it is true for every commodity. What you are saying is, poor people can not afford as much as rich people. That's the definition of being poor.

Of course it sucks to be poor and everyone wants to be rich/er. 

But what does this have to do with bitcoin? One of the few assets a poor person actually get his hands on, thanks to it's uncensorability.

And, once a person, poor or not, owns Bitcoin, rich people buying up the supply helps them.

As an exercise I decided to make proposals to Dash and Decred communities as a similarly unknown outsider and guess what happened, they treated me exactly like you're treating this guy. Not so much dash, but my Decred experience was horrible. I don't think this proposal is sketchy at all, I do have some issues with it, but I DO NOT expect anybody to work for free before putting in a proposal especially if they have a portfolio of similar work. Also the argument of why he made videos for BITCOIN, DASH, PAYPAL, US NAVY or whoever for free is totally irrelevant, he's a free man and allowed to volunteer his time where he pleases.

Cryptnonews, we could have used you to critique the Angelo and Kelsey proposals which have already passed and charged a heck of a lot more for video production, which included purchasing equiptment for the shooting of said videos, I'm straying off topic slightly but in contrast to that proposal this one is cheap as chips.

Finally if you look at our current Budget we have precious little 'new blood' we need to attract more proposals and we wont achieve this if we chase people away instead of trying to help them when (as in this case) they are clearly prepared to be flexible.

Sorry if it seems I'm ranting at you, perhaps I'm suffering trauma from the mauling I got at the hands of the Decred mob. I hate to see it happening. I really do appreciate your interactions. so thankyou

Correct, and they all think they're the scam artists.  

It started as badly designed internet play money cobbled together by an economically illiterate engineer who is likely to have been a pissed off libertarian mad because he was laid off of a government job.  

It became stoner science fiction bux for while and some guy in Jacksonville even talked his local pizza shop into ""accepting"" it for a pizza.  

Then libertarian jackwad DPR pushed it for use by drug dealers, pedos, and hitmen on Silk Road.  That caused the first bubble.

Then Silk Road went down and so did bitcoin, temporarily but some more sophisticated actors than DPR had noticed the pump and they got to work making a bigger pump.  

Since then it's been a scam where you pretend to believe that it will be ""adopted as currency"" even though it's ""scarce"", which makes no sense.  But you don't care because you bought it solely to move it on to a greater fool for more real money.  If that doesn't work and you feel butt hurt you may make a pouty show of pretending to believe that the libertarian slogans are true and you care about ""Venezuela"".

This is the same level of risk as re-using a bitcoin address because the first time you use it, the public key is published to the blockchain.  If you never sign a message or publish a transaction, there is no way to know your public key or even to prove for certain that a private key for the address you supplied actually exists.

If you must sign a message with a private key, best practice is to send the coins to a different address after to avoid reuse of the same private key.  This can be just another address in the same wallet, but would be an on-chain tx and would cost a fee.

eghe12h,SnowBastardThrowaway,1,"&gt; Steam/Microsoft/Dell were a few examples in Dec 2017.

And yet they haven't adopted BCH, despite it's huge blocks. Perhaps solving mining fees isn't enough if you don't solve centralization and store of value at the same time.

&gt; 1) no processing fees like Visa's fees

This is a theoretical merchant side savings that has yet to be able to be passed onto the customer reliably. Rakuten had some trial stages where they offered Bitcoin discounts, but that's about it. I say theoretical because 99% of merchants accepting crypto use services like BItpay which charge just as much fees as Visa.

&gt;2) No permission required, licensing issues, background checks. Obvious example is black market/dark web adoption, but life isn't all black and white.

Yes, BTC and crypto are flourishing in these markets. The sportsbook greymarket being my favorit example of real world adoption. Mining fees didn't stop that adoption because it was a non factor compared to the benefits. 

&gt;3) Each time we get a bubble from the crypto market, some of that money is spent as p2p cash. We hear of car dealers accepting crypto, houses, big ticket items, etc. This spearheads the idea that crypto is cash as well. The gains seen from these bubbles overshadow the initial exchange fees.

Sure, but that requires them to HODL and then spend during a bull market. 

&gt;4) Again because of the licensing/permission issue that fiat/credit has merchants such as marijuana dispensaries have less trouble than following the law in regards to financials and accepting payments. Markets that lack fiat liquidity due to these legal gray areas see crypto as one solution. This probably is a expansion of #2.

Yes, another good example. Again, I would argue in these grey/darkmarket cases, miner fees are a moot point though. Especially when you consider that a lot of those merchants accept BTC off-chain where miner fees don't come into play.

##Premium Snapchat Subscription

Snapchat subscriptions give access to my private story which will contain nudes (picture and video) as well as a variety of other real life and SFW updates. This may include: nudes, teasing, public exposure, day to day check-ins, boy/girl content, early access to sales, updates on pre-made videos! I have been having a wild time and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day. For premium subscribers and only at my discretion I will open any content sent to me although I reserve the right to respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include any guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a snapchat subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

------------------------------------------------

##Lainey's Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. Please note that I also offer kik sessions at the same rates as snap! All session requests **must** be 20 minutes or greater in length to ensure  the session isn't rushed and that you're left fully satisfied! My video sessions include verbal JOI and speaking. I show full face. As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions where you will have my full attention for the duration of your session. Unless otherwise negotiated I will start clothed and strip to topless throughout the session and interacting with whatever content you decide to send me. Once the session has started I will not pause or delay the session for any reason. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during your session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on kik or Snapchat but it is my preference to use kik and it allows you to have the conversation for later use 😉

--------------------------------

##Cock and Cumshot Ratings

###Options for ratings include:

Rate|Price
:--|:-:
Text|$15 
Video|$25
Nude Video|$35

My ratings are provided in clips through kik recorded just for you. All video ratings vary in length depending on how much I have to say but will include a 1-10 rating as well as a detailed review about its appearance, what I would do with it, and my overall satisfaction. If you want me to use your name please allow for an additional $10 and I'll make sure to use it throughout the entire rating as if you were sitting right there before me, ready to play. Ratings are not intended to be interactive so please refrain from making any requests. I do not provide any pics/vids to help you get ready for your rate but I encourage you to check out r/LaineyLove to get yourself rock hard 😉


Rate Addon [AVAILABLE FOR NUDE RATINGS ONLY]|Additional Cost
:--|:-:
Name use|$10
The Worship Rating|$10
Extra JOI and showing off|$20
Extra showing off with pussy play|$30
Cumshot rate in addition to dick rate|$35
Rate provided in one continuous video instead of over kik clips|$35

---------------------------------------------------------

This is the list to date of premade videos that are for public sale. These videos are, for the most part, labeled in the order that they were filmed. Thus the video is shot a little bit better as I got the cameras figured out. All footage is shot by smartphone camera (iphone 6 or above). If you're just looking for something sexy I highly recommend #10! If you are interested in any of the following please send me a message on kik to arrange payment and delivery. Videos will be delivered via a google drive link where you will be able to view and download the videos.

#Girlfriend Experience/Sugaring

**Types of GFE available**

* Companion/New crush (general)
* Domination/Tasks
* Sissification
* Self-improvement/Dating Life Improvement
* Sugaring Arrangements (donation first ; see /r/sugarbaby)

Interaction Levels and Pricing
Pricing for GFEs largely depends on what level of interaction you're looking for. Below are examples of what I would consider a low, medium, and high interaction gfe. 


GFE|Rate|Description
:--|:--|:--
Low Interaction|$50/day|This is my more affordable option. We will have light chat throughout the day periodically but you will be understanding that I'm often busy and I may take a little bit to reply. This is a relaxed arrangement without a whole lot of back in forth. Just a few check-ins a day and some occasional chat.
Medium Interaction|$75-150/day|This is a middle of the road option where we talk when I'm available. You will occasionally receive a mixture of live and gallery photos with this option. With this option I am open to receiving any pictures of yourself you'd like to send including NSFW ones and will be more open to NSFW questions. 
High Interaction|$150+/day|This is a very involved GFE where I interact with you at a similar level to a significant other. Chat will be constant throughout the day unless I have matters to deal with or I am sleeping. I will reply as much as I possibly can. You will receive a mixture of live and gallery photos throughout the duration of the GFE because I love to show off for you!

-----------------------------------------------

## Payment Method, Availability, and Terms

1. Bitcoin
2. Google Wallet
2. Indiebill (+%15)
3. Sextpanther Tip (+%20)

egk59tz,priscillamhudak,1,If you have any questions or concerns. It’s never too late to learn! Bitcoin related Questions only.,2019-02-16 06:56:22
egk5eb1,lgdly,1,"but hold on a second, isn't this just the simple narrative that opinions you disagree with, are just fake opinions? What

can one think if their opinion just gets shouted down, even if they strongly hold that belief? Lets face it, there are still

a lot of core supporters who will always say btrash etc., and sure there might be some instances of bot farms etc., and

software which generates fake reddit accounts, but at the end of the day insisting that your coin is the only bitcoin etc

hurts the people in this community who simultaneously believe that big blocks are good and also that others disagree",2019-02-16 06:57:58
egk5fdu,Donek92,1,"&gt;And who has influence over policy? Who are the politicians? Who are the media? Hint: not the poor, and not the middle class either. Something that starts with an R and ends with something that sounds like ""itch"". 

You imply that poor have no brain and eat every shit rich tell them, now that's elitist! There are more poor than rich and even Electoral Colage doesn't change this much, you get what you vote for.Also, more argument to limited gov, glad we agree!

Ah and btw this argument wasn't about that, next line explained that - rich guy can't do Tiananmen Square *legally*. Government can.

&gt;Who protects your employer's property rights?

Me myself(because I know myself my situation,what is good for me),competition(I will leave ASAP if other employer can offer same job for better wage and working conditions) and free(not gov backed) unions. [You have really nothing to worry about.](https://youtu.be/kphQ3bR-n2Q?t=440)

&gt;Who provides you with currency?

Debate about central banks being necessary/unnecessary is detail differencing different classical liberals and libertarians. It's not related to our discussion (it's like endgame of reducing state power so there is not much point talking about it where we are nowhere close, at least in Poland, USA has far better economic freedom even with congress bs), but I can tell private banks can menage currency in theory, you can debate it in ancap/libertarian subs. Also bitcoin is a thing, maybe we eventually reach the point where it doesn't burn so much power to process transactions and make it more user friendly, so far impossible but future will tell. Also, people had currency before central banks started existing.

&gt;Who builds the infrastructure that your employer's business operates on (the dreaded roads!) and so on?

I think you laugh with me about roads argument so I skip this one :D

&gt;That is the source of your rights and protections.

That's slave mentality. Founding fathers clearly stated that gov of US is suppose to respect and protect individuals rights, they are not granted by gov , you have them yourself, they are with you like your body is with you.[There](http://bcsteaparty.com/first-principles/constitution/in-10-lessons/transcription-of-the-publius-huldah-video/) you have it explained - and you don't have to believe in God to understand it, I am atheist myself.

&gt;And if you want to invoke God or nature as the source of your rights, then you better hope that God descends from the heavens or that the Ents emerge from the forest to fight for your natural god given rights when they're infringed upon.

That's why there is 2A. It's not needed in civilized societies but it's a *right* to bear arms, not *need*to bear arms. For example there is almost no crime in Japan, but it's not 100% because of police. Damn it you really have low opinion about people, not all people are *homo sovieticus*. If you believe people have no rights with no police around I hope you avoid remote places, don't use intercontinental flights or sea travel. You are either going into paranoid mode or be dangerous.

&gt;But of course no such thing will happen because you have no rights.

Ok lunatic, give me your wallet. If I don't have rights neither you.

&gt;Ah yes, the good ol ""quiet peasant! you own an iPhone! Show some gratitude, you darn yokel!"" argument. Yes, people in poorer countries suffer more; no that doesn't mean that poor people in rich countries have to suffer. 

They don't suffer, but if they do, not all of them, but more % of them than % in lower at Economic Freedom Index counties do it because personal choices.People with similar beliefs like yours created this gap. It's pointless rant, if you want you can sell your iPhone and live in 1940 USA standard. You will not die nor be hungry. Also nobody owes you anything, remember that, not even iPhone.

&gt;That's a strange and entirely unnecessary jab at Africans. 

It is. IQ is a thing. Wakanda would not be real if colonization didn't happen. Also their climate and resources are more harsh so don't expect too much.

&gt; and that entitlement benefits go primarily to the middle class. 

So you admit welfare is poorly way to help poor if 49% goes to middle class? You were virtue signal about poor entire post, glad you finally get it at end. [Charity&gt;welfare.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XooUY4p4RaY)

&gt;What about Trump's recent tax cuts? What about Bush's before that? What about all the deregulation that has been occurring under these two? Not that the Democrats are much better. In the words of Nancy Pelosi, ""no, we're capitalist here"". 

Again you have to look at both ways. Tax is just one way of gov influencing market. He didn't reduce spending, he failed to refuse Omnibus Bill. Gov spending only goes one way , [Chart S.03f: Federal Spending](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_spending_chart). Welfare exploded since LBJ. Debt rises and rises.

I'm sure they don't know a ton about bitcoin, bitcoin was kind of forced on the online gambling community since it's really the only option we have left until the US starts trying to enforce morality by law. ",2019-02-16 06:41:19
egk3sky,themop1,1,"That could happen as well.  I’m reading reports of a large amount of coins being borrowed and sold into the market over the last year so that people can go short.  I think exchanges allowing that type of trading is incredibly risky if the price increase is substantial enough exchanges could lose serious money from shorts that can’t be covered.  I hope exchanges realize that risk and raise margin requirements significantly.  With highly volatile assets that some people are seriously projecting could be worth 30-400 times their present market price with substantial adoption the risk is much too high for exchanges to allow short selling.  The risk in these markets is much too asymmetrical.  Leveraged longs are actually controllable because the downside risk to the buyers can be calculated in an absolute sense.  Places like Bitmex are even worse because in a black swan price move no one is likely going to be paid.  If the price tripled in short period of time the counter-party and exchange risk is enormous.  

Large miners are the only group that should have the ability to short because the risk of them being able to come up with the coins can be secured against their future production of coin.  Even in that situation they could just borrow cash and have it be secured by their future coin production.

I think derivatives that aren’t linked to physical coin should definitely be banned.  Pure gambling on price moves do nothing to help the actual bitcoin market function.  You could make an argument that most cash-settled options in most markets should be banned because it’s too easy to use them for price manipulation and price suppression like they currently are being used at places like bitmex.  ",2019-02-16 06:37:59
egk395g,TechCynical,1,Don't make this like BTC core. Isn't not spam unless it's something malicious called out against the network. R/Bitcoin cried when people were using a bunch of 3 sat transactions in the masses since it made their fees jump up to 20$. Even though the regular fee 2 months ago was 1 sat. Suddenly the average price for a transaction turns into spam. Nano is free every transaction is just using the chain. If a couple empty transactions or pending blocks can stall the network then it explains why this coin that itself in value.,2019-02-16 06:31:11

egm1h93,r57334,1,"&gt;Not at all. I'm exactly opposite.

Of being logical, sure.

&gt;I did provide txid and it shows exactly what I said.

It does not, it was not required, that person was using outdated tech and overpaid.

&gt;Of course and I provided evidence. You are still denying facts. Unbelievable.

Your evidence didn't pass when checked. Its unbelievable that you dont just find a transaction that fits the criteria.  If fees were so high, this should be easy for you right? 

&gt;I proved you have no experience as a merchant and you lied about being one. You repeatedly lie about txid too.

You proved you have no experience using bitcoin full stop.  You have not shown a single lie I've made, because I speak the truth.

&gt;Like I said previously several times, you are acting in anger and you have problem with accepting inconvenient facts. On top of that you will most likely use exactly the same sentence in reverse to me further supporting my claim

You replied to me out of anger, thinking you could refute me shitting on bcash.  You have a problem accepting market conditions and reality.

&gt;On top of that you will most likely use exactly the same sentence in reverse to me further supporting my claim

It doesnt support you claim, it shows you are a hypocite.  You cant do the same to me, becuase my statements are based in reality, not big block zealotry. 

&gt;Fair enough, but doesn't put you in good light I'm afraid.

Im in a better light than you and the idiots who throw away their money.

&gt;Btc failed as digital money and it can not service adoption. 

False, LN is growing as fast as ever.  BTC works as digital money, thousands of people have sent digital money with Bitcoin today.

&gt;That's why we are in reverse in price and usage.

So why haven't you been shorting?  Are you going to short it all the way to 0?  Its probably because you don't believe your own bullshit, its why you have no skin in the game and don't put money where your mouth is.

&gt;Bitcoin cash is a hope

A long lost dead one

&gt;but even you present that people worry more about price than bitcoin as an idea.

A crashing price makes people think forking BTC and trying to steal the brand and make it centralized was a bad idea.

&gt;Anyway, you have been rekt.

egm5f20,slashfromgunsnroses,1,"&gt; In both of those cases, of hard and soft fork, you must have miner support though. 

Wrong. You need no miner support to hardfork. Just set difficulty to 0 and there you go. Anyone can hardfork. Theres even this lulzy tool: https://forkgen.tech/

&gt;  A scheduled upgrade

And now you unwittingly dived down into the real problem. Who schedules? Who decides what goes in? This is *exactly* the problem.

&gt;  The only projects that do not have updates are dead projects.

Wrong. First, Bitcoin softforked not long ago. More softforks are being proposed. Secondly, no updates could just as well mean your projects is working.

&gt; Both soft and hard forks can be introduced by anyone.

Wrong. Sure, anyone can *fork off*, but only very few people can hardfork a coin to change its concensus rules. If that was possible we'd probably see Bitcoin with 8 mb blocks. But we don't. Because you can't just hardfork. However you can actually just softfork if you have the hashpower support. Miners could activate segwit and 300 kb blocks on bcash *tomorrow* if they felt like it, and there'd be nothing you could do (although you probably wouldn't notice).

&gt; Having one corporate entity funding development seems pretty centralised to me.

I'm not sure what you're talking about, but if you wanted to you could whip up a softfork with a blocksize increase though extension blocks and propose it to miners. No amount of code committed to the Core repo would matter if miners decided to run your code. Thats why I say that anyone can softfork, and softforking is the only true decentralized way of developing.

Anyways, I don't think elaborating further on my points now will matter much.",2019-02-17 04:39:00

egmd0mm,SILENTSAM69,1,"Hard forks do not have to split the network at all. The miners are the only ones who decide if the network is split when it comes to a hard fork.

It is exactly the same with hard and soft forks. You have to get miners to runs them. The only difference is with compatibility. This makes soft fork updates optional, and hard fork updates not optional without a chain split.

In terms of how Bitcoin is a democracy the sort for is a regular vote, and a hard fork is comparable to a vote of no confidence. It requires a larger, I'd not absolute, majority in order to not be defeated.

You seem caught up in the end on if it is contentious. SegWit was contentious. That is why it is taking years to gain adoption. That is miners forked off to BCH was because it was a contentious soft fork, and a point of no return when the were already debating how to scale and use the max blocksize.",2019-02-17 06:21:49

egm7tdj,SILENTSAM69,1,"This is more of an adoption issue than a fee issue. If a lot more people use Bitcoin its value goes up l, and while the amount of Bitcoin reward is halved, the value of the reward goes up.

With massive adoption the value of the reward would continue to increase for quite a while. There would come a point where the amount of use would cause the fee reward to surpass the block reward. Lots of small fees being more than a few large fees.

This is why adoption matters more than anything else. Some only think of a store of value, but there wont be any value with it being used as a medium of exchange on a larger scale.",2019-02-17 05:11:31

egp6mce,Vivesectionist,1,"Sent $40,000 fiat into Quadrigacx and grabbed Antshares for $4 back in May 2017 on the Chinese 19800 exchange. Antshares re-branded to NEO and I surfed the wave to near peak, going to retire early!  19800 folded - no records for the tax man. Slipped into ELA pre-sale in December and sold all my NEO near peak to go all into the Elastos Kool Aid.  Started work on porting a nascent side chain project we had been kicking around to Elastos. Flew my team to the first ELA meet up in San Fran.

Had an awkward early outdoor morning coffee meeting with Fay, like something out of the Lord of the Rings, perched on uncomfortable tree stumps at a back alley coffee house in Chinatown.  Discovered that where it says on Fay's twitter that she is an ecologist, it means that she studied different berries on Palma De Mallorca prior to Elastos, not that she is some type of 'blockchain ecologist'. Was rewarded for my efforts with a two hour personal meeting with Rong. Got a backstage look at his Bitmain handlers.

At our meeting, Rong prophetically shared that his long career had been a series of failed projects and that he could not believe his recent good fortune.  I was an idiot and took this as as a sign that he was down to earth. Ah, retrospect, the lady soul which could not stoop.

Returned home and took my place with the converted as we watched everything burn to the ground.  My side chain project never left the ground,  a key member got too greedy, Bitcoin crashed and ate the oxygen out of the entire market, Fay used a flame thrower of lock up tokens to smother the price, Telegram transformed into the home of thought reform and unquestioning belief, Bitmain removed Emperor Elastos's clothes, Viewchain soiled itself, and finally Quadrigacx went belly up and permanently locked my escape losses forever.

Hell of a ride fellow Elastonians - no regrets.

## Private Kik Session

Want to have me all to yourself and have some private fun? Private sessions are always a fun way to get each other off. I don't do multiple sessions, I prefer to take care of one cock at a time, when it comes to sexting, anyway.

We can sext, explore and role play your favorite fantasy, make each other cum, or whatever you'd like. I'm very open to suggestions, so feel free to redirect me during the session, or request me to do all those sexy little things that drive you wild.

* $1.5/min text only
* $2.5/min with live videos and pictures.
* If you want me to use any toys that involve penetration: $3.5/min

# _____________________________________________

# GFE

We'll chat together as much as we both can according to our schedules. I'm usually on from 8-9am to 1-2 am EST, though it varies a bit depending on the day. We can take the time to get to know each other, be workout buddies, have Netflix dates, or even incorporate a dom/sub dynamic to our GFE. It's your call. Get good morning and good night texts, unlimited chatting, tons of naughty sex stories, and I'll make sure to make your work days a little bit less boring, and one 20 minute standard KIK session every week, with live pictures and videos, in the weekly and monthly options.

If you live in a different time zone or are looking for a partial-time GFE, just DM me with what you're looking for and I'll be able to provide you with a different rate.

* $70 - One Day Trial
* $130 - Three Days
* ~~$250~~ \- Weekly **$200**

You can expect 2-4 shows a week.

* Lifetime - $40
* VIP - Lifetime - ~~$150~~ (includes private snaps sent directly to you along the week (not daily), and I always prioritize your requests and messages) VIP members can also save snaps on the chat) **$75**

## Cock Ratings

Do you want to know how you measure up, or just want to hear me ramble about your cock? I'll let you know my thoughts on different aspects of your cock/balls in a very thorough rating, what I'd do to your cock, how it compares to the other guy's I've been with, and finish with a rating on a 0-10 scale.

I can give you a 100% honest cock rating, a cock worship rating for those who get off on hearing a girl drool over their cock, or a sph/harsh rating.

* $25 - Text-only rating. Around 200-300 words.
* $40 - Video rating. Listen to me ramble about all the aspects of your cock in a 3-5 minute video with lots of teasing, touching and flashing.

ego2e4g,thatmathguyy,1,"I'm sorry you feel that way, but there are lots of people who are part of both the banano community and the NANO community, myself included. I don't think the hostility towards banano is fair.

Banano started as a meme to be a more ""lighthearted"" version of NANO with slightly more fun, just like how DOGE started off as a light hearted BTC clone, and you don't ever see Bitcoin holders being hostile towards the DOGE community.

There are many Banano developers that have also contributed to the development of NANO. Take Natrium as an example, Natrium started off as a project by /u/bbedward and /u/ngyekta to provide a mobile wallet for Banano since there wasn't a mobile wallet yet and the Banano community needed one. After Kalium was created, they made Natrium along with it to release as a NANO wallet, and Natrium has been one of the best mobile wallet experiences I've ever had. Quoting Yekta: [If it wasnt for Banano, I wouldnt be able to design Kalium, thus Natrium, or monKeys for that matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/arcfna/help_convince_natrium_developer_ubbedward_to/egmgqe0/?context=1). Bbedward also said the same thing in a different comment, and that [Banano reinvigorated my passion for Nano, and several other people..... If it wasn't for Banano, we wouldn't even be talking about Natrium.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/arcfna/help_convince_natrium_developer_ubbedward_to/egmftld/)

Another thing is that since banano is a meme fork, we have a lot more freedom to experiment. There has been talks every now and then about adding privacy to NANO transactions, and it is understood that this is currently not a priority for the NANO devs as there are other node improvements that need to be made first. /u/coranos2, the same guy who helped get NANO on the Ledger, is currently trying to develop banano camo, a way to make banano transactions private, and perhaps can be added to NANO in the future. The fact is that we can use banano to test possible improvements to the NANO protocol on the banano network first.

So yes, Banano might be a meme fork of NANO, but I don't see why the two communities need to be hostile towards each other. It is possible for both communities to have a symbiotic relationship, and NANO and Banano are not mutually exclusive

ego2a6o,zenethics,1,"Ok, thanks for adding this. Here are the counter-arguments to his points.


""_Nobody uses bitcoin (nor gold) as a unit of account (for measuring value) because the units jump around much more capriciously than the value of money._"" This neglects the thousands of years of history where we did just that, of the hundred or so years of history where fiat money was backed by gold. 


""_Once everyone realizes this, the value of bitcoin will collapse._"" I think this is pretty out of touch with the actual community. Yes, all the speculators are gone. Yes, we may have one more wave of sell offs to get the last of them out. No, I have no intention of doing anything but accumulating during this time. In fact I got out (above my buy in price) at around 6k when we were hovering there for a few months. I fully expect another year or two of bear market until the next block reward halving. But there's zero chance I don't get back in before then, whatever the price. To me this is like the gold bugs saying ""once everyone's view on economics aligns perfectly with mine, holy crap gold is going to the moon."" Everyone's view on economics will never line up perfectly with this author. As an economist he should know this. Right now, very few people own any Bitcoin. Much, much fewer own more than one (as a matter of technicality - because the supply is finite and they can't).


""_Once the speculators abandon bitcoin and it becomes just a reserve of terrorists and criminals, the police will shut down the companies that exchange bitcoin for money which will make bitcoin virtually worthless for criminals too because they mainly rely upon money for most transactions and only use bitcoin for illegal transactions._"" The biggest monetary tool for terrorists and criminals is the paper version of the US dollar.


""_Bitcoin’s value will fall to zero once people realize its failure as a medium of exchange because it has absolutely no other source of value. All stores of value must have some underlying value. Fiat money (like the dollar) is truly useful because it really does minimize transactions costs as a medium of exchange which give it its underlying value.  If there were something else that was better at facilitating exchange transactions (like bitcoin), we would use it instead of dollars and the dollar would become worthless because it has no other fundamental source of value._"" Yes, that's kind of the whole point. Bitcoin cannot go from nothing to the new world money in a decade or two. It has to be a speculative asset first for a while, maybe for 50 years or so. But eventually-eventually there is a chance that the price stabilizes relative to fiat because there is a chance that fiat goes to zero. Actually a pretty good chance. The average lifespan of a government issued fiat is about 25 years. So for now, Bitcoin makes sense as a hedge against global financial payment networks (which are linked to fiat) in the same way that gold makes sense as a hedge against inflation. Imagine the USD collapses tomorrow but the internet is still a thing. PayPal isn't going to help you - it uses dollars. Same with Visa. Mastercard, whatever. Are you going to go to your bank vault and pull out a bunch of gold and take it to the market? Maybe, but unlikely. But to say Bitcoin's value is zero because its not a medium of exchange is like saying gold's value is zero because its not money. Its kind of a category error - Bitcoin is a new hedge against existing payment networks (whose counter-party risk is that they use the dollar). Its an insurance policy. People have insurance policies for all kinds of unlikely events, and frankly I think that the collapse of the dollar falls more into the likely camp than the unlikely camp, at least on long enough time spans. But the thing is that its unique in being a hedge against existing payment networks. 


""_A fiat money like the US dollar is cheaper to use than bitcoin as a medium of exchange because 1) its value is more stable because it is actively managed by the central bank which makes it a better unit of account; 2) it is cheaper to use for paying taxes because the government requires it for paying taxes so Americans have to have the ability to pay in dollars; 3) the fact that everyone uses dollars creates a kind of economy of scale called a network effect which makes dollars more convenient to use simply because all other Americans are already using them; 4) bitcoin is structurally prone to deflation which would contribute to recessions if it were adopted for an entire economy.  That fact alone will prevent any large economy from adopting it._"" Really the heart of this argument is Keynesian economics vs Austrian economics. And again, the USD is better _right now_ but Bitcoin's value proposition _for right now_ is a hedge against the USD. The argument that it can't work because it is deflationary is kind of mind boggling to me. I'd say the opposite - fiat currencies can't work long term because they are inflationary. They only have to hyperinflate once to die to something better. I think people, at the margins, will continue to trade some of their routinely debased currency for Bitcoin as a hedge against that currency. I think that people have been playing the Keynesian economics game largely because they've had no choice. Every time somebody has tried to create a centralized gold backed currency to compete with fiat moneys, the government has shut them down. Now there's Bitcoin and a shutdown is impossible. It may or may not be in the economy's best interest to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve currency. Don't know, not super interested in that argument frankly. It _is_ in everyone's individual best interest to adopt Bitcoin as their personal reserve currency (or at least to take a small stake in it as a speculative hedge) and so for that reason I think its going to happen whether its good or not. You can't argue that the Titanic is unsinkable because if it sank that would be bad.





""_Bitcoin transactions are extremely expensive and slow relative to dollar transactions using the conventional banking system._"" In a few years this won't be true. Square's Cash App is already integrating with the Lightning Network which uses Bitcoin as a settlement layer and makes the transactions actually literally peer to peer. In a decade Bitcoin transactions will be free or near free again (at a global scale). 



""_Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than 159 different countries and in order to make it worthwhile for miners to continue processing transactions, bitcoin will have to deflate in value because there is a finite amount of bitcoin that can be “mined” and as we approach that hard limit, the costs of mining (processing transactions) continues to rise which won’t be worthwhile unless the value of bitcoin rises which is deflation and deflation is harmful for an economy when it is caused by a money supply that does not expand as fast as the number of transactions that people want to make.  Because the costs of processing Bitcoin transactions must rise over time, it will continue to get even worse as a medium of exchange._"" How much electricity do traditional payment networks use? This is still a big improvement, even from this perspective, if you take into account all factors. For the miner reward, ya, this is an interesting issue. My hunch is that Bitcoin either goes parabolic and gobbles up all the fiat money or that it goes to zero. If it gobbles up all the fiat money then the mining reward with full blocks will no doubt pay for the miners. The napkin math is, essentially, imagine the global daily transactions that take place. Now imagine that Bitcoin is the settlement layer and that each on-chain transaction is the summary of a million off-chain transactions. You're basically taking a (small, percentagewise) cut of that every 10 minutes. Even with very low per-block transactions the miners are taking about .35 BTC per block. If the blocks are full all the time and there's a bit of competition to fill them, we can expect that to double or triple. And if BTC is the world reserve currency, we can expect the block reward to be in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars (in today's money) even with no inflation.



""_Every fiat money is always in peril of being managed badly and that has dire consequences for the people who depend upon it such as in the Zimbabwe hyperinflation.  But if a fiat money ever becomes a worse option than bitcoin, then people can switch.  Bitcoin provides competition for the world’s fiat currencies.  So far that hasn’t panned out except in a few niche areas, but it is nice to have it as a possibility.  For example, in Zimbabwe’s case, people have been mostly using the fiat currencies of other nations, most commonly, the US dollar rather than bitcoin. There is simply no major economy where bitcoin has replaced fiat currencies as the main medium of exchange except in some networks in the criminal underworld._"" Yes, exactly. To say that BTC has no place as a speculative bet or a hedge is to say that the USD won't ever tank. But there will always be the fear of this. Adoption of Bitcoin in countries like Venezuela or Turkey where they are having a currency crises is not zero. It has an advantage over the USD in that it can't be confiscated as a matter of technicality. It has the disadvantage that fewer know how to get it and its harder to use, but I think those are problems that slowly go away.",2019-02-18 01:24:26

egqix84,Bibing_,1,"Short answer: yes (with precautions).

Long answer: Bitcoin is pseudonymous so you will need to obfuscate e.g buy at atm with cash. Alternatively if you have btc tied to your identity already you can use mixers/convert to privacy coins and perhaps back again to btc (dont waste money on fees doing this btw unless a must).

Then use tor browser. Extra steps can be taken if you require ultimate privacy from governments.",2019-02-19 01:23:48

I am *not* saying that we won't fall below $3130.00 to make a new low. But what I am saying is that this is what the accumulation period feels like. And honestly, if this slowly bleeds back to $3550.00 over the next seven days, it'll feel even *more* like accumulation. ",2019-02-19 01:09:16

**$20** for Democrats, Independents, other countries and regular not evil people  
**$40** for Republicans  
**$10** for an additional overall appearance rate  

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t lie. If I like your dick- you get nudes (minimum of 4, more if you have one of those once in a lifetime beauty dicks) and a detailed review (text), if I don’t like it- clothed pics and an essay on why your dick is not my cup of dickaroni and cheese. And by “essay” I mean a lot of asshole kik messages. Choose wisely.  
Optionally I can provide an overall appearance rating, sometimes accompanied by pop culture comparisons, usually not in your favor. 

&amp;nbsp;

**🍑Fuckboy Tasks 1 task/$20🍑**  
* Video tasks delivered via kik (video 1-2 mins long)

&amp;nbsp;

**Polaroids $50/10 includes shipping**

This will include a live kik session showing you the panties at the store, talking about which ones I like and which ones you would prefer and pictures from the changing room of me trying them on.

Once we choose the right pair and make sure they fit right I will give them 1 day of wear, 1 Hitachi Wand session with video and pictures of me cumming in the panties (there will be no less than 10 photos, video will be no less than 1 minute)

egybq46,sqrt7744,1,"Ugh, not the ""environmental effects"" argument again.

1. A vast majority of known miners use renewable sources like hydro to run their equipment. Some of them have even built their own infrastructure of power generation and delivery for the purpose, thus creating something where there was nothing before! Now, if that doesn't show long term investment in the ecosystem then nothing does. E.g. a friend of mine runs a few miners off power he gets from a mountain stream that runs through his property.

2. Bitcoin cash can support a huge (and increasing) number of tx/s, so when adoption increases, there's little need for expending more on generators and the like, so the admittedly rather meaningless ""Watt/tx"" rate that detractors love to cite will drop as adoption grows. In any case, these decisions are best left to the miners themselves rather than a politically appointed committee.

3. ...BOOM... ....this is the most important point... As far as environmental impact is concerned, the FIAT money system enables environmental destruction on a scale unprecedented in the history of the world. The central bank cartels are in bed with governments everywhere. National debt and unfunded liabilities are on the rise all over the world. If debt is increasing, that means that MORE is being consumed in the here and now (like living large off a credit card) at the expense of future generations. The accumulated over-consumption is already in the TRILLIONS of dollars, probably hundreds of trillions if the entire planets is considered. Add to this the credit fueled and destructive wars and economically disastrous interventionism, the 10-20% of the population employed by parasitical state organizations and the further 10-20% living off government welfare (both corporate and private) and you begin to see the problems that the fiat system is causing the world. The planet is being destroyed, and it sure as hell isn't bitcoin that's doing it. It's fueled by the debt based fiat money system that modern states have adopted

4. The purpose of bitcoin - it's raison d'etre - is to STOP the system mentioned above. It's not to create a new elite of early adopter super rich technocrats (King /u/nullc - shudder), it's not to get to the moon, no.  It's ONLY purpose is to save the planet.

I've also gone back and forth and back and forth for months on if Bitcoin can actually hit triple digits. Part of me believes it can due to bankers, but then another part of me doesn't because of HODLers and fundamentals. After seeing everything today that I looked at with more open eyes, I believe if Bitcoin dumps below $3,120, we will make it to $2,450 max. I wouldn't even be surprised at ALL to see $3k hold. I am especially now eyeing up around $2,800/$2,900 for a wick. This would establish **strong** bullish divergence in the weekly, which is what I have been eyeing up for a *real* long-term FOMO investment point.

I see bullish divergence close in the weekly, especially with a much lower low, and I'm FOMO'ing. Hard.

##Premium Snapchat Subscription

This gives you access to my Premium Snap story. This may include: photos and videos of me nude, teasing, public exposure, day to day updates, premium only sales, and more! I have been having a great and wild time, and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day, for over a year and a half! For premium subscribers (and only at my discretion) I will open content sent to me, although I may not always respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being banned on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

egzds0d,TTEEVV,1,"&gt; how they can claim fungibility

As far as I know, the claim applies  to ETH, XLM and XRP, so here's a quote from [an XRP maximalist](https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/970491527968501760):

&gt;  Actually, XRP are more fungible than Bitcoin. 
&gt;  
&gt; All XRP are the same. They are indistinguishable from one another. (I keep calling them static but there's probably a better term.)
&gt;  
&gt; Bitcoin, on the other hand, is actually unspent transaction outputs that lug a history around with them.  I can imagine a day where stolen Bitcoin become unspendable or, even worse, miners (or their governments) start censoring transactions.

I prefer that definition of  “fungibility” that's used among Monero enthusiasts, but the *claimed* fungibility of ETH/XLM/XRP (and also electronic fiat) is something that we need to watch closely, since Monero is at risk of scoring a public relations own-goal.

But let's start with fiat. Say I owe you $20, and I settle up by handing you two $10 bills. One of them I earned by honest work, and the other I acquired by armed robbery. You pay both of them into your bank account, and they have equal status. The proceeds of my robbery may be traceable via its serial number, but from your point of view it doesn't matter because it loses it taint through **two** mechanisms. First, its value of $10 is protected by its legal tender status. Second, and more importantly for the purpose of this discussion, when you pay the two bills into your bank you convert two physical objects into a +20 increment to a pure number in your bank's ledger. The two inputs are indistinguishable since they've being transformed into [part of] a single number. Thus bank balances have two levels of fungibility: legal tender and **fusion of inputs**.

Now re-run the scenario with bitcoin. If I settle my debt with two inputs, one tainted and one not, you're burdened with that distinction forever. Quite apart from the lack of legal tender status, you've got no means of fusing the two inputs into a pure number as you could with dollars. The XRP maximalist argument is that XRP transactions *do* fuse inputs into pure numbers and subsequent outputs therefore cannot carry forward any taint from inputs. My understanding is that you need to have a concept of *accounts* build into a currency (crypto or electronic fiat) for this to work: XRP, XLM (and ETH?) have this concept, while BTC and XMR don't.

Therefore the possible own-goal for Monero happens when surveillance-obsessed bureaucrats and politicians declare *“We like fungibility too, and you plebs can have all the fungibility you need* ***without*** *an opaque blockchain! One XRP/XLM/ETH is indistinguishable from the next! Opaque blockchains are just for criminals!”* Completely disingenuous, especially given that banks offer better financial confidentiality than XRP/XLM/ETH, but this is public relations, not reality.",2019-02-22 06:19:16
egzcj8f,Just_My_Two_Bits,1,"Bitcoin exists to offer people the option of controlling their own money.

The problem with BTC is that the base layer has been so constricted that if significant adoption happens (20% transaction increase) the blockchain fees will be so high that users *wont even have the option* of using anything other than Lightning. They will be stuck using custodial services to move their BTCs around and the blockchain will only be used by the custodial companies themselves. This is the exact opposite of what Blockchain was invented for.",2019-02-22 06:05:27
egzc3n4,Zarigis,1,"A CDP is a great option for a long term position, since the fees are about 10-20x lower than margin trading. This makes it practical to keep a position open for years without worrying too much about the day to day movements (as long as you stay above your liquidation price).

egz6mmr,vegarde,1,"First - LN and the scarcity of block space are two entirely different things. Yes, scarcity of block space will bring onchain fees higher, which means low fees of LN will be more tempting. But block space is limited, so if you have small UTXOs, you will have problems spending them onchain at high-fee times. This is all known.  


So, what happens with LN compared to without?  


I'm going to give a simplified example:

Say, you have a channel with $100 in it. You now receives 9 transactions of $10 each, and then you want to close the channel. How large is the channel? \*One\* UTXO.   


This, compared to if you get 9\*$10 onchain. You now have 1990 smaller UTXOs, which by themselves are more difficult to spend than if you had received them with LN and got one large UTXO.  


So the premise is mixing up various unrelated issues to make this seem like a problem with LN, but LN actually makes it easier to spend small payments on-chain afterwards!  


The notion that LN is somewhere you need to ""withdraw"" from is another false argument! Your LN funds are in \*your\* wallet and noone elses, and I for one don't ""withdraw"" from my LN channels unless I absolutely have no non-LN bitcoin left and have to spend onchain. Yes, I can foresee this happening, but most people will try to keep enough outside LN for their onchain needs, and the funds put into LN is meant to be spent in LN.  


That said, there are various possible improvements that is going to improve parts of this. Splicing is one of them, this will make it possible to spend directly from an LN channel - or receive directly to an existing LN-channel!

 - ""People in Nano act like that because the majority of investors in the coin are people that can’t afford to buy bitcoin so they buy the cheapest knock off"" - this statement is incorrect. Firstly, BTC's divisibility means that I'm sure nearly everyone who has invested in Nano could have invested in BTC. 

 - ""at their socioeconomic level, they’re typically young, immature investors"", I feel quite confident that you have not surveyed the Nano community on this, so it's just speculation, but in any case it describes much of the wider crypto community.

 - ""So they run around downvoting, talking shit about other projects, and shilling nano like crazy. Which is exactly why people in the sub are sick of it. When a coin typically has investors that are irritating noobs, this is what happens."" Which was not happening in the post you commented on. OP was talking exclusively about Nano and not about any other project. And if you're so irritated by it, why did you go onto a Nano related thread to comment?

The creator started Bitcoin in 2009 under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto and no one knows who this is. He stopped being active in December 2010 and the Bitcoin projects development process is much more decentralized as a result.

Its expected the creator of Bitcoin mined roughly 1M Bitcoins which is roughly the equivalent of $3,928,000,000, of course the market would crash if he tried to sell a significant portion of that.

Fees does not need to be almost free, they just need to be cheap enough for whatever its usecase is.  


People being able to put money into and out of Bitcoin on-chain is necessary for it to not become a token in central banks, exchanges and applications.

eh1b9wd,4vWte1ovZK1i,1,"1. Thank you.
2. Yes/no. If you spent twice as much you still wouldn't be guaranteed success. You're never guaranteed success. You'd then have a 75% chance of success. You can double it if you like, but I think listing values for 50% is the right way to go. Add a cent to it and now you can say ""an attack will be successful the majority of the time"".
1. Yes existing miners could and it wouldn't be immediately obvious.
1. Yes (and round up). Or rather, you can be 50% certain you're safe. However if you are an exchange and accept lots of transactions from lots of people, an attacker could split their double spend by sending it through several wallets so you don't want to just have enough confirmations for this single transaction, you want enough confirmations for it to be safe for all transactions this block.
1. No. The way it works is you make a legitimate transaction, have it accepted into the blockchain in block X and get your dollars. Simultaneously you secretly start mining your own version of block X (where you never made the transaction). If you can mine both block X and block X+1 before the network finds its own version of block X+1, you can announce your block X and X+1 to the network at the same time and they will be accepted as the new correct version of the blockchain (as it is longer). You can't spent your bitcoin ten times, because it still originally had to be accepted into the real blockchain.",2019-02-23 00:53:01

eh1ahcz,cm9kZW8K,1,"both. Someone must spend for someone else to accumulate.

The ground truth is the price; its the only number which illustrates the real balance between the demand for savings vs spending in btc.  The reality is that the price at which sufficient people will spend to meet the demand of those who want to save is around ~4000 usd worth per btc. That is about the amount of value to cover 1 year of eating at restaurants for the average middle aged american.

These technical indicators are positive for the health of the network, but they dont prove anything about if or when the price of bitcoin will go up. More realistically, the price of the dollar going down will push the value of bitcoin up. Ultimately, the dollar as we know it today must devalue or die, so this is somewhat inevitable. Hard to say when , but probably later than we think.

Bitcoin Cash also runs on the same SHA256, so the security of Bitcoin gets weakened the higher marketshare Bitcoin Cash has.

eh4i0gk,Stevenspielberg420,1,"Think about this very hard. What is bitcoin backed by? Nothing, it's backed by wasted electricity if anything. A pyramid scheme is designed to steal from the people at the bottom to feed the people at the top. Every single time BITCHCOIN goes up a lot, everyone trying to move up in the scheme starts a marketing campaign to trick people into buying in while they unload. It goes from 1000-5000, and people who have spent years studying markets and know it's a bubble start telling everybody it's going to 20000 and they are going to miss out. They know this is fucking impossible and even on the stock market there will inevitably be a pullback. These same people building hype about ""THE MOON"" sell their coins and take a short position and people lose 50% of their investment in a week. 

Once this is done the people who lost their house are forced to either take a loss or accept their position in the pyramid scheme and wait for the next bubble. They know it's impossible for the price to go back up to 5000 so they put ""Crypto trader, crypto analyst, futurology expert."" In their Twitter profile and use penny stock tactics to dupe other idiots to take their place. 

Once they get enough idiots to buy in they wait for a whale to artificially increase the price 20% in a few days (Willy bot for example). This leads to a news cycle where everyone holding lots of coins posts ""Is bitcoin the next thing? Are you going to miss out? You could be rich!"" Then they sell when they can make their loss a profit, the price crashes and they rinse wash repeat. 

I have no trading background whatsoever and for years was able to use common sense and a head start from an initial investment to make money doing literally nothing. I just detected simple patterns and that was it. I was not speculating based on some new technological breakthrough or bitchcoin being adopted by the public (still hasn't happened by the way, same people accept it now that accepted it five years ago. I was not investing in some start up I carefully researched and viewed as a good risk. I just bought on drops and sold on rises. 

You greedy scum think you are entitled to be rich because you got into the scheme early. You want money for nothing. Everyone else is lucky to get a 5% return on savings , yet you expect 5000% because you are special and clicked a few buttons before other people. BITCHCOIN is not a currency , if USD was worth 1 euro today and 8 euros tomorrow there would be an executive orders to prevent a global economic crash. You should be kissing the feet of Mark , Peter, Brock, Jed etc for being big promoters of your pyramid scheme. They brought additional idiots into the equation, and most of you have only contributed 100 essays where you talk about your profits or potential profits. 

You are greedy shitheads and nothing else. The least you could do is stop acting like you have some high ground. Somebody worked 1000 hours for that 5000 they used to buy one coin before it crashed 50%. They were following societies lead and thinking they should invest in something legit to help society and their retirement. They invested into nothing but your pockets. Almost every bank and financial service let's you send money instantly now. The block chain technology will be good for keeping records and occasionally helping somebody send money to the third world.

means exactly that. We're an echo chamber for crypto here. Many of us forget that that vast majority of the world barely knows yet that Cryptocurrency exists. Many if us forget that the vast majority of the world is unbanked.  

A vast army of people in the world are poor, working as expats, and sending a large proportion of their income home every year. It's a $700b annual movement of funds, and WorldPay are happy to take their cut of that.  

These expats will eventually discover Nano. They'll be happy to send sub-second transfers for free. They don't want to pay Bitcoin fees, and won't be able to afford them when blocks fill up [soon](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-congestion/). ",2019-02-24 07:35:15
eh4sfox,Steven81,1,"Nano was created on an instant and then promptly given away on faucets. We do not know who said nano was given away too, for all we know the people closer to the source (dev team) still holds the majority of Nano's stake so they can censor TXs at will and hike TX fees if the need ever arises.

None would be the wiser too because it would seem like an organic action of the network. I am always sceptical of networks with central points of failure. 

The point of not creating all coins at once and also requiring WORK to produce it is not some arcane decision from Bitcoin founders'. It is the response to previous failed attempts to creating ecoins that had ventral points of failure and were produced at once. Nano, tries the same 90s trick in a new way and IMO won't work for the same reason that older ecoins didn't: people are greedy and some will take over.

Bitcoin at least in part recognizes that and tries/tried no matter how imperfectly to fight back. IMO bitcoin too failed but it did saw the way...",2019-02-24 07:36:05
eh4sfhn,moleccc,1,"&gt; You'd have to make regular backups

exactly. And those backups would contain the next 100 (or so, configurable) keys you'll generate. So if you did regular backups you really were safe.

The situation with LN is different in at least 2 ways:

  * backups have to be truly ""live"". There's no guessing of future channel state. This is very different from having to ""backup periodically"". I wouldn't even call that ""backup"", you basically need to use clustered db servers synchronizing live for that channel db.
  * in the 2013 bitcoin case, if your backup was too old (more than 100 keys generated since) you lose some fund, but in this LN case, if you attempt to restore a channel state that is even slightly old, your channel partner can take ALL YOUR FUNDS from that channel.

What a fucking nightmare... in 2013 it was clear that Bitcoin clients had to become a lot more user friendly for mass adoption. There was no way my mom would be able to safely use Bitcoin. Well, fast-forward 5 years and now **basically noone is going to be able to use Bitcoin (BTC) safely** (given adoption will happen at all, which seems quite questionable)... let alone my mom.

eh4sbgc,FantasticEchidna4,1,"I agree and I think that we should also question every 'community proposal' as yours. So I'll start with you. I don't think that we need to actively try to break it, that's the job of hackers. Normal users just need to choose products that fulfil their purposes whatever they might be. Some may use bitcoin for the freedom it gives, some to speculate on the price. It's a natural process.

If you're a UI designer, a dev, etc, someone that offers a product or service you just compete and win by merit. There is no place in a free market within bitcoin ecosystem for political action because bitcoin self regulates. And your proposal sounds like a political call. And those that fall on the convenience of custodial services, for example, will learn not to trust other people with their money when the service gets hacked.

eh7352v,enqueued,1,"&gt; Nano was 100% premined and then distributed ""fairly"", but even that is disputed as some people claimed the captcha was rigged etc and for all we know the devs paid a large amount to themselves secretly.

We know that Vitalik and the people who launched the Ethereum ICO both got paid for the coins they sold and gifted themselves some coins in addition, yet people seem to believe

\&gt; 'muh no cryptocurrency is decentralized by Bitcoin and Ethereum

If there is no critical rejection of Ethereum because of the known unfair distribution mechanism, then there is no unhypocritical basis for leveling a similar criticism against Nano.

In other words, the *only* cryptocurrency of note that I know of that has any claim to have been more fairly distributed than Nano is Bitcoin. But since more people knew about Nano at its inception than knew about Bitcoin, I'd argue that Nano has a better claim--and far less permanently lost coins.",2019-02-25 05:24:16

When you have big blocks, the cost of running a node increases to the point that only miners can run a node. So you're creating centralisation of nodes.

Bitcoin BTC has 10,600 nodes and is only useful if it is kept decentralized,  because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.

The time to initially sync a node increases dramatically. Fast block propagation is either not clearly viable.

eh9jbdm,Peter__R,1,"I recently gave a talk on SPV in Hong Kong (unfortunately, there isn't a professional recording to share). In preparing for my talk, I dug into SPV's fascinating history.  I thought I'd use your post here to provide a summary.  

The basics: The fundamental idea behind simplified payment verification (SPV) is explained in Section 8 of the [bitcoin white paper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf): if Alice pays Bob with a bitcoin transaction, Bob requires very little _additional_ information from the network to verify that the transaction was included in the blockchain.  Bob needs only two things:  (1) he needs to know the longest chain of block headers (which requires downloading 80 bytes every ten minutes), and (2) he needs to know the path through the Merkle tree that links the transaction he received to the root hash embedded in the block header (about 320 bytes of information for a block with 1000 transactions).  See [this video](https://youtu.be/MvM055u4bm4?t=1098) (starting at t = 18:18) for more information.  

Satoshi's SPV idea is simple and brilliant.  But the details get messy when implemented in the real world.  The first messy detail is how Bob actually _knows_ that Alice sent him a bitcoin transaction in the first place.  Alice _could_ directly deliver the transaction to Bob, for example via NFC or by sending it to Bob's IP address.  But today this isn't what usually happens.  What happens instead is that Alice broadcasts the transaction to a few random nodes on the bitcoin network, these nodes in turn ""gossip"" the transaction to other nodes, et cetera, until all nodes on the network are aware of the new transaction. Alice trusts that Bob will eventually hear about the transaction though this gossip process.  

This brings up the first obstacle to SPV.  The only way Bob can be sure to learn of the payment is to listen to _every_ transaction broadcast on the bitcoin network.  This obviously requires a lot of data (full-node level bandwidth!), which defeats the purpose of SPV in the first place. 

One way to solve this bandwidth obstacle is for Bob's wallet to register his address with a full node and ask it to forward him any transactions that pay him.  Later, when his transaction is confirmed in a block, the same node can also forward Bob the Merkle branch proof he requires to verify for himself that the payment he received was confirmed in the blockchain. 

Easy right?  Bob can trustlessly verify that he was indeed paid with only a few SMS-text-messages worth of data.  So what's the problem?  

The problem is that Bob is leaking privacy information.  The node that provides Bob information about his transaction knows that he (or rather the entity at his IP address) cares about these transactions.  Information about which transactions Bob is interested in is valuable to certain companies/agencies and is potentially harmful to Bob if leaked.  

The Bitcoin developers (e.g., Mike Hearn) came up with a clever solution to improve privacy: [BIP37 Bloom filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki).  The idea behind BIP37 is that rather than registering Bob's addresses with a full node, Bob registers a Bloom filter with the full node instead.  The Bloom filter is crafted by Bob's wallet so that all of the transactions Bob cares about get picked up by the filter, but some transactions that Bob _doesn't_ care about also get picked up by the filter, thereby confusing the node as to which transactions are really Bob's.  BIP37 allows Bob to ""tune"" the filter to be very private (i.e, to send Bob his transactions and LOTS of other random transactions) or highly selective (i.e., to send Bob his transactions and just a few other random transactions).  We see here that there appears to be a bandwidth-versus-privacy trade-off with SPV.

I still think BIP37 is great, but history has shown that it doesn't provide as much privacy as originally intended.  The privacy problem with BIP37 is subtle and is due to the fact the ""addresses"" are so prominent in the user experience today.  Every time Bob uses bitcoin to get paid he typically specifies a new address to the payer. Hopefully, this address is only paid once, but maybe Alice decides to pay Bob a second time using the same address.  And so Bob wants to constantly monitor _every address his wallet has every created_ for new incoming transactions.  This means the Bloom filters he registers with full nodes are constantly growing and changing.  Due to the way BIP37 is used in practice, it is possible for a node to determine specifically which addresses are Bob's from a series of these Bloom filters. We can fix this problem somewhat, but until we fully abstract ""addresses"" away from the user experience and make them truly ""single use,"" I think this will always be a bit of an issue.  Tom Zander (u/ThomasZander) probably has more to say on this topic. 

BRD is an example of a SPV wallet that uses BIP37.  

[BIP157/158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) took a new approach to SPV, as part of the LN efforts, and which our own Chris Pacia (u/Chris_Pacia) has contributed to and built upon.  BIP157/158 turns BIP37 on its head: rather than the SPV wallet registering a filter with a node, the node provides a filter to the SPV wallet of all the transactions it is aware of, e.g., in a given block.  If the SPV wallet sees that the filter contains transactions that Bob cares about, then the SPV wallet can download the complete block _from a different node_.  The wallet then builds the Merkle proof itself (from the downloaded block) to verify that the transaction was indeed included in the blockchain.  With this technique, there is no privacy information leaked at all.  But we see the bandwidth-versus-privacy trade-off once again: we've improved Bob's privacy but now his wallet is downloading complete blocks every once and a while.  This obviously isn't efficient if we imagine a future with 10 GB blocks! 

Neutrino is an example of a wallet that uses BIP157/158. 

Lastly, I'll say something about Electrum servers, although I really haven't studied them enough to speak as an authority on this topic.  

Firstly, I don't think it is correct to say ""'true' SPV doesn't need a server but Electrum wallets do.""  All SPV wallets need a server, it's just that with a wallet like BRD a run-of-the-mill Satoshi client can act as the ""server.""  But, remember, this is only the case _because_ BIP37 was added to the Satoshi client!  We could imagine a future where BU adds Electrum-server functionality but ABC doesn't.  Now is u/jonald_fyookball's Electron Cash a ""real"" SPV wallet or not?  The answer doesn't really matter because it's a bad question to ask in the first place.  In the future, we're going to see the services offered by full nodes diverge, with perhaps some providing BIP37, some providing full Electrum features, and some doing totally new things.  So this idea that Electron Cash relies on a ""server"" while BRD doesn't is a bad way to look at things in my opinion (they both need a server).  What is important instead is the trade-offs made by the particular SPV-wallet solution (e.g., in terms of bandwidth-vs-privacy, and other trade-offs).    

A second comment I'll add is that adding the features of an Electrum server to a mainstream Satoshi client would probably be controversial.  Understand that there is a not-insignificant faction of people who'd love to revert even BIP37!  I'd bet that Core would never in a million years add Electrum functionality, I'd be surprised if ABC would implement it, while I'd be surprised if BU _wouldn't_ implement it, at least as an option.  AFAIK, Electrum is a much greater privacy leak because SPV wallets directly ask for the Merkle branch proof they are interested in, and so it is much easier for an Electrum server to figure out which addresses belong to which users.

Download the source code for any Bitcoin wallet software  
or [bitcoin-tool](https://github.com/matja/bitcoin-tool)  
You might need to download the code for the secp256k1 elliptic curve separately  
The same applies to the SHA256 code and RIPEMD160 code  
Bitcoin Core source code does not have external dependencies for SHA256 RIPEMD160 or secp256k1. It's all there in one place  
bitcoin-tool does not handle SegWit addresses

Read the source code - the parts which derive public keys and addresses - and understand it thoroughly  
Each calculation is simple but it might take a few hours to get your first address  
Does your calculator handle 32-digit hexadecimal numbers?  

&gt; how would I convert the binary (again, no bitcoin client) to a private key in the tradition form?

This is trivial. Integer base conversion is a 30-minute high school lesson. Convert your 256 bit string to hexadecimal - 4 bits per hexadecimal digit. Convert to base58 using the standard method from high school - divide and record the remainder, repeat. Details about the base58 character set used by Bitcoin, and the application prefix and checksum suffix are here

I post ~5 days a week, respond to your Snaps when I can (but please no dick pics), take requests from time to time and Snap is the first place I go to show off new toys, lingerie or to test out new video concepts.

##**Very Detailed Dick Ratings**

**My very thorough cock ratings are one of my most popular services ([read the reviews!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarabelle_Says/wiki/ratings#wiki_reviews.3A)) and for good reason -- I have a lot of opinions about dicks.** When it comes to cocks, I'm something of a connoisseur. I have discerning taste and I'll tell you exactly what I like (or dislike) about your size, shape, grooming, photography skills, cumshot and how compatible I think we'd be in bed. I am happy to use your name for no additional charge -- please be sure to give me yours up front if you'd like me to use it. My ratings are honest and insightful by default, but I love to dole out the cruel SPH...if you think you can handle it. These are delivered within 72 hours --  I'm often much quicker than that, but for guaranteed [24 hour turnaround, add $10](https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/1000851201/Clarabelle-Woods/tip).

####DELUXE COCK RATING |
**$75** | a 1080p, 60fps nude video of me assessing every detail of your cock, including cumshot if desired! No upper limit on time, usually in the 10-15 minute range, though the longest was well over 20! **By far the most popular option &amp; my favorite as well!**

####WRITTEN |
**$25** | several paragraphs about your schlong and dick pictures, delivered via Reddit PM

ehcp277,chernobyl169,2,"Bitcoin was originally coded with no limit to the size of block that is acceptable to the network. In anticipation of antisocial mining tactics, a temporary limit of 1MB was included in bitcoin-qt (the project that later became bitcoin-core) so smaller miners wouldn't be shut out by more capable actors that flood their systems with oversize blocks.

Around 2013, adoption of BTC started to pick up and serious discussions about raising the limit emerged. A hot debate flared between the lead developers and the community of users, eventually (over several years) leading to the establishment of [thought leadership within BTC](https://redd.it/3h9cq4) and a wedge driven into the community of cryptocurrency supporters. At this point, it was decided that BTC would not have its block size limit increased to accommodate more users - much to the displeasure of a huge segment of the BTC-using community, some of which were actively developing business solutions that relied on a higher capacity than the chain was offering. Interestingly, during the debate, luke-jr was advocating for a *reduction* in capacity, to about 300kb (but nobody took it seriously).

Thus a capacity fork was first conceived - in the face of actually being told the literal phrase ""fork off"" - and eventually the fork of BTC that allowed for larger blocks and did not bear the burdensome technology called Segregated Witness was deployed and called Bitcoin Cash, and secured against a variety of attacks as they were discovered. This is the BCH I know and use today, the continuation of the Bitcoin experiment established in 2009 that is attempting to realize a global **peer-to-peer electronic cash system**. Contrast this phrase to Lightning Network's architecture of liquidity channels and routing requests and you may understand why people involved with cryptocurrency since before its conception are highly offended by the actions, behaviors, and decisions of BTC developers.

Meanwhile, BTC developers have continued down their chosen roadmap, relying on SegWit to provide an artificial capacity buffer while they deploy this quasi-offchain ""liquidity channel"" technology. Now that BCH is a distinct entity and most supporters of BCH are not involved in BTC, the idea to reduce the block limit to 300kb has resurfaced and is now being legitimately considered, as far as I can tell.

For Bitcoin to work, it needs to be the only one, or one of a very, very few perhaps. And it pretty much was until the bubble.

Bitcoin itself was starting to be adopted as s currency.  You could spend it in a few legitimate places. Even Steam at one point accepted it, I believe.  Ironically, the bubble has killed Bitcoin's value as a currency.  A currency that changes in value drastically overnight is wortheless.  A lot of places dropped the use of bitcoin as an acceptable currency because of, including Steam.

&gt; You don't get it. Bitcoin is like a ponzi, except there is no singular entity that can pull the plug, and there is no re-investment of the core assets. So the core asset(the coin itself) can't be lost or depreciated directly via market decline, and no one person can make off with all the money.

ehfuf47,thiswaynotthatway,1,"&gt; Isn't the problem that people are jealous instead of thankful for those that pay and make more?

This is what it comes down to with the tax issue, they are paying more in dollars but not as a proportion of earnings. The marginal tax rate doesn't have margin after &gt;$500k so people earning grossly higher than that aren't being put onto higher margins as they should. Then there's all the deductions and loopholes accessible to the rich and which often grant large companies the ability to operate almost tax free. The reason my political argument is directly related to this is that the outsized political power of the rich is the reason that these loopholes are allowed to exist.

It's got nothing to do with jealousy, it's got everything to do with equal representation. Even your bitcoin millionaire didn't get rich in a vacuum, unless you think he could do it in Somalia then he's benefiting from all the infrastructure and stability that comes with living in a developed country.

ehfxxr8,pcvcolin,1,"I've added an edit to my top ranked comment in this discussion to refer people interested to /u/SolarCrypto comments for some additional perspective. I hope this helps. I feel personally that _no matter what ends up in the bills' final text,_ the ULC's propsals to Legislatures of California, Oklahoma, Nevada, Hawaii, and possibly other states, are horrible and merit our decision to unleash the Hate Machine (a.k.a. ""Million Angry Kitt3hs"") to help stop these bills _regardless of what they contain and regardless of how they might later be amended_. That is how we stopped them in past years. It works. I know with certainty that _individuals and businesses_ will be profoundly harmed by these bills if they become law, with many individuals banned, de-boarded / unverified from services, and service regions negatively impacted by exchanges and individuals leaving states who do adopt bitlicense. We saw that happen in New York and it will happen again. 

Even if the bill(s) do not expllicitly authorize a full ban, all it would take once the bills are passed that I have objected to here, to arrive at full ban, is either the adoption of a tiny sentence as implementing regulation or a tiny amendment to any bill signed into law, at some future date. If you approve of the bills that is the future of bitcoin in California and beyond - bans, sanctions, ""blacklists,"" and court battles. Not what we want or need. California has a practice of ""gut-and-amend"" where bills that have to do with milk or the environment are passed through the Assembly or Senate, then once passed, the bills are gutted-and-amended to be turned into bills that ban behavior, use of certain assets or tools, and even bans on exercise of Constitutional rights. If you understand the nefarious California Legislature as I do, as I have come to understand it intimately, you will know that a bill as introduced or passed is _never_ the full measure of what California Legislature will actually end up using it for. It _always_ becomes worse. For that reason, even bills having to do with ""milk"" in California are now rightly viewed with suspicion by a large number of people in the State. It's terrible, but that is how the CA legislature does business.

With that said, I hope you get an alternative perspective from /u/SolarCrypto comments. But beware - these bills must be stopped, no matter what form they take now or later. Their passage will become an open sandbox for expansion of regulatory intervention which will become a series of bans on activity in the space. It is worthwhile to rally the community against all bills targeted here.",2019-02-28 10:27:22
