With Bitcoin, the value is derived from some (or all) of the following: utility, store of value, scarcity. 

With VET, the value attributes of Bitcoin don't really apply. There but isn't much utility (it's not used as currency) and the store of value and scarcity are heavily diluted because of the large circulating supply. 

Value of VET is driven by the two-token system. The VET token is valuable because it generates VTHO, which itself has value. Without VTHO, the VET token has no value whatsoever. 

I like the cow/milk analogy. A dairy cow has value because it produces milk. If the market price of milk goes up (supply/demand) then the value of the cows goes up as well. If people stopped consuming milk, the value of those cows would go to 0. 

Vechain's two token system is brilliant. As the demand for VTHO goes up, the demand (price) of those VTHO producing machines (VET) will go up as well. It's really that simple.",2019-05-01 03:14:04

em5awwt,SarangNoether,38,"It's monthly report time. As always, my thanks to the Monero community for ongoing support of my research and the project ecosystem.

Along with general code library cleanup, a good deal of work was completed on signature schemes this month. The formal analysis of the [DLSAG dual-address signature construction](https://getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0008.pdf) continues, with ongoing coauthor review and edits for conference submission and release of the preprint. Some questions remain about the consequences of a proposed modification to dual-address key images.

Another signature scheme was [proposed by research contributor RandomRun](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/52) that reduces the size of ring signatures substantially. The scheme, denoted CLSAG (compact LSAG), uses key aggregation to reduce the number of scalars required for a ring signature (at the cost of a single additional group element per signature). I produced [example code in Python](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/clsag/hashes), as well as [timing code in C++](https://github.com/SarangNoether/monero/tree/clsag-plumbing), to determine if the signature scheme could be made fast enough to be useful. After the addition of some modified cryptographic functions to increase efficiency, tests showed that CLSAG signatures are indeed faster to verify than our current MLSAG ring signatures! Note that both the example code and the timing code are for research only, and are not yet suitable for use in production without review.

For our present ring size of 11, a typical 2-input/2-output transaction uses 2.54 kB of space and takes (on my test machine) 13.0 ms to verify the MLSAG signature. Using CLSAG, the same transaction requires only 1.9 kB of space and takes 11.1 ms to verify the signature. This reduces the transaction size by 25% and the verification time by 15% too! A technical note describing the scheme with security proofs is still underway, since there are some [design choices](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/clsag/clsag) to make about hash coefficients that could give an additional 5% benefit in verification time. There is no formal plan to move to CLSAG signatures yet, but they are very promising.

My [proposed modification to ring decoy selection](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/outputs/outputs) has been updated to account for a moving window that is used to determine average output arrival times. This proposal has been merged in a [pull request by moneromooo](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/5389) with accompanying tests. It helps to mitigate some weighting issues and analysis heuristics.

I have proposed to integrate the [Dandelion++ (D++) transaction relay scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11060) into Monero. The D++ protocol helps to mitigate against certain types of network observation by building a random node graph that is used when initially broadcasting a new transaction, before the transaction is diffused to all nodes in the network. Variations on this are already being used in other projects like [Zcoin](https://github.com/zcoinofficial/zcoin/pull/262) and [Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/2628), with a Bitcoin [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0156.mediawiki) also available. The use of D++ does not remove the need for other network-level approaches (like Tor or I2P) that are helpful to mitigate targeted node analysis, but it is a good complement that can be handled entirely at the relay level.

Work analyzing the [Lelantus transaction construction](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/373) is available. This proposal was released as a preprint by a Zcoin researcher and has undergone several recent revisions. It is a clever application of modified Bulletproofs, zero-commitment proofs, and double-blinded Pedersen commitments that extends some of the ideas originally introduced in Zerocoin. The protocol has some privacy limitations and questions of efficiency, but the underlying approach deserves careful review to determine if any part of it may be feasible for Monero in the future. I have [example code](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/lelantus/lelantus) that demonstrates simple transaction flows, have worked up a [method](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/blob/lelantus/lelantus/migration.md) for safely transitioning Monero outputs to the Lelantus format, and am in contact with the paper's author to discuss future work and offer suggestions for efficiency improvements. Depending on the precise use of common anonymity sets across groups of transactions, initial calculations suggest impressive batched verification times. This is research only, with no plans to move to such a protocol.

For the next month, I plan to continue analysis of transaction protocols like Lelantus, complete code and tests to efficiently generalize Bulletproofs for arbitrary input length, and tidy up some loose ends with the CLSAG signature scheme proofs.

I've always loved programing and my sophomore year of high school made the transition to writing mobile apps. I would write the Android apps while my ""business partner"" wrote the iOS version. I say business partner in quotes because at the time it didn't feel like much of a business-- just fun.

Well our portfolio of apps grew and eventually we decided to leverage that as proof to small businesses in the areas that we knew our stuff and got a significant amount of freelance work at ~$45 an hour each which was awesome for a couple of 16 year olds but as you can imagine not nearly enough to make me a million before 20.

But at the time I also happened to be falling in love with bitcoin and put all my profits from the freelancing into it and sold last year at $15k which did the trick for my first million.

- Everyone must wear hats: Hats are either designed by Jimmy, or must have ponies and NO2X / UASF on them.

- Theymos must be able to ban anyone regardless of the above policy, or must be plugged-in a “ban everyone” simulation for the duration of the event.

- The debate results MUST NOT expose Lightning Network’s inferiority to on-chain scaling. Any attempt to discredit LN’s approach to bring bank custodial banking to Bitcoin will immediately result in the automatic exercise of Article 1, and the ban will also extend to include friends and family of participants for good measure.

- Adam Back must be able to carry a large wood tab with him at all times, in case he needs to demonstrate a Bitcoin Transaction.

- Champaign will be served and popped during the event anytime BTC transaction fees hit &gt; $1. Blockstream will only provide empty glasses. The Bitcoin Cash side of the debate must provide Champaign.

- The debate must allow for Liquid and Tether/Bitfinex infomercials at no less than 50% of the total debate time.

If all the participating parties accept those terms, please send a Bitcoin BTC transaction to Blockstream with no more then 20 cents in fees; once -and if ever- said transaction is confirmed, Blockstream will approve the debate.

em9yck0,skinnynipps,89," All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body.

em9at7b,boomsc,54,"Language just hasn't caught up with industry yet. Think of them like 'microtransactions' and 'Microtransations'.

Pre-2000's: No DLC/Microtransaction crap at all. You buy a game and you have the game; cheats, extras and unlockables included.

2000's: 'microtransations' in the form of DLC. BL2 heads, Expansion packs, extra skins. That kind of jazz.

2010's: 'Microtransactions'. Injecting 'in-game currency' purchased with real money stores, gameplay expediating boosts, time-skips, loot crates etc.

Obviously what we all *want* is the pre-2000's era. Games like Witcher 3 where the only post-game-purchase costs are for straight up expansion packs (Callbacks to Myst, Diablo and original WoW expansions) but in the two odd decades we've learned to accept 'microtransactions' and accept a world where you have to throw down some more money for extra customization options or additional content.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is publishers have grabbed the concept and run *so far* and *so fast* with it that while we're all still back here thinking about 'microtransactions' in the way of BL2's Skin Packs and Slaughterdome expansions, they're off in the distance somewhere waving shiny lottery boxes and vomiting up pixelated bitcoin-bukakke; and still calling it 'Microtransactions' to confuse you every time someone says 'microtransactions are good' but 'Microtransactions are bad'.

&amp;#x200B;

For the time being, until language catches up, you'll just have to take a more nuanced look at each one. In this case the 'microtransactions' are probably going to be *okay* because they'll be in the vein of actual expansion content and skins and a direct $-to-content transfer. If later news starts talking about purchasable in-game currency, in-game stores, loot boxes (and not ***LOOTSPLOSIONS!?!!!***) and experience boost 'Microtransactions' then it's probably *not okay*.",2019-05-02 05:51:54

1) Network effects. It's still the main pairing in most exchanges. I would encourage more people to use CoinEx.com because it uses Bitcoin Cash pairings instead of BTC.

2) Tether. The Bifinex guys are openly hostile to Bitcoin Cash and they control tether. They can print as much tether as they want and they can use that to boost the price of BTC artificially high to prevent BCH taking over. Because the moment BCH takes over, the game is up. Looking at things, the end may not be that far away from Bitfinex and Tethers. (Note: Tethers had also been used to boost Bitcoin Cash price but I would argue majority of it was on BTC.)

3) Bitcoin brand. I tried to talk to people about Bitcoin Cash but it's not easy.

emayk7w,biba8163,38,"Ripple is all marketing.  After it's price peaked to $.05 riding the coattails of 2013 Bitcoin bubble, XRP tanked to ~$0.006 range for 3 years.  There really wasn't any growth, working on adoption, expanding the network, etc over that time.   XRP finally recovered in around March 2017 after Bitcoin had slowly recovered over years and then was starting another bullrun.  Anyone holding XRP would have bled money year after year and most people wouldn't have been able to hold on to it.

Starting the 2017 bullrun, Ripple again starts marketing itself as the bridging and settlement currency of the banks despite the fact that it's been pretty much dead for 3 years and it has zero volume and liquidity in the corridors of the world where it is most needed to provide this utility.  People new to crypto fall for this and how cheap the coin looks and it has a major spike from $0.006 to ~$0.30 really quickly.  It again has a major spike after the Bitcoin bubble pops and people flee to ALTs looking for returns, especially pumped by Korea where XRP has just recently been introduced to exchanges and the price pumps from $0.20 to over $3.00.    

A lot of people are hesitant to leave XRP because of the 2 huge price surges in the 2017/2018 boom.  But these 2 quick and sudden surges show more of a speculative FOMO anamoly than Ripple actually being adopted, used and having natural growth.  Besides Ripple's marketing there has been no network growth and adoption of banks since 2013.  Now it looks like it's doing what it did for 3 years, slowly bleeding and waiting for the next Bitcoin bullrun.  I think people holding XRP, actually believing their marketing that it's a bank coin, will continue to lose value relative to Bitcoin for years just like last time.",2019-05-02 19:22:32

At the end of the release are ""testimonials"" from some of the companies that are apparently using or plan to use this service.  Emphasis mine:

&gt; SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr. 30, 2019-- Today, Amazon Web Services Inc., an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Managed Blockchain, a fully managed service that makes it easy to create and manage scalable blockchain networks. Customers who want to allow multiple parties to execute transactions and maintain a cryptographically verifiable record of them without the need for a trusted, central authority can quickly setup a blockchain network spanning multiple AWS accounts with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Amazon Managed Blockchain scales to support thousands of applications and millions of transactions using popular open source frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

&gt; Customers typically create blockchain networks using frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, but setting up the networks using these frameworks is difficult and time consuming. Each member of a blockchain network has to provision hardware, install software, create and manage certificates for access control, and configure network settings. As usage of a blockchain application grows, there is a lot of work involved in scaling the network, including monitoring resources across all nodes, adding or removing hardware, and managing the availability of the entire network. This complexity is the reason many customers typically need the help of expensive consultants to make blockchain work. Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed blockchain service that makes it easy and cost effective for customers to create and manage secure blockchain networks that can scale to support thousands of applications running millions of transactions. Customers simply choose their preferred framework (Hyperledger Fabric is supported at launch with **Ethereum support coming later this year**), add network members, and configure the member nodes that process transaction requests.

&gt; **“Blockchain is far more than just Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.** It’s changing the way companies do business and giving us a new way to solve complex business problems,” said Andy Daudelin, Vice President, Alliances Business Development, AT&amp;T Business.

&gt; “Transparency in supply chains is increasingly important to consumers, who want to know what is in their food and where it comes from. While Nestlé has begun to release information on its supply chains for its 15 key commodities, using blockchain technology enables a more precise tracking,” said Armin Nehzat, Digital Technology Manager, Nestlé Oceania.

&gt; “At Accenture, blockchain is driving business transformation in virtually every industry—from aerospace to not-for-profits,” said Prasad Sankaran, Senior Managing Director of Accenture’s Intelligent Cloud &amp; Infrastructure business group. “Blockchain’s unique characteristics are helping to reinvent complex supply chains, improve business processes, and expand the reach and veracity of our digital identities. As the technology continues to take hold, services such as Amazon Managed Blockchain can drive both cost saving and revenue generating opportunities.”",2019-05-03 00:08:50

&amp;#x200B;

Tether is an inflationary scam.  That will destroy the exchanges that use it.

&amp;#x200B;

You take $1000(1000 tether) and buy bitcoin at $1,000.  You now have 1 bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin goes to $20,000 and you sell it for tether, tether has to artificially print 19,000 more tether to meet your request to exchange bitcoin into tether.

&amp;#x200B;

Now bitcoin drops from $20,000 back to $4,000.  The 20,000 tether in the market is now worth 5 bitcoin. So you buy back in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now your 5 bitcoin goes back to $20,000 and you sell again. You now need 80,000 more tether, generated out of thin air, to meet your request to exchange 5 bitcoin into 100,000 tether.

&amp;#x200B;

Print, print, print.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now you've sold your 5 bitcoin, and are sitting on 100,000 Tether that is ""worth"" $100,000.

&amp;#x200B;

And now you decide to cash out.  Where does your $100,000 USD come from?

It has to come from other cash deposits that people have put into the exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

It can't come from tether, because tether isn't printing USD, they are printing a digital coin.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so the exchange finds $100,000 USD from other depositors to send to your bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

The money is now in your pocket, so the 100,000 Tether that was created from thin air should also disappear, right?

&amp;#x200B;

No. It never disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens is that while the market is going up, the exchange has to get freshly printed tether to issue to anyone trading in and out of bitcoin at higher dollar values.  But when the market rolls over and people want to cash out, just because the exchange has100M tether in their reserve doesn't mean they have $100M in USD deposits to honor those requests.

&amp;#x200B;

You only put $1000 USD into the exchange and are now trying to pull out $100,000. The general rise of the overall market can put the exchange in a situation where the value of it coins significantly exceed the value of the cash ever put into the exchange. So it can't honor withdrawals.

I'm pretty sure this is it. He's quoted in the article:

 “My worst fears were being played out in real time,” he said. “They traded the money into bitcoin and then they withdrew it all.” 

Standard brokerage accounts don't offer this (to my knowledge). It sounds to me like he had $1 million parked in a cryptocurrency exchange. If he did and that's 90% of his net worth, this is more on him than anybody else. Crypto exchanges are not safe. You can safely store value in the coin itself (outside the exchange), but letting it sit in your exchange account is no good and there's plenty of precedent of that stuff being stolen with no recourse.

I can't draw up a scenario in my head where a legit broker will quickly transfer funds out to somebody with a name other than the account owner. The article makes no mention of a broker either...I don't think there was one to blame here.",2019-05-04 01:31:10

I do think it's good to check balances and such, but locking into specific funds should avoid the need to micromanage investments.  And, while the dude's phone provider was hacked (or phone employee paid off) it was an eye opening to what you are using for 2FA.  Moving the important stuff to a VOIP number or going for a separate hardware key seems like a good idea... though anything can be hacked with enough information.   Seems like t-mobile is one of the major carriers that is common to be hacked as hackers have a tool to skim personal data from that service (I've been reading other articles online) to help with the hack.. though they prefer to payoff store employees (which seems more risky for the theif, versus making a phone call).  So maybe don't use t-mobile?

Also a lot of the sim swap hackers seem to target instagram users with simple names so they can sell the accounts.  Maybe not being on instagram is a good idea?  Additionally the common currency stolen appears to be bitcoin or similar products.

emgkumu,x86_64_,29,"After reading the story, this may be the dumbest, lowest-ROI ransom ever.  Tell me if I'm missing something.

First let's get the hyperbole out of the way - this wasn't a 'hack'.  Nobody took advantage of any weaknesses in the platforms it targeted, the affected repos were all accessed *using the correct username and password*.  The credentials with admittedly weak or reused passwords were stored in plain text on related repos (does this mean they were open source anyway?).  This is the equivalent of leaving your car unlocked and the keys in the ignition.

The repositories had their commit histories blanked -**the repos were not wiped.**  It's extremely, extremely unlikely that a 'hacker' went to the trouble and expense of actually downloading 392 git projects for the purpose of ransoming them.

So if I were to think about the type of *users* affected, I'd say 1) casual devs using free accounts, 2) users who set up a repo and forgot about it, so their repos are empty anyway, 3) users for whom security is not even a passing concern, as 2FA would have stopped it.  So, non-critical, non-essential code belonging to users unconcerned with security. 

Now for the holes in the perpetrator(s) plan:  

* By design, Git is decentralized - so the victims would simply recreate an origin on the server then push the missing repositories from any remote (yeah they would be out of luck if they wiped all their remotes)
* Git users are unusually technical, surrounding themselves with vast networks of support.  Considering the 'hack' consisted of *making it look like the repository was empty* and help is just a StackOverflow post away, a novice can defeat this inconvenience inside of an hour.
* Any modern hosted service will have a recovery feature, however timely or easily sought.  
* Nobody trusts bitcoin ransomers.

The parabolic rise in BTC and alts in late 2017 was built on the foundation of a 3 year bullish impulse driven by BTC adoption starting in 2015.  Bitcoin is the tide that raises all ships, and if you study Bitcoin's price history, or even the SPY or DOW, you'll see 3 different market phases:  Bull cycle, bear cycle (generally shorter) and then a consolidation period before another bull cycle emerges.  We've spent the requisite amount of time in a bear cycle in 2018 and only recently has Bitcoin entered into what looks like a consolidation phase with price slowly turning bullish again.  If you're investing in alts, you absolutely need to follow BTC until the market matures in such a way that alt projects can really decouple from the risk-on experiment that is crypto.  BTC is \*only\* 10 years old which makes it a baby compared to traditional instruments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to look at 3 different things when making an investment, and these attributes are what VC's examine as well when choosing to invest in a start-up or fledgling project:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Product:  What is the group building and how does it work?

2) Team:  What is the team's track record and are they equipped to execute on their plan.

3) Market:  Is the market demanding this kind of product?

&amp;#x200B;

Cardano is, in my view, the most promising investment in the utility platform space in the sense that they are building out a decentralized Dapp platform that may contend with ETH; their team is top notch and CH has a proven track record of attaching himself to winners; the market is still a bit of a question mark as it's unclear how much real adoption will happen in the short run, but it's difficult to dismiss the idea that decentralized networks will claim some real value moving into the next decade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cardano is a \*speculative\* investment with high risk and potentially high rewards.  If they deliver on their promises, they will claim a large portion of the utility coin market share as more mature Dapps are developed on a framework that mates with consumer demand and can scale fluidly over time.  But we don't know if this happen, nor do we even know that this model will find real demand in the short term.  It's important to remember that no current incumbent has proved that POS works at scale, and so the notion of 'first mover advantage' is erroneous.  We've seen the first version of flight, but no jetliners; this transition will take some time.  This is the bet you're making if you're an investor; you're betting on decentralized networks becoming a new model for how people transact and make decisions as a collective free from the censorship and power consolidations seen in traditional centralized systems. 

Like many of you, I bought back into Cardano on the way down with an avg coin price of $0.13 and would love to see my investment 10x but I'm very patient and don't see any reason to abandon the project right now.  If I were to abandon the project it would be for the following reasons:

1) They begin laying of engineers and their github commit count starts to wane coupled with further delays and murky promises on release dates.  So far, I don't see this happening.  I created a post not to long ago which examined the ['Dev Report' by Electric Capital](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c745b19c2ff6174b1290e42/t/5c805a3ae4966b1ce3a2a937/1551915603922/The+Dev+Report.pdf) which did a deep dive into real work being done in the space.  This report is worth reviewing and shows that Cardano ranks highest amongst competitors in their code commits measured against network value.  This is an important metric as it shows that a tremendous amount of money is being spent on development and when squared against negative sentiment in the bear market, provides an opportunity for long term investors. 

2) CH publicly announces he's abandoning the project.  While in the long term, Cardano doesn't need CH as the network transitions from an internal and federated model to a decentralized model driven by governance, if he were to quit the project tomorrow, I'd be inclined to offload some of my holdings as the project does need centralized leadership in the current state.

3) Dapps do not find a level of adoption promised by the starting principles driving the project.  If Cardano and like competitors are resigned to a ""Google glass"" outcome (i.e. Cool idea, but no one wants to actually use it), then I'd be inclined to sell my stake and move that capital to more promising investments.

&amp;#x200B;

CH is right.  People need to chill.  Close your browser and check price later this year.  If we go through another boom cycle, you'll want to hold into 2022 an minimum.  The people who make the most money in any market have patience as well as capacity to move their capital into more promising instruments once the writing is on the wall.  Short term news cycles will shake out the weak hands because they fail to see the larger picture and this happens in every market.  I'm reminded of Amazon which went from $110 to $5 during the 2000 crash.  Because Amazon was always playing the long game, they rewarded shrewd investors with massive gains in the following cycle.

emnztlw,GoodReason1,676,"Speaking as a person who has actually read some of J. Stiglitz his books, and has watched countless lectures, I feel obligated to say that most comments here (not all) are extremely misguided.

First of all, J. Stiglitz is not just another economist or banker. He is a world-renowned economist who has taken very admirable positions regarding the current financial system, most of them relate to why we no longer believe in it, and most of you would strongly agree with these positions for sure. Speaking from experience, he is one of the few economists (like T. Piketty, or P. Krugman) who is actually more interested in raising the average life-quality for the working people in the world, and is strongly against concentration of means and wealth into the hands of a small number of people or financial entities. I guarantee you that this person has done more in his life to challenge the broken financial sector, and all of it's fraudulent activities, then any of us ever will. I mean just think about some of the titles of his best-selling books ""*The Price of Inequality*"" or ""*The Three Trillion Dollar War""* or ""*Making Globalization Work"".*

Secondly, he is the first to admit that the current financial system is completely and utterly broken. He believes banks have only 1 aspect that is of any use to the economy, as an intermediary, to provide a payments network. Which should -according to him- should be almost free of charge. All it's other activities such as speculation, inflationary lending (I must add, for asset-inflation, he does consider inflation for productive purposes a good thing for the economy, but not for house-loans for instance) , lobbying, ... are disregarded by him as being immoral, and a drag on the -what is sometimes called - ""the real economy"", not the financial fairy-dust economy. For decades, long before any of us had heard of Bitcoin, this man has been screaming from the rooftops that the current financial sector is utterly insane and that it doesn't serve the interests of the vast majority of people, bitterly condemning the bank bailouts for example.

Thirdly, no words should be put into his mouth. His only real objection I've heard is the lack of transparancy (i.e. monero/Zcash). Where nobody would be able to trace anything. From *his* perspective, I strongly agree with this statement. BUT his perspective is that governments are not that infiltrated by the powers that be. That governments will still act in the name of it's people. If we would all be living in properly functioning democracies I believe that giving the state this transparency can be very beneficial to all of ours lives. But, this is where he and I, and most you, differ. I no longer trust my government to act in my interests. I mean, if my government allows elites to have Swiss bank-accounts, and I can get one aswel, then I will, after all, I'm the one in need of more protection, not them.

Fourth, notice that in this statement he refers to *elites* stashing away their wealth in dark places. He sees crypto as an additional way for *them* to be doing that. He didn't refer to the every day person, and that's not a coincidence to any person who has read one of his books. Yes, he does believe the US Dollar is a good currency. And by historical standards, he is absolutely right. The US Dollar has survived extremely well, compared to the thousands of other fiat-currencies in history, that all went to 0.

He believes the dollar can start working for everyone of us (by massively regulating the private sector again -just like we used to have during our best economic growth, the Bretton Woods system, and have central banks answer to governments - which they obviously no longer need to do), just like it did in the 60's and 70's, when it did!

Fifth, I'm not sure whether he understands the political aspect of cryptocurrency, the governance-side of it. It's pretty obvious because he thinks Cryptocurrencies can be shut down. But I find it hard to believe he would be against a currency that is directly or indirectly ruled by the mayority of people. This is just speculation on my part, but I've read his books. The idea of direct governance by voting or mining or some other mechanism is something that I think he would support. He just still believes central banks and governments are more fit to carry out the task of making a currency work for everybody, and not just all-powerfull financial entities.

Those here interested in renowned economists should check out prof. *""Richard Wener""*. He's the academic that provided the first empirical evidence, in 2014, that individual private banks create currency out of thin-air. I find it stunning that nobody in the crypto space knows his name, while he's probably our biggest academic champion of all time. The research can be found here: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070).

If you think it's going to be worth a lot of money someday you can always buy a used copy secondhand... they are really cheap. Worst case you eventually sell one or the other and you lose very little.

If you are keeping games with the hope that they'll be worth a lot of money someday, you should know that games offer poor returns.

I've still been lurking, but mostly just observing the market and not trading much, since alts dropped on their ratios more so than I was expecting, and that in conjunction with the tether/Bitfinex news had me a bit worried about the integrity of the market...so I've been hesitating to make any bold statements about it. I will say that living in New York with ridiculously tight crypto regulation has me a bit suspicious of the AG's true intentions, even though I'm sure people will be rightfully convicted. New York is old school. They still prefer cash here. They're also pretty untrustworthy of outsiders and are very strict on companies that they believe to be taking advantage of people. Makes sense that they're spearheading this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this hasn't stopped me from doing analysis, and I've been posting on and off on Tradingview. I made some great calls and some pretty decent trades recently so I decided to take a little bit of a step back. For reference, when everyone was bearish here in January, I kept talking about descending resistance lines, and how they should be taken seriously. Going long once those were broken would've been a great idea in hindsight. [Here's](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Z7Qe8dVj-Buying-Into-Fear-Bitcoin-BTC-Long-Setup/) where I first posted a trade setup for that. We actually surpassed my first target for that setup. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently made [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/wjtyarTO-Bears-Keep-Looking-At-The-Wrong-Charts/) video, explaining why I think the market continues going up, despite many people expecting a selloff. Also [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XLMBTC/V3KGyyZL-Why-Bitcoin-Hasn-t-Dropped-Yet-Altcoin-Market-Analysis/) video focusing a little more on alts. We could dump, and things could of course get very bad, but I've been looking at a number of factors, including the recovery of some stocks after the dotcom bubble, the stock market's current trajectory, altcoins against the U.S. Dollar (most still look pretty bullish, despite losing dominance). ETH especially has been consolidating just below major resistance for quite a while. I also have an eye on this [trendline](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/VuBku4tC-Bullish-Projection-For-Cryptos/), and if broken, the market will probably have to slow down its growth. I guess this could happen if the economy starts to turn south. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm still around. Sentiment has just been weird lately, since bears are in disbelief, bulls are uncertain, and people who like altcoins (like myself) are sweating, and probably a lot of people are salty that Bitcoin has taken over for now (definitely can sense this in r/cryptocurrency). This is not out of line with what has happened in the past though. Should've seen that one coming. I've made some pretty great calls, but no one's perfect. Not even Victor Cobra.

Think about it: if he truly believed that it does not have the attributes of a good currency, he would not be asking for a ban, as it would not be necessary.

However, it is now quite obviously too late for a ban. A ban could have killed an early Bitcoin, but that ship sailed long long ago. I am afraid Stiglitz grossly underestimates how big the ""monster"" has become already.",2019-05-07 02:43:06

emqlcgi,Merlin560,36,"Well this is turning out nicely.

We had a breakout last night and we came within a hair of hitting $6,000.

While I appreciate the psychological impact of $6,000, I think the real battle comes at $6,800 where we broke the trend last November and the price started its sharp decline.  I believe that $6,500-$7,000 is where the significant resistance will come.

The prices today are:

We broke out into a double top break out.  The target for this formation is a high of $6,000 based on the slight width of THIS formation.  I would suggest we might want to consider the entire formation which is 15 or 16 columns wide—but that is not “technical” so I stick to the smaller target.  

The second target is based on the last breakout, which would put the top at about $6,300.  

These targets are for the next couple for weeks to a month.  Just as a comparison, the much discussed bullish catapult of April occurred at around $5,350.  Here we are, around a month later and the price is $500-550 above that.  10-15% is the low end for a catapult within 45-60 days.  We still have some room to run.

I know this is a trading sub, but it is important to understand that some trading is trend or swing trading—not day trading.

All of this is tentative because if the price drops below $5,550 we would continue the move downwards that was reversed with today’s move.  I hope I am not jinxing our reversal and breakout by not marking it all “tentative.”

I AM noticing a ton of positive bitcoin news—from it NOT being berated on Fox Biz this morning, to all of the news from Fidelity and the positive technical analysis.

I am trying hard to contain my enthusiasm.  Bitcoin lately has been like the seedlings I am growing—one good wind storm or chill in the night and they die on me.    So, I keep them protected as best I can, keep an eye on them and hope for the best.

I urge you all to do the same.

emouaxz,thieflar,31,"&gt;I don't get it... I mean it's not like anyone would use more dial up modems to increase the blocksize.

The thing that you're apparently missing is that the image is not a literal depiction of reality, but rather an [analogy](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/analogy).

I'm not defending the image or OP, mostly because it's low-quality content that I would like to see less of in /r/Bitcoin and because the ""scaling debate"" is a dead horse that's really not worth beating at this point... but I'm still happy to explain the point being made: basically, ""attempting to scale in the straightforward-but-naive way is misguided when we could instead prioritize the development of new technology to achieve superior results"".

&gt;I'd be against a gigantic increase, but I think there's pretty clearly room to compromise on the blocksize without ""adding more modems.""

There are quite a few points that can be made here:

1) The Bitcoin community already *did* ""compromise on the blocksize"" in 2017, replacing the old 1MB limit with a significantly-higher 4M WU limit. It seems that you recognize this fact from your other comments here, so that's good.

2) Right now, Bitcoin isn't even seeing the new, higher limit get fully taken advantage of, indicating that the base-layer throughput is more than sufficient for the current levels of organic transaction activity that we enjoy, and that *another* follow-up increase in the limit isn't a particularly pressing priority or pain-point, all things considered.

3) If given the choice between minimizing the [CONOP](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization/) and maximizing base-layer throughput, it seems that a considerable portion of Bitcoin's userbase would prioritize the former over the latter. This is justifiable for many reasons, but to reduce things down to a digestible summary, let's just say: *decentralization is the number one priority in Bitcoin*, and it's what sets Bitcoin apart from the litany of shitcoins riding on its coattails.

4) Even if we restrict our focus to base-layer throughput (and there is no good reason to do so), there are better ways to maximize that figure than ""iNcReaSe tHe BLoCkSizE!!1!"" which are unfortunately neglected in the absence of pressure to adopt and/or develop them (e.g. transaction batching and fee-management algorithms/tools), and currently the best-understood, most-obvious, most-direct, and most-powerful form that pressure can take is only manifest when blocks are full (or nearly so) and fees become meaningful to users.

5) There are large, powerful, well-financed actors who have repeatedly demonstrated a lack of moral scruples and willingness to attack Bitcoin in creative and pernicious ways. These antagonists would almost certainly not hesitate to do everything in their power to fracture, confuse, and harm Bitcoin if granted an opportunity to do so; a hard-fork proposal, and in particular one which is contentious (see #3 above) and/or concerns the blockweight limit, would represent exactly this sort of opportunity. This makes a blockweight-limit-increase an all-risk, almost-no-reward proposal (at least for right now and in the near-term future).

6) According to our best understanding, full blocks are not only *not a bad thing*, but actually *outright beneficial* and perhaps even *necessary* for Bitcoin over medium- or long-term time horizons. No one has yet proposed an even somewhat compelling analysis of what timelines we should be focused on or what the transition period duration(s) should be when it comes to Bitcoin's economic maturation and the epochs thereof, much less one which indicates that working to maximize per-block transaction-space leeway in the short-term is healthy or desirable. Until such analysis takes place and is peer-reviewed and accepted as valid, the premise that ""we should strive to make blocks not-full"" is arguably backwards. On top of this, disincentivizing chain-bloat is worthwhile in and of itself.

7) Base-layer throughput isn't even necessarily a figure that is worth trying to increase in the first place. Solutions involving secondary or tertiary layers of the Bitcoin stack, including payment-channel-based tech, sidechains, aggregative tools, and the like (e.g. Lightning Network, eltoo, compression techniques, other off-chain approaches, and all the supplemental or complementary tools and tricks that go along with these things) are already available for users who prioritize fast or cheap transactions, and boast the added benefit of *not threatening Bitcoin's fundamental value-add* too. These sorts of things are constantly being improved and updated (largely thanks to the pressure mentioned in #4 above), and *already* provide noncustodial, trust-minimized mechanisms for virtually-instant and virtually-free Bitcoin payments for those users who want or need them.

This is all off the top of my head, and I could probably keep going, but the main point is that there aren't really any good reasons to demand or champion a hard fork regarding an increase in the blockweight limit right now, and there are *plenty* of good reasons not to. So let's focus on productive things instead.",2019-05-07 08:20:27

I think the whole thing didn't make sense even from a tunnel-vision autistic navel-gazing game theory perspective, and it made far less of one considering the values and politics of the Bitcoin community.

As soon as the theft was confirmed the attacker had a substantial advantage.  Even if you assumed miners would be willing to disrupt Bitcoin and all its users, and that Binance and others would be okay with the political and legal ramifications... you're still left with that the attacker can easily outbid: their amount to bid with is increased by the honest hashrate percentage and the value of the income from all the blocks already mined.

The whole idea was just delusional.

By all means, fiduciaries should feel obligated to explore all possibilities, including unreasonable ones.  I always through it was an example of a failure of the MTGox trustee (for example) not even asking the community if it would change the protocol to make MTGox whole... not because the request wouldn't be a total joke-- it would be.

So if we run the earlier presegwit client side by side with the segwit client, we discover there are actually *two different versions of the BTC blockchain at any given time*. The ""real"" oltre that the miners are following, and the fake one that's been ""unloaded"" to trick old clients into thinking they're following the current version of the chain, which they aren't.

This is why “bitcoin is ruining the environment because it eats up x% of the worlds power “ is so flawed in my opinion 

Completely discounts the fact that in a lot of these places you can’t just transport the energy to somewhere else really far away.  There is a tremendous amount of power generated that’s either not purchased or lost in transmission from these plants, or even just wasted all together.

So in a way bitcoin mining is actually making renewable energy more profitable and you can make the argument this is better for the environment in the long run 

There’s even a new company (the name escapes my mind) where they go to natural gas wells where previously they literally set the excess gas on fire and vent the C02 into the atmosphere (process is called flaring) and instead the vent can be capped and the excess gas is used to power a generator that runs bitcoin miners

The beauty of the whole system is that people mining utilizing electricity that’s dirty are priced out of mining because It’s too expensive to profit off of.

emsygzx,MumbleWimble,30,"Just so we’re clear:

You can’t roll back a Blockchain.

Its a decentralized network and there are thousands of nodes all over the world that all run the different versions of the code that adheres to the same consensus rules.

What you CAN do is mine a competing chain in hopes of finding more golden nonces faster than the current chain. If you are successful, then the core nodes will abandon the current chain and go eith the chain with the most work on it.

This only works probabilistically, and the probability of successfully reorging the chain follows a Poisson distribution or more generally a Gamma distribution; it is an application of the gambler’s ruin problem. The attacker/reorger has an exponentially diminishing probability of success as the depth of the reorg increases. If the attacker/reorger controls more than 51% of the hash power, then the probability of the rest of the network diminishes faster than the attacker’s.

Did noone read the whitepaper? Its on the last page...

CZ will not roll back the Bitcoin blockchain. At this point it will cost more than 40M to reorg the chain and more importantly: CZ knows he cant roll back the fucking blockchain because he’s not a fucking moron.

Conditions vastly different this time around.  September 2018 BTCD high happened during a sharp decline in prices across the crypto market.  In the days leading up to the 58% BTCD in Sept 2018, global crypto market cap dropped nearly 20% in 48h.

&amp;#x200B;

Today we are seeing a very different trend.  Bitcoin Dominance is increasing while altcoins are flat vs. USD.  This means the crypto global cap in general is rising, almost purely on Bitcoin's gains.  In the past month, Bitcoin price has risen more than 17%, from \~5200 to \~6100 on CMC.  In that same period, the global market cap excluding Bitcoin has dropped nearly 10%, going from $88.5B to $81B.   


What does this mean?  It could be that alts are simply waiting to pop off and catch up with BTC.  This has happened before (look at September 2016 - January 2017).

Remember who these politicians work for and get on Twitter and let them know how you feel. 

Personally, I find this attempt deeply insulting. As someone who was with one of the first units in Afghanistan after 911 and who has devoted years and years to the service of this government and its people, I am disgusted by people like this who so transparently take massive donations from banks and become mouthpieces for US hegemony and petrodollar dominance through bans, rather than meaningful marketplace competition. 

If the US dollar is so strong, then it should be robust enough to participate in a global economy that is bound to be rife with competitive challenges in fintech.... such as Bitcoin. and others. If we, as a people, need to resort to BANs to protect the dollar form these, it is evidence to the *contrary*- that the dollar is weak, not strong. That which warrants bans in favor of it, is by definition- weak. 

I strongly urge politicians and their millenial advisors (like the ones seated behind the Congressman in the video above) to stay true to your Constitutional principles and teach older politicians that in the global internet driven economy, banning only serves to isolate and weaken.. like AOL or Compuserve back in the 90's. Creating walled gardens- islands of stagnant innovation that were doomed to fail because their failed to expose their systems to the world. The dollar is no different. 

You risk turning ordinary, law abiding people like me into driven opposition to a hegemony of governmental bans. Because that is precisely what legislation like this would do.

&amp;#x200B;

The $6,000 barrier was not the big deal I thought it was going to be.  We continued up nicely, topping off this morning with a high of  $6,098.    It is my opinion that our next range of substantial resistance will be around the $6,800 which is where the significant trend reversal happened last fall.  For some of us, crossing that barrier will be the sign of the full recovery from the fall.   

&amp;#x200B;

Since we moved up a box in the direction of the column this morning, we completed the chart for the day and any changes will be noted tomorrow.

Here are the numbers for the day:

We break down tomorrow if it drops under $5,950 without rising over $6,100.

We broke out this morning.  The breakout formation is an ascending triple top break out.  This is a moderately bullish formation.  In this case, the bottoms have been higher and the tops have gone up one or two boxes above the previous high.  This is a formation indicative of accumulation.

The formation is 5 columns wide.  This is below average width for a formation.

The price would have to drop below $5,500 to break down.

On a personal note, this is my “Bitcoin Birthday.”  On May 9, 2013 I bought my first Coinbase coins.  These transactions are documented on my chart for the day.

If one were to just sit back and think about this:  I bought shortly before the Silk Road take down.  When I first heard about bitcoin it was $4.35.  When I first looked into buying it, it was $45.  The lowest price I paid AFTER this was in the high $80s.

The compound rate of return for these coins, bought on 5/9/2013 is 94% per year.

That week I bought 18 bitcoin for a total of  $2,041.  Today, that bitcoin would be worth about $108,000.  Over the next month I bought and sold between 15 and 20 at a time, multiple times.  In that first couple of months I had almost 80 bitcoins with a base price somewhere in the $125 range.

I am a shitty trader.  HODLING that 80 coins would have allowed me to completely retire, a couple of times over.  It would have given me almost half a million dollars today, let alone what it would have done for me at the peak.

There is a lot of fun in trading.  The rush is real.   I am happy being  deep enough to have benefitted greatly over the past several years.  But, if you are scraping dimes thinking you are making money.  Please consider what this is doing to look like in 2-5-10 years.

en0rub5,kmft,55,"
I have many, but I’m going to try to narrow to a Top 5 in the order they occurred:

1.  2008:  I started a construction company and began building my first spec houses in late Q1 2008. The housing crisis tore that to shreds and it took me over a year before I sold everything at a loss and closed down the company.  The mistake was not doing research on the industry before I sunk in a significant portion of my NW.  Instead I followed the housing bubble euphoria with FOMO like a lemming. 

2.  2008:  During the crash I sold all my stocks on the way down cause I was freaking out “this time is IS different.”  Idiot.  I eventually bought back, but the market was already higher than when I sold.  That’s some pretty basic newbie behavior. 

3.  2013:  I started two web based companies at the same time that were totally unrelated in two different industries and stretched my resources very thin just because I couldn’t decide which would be the successful company, and was afraid to choose.  I had very little help and not enough finances in hindsight, and was doing most of the work myself. Happy ending in this one, as one of the companies gained traction and took off like a rocket ship a few months later. Results were great from this, but don’t be results oriented, the decision was still a poor one.  I also completely abandoned the other project and was too busy to even attempt to liquidate it for cash.  I don’t even know where the code for it is now. 

4. 2016:  I started a software project 3 years ago and spent nearly $1M on it.  Runaway costs and a inadequate team forced me into a difficult situation, and I decided to scrap the project entirely.  The unfinished project turned no profit and has no resale value as far as I can tell (haven’t tried). I’ve just mothballed it with low probability that I’ll return to it.

5.  2016:  I started a new company for the sole purpose of being a hedge against regulation in my current industry, mostly a fear driven decision. Still unsure is this was a bad choice  though, regardless of the emotion that drove it. My team was stretched thin doing so, and I just threw money at problems. Okay, that was a bad choice. Regulation never became a doomsday scenario fortunately, and I pulled the plug on the company in its first money of operations, never giving it a chance because I was stretched too thin to give it attention. 

Wait...one more bonus one for your enjoyment... 
6.  2018:  I bought some Bitcoin in early 2018 for $250K and sold it mid 2018 for half what I bought it for.  Every step of this process was bush league decision making that I’m embarrassed to admit I was a part of. 

Despite all this foolishness and many more I didn’t list — I invested 25% of my 2012 NW in manufactured hardware that I literally knew nothing about but was easily talked into, ending up selling it at a 50% haircut over the next year...forgot to list that little gem!  Still my NW has grown considerably over the years.  Perhaps it’s a testament to the benefits of having a high appetite for risk. 

Net worth timeline below:

$10 - 1995  
$100 - 1995  
$1,000 - 2002  
$10,000 - 2005  
$100,000 - 2006  
$1,000,000 - 2014  
$10,000,000 - 2019

The chances of another global food price crisis are high though not guaranteed. if it happens, Localized die-offs will occur in low income food import dependent countries, some more governments will be overthrown in an african spring, it won't make a difference because they have no bargaining power on the world markets. 

The next recession *or the following one* will be the BIG ONE where the economy starts sliding down the cliff, nothing will work to fix it, it will get away from us, out of our hands. catabolic. 

**Things will mostly be the same, the grind will be harder, the opportunities harder to get.** People will continue to muddle in quiet desperation, many more will kill themselves from immiseration.

People will find out collapse just looks like everyday life but with a sprinkling of newsworthy events here or there, slow grind, no line in the sand that spurs people to act or to try to understand. just hand to mouth. 2030

I really think the entire community is grossly underestimating how big a pain in the ass the government can be if they come down hard on cryptocurrency. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine if every single crypto exchange was made illegal overnight (this has happened before with online poker payment processors becoming illegal overnight).  Next imagine that local bitcoins and bisq became massive honeypots where people started getting busted by undercover cops constantly and getting thrown in jail for money laundering.  Next imagine any merchant that accepts bitcoins will be threatened with legal action and a few would even get raided in the middle of the day for accepting bitcoin (this happened with landlords that were leasing properties to cannabis dispensaries before they became legal).  

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think the state of bitcoin would be in this scenario?  Ledger/Trezor won't be able to ship wallets into America without getting seized by customs at the border.  Apple and Google won't allow bitcoin apps in the app store for Americans so you'd have to Jailbreak for mobile, or run your own full node that you'd have to install yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Literally no one will go through that much trouble in the U.S. Everything I listed above has happened in one shape of form to other things the government has decided to set their targets on (drugs, online gambling, prostitution, etc) and taking down the handful of services that are crypto/fiat onramps and offramps would be TRIVIALLY easy for the government to do if they wanted to.  I can list all of the places you can exchange bitcoin for dollars on two hands.  Maybe even one hand.  Of course bitcoin will survive internationally in the more free countries, but for all of us here we'll just be blacked out.   


I think we need to seriously stop taunting regulators and constantly poking the bear when we are so vulnerable. It would be better to keep pretending like we aren't a threat, slowly get mass adoption until we are everywhere like Uber and AirBnB and we have the support of the masses to vote people out of office that try to come down too hard.",2019-05-10 06:42:46

en1zr0c,meostro,95,"What you're proposing sounds like IPFS.

It has the same concept of ""pinning"" files, where you say that you want to keep a file available on the IPFS network, and as long as someone has that file pinned it's accessible by anyone. It can change hands `N` different times, where A pins, B pins and A unpins, C pins and B unpins, etc. and it will always be accessible.

Some comments on your structure:

Don't use bits, just bytes. Don't save ""half a byte"" and make it a pain in the ass to work with, give every field at least one byte. If you're going with bit fields, pack them into a byte and use that as a flag byte.

4.5TB as a limit _today_ is dumb. There isn't a single-file that I've seen that big, but there are a few torrents that size and if you're building something new you should expect bigger stuff in the future. Go with 64 bits, that's 8 or 16 exabytes and a limit you won't see for at least 20 years.

Client-server is going to be a bottleneck for any system of the scale you're talking about. It will work for a long while even if it's centralized on the /u/soul-trader server, but if adoption gets to the same scale as any of the other P2P systems then it's gonna get weird. You could have ""federation"" of a sort, where you have multiple tiers or shared data pooling between separate instances, but something more like DHT will work better long-term.

Don't hash zips/archives directly, or at least give the option to hash the stuff inside them as well. That will help you avoid the ""someone adds NFO"" invalidating your content, and will help you dedup when someone takes all 30 RAR files and packages them as a single uncompressed / recompressed torrent. Same goes for content archives, if 50 different 4chan dumps have the same file you'd be better off indexing and storing it once. It would also solve a problem I encounter regularly, where I will repackage content with `advdef` or `zopfli` to get better compression for identical source bits.

Limit per IP and would be rough. Figuring out a web-of-trust would be a better plan, and your blockchain is one of the only useful applications of that kind of technology! Same idea as bitcoin or GPG, I sign that I have / own / publish something and some other people vouch that they got matching content from me. Thinking a bit, that could be the solution for a lot of what you're talking about - make a chain that says when someone hosts or stops hosting a thing (tied to your content hashing scheme) and you can chain everything from there. If I try to fetch from `$source` and it doesn't have the thing I want I would publish a message to that effect, and eventually my `$source doesn't have content XYZ` would override the original `$source is hosting XYZ` when enough other entities confirm that fact.

Let me know if you go forward with this, I have a bunch of random stuff archived and would like to see how this kind of system would handle it. I also have some extreme weird-cases (edge cases of edge cases) that I would be curious if this approach would work.",2019-05-11 06:04:05

en0vvy9,Merlin560,72,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

We rose high into the $6,300s last night, pushing us into a “High pole warning” situation.  The high pole occurs when the price rises four boxes above a breakout.  It is a point where, traditionally, the momentum slows and the direction can turn down in short order.  Again, traditionally, this retrace is usually about 50% of the length of the column of Xs. 

In our case, this would show a decline down to about $6,000.  Keep in mind this is not a “reversal” in a truce sense, but rather it is a pause, a re-trace, and then it resumes its course upwards.  You’ve heard me refer to Crazy Ivans (from the Tom Clancy book “Hunt for Red October).  This is a typical Crazy Ivan situation.  When it happens watch the “Warning Target” (the HPW in Orange).  If the price continues below that point, it might not be a re-tracement—but moving towards a reversal—usually associated with some news.  It is a good heads up.  You can maintain your long until it is pretty clear you are headed down.  And you will know when it hits the overall breakdown point, so there is a chance to get out before the herd.

So, here are the numbers for today:

&amp;#x200B;

* We added boxes up to $6300 this morning, so there will be no other changes today.
* We remain in an ascending triple top breakout, but we reached the High Pole Warning.  The target for a retracement is the $6,000 box.
* A negative breakdown occurs with a price under $5,650.
* The formation is still five columns wide—slightly below average.
* The trend is positive and would reverse with a price under $5,350.  We are currently 21 boxes above the trends line.  This is not as high above the line as I would feel “comfortable” resting on.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been doing some reading on the Fidelity and Etrade proposals.  While I’ve expressed some skepticism about how good this is, one of the things that I see is that they are looking for third parties to hold their coins.  My guess is that the “if it is not in your hands its not yours” meme is going to make a significant re-appearance.  We all know that private key wallets are critical.  But do the people coming into E Trade know that?  I would think there would be a run on Trezors and other private key secure devices.  If you can find money to invest in the private key holders, there is some upside there.

&amp;#x200B;

My final aside today is that I had dinner with a close friend who works as an institutional investor for large private trusts (""$20 Million min"" type of family trusts.)  We were talking about bitcoin and crypto.  He is a novice at this stuff because most of the money he manages has ivy growing on it—he just never took the time to learn.  He told me that one of his investor buddies works for a well known, very large institutional bank.  EVERY person in their division were to go out and open bitcoin trading accounts and learn how this stuff works.

His feeling was that large trusts and investment accounts of Gen X’ers and younger millionaires are expressing much more interest and demand for cryptos.  Lots of Boomers inherited tons of money from their parents.  That which is not going to assisted living and nursing homes (and Lambos) might find its way into a portfolio that includes crypto in the same proportion as bullion.

Again, WE all know this.  However, this guy is steeped In “old money, institutional” finance.  If he is starting to feeling it, the trend can only be bullish.  These guys do not take “flyers” on the latest fad.

Just something to think about.

Happy Mother’s day to all of the mom’s out there.  My mom doesn’t recognize me any more, but she still likes flowers and chocolates.   (My mother in law is across the hall from her in the skilled nursing facility…97 and still with it.    She will sneak over and help her eat the candy.)

Also Bcash (which runs Purse) is sorely in need of catching up in performance even as it's being updated last-minute for May consensus.

Whether these software and services are improved, replaced or obsoleted, something needs to be done.

enc0gys,roarkish,88,"Living in Korea, the banks are some of the WORST institutions in the country, by far. If you want to see an exercise in inefficiency, visit a Korean bank. 

They pretty much try to close as often as possible and do as little work as possible, so they use the test as an excuse to do so. 

They open from 8:30 to 4:30, normally, and aren't open on weekends, so if you're having some sort of emergency or really need to get to the bank, you're fucked if your boss doesn't let you go take care of business.

They make it really hard to open an account, even for Koreans, because they are afraid of bitcoin and hackers, and for foreigners it's especially hard these days.

There's not really such a thing as a 'savings account' at the banks.

If you want to shop online you MUST have these useless certificates on your phone and/or PC to be able to complete the checkout process and there is no online banking without this certificate. 

When you transfer money, you have to look at a card with a bunch of random numbers on it and it will ask you for certain rows of numbers; it's like using a calculator to access my bank account.

During maintenance time, they will literally prevent you from accessing your money and will tell you this by posting it on regular ass paper on the windows of the bank. 

If you need to use your card or withdraw money during this period, you can't. 

Korea is so back assward when it comes to things like that. Fastest internet in the world, supremely advanced technology, but bureaucracy and whiny institutions wanting to make maximum ~~dollar~~ won prevent any sort of sense from being made.",2019-05-13 23:43:33

Let government manage two levers of economics via fiscal policy (government spending and taxes), and let an independent central bank manage monetary policy (money supply).

Having no central bank, or having government involved in the central bank could incentivize politicians to currency manipulation which could lead to hyperinflation from an overheating economy, or a huge deflationary crunch, or maybe a bit of both if you want to nationalize vast parts of your economy.

On the flip side.. China doesn't have an independent central bank.. but.. their currency doesn't run the world, and as a communist state - their people are used to nationalized parts of their economy.. so they're already at a different point that the U.S. doesn't want to get to.

With all that said, going back to the gold standard, silver standard, etc. would allow for governments or the hyper-rich to manipulate commodity markets; for example think of how Russia used supercomputers to mine bitcoin, or how Saudi Arabia can basically control the world's oil supply.. and those were just the two laziest examples I could think off the top of my head.",2019-05-13 05:57:23

As far as I understand Bitcoin it has the following downsides:

- It is slow to transfer from one account to another compared to basically every other payment method
- It is a pain in the ass to set up a Bitcoin account or to safely store them offline. 
- Exchanges have high fees
- Fraud has been a huge problem from the very beginning, with many people losing a lot of money through theft and hacking
- It is not really a currency because most people who have Bitcoin sit on them instead of using them to buy things. Even if they were to spend it, credit cards or even PayPal is a much better option
- It is not a good store of value because it's worth has been subject to bubbles that have been growing and popping more than once over the last few years
- And again the worst one: It eats up a huge amount of energy in a time where humanity needs to eliminate unnecessary energy consumption to prevent catastrophic climate change.
- Also as far as I have been told, even if there was a need for a cryptocurrency because fiat money is bad, there are other technical options to build a network that might not need as much energy

The upsides are:

- It maybe helped a few people in Venezuela to safe some of their savings before the currency completely deflated
- It might do interesting things in the future, maybe.

enei8lt,SloppySynapses,76,"In 2015, the lowest price of the year on bitstamp was $152.40 on January 13th, 2015. 

After forming a flat base at ~$220, it rallied from $220 to $500 from September 13, 2015 to November 3rd, 2015 with a parabolic blow off top. (51 days)

The last 4 days were the majority of % gains: It went from $303 to $500 on those last 4 days. 

A week later, the price retraced violently and dumped to ~$294 but never went below $300 again after that day.

In 2018, the lowest price on stamp was $3122. 

After forming a flat resistance area at ~$4200, btc rallied from $4200 to $8190 from April 1st, 2019 to May 13th, 2019. 

51 days after 4/1/2019 is 5/22/2019. It has been 42 days so far.

If you multiply every price in 2015 by 20, you would get:

$3048 bottom, $4400 flat base, $6060 to $10000 in 9 more days (assuming the whole rally takes 51 days exactly) with a return to $5880 over the course of a week after hitting $10k. The price, after that, if it were following 2015, should never go below $6k again. 

It's amazing how consistently things are repeating themselves! 

Seriously, at this point, it's clear someone's either pulling the strings on the show or bitcoin is simply so free from anything but pure human emotion that it repeats its own cycles very, very consistently 😅

https://tradingview.com/x/QTPEIxFW

https://tradingview.com/x/a5qPzn3D

For anyone trying to long this: the parabola never dumped more than 10% the entire way up. a 10x long (maybe 9x to account for maintenance fees) until the top in 2015 was never liquidated at any single price point. The first 10x long to not work would have been liquidated at $450 if you had longed $500 exactly.

For anyone trying to short this: perhaps begin looking for shorts once the price actually retraces more than, say, 10%  and stays there? $7580/$6750 was 12.2%. Maybe a confluence of 10% + support nearby. So a breakdown of $6700 would've signaled to short.. Note that I made this play, personally and had stops there for longs exactly at $6720 (we got down to $6750). I'm amazed and honestly feel extremely lucky that they did not hit.

The term “Virtual Currency” is defined in the Payment Services Act as:

(i)   proprietary value that may be used to pay an unspecified person the price of any goods purchased or borrowed or any services provided and which may be sold to or purchased  from  an  unspecified  person  (limited  to  that  recorded  on  electronic  devices  or  other  objects by electronic means and excluding Japanese and other foreign currencies and Currency Denominated Assets; the same applies in the following item) and that may be transferred using an electronic data processing system; or

(ii)   proprietary  value  that  may  be  exchanged  reciprocally  for  proprietary  value  specified in the preceding item with an unspecified person and that may be transferred using an electronic data processing system. **Though  the  definition  is  complicated,  in  short,  a  cryptocurrency  which  is  usable  as  a  payment method to an unspecified person and not denominated in fiat currencies falls under Virtual  Currency.**    For  example,  Bitcoin,  Litecoin,  Dogecoin,  Ether  and  **XRP**  fall  under  Virtual Currencies.",2019-05-14 01:48:20

From a lone address, over half a million transactions were made in a relatively short time, that much was clear. Theories flew around the ecosystem about their cause and meaning, none of them particularly sober.

I'm not interested in Bitcoin. I agree completely. Leah says Tyler mined in 2011 and got Gox'd. Tyler says he's never owned bitcoin only GBTC. How does this chart work Leah? I agree completely.

Tyler says hyperwave has never been wrong at Unconfiscatable. I'm 100% sure. I'm 99.99% sure. I'm 99% sure. I'm 80% sure. I missed the bottom and bought the top.

I beeleeve it's going to ten meelion even though I dont understand it but it has to touch won thouzan! This will be my redemption.

I miss the bottom and buy the top and call my hypothesis a theory because all these coursecucks don't know the difference and neither do I! I'm not interested! I agree completely!

A tumbleweed rolls down the ghost town of Hyperrekt Clientville.

The monkey was sitting on this wad of asshole like a cushion while he was chilling on a tree. In my mind I was thinking that the mound of tissue would be extremely sensitive and prone to scarring and infection from sitting on the rugged surface of the tree bark. But then it hit me - this tissue is acclimated, adjusted and toughened against nature. 

This is the spirit of Bitcoin. I would say right now Bitcoin would behave in a similar fashion - it's able to withstand the cruel surface of the tree bark (dips, selling, etc), because it has become resiliently strengthened like the monkeys asshole (hodling, adoption, etc). 

This is truly an exciting time for bitcoin, if we can push through to 10k+, I would say bitcoin can transform and rise from that of the monkeys asshole, to say, a monkeys paw - which is good for many wishes! (10x, 20x, etc.)",2019-05-15 11:35:06

I really liked the way he started talking about money as a belief system. I thought he could have taken it further by tying it into the comments made about gold being a trusted money.

""Money is a belief system, two people believe something has value and to use it as money to trade with each other. Throughout time people have believed in everything from gold, to seashells, as money. In modern times people mostly use government issued paper money. Most of these belief systems have died over time,  but others like gold are still widely used and highly valuable today. It's not a matter of luck we dont use seashells or weimar republic notes anymore but still use gold. It's the properties of limited supply and durability that allows something like gold to retain value over thousands of years. Bitcoin was designed as a digital equivalent to gold, both in its durability and limited supply. Its network is designed and deployed from the ground up to be antifragile. To be extremely resilient to attempts to harm it, and actually become stronger due to those attempts. Bitcoin is an apolitical money,  its digital gold that can be transferred anywhere in the world without relying on governments or other 3rd parties.""

But when Bitcoin was $200 and I was pushing them to buy just one, they of course dismissed it.

Bitcoin goes to $1000, and I better ""sell it all because it's gonna crash"".

Bitcoin goes to $5000, and I ""don't know what I'm talking about, Buffet would have bought it if it was valuable (see a previous post of mine that addresses this)"" and lots of anger towards me for having unrealistic gains.

Bitcoin goes to $10000 and all of a sudden they need to know if it will be worth more in the future or not. I have no idea dude, but I made my bets and you should consider if you want to take the bet too. Of course I get a strict ""no, I won't invest unless I know it's going up in value"".

Bitcoin hits $15000 and now ""I should just invest a shit ton of money into Bitcoin because I'm sick and tired of everyone else getting rich"". I suggest they hold back and wait, but then it hits $17000 and they now think I cost them ""a fortune"", and they buy into it.

Bitcoin hits $19000 and they're ontop of the world. They finally started winning! They're the best investors ever and Bitcoin will rule the world! I was sooooooo wrong for having doubts at $15000.

Bitcoin tanks. They hated me for a few weeks, saying that I cost them their savings, even though the last few texts we shared was me telling them to NOT invest recklessly. I think their rationale was ""how dare he make money and I not. I do everything by the book and he can't possibly come out ahead by deviating from what you should be doing"".

Bitcoin TANKS hard to like $3600 and I get apologies from some, and others have not yet spoken to me. I imagine they all sold because they can't stand to lose... ever.

And now only after it goes up in value to like $7500 do they ask me if it's a good time to buy. I was hinting at buying it from $4000 to $5000 but in small bits and pieces to dollar cost average. Nope. They wanted to be the wolf of wall street.

enhjmdq,cbus20122,52,"Capital flight.

Seriously, people like to see Bitcoin as an instrument that is speculating on future currency, but that's not what drives Bitcoin for the most part (in my opinion). Chinese engage in capital flight of all varieties. They buy exorbitant amounts of real estate abroad, such as the [Vancouver real estate market money laundering operation](https://vancouversun.com/business/local-business/millions-in-real-estate-linked-to-b-c-money-laundering-investigations-is-owned-by-nominees), they buy commodities such as Gold or [Diamonds](https://www.ccn.com/did-chinas-wealthy-elite-secretly-move-capital-offshore-via-hong-kongs-gemstones) to move offshore. 

Beijing has been in a campaign to limit bank account deposits abroad for years, but is cracking down more and more as there is greater and greater pressure on their currency. Recently, they've been l[imiting foreign currency withdrawal limits](https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3008795/chinese-banks-quietly-lower-daily-limit-foreign-currency). Their social credit system is likely also part of their efforts to ban capital flight. For example, [they have banned 23 million from traveling abroad](http://fortune.com/2019/02/22/china-social-credit-travel-ban/) through this system, which is relevant since foreign travel is one of the biggest ways that money flees their borders. 

This is all relevant since [China's current account is potentially going to flip negative this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/china-economy-morgan-stanley-predicts-chinas-account-deficit-in-2019.html), and China has a ton of dollar obligations, meaning they need to keep their currency propped up as much as possible, which is why they're fighting against capital flight at all costs. 

**So what does this all have to do with bitcoin?**

It's pretty simple, Bitcoin = a perfect mechanism for allowing capital to flee borders. It's always basically been a money laundering mechanism, obviously allowing illegal entities to carry out transactions (IE, drug dealers) with anonymity. China cracked down a lot on their bitcoin exchanges in late 2017 at the peak of the bitcoin bubble, but there is likely re-invigorating capital flight going on right now, and preventing money from leaving via cryptocurrency is not easy to enforce or regulate. 

For some perspective, [here is a good overview on how bitcoin is linked to China's currency problems and capital flight.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrich/2018/12/20/pro-perspectives-bitcoin-was-all-about-chinese-money-flight/#37c7d6503861)",2019-05-15 01:51:49

enody0f,deadalnix,126,"Hi,

First, thank you. This is a very accurate description of the problem.

I would like to take this opportunity to address a larger point. Something I have been hinting at for quite some time, but this is a very good and explicit example of it, so hopefully it'll make thing more palpable.

In software there is this thing called technical debt. This is when some part of the software is more complex than it needs to be to function properly. This is an idea I've expressed many time before. You might want to read this thread to understand it a bit more: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bo0tug/great_systems_get_better_by_becoming_simpler/
. Technical debt behave very much like financial debt. As long as it is there, you will pay interest - by having extra bugs, by making the codebase more difficult to change, etc... - until you finally pay it all back by simplifying the code.

In the specific case of this bug, the code did have to determine if the number of sigops needs to take OP_CDS into account or not. This is a complexity that is not necessary now that OP_CDS has been activated for a long time and the code should simply be ALWAYS checking for it. While we did not know the bug existed - or we would have fixed it - we knew that this complexity existed and should be removed. We knew that there were technical debt here. Paying back that debt changes the code is such a way that this bug is not possible, structurally. The node cannot make the wrong choice when the node doesn't make a choice at all.

This is what managing technical debt is about. Not fixing bugs that you know exist, but changing the structure of the software in such a way that entire classes of bugs are not possible altogether.

So, it raises the question, why didn't we pay that debt back? The reason is simple, we've spent almost all of our time and resources over the past few month paying back debt. For instance we paid a lot of debt back on the front of concurrency - and this lead to the discovery of two issues within Bitcoin Core that we reported to them. This concurrency work is a prerequisite if we want to scale. It is also very important to avoid classes of bugs related to concurrency, such as deadlock or race conditions.

We could have well decided to pay back debt on the OP_CDS front but, in this alternate history, we may well be talking today about the race condition someone exploited in ABC rather than a sigops accounting error when building a block template.

We are very focused on keeping technical debt under control. But the reality is, we don't have enough hands on deck to do so. The reality is that this is an existential threat to BCH. The multiple implementation moto is of no help on that front. For instance the technical debt in BU to be even higher than in ABC (in fact I raised flags about this years ago, and this lead to numerous 0-days).

I hope it is now clearer why, while I super exited about graphene, increased parallelism in the transaction processing and other great idea the cool kids are having, this is not the highest priority. The highest priority for me is to keep the technical debt under control. Because the more other cool shit we build, and you can trust that I want this other cool shit to be built, the less resource we spend on paying back tech debt, and the more the kind of events we saw today will happen. I'm not looking forward to that being the case. This goes double for ideas that aren't that great to begin with, such as running ""stress tests"" on mainnet.",2019-05-16 07:08:18

Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world.

In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users.

But the attacker didn't do that -- and had no signature requirement in their redeem script.

This may be because the nature of the garbage script they used to trigger the Bitcoin ABC bug didn't allow for a signature check

So I was able to redeem the coins by figuring out how they generated their garbage scriptsig -- it was a bunch of nonsense with the code 'bababababa' thrown inside (probably as part of the joke, ha!). Also 0xba is OP_CHECKDATASIG.

We’ve had a reversal. 

And the “masses” are freaking out.  Stop it.  Just stop it.  

 I don’t usually reference myself, but just the other day I wrote:

*“Obviously the high pole warning is still in effect, and that drop would be 26 boxes down to $7,000.  So start getting your mind wrapped around that.  High pole warnings are fun on the way up, and they are the steepest roller coaster on the way down.”*

I am not suggesting that I am the Bitcoin Wizard who can predict the future.  But I can read a chart.  And as an old guy, I understand that nothing goes on forever,.  

It is critical for people looking to “trade” to understand how this stuff works.  So, I posted the chart today, but pulled back on the zoom so that you can see the entire column.  The decline yesterday was just one box above where today’s pullback went.

In real terms this is almost nothing.  I guess is you were trading at 50X, it might hurt, but if you are a holder since Sunday you are still up about $700.  Yikes, what a nightmare this is.

Here are the numbers:

* We hit a low last night of $7,750.  This reversed into a column of Os.
* It would reverse to column of Xs if the price reversed up to $7,900.
* A breakout would happen above $8,350.
* A breakdown would happen if the price dropped under $5,650.
* We are 50 something boxes above the trend.  I think we are safe for today.

So, in summary:  Relax.  This was expected.  Until the price drops to $7,000 or lower it remains “expected.”

If you are HODLing, go outside and breathe some fresh air.  Today is not for you; maybe this afternoon will be.  

Anyway, in the end its probably pennies on the dollar after taxes.

If you are short, or trading this on the way down, have fun.

enwtag5,discoversound,43,"There is a lot of slang in his statement that applies to a very specific subject.

In lay men's terms:

A man with lots of Bitcoin made a website where you can guess the price of Bitcoin in the future and wager money on it. This website also allows you to wager up to 100x the money deposited on the platform towards your bet. This would mean that if you bet right, you would earn 100x what you would earn from that bet normally. However, at 100x, if your bet is wrong by even 1% in the other price direction, even for just a millisecond, you get cashed out to zero, also known as liquidated.

This post is stating that when people get liquidated on this site by % blips in price that appear to just cancel out everyone's bet, they feel as though this could be the work of the man with lots of Bitcoin who opened the website, since he can see all of the orders and would be able to execute something of that nature.

When I made the decision to invest in bitcoin, it was for a long-term investment.

I feel bitcoin is going to rise in price significantly in the next 5-10 years. I also feel that it is a good store of value at the price I paid for my bitcoin. I have faith in the bitcoin network and I see bitcoin as the gold standard among cryotocurrency.

I was around during the early days of the internet. Connecting to local bulletin boards (or pay long distance to connect to exotic far away boards) via dial up 2400k modem. I had a free unlimited America Online account for being a Beta tester and remember telling older family members that websites would replace 1-800 numbers on the bottom of the  screen at the end of commercials and the general response I got was ""Oh, that's just for computer nerds"" and widespread adoption would never happen.

I was extremely young at the time and felt that the internet was going to change how we live life on a daily basis.

And look where we are now. Billions of people are connected via the internet with computers in their pocket 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

enx4ads,VictorCobra,32,"I'm glad we're finally seeing a retrace. What will be really interesting is where this dump stops. We're currently either following something like the yellow or the pink scenarios in this [speculative chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ozRo49eJ-What-s-Up-Bitcoin/). If we're to follow the pink ($10K+ prices), as I mentioned on here recently, I think Bitcoin needs to close this current [weekly candle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0FZdOTU2/) above that light blue channel resistance. I'd expect some volatility, as big bulls will want to keep prices above 6.9/7K and bears will want to break it down. The support currently lies in the 6700-6800 area though, so we could see some continued downwards movement today. I think that's the true zone of control for bulls. 

That giant wick down to 6100 actually has us at a 27-30% retrace from the peak, which is in line with previous bull market corrections. If we fail to hold above that channel resistance however, we could follow something like the yellow scenario, and head down to the parallel channel below (our current ascending support). This would mean 5K prices or lower. I think this is a bigger moment for the market than many people realize. Another thing to note is that many alts have remained relatively stable on their ratios. I guess that's because they were so oversold to begin with. 

 [Here's that Bitstamp chart zoomed out](https://www.tradingview.com/x/L4vPBjEW/), with the parallel channels, as well as three separate projections, including a potential double bubble scenario illustrated for fun (if things continue to look ridiculously bullish). That has a target above $50K by the end of this year  =0  

Interestingly, the [BLX chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/c8fD6IJk/) shows that we're NOT back into any sort of long term bullish channel, and we may instead follow something like the yellow or green, which I actually outlined back in March. That seems more realistic and sustainable to me. [BLX chart zoomed out.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/g47d9rJ3/) No one knows where we're headed, but things have been way more bullish than I've been expecting recently.

The reverse to a column of Xs was confirmed yesterday.  Overnight we ran up to $8,155.   Of course the volume was not nearly as high as the recent movements.  This is actually good.  I see it as a sign of steady accumulation.  

If we turn down at at point today, I would suggest a bottom in the $6,650 range—which would be the start of another “flag” or “Pennant.”   That formation is reminiscent of the formations that we saw ith props to Johnny Most and the ’86 Celtics.)

I doubt we see the “Big Crash” back to the $3,000s at this point.  

Here are the numbers for the day:

* We are in a column of Xs with a recent top  in the $8,150 box.
* We break out with a price of $8,350.  At that point the targets are so diverse it is impossible to suggest the size of the movement.  
* We break down with any price under the $6,600 box.
* The current formation is 3 boxes wide.
* The trend is positive and will change at a price under $5,400.

eo49ny6,jotakami,35,"I want to use this opportunity to invite anyone who gets queasy about unrealized losses on naked longs and shorts to join me in trading the implied interest rate from swaps. What is that, you say? Well, if you **long** the perpetual and **short** the futures (or vice versa), you have a net neutral position and will not make any profit or loss from price movements. Your PnL is instead determined by (1) the price differential between the two instruments which is fixed at the time you open the trade, and (2) the funding on the perpetual which varies over the time you hold the position.

The ""implied interest rate"" from a futures contract is also called the basis rate, and is equal to the price premium/discount divided by the number of years remaining on the contract (for an annualized rate). For example, on BitMEX you can check out the current basis rate (""Fair Basis Rate"") by looking at the details for the instrument on the *Contract* tab.

When trading swaps, you are betting that (a) the profit you capture from the basis will be greater than the funding you pay over the course of the position, or (b) the loss from the basis will be less than the funding you receive, or (c) you both gain from the basis and receive funding payments at the same time. Option (c) should be your goal, so that even if you're wrong you might end up in (a) or (b) instead.

A few observations:

1. Volume and open interest is greatest in the perpetual, so market sentiment is most clearly reflected here: bullish markets create a premium and positive funding; bearish markets the opposite
2. Positive funding on perpetuals causes traders to long futures instead, resulting in a positive futures basis (futures trade above spot/perpetual, also known as contango)
3. Negative funding results in the opposite effect: a negative futures basis (also known as backwardation)
4. Liquidations and stops triggered by price jumps typically amplify the move, resulting in a price premium/discount that in turn causes a large positive/negative funding rate in the immediate aftermath
5. Unusually large funding rates for a single period lead to large changes in the futures basis over that period, often larger than the actual funding payment itself

After watching the behavior of these instruments for over a year now, it's quite clear than in many circumstances the funding rate leads the futures basis. This has played out beautifully over the past week, as the heightened volatility and huge price swings change sentiment overnight. The futures basis has swung from negative to positive and back multiple times, and in most cases the funding rate leads these changes so a well-timed trade can capture both the change in basis and the funding payments that are causing the change.

The price pump starting at 01:00 UTC last night was a textbook example. After the dump from $8k, the bearishness from a few months ago was creeping back in and the basis was around -$30. Then the pump started, and by the time we reached $8k again the perpetual was well above spot and clearly poised for a fat funding rate during the next period. However, the June futures were still sitting at $25 below the perpetual. Fast forward nine hours, and now the futures are trading $30-35 above and rising as the funding remains above 0.03%.

So why get excited about a measly $60 gain? Well, a few reasons...

1. No exposure to price movements! You do not lose your shirt just because bitcoin dropped (or popped) 15% overnight. I do not have a trader's psychology--I get stupid when I start losing money--so this is a much safer way to trade.
2. You can ratchet up the leverage to amplify the gains with less fear of liquidation. Yes, you still might get liquidated if you don't have portfolio margin, but you'll always have an offsetting position which can be closed at the same time to keep you neutral. Sometimes you even make a little extra profit from the liquidation because your offsetting position keeps riding the wave ;-)
3. The most important reason: **Predicting movements in the implied interest rate is much, much easier than predicting where the price is going.** Sometimes the movements are virtually guaranteed, so you can open your trade with full confidence that you will make your profit and exit quickly.",2019-05-19 22:29:29

I'm sure everybody at pets.com thought that the Foosball and free lunch and a better job offer every other week couldn't end either.  Ditto with the mortgage brokers a decade ago, or the house flippers.

There is a reason that we talk about survivorship bias.  At any time there will always be some strategy that worked well for the last 5-10 years.  The trick is figuring out what will work well for the next 5-10 years, and there is a pretty good chance that it won't be the thing that was most optimal during the last decade.

If you do something that worked for the last 200 years you might not be spending your Bitcoin earnings on a Model S, but you probably also won't be the one without a chair when the music stops playing.

Many of my Japanese colleagues have laptops that are five to ten years old--and so long as they can fill out a spreadsheet or send and receive e-mail, they seem to meet their needs. There isn't the urgency to have the latest model that one sees when it comes to the smartphone market. The lower demand softens the market, meaning prices stay relatively high.

Domestically produced computers tend to be more expensive due to the cost of Japanese labor; and likely there are tariffs on imports in order to protect these manufacturers--this is true for the automotive industry and other manufacturing industries, so I'm guessing it applies to companies like NEC, National and Sony that produce domestic electronics. Meaning, Japanese will likely pay a premium for a Japanese made, or assembled laptop, or end up paying a similar amount due to a tariff on one built overseas. 

The third option is that you just don't know where to find the deals. I built a PC in Japan a few years ago and was surprised that some of the components were much more expensive than in the states, where others were actually lower in cost--notably the GPU. This was of course after the cost of GPUs sky-rocketed in the States due to Bitcoin mining. Because there wasn't the same demand in Japan (it costs more to bitcoin mine here because of energy prices), Japanese domestically made GPUs were selling for half of the price of the same GPUs in the States and Canada.

eo8788k,Merlin560,34,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

We matched the top box yesterday by crossing the $8,300 line.  But we did not cross the break out point at $8,350.  So, we have a double top formed.  Unlike traditional charting, a double top is not necessarily a bad thing.

As I wrote the other day, the “old” formations of 2017 followed a pattern of a sudden rise, then the formation of a consolidating flag over a few days, and then a breakout—usually to the upside.  This appears to be following that pattern.

We have a significant amount we can fall (down to $6,600) before I would be “concerned.”   My guess is we bounce around between $7,500 and $8,300 for a couple of days—unless there is another whale out there taking a shit.

Here are the numbers:

* We reversed into a tentative column of Os.  This will be confirmed if we do not revert up above $8,350 for the day.
* The column would reverse tomorrow with a price over $7,750.
* A positive breakout occurs at $8,350.  If that happens today it would be a double top.  If it happens tomorrow it would be a triple top break out—which is very positive.
* A negative breakdown occurs with a price before $6,600.
* The trend is positive and it would change at $5,400—so we are pretty safe in normal conditions.
* Currently we are 44 boxes above the trend.

So expect a trading range and I would not expect anything dramatic either day.  But its bitcoin, so be prepared for the Whale Sale or some insane buying spree.

&amp;#x200B;

*PS:  Sorry for the nationalist screed yesterday.  The world is full of people and 99% of them are decent folk.  I count myself among them; and I count most everyone here that way as well.  I figure we could sit down and find ourselves in agreement on most things, almost all of the time.  That is the best we can all do.  I apologize if I offended.*

3 mostly takes advantage of 2, which causes the wild volatility, and also takes advantage of 1 to a lesser extent since more of them are hodlers.

And when you're FIREd capital gains is most of what you care about, since most of your dividends are probably QDI, too.

As I wrote yesterday it appears as though we are creating a nice flag within a range from $7,600 to $8,300.  This type of consolidation used to go on for a week or so in the olden days.  Then it would move quickly, one way or the other.

If we move out of either of those range points, it would be a good entry point (entry for what depends on the direction.) 

In these times we rarely match the previous high, but the lows are higher.  Thus, it appears as a pennant or flag on a pole.  The resolution of the High Pole warning at this point is probably not going to happen.

The next few days should be interesting.  Keep in mind, any move outside of the range is going to be fast.  Keep an eye on the volume.

eoa4mth,exab,41,"Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin.

What was Bcash when it was created?

In a nutshell,

1. Bcash was basically a one-man's coin, although he had quite a few influential allies.

2. This man was Jihan Wu. He was CEO and co-founder of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produced more miners than every other competitor and potential all of them combined in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gave their mining farms (but not their customers!) advantages in mining, which resulted in their monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost was unintentionally disabled by SegWit, an update that fixed some critical development-stalling issues in Bitcoin but got intensively attacked and blocked from activation for a long time.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash was basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miners in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controled a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, there was solid evidence of Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed, and both were acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who was behind Bcash and what he had done / what kind of person he was, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attacked SegWit?

Bcash had few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. On the other hand, Bitcoin had more than 400 developers, of which some were well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which was better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). 

Contrary to some misinformation, Bcash did not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It was an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.

It's important to note that, besides Jihan/Bitmain, there were another group of people who joined against SegWit. They are Bitcoin haters - mainly altcoiners, especially Ethereum stakeholders, who see Bitcoin as the biggest obstacle, but may including bankers and people in remittance industry whose businesses are threatened by Bitcoin. They don't like Bitcoin to succeed and SegWit would bring Bitcoin to another level. Although Jihan Wu always referred to Bcash as *not* Bitcoin, they don't. The leader of the group is Roger Ver. He was an early Bitcoin adopter but is believed to have been secretly converted to Ethereum a long time ago. He uses his bitcoin[dot]com website, rBTC subreddit and @Bitcoin Twitter handle to sell Bcash as Bitcoin, call Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"", call Bcash the original Bitcoin, and propagate the idea that there can be many Bitcoin coins/chains/protocols. This is their latest strategy to undermine Bitcoin in order to destroy it.

There has been some developments in Bcash lately. The chain was split into two: BcashABC and BcashSV. It's a farce so bad that it no longer deserves any attention.",2019-05-21 11:53:11

eo8mglz,AbrasiveLore,38,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day.

* Tomorrow this will reverse if the p\[rice rises above $7,850.  If the price rises back above $8,100 today the tentative change is cancelled.
* We have a positive breakout with prices over $8,100.

Remember, we are moving into a long weekend in the US.  That has some impact on markets—so think about what you will do for stops and buys over the weekend.  Or just go out and have a beer.   I always have a voice in the back of my head telling me that long weekends are when really bad market things can happen.  It’s an old fear—going back years and literally based on nothing except my background in banking.  Long weekends is when we would do some of our due diligence on banks that we would buy.  Nothing good ever came from those long weekends.

eof2j7a,binarygold,56,"When you're buying Bitcoin, you're not just buying a random speculative asset to make a quick buck. What you're buying is much bigger and much more valuable than any other asset available. It's not about gains, or even store of value.

In fact, this will sound insane to the uninitiated, but it's more precious than anything else in the world. You're buying **freedom** for yourself and others. You're buying freedom from tyrannical governments, freedom from wars paid by devalued currencies, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom to freely trade with other free humans.

When you buy Bitcoin, you're directly supporting an asset that underlies a philosophical and political movement focused on the idea of liberty and pursuit of happiness, the great ideals of the United States and the free world in general, which are in danger of being completely corrupted. Every time you spend a dollar on Bitcoin, you make Bitcoin stronger, and make it live another day longer. You're feeding the flame of hope for a free society where people can do what they want without others forcing their will on them, as long as they are not hurting others.

Some people know this rationally, and thus work on Bitcoin and buy Bitcoin like nobody's business, putting their savings into it to keep the flame alive. Others know it instinctively, and may not be able to explain the reasons why they are drawn to this asset like to no other. People have an emotional attachment to gold for similar reasons, but gold also has a negative overtone, because it is also a symbol of opulence demonstrated by dictators and tyrannical rulers who are antithetical to the ideals of a free society. Bitcoin on the other hand is cyberpunk, grassroots, bottom up, and pure in heart.",2019-05-22 18:56:35

&amp;#x200B;

The demand can (and often does) change rapidly.  

The supply follows a strict schedule - no matter what.  

When demand rises, the supply stays about the same.  So the price of Bitcoin goes up.  

When the price goes up, it attracts new mining activity, but there is a lag, a delay.  

More mining does not produce Bitcoins at a faster rate (not for long).  More mining can increase the mining difficulty, raising the cost of mining (or reducing the expected payout rate).

In financial regulation, a Suspicious Activity Report  (SAR) or Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a report made by a financial institution about suspicious or potentially suspicious activity.  The criteria to decide when a report must be made varies from country to country, but generally is any financial transaction that does not make sense to the financial institution; is unusual for that particular client; or appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating another, separate transaction.  The report is filed with that country's financial crime enforcement agency, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and then report these to relevant law enforcement.  Front line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person that is responsible for reporting the suspicious transaction.

eoikyud,Merlin560,36,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

The formation broke down into a double bottom breakdown last night.  We hit a low that went into the $7,450 box.  The targets for this low range between $7,400 and $7250 based on the two most common methods of establishing target prices.  Keep in mind the entire market is down this morning.

This kind of movement is not uncommon for this type of formation.

Where do we go from here?

We moved up $200+ since the bottom with more volume today than we had all day yesterday.   I am not ready to scream “bullish” but it sure is a nice bounce.  The move downward did not “impress” me with its speed—it was somewhat of a slow bleed.  I do not find that outwardly bearish either.  

So, I think we stay in this $7,500—$8,100 range for a few more days until the rest of the world figures out what we are going to do.  

Here are today's numbers:

* **We hit a low overnight so the chart is completed for the day.  Moves up today will not be reflected until tomorrow.  Moves down below $7,450 will result in lower boxes.**
* **We broke down last night with target prices between $7,400 and $7,200.**
* **The reversal would happen above $7,600.  That would one reflected tomorrow if we do not go lower today.**
* **The positive breakout (A split triple top) occurs over $8,100.**
* **The formation remains 6 column wide which is average—not resulting in HUGE moves either way.**
* **The trend is positive and will remain positive over $5,550.**
*  **We are currently 39 boxes over the trend reversal which is moderately safe.**

Think about what your plans are for a reversal over $,8100 and for a drop under $7,300.  We are in a range right now where you have to think in pretty big movements in nominal dollars vs small movements in percentages.  

Keep it in perspective.

eohuy18,Ilogy,27," 

Inflation in modern fiat systems can be thought of as a way of guaranteeing that the currency doesn't act as a store of value, so that other financial instruments---primarily bonds---can fulfill this role instead. Individuals and businesses with excess wealth and who want to preserve that wealth choose to purchase bonds---i.e., lend their money---which ideally provide interest that counteracts the depreciating value of the currency. So, in other words, one of the primary reasons for inflation is to guarantee that lending remains high with the idea that savers (i.e., people with excess wealth) can transfer those savings to people who want to put the money to work, and this is considered good for the economy.

The reason the fiat money system wants bonds---primary government bonds---to act as the store of value, rather than the currency itself, is actually because bonds (again, primarily government bonds) ARE the real money in fiat systems, not the currency we use day to day. The currency we use day to day really represents the liabilities of the banking system, whereas bonds represent the assets of the banking system. Monetary systems don't want liabilities to act as stores of value, or even worse, to appreciate in value. In other words, since fiat currency represents the debt of the banking system, it is in the banking system's interests that their debts are always decreasing in value.  

In the Bitcoin system, by contrast, bitcoin the currency represents the assets of the system, not the liabilities, and it is in the interests of the system and its security that the value of its assets are appreciating. When this appreciation occurs, miners expand, liquidity increases, the ecosystem grows, and the security of the network increases which increases demand for its use (Microsoft's venture into using the bitcoin blockchain for their digital identity effort is a case of point of the kinds of demand that comes from having the most secure network in the world).

When we invest in bitcoin, what we are actually doing is investing in the Bitcoin Network and it is precisely because of our investments that the network continues to grow and mature, just like a company. And because Bitcoin is effectively the flagship for the entire crypto industry, an investment in bitcoin is really an investment in the broader crypto economy. (If bitcoin went to zero tomorrow, it is likely that the entire industry would wither and die along with it.) The reason so much activity has occurred in this space since 2017 that makes the earlier days of crypto look like a joke is in large part because of the amount of investment that went into bitcoin.  

So in this sense, bitcoin is more akin to US Treasuries than to US dollars. When people invest in Treasuries, what they are really doing is investing in the US government, helping it to remain strong and grow. Likewise, when people invest in bitcoin, they are really investing in the Bitcoin Network, helping it to remain secure and to grow.  

The first mistake people make when talking about bitcoin as being deflationary is in mistaking it for a currency like US dollars when in reality it is more akin to US Treasury bonds which actually represent the REAL base currency of the US fiat system.  

The reason US Treasuries act as such great stores of value, and the reason everyone wants them, is because the US government is the most powerful institution on the planet and people trust it isn't going to disappear anytime soon. For bitcoin to compete with the US Treasury bond, it must become equally as trustworthy---which obviously isn't likely to happen for quite some time---and for that to happen it must be seen as a network so essential to the world that everyone knows it isn't going away anytime soon. For that to happen, Bitcoin must become a network depended upon for far more than just currency, and for that to happen it must continue to grow and evolve, with 2nd and 3rd layers making a tapestry of use cases that leverage the financial infrastructure of the base layer. And, finally, for that to happen people must continue to invest in the currency, bitcoin.  

And so it goes without saying that bitcoin must also be deflationary. Treasury bonds are valuable and act as the real base money of the world's economy because they act as stores of value, Bitcoin must do the same. Will bitcoin always fluctuate in value? Of course it will. But so do Treasury bonds. And just like the value of Treasury bonds determines the fate of the world economy, bitcoin in such a future scenario would have a similar impact. The critical thing is that bitcoin must eventually become the most trusted network in the digital age, and since networks will with time replace institutions as the locus of trust, in being the most trusted network, bitcoin would effectively become the most trusted source of value.  

In other words, there is no ideal value of a Treasury bond, its value fluctuates according to the needs of the economy (though that value is manipulated by the central bank), because fundamentally it is acting as the foundational store of value for the world. This is, in general terms, similar to how I see bitcoin eventually operating. There are very real problems with Treasury bonds and the design of the fiat system which I suspect the crypto system will slowly replace. But the fundamental premise, that at root money must act as a store of value, is as true today as it ever was, people are just confused because they don't realize that bonds represent the foundation of the monetary system.  

The mistake everyone is making is in comparing bitcoin to fiat currency or even to gold. The problem with the fiat money analogy is that fiat money does not act as the primary store of value asset in the modern monetary system. When we talk about inflation being necessary to modern money, people don't understand that this presupposes that such a money is ultimately backed by a store of value which is effectively deflationary (bonds). Bitcoin is more akin to the bonds which are backing fiat money.

And the gold analogy, while good, doesn't exactly work either because gold was strictly a commodity whose utility, as a commodity, was not influenced by investment in it. People who liken bitcoin to ""digital gold"" imagine bitcoin as a kind of commodity, but unlike gold, the more investment into bitcoin the more the network evolves and grows and its utility increases.

And for the reasons I have given, and others, I don't see bitcoin ultimately becoming the money consumers use day to day in the future, it will be a money primarily for the financial backbone, similar to how bonds work today (but it goes without saying that the crypto system will be much different). Bitcoin maximalists, if I were to really boil down their philosophy, are those who believe currency must act both as the primary medium of exchange and store of value, as was the case in the Middle Ages. But in my opinion, the fiat system demonstrated the efficacy of separating the two. I believe crypto will advance further upon this evolution with deflationary cryptos like bitcoin acting as safe haven stores of value, while transactional, consumer level cryptos will likely be more utility focused.

For example, you will likely have things like Facebook Coin, which will provide various advantages when buying and selling on Facebook related platforms, will be convenient and easy to use, but which will also be inflationary and prone to easy confiscation, theft, and censorship. Such a coin will be something people will want to use, but not store their excess wealth in. The reason I see something like this outperforming bitcoin at the consumer level is simply because Facebook will incentivize its use (similar to how Binance incentivizes the use of BNB on their platform).  

The important thing to understand is that the age of crypto introduces a world in which we are no longer forced to use one currency. Once you have a situation where companies like Facebook can create their own currency, and governments allow them to, then you have a wide open marketplace of currency and competition unlike anything we are used to having grown up in a world of monopolistic currency. Under such a system, inflation, as it were, becomes a natural part of the system, something that is controlled through competition and the availability of safe havens like bitcoin, and not something that actually has to be manipulated or controlled by central banks.",2019-05-23 16:41:01

eokf2lo,olivierjanss,69,"Thanks for interviewing Luke, Peter! He's really hard to reach/interview/get straight answers from, and this rare opportunity allows us to document how wrong he, and many in Core, are.

Some quick observations:

- Soft forks are actually a lot more “evil” and “sneaky” than Hard forks. Soft forks can be pushed through just by miners only, and your full node won’t even know the network was upgraded/changed. All your stuff will just be ignored. For example, miners could activate a 300kb blocksize limit with a softfork, and full nodes wouldn’t even be aware that the upgrade took place (except for everything they do being ignored). Which brings me to my next point: 

- Running a full node is completely useless, except for a couple of things: 
-&gt; Verifying that there is no “evil stuff” (like 21 mil supply change) being done by miners. But you’d only need a couple trusted full node operators for that, and trust me when I tell you that any exchange (or even other miners not participating), would quickly report that 51% of miners just tried to take over the network (obviously!).
Total kicker with that is: If all miners would activate evil stuff via a softfork, you would not be able to know they did! Another reason who soft forks are evil. You would no longer be able to participate under the new rules and you wouldn’t even know what they were!
-&gt; Being made aware that a hard fork took place (as mentioned before, soft forks cannot be detected!). With a full node, you would be forked off the network when a hard fork took place. If you don’t agree with the changes, you can protest by not upgrading your client, but you would need to find new miners to secure your “old version / fork”. In other words, you will always be dependend on miners, and full nodes can’t really do anything. You can make a point that “economic nodes” aka big exchanges (and users), can refuse to upgrade and follow the new fork, but they would still need to find new miners to protect the “old” fork they want to stay on.
-&gt; “Privacy” to some extent, but TBH I wouldn’t really count on that if you’re doing really secure stuff. You’d need a lot more than just a full node (including a VPN).

I also have to mention that high fees are extremely centralizing and make Bitcoin extremely insecure cause they force users on third party custodial wallets such as exchanges. Those with small amounts will not pay $x in transaction fees to have the security of their own wallet. It was incredibly irresponsible not to increase the block size limit (much higher than today, so high fees could have been avoided), before 2nd layer solutions are out of beta (or even alpha!). And even then, I doubt the the current 2nd layer proposals will ever work (and if they do, if they will be more decentralized than what's available today with onchain transcations).

So when you read the above, you can quickly conclude that the whole “everyone needs to run a full node” is completely bananas. I actually wrote an article on why it’s a terrible idea. You can find it here:

The price rose last night into this morning to a high of 8070’ish.  It promptly fell back down.  It rose enough to match the last column of Xs, but not enough to “do” anything. 

We remain in the formation, 40 something boxes above the trend reversal.  The formation is 7 columns wide, which is moving to the above average width.  With every column that we add in width it is another tightening of the spring that will move the price with some ferocity.  Of course, it could go either way.

Here are the numbers for today:

* We reversed into a tentative column of Xs.  
* A positive breakout would be above $8,100.  The formation would be a double top breakout.  A price over $8,200 would break resistance from the most recent high.  If the price in this column moves over $8,350 it would trigger a “split triple top breakout.  This would be a strong bullish indicators.  Failure to move to $8,350 would not  be the end of the world, but it would indicated a higher level of resistance that would be short-term bearish.
* A negative breakdown would occur at a price under $7,450.
* The formation is now 7 columns wide.  This is moving towards the higher end of “average” width.
* The trend is positive, with a reversal happening under $5,600.  With every column added to the right this moves up one box. 

This is a three day weekend in the US.  It is wrought with political and trade impacting potential.  I think we are positioned for a breakout, but I would not be shocked to see us fiddle and diddle for a couple more days.  Or we could blow out this afternoon—as we have done on so many other Friday afternoons.

* A smaller miner tried to collect all those coins.
* Some person (either independently or in coordination with the miner) exploited a bug in Bitcoin ABC which prevented miners running Bitcoin ABC from creating new blocks.
* The Bitcoin ABC team released a patch.
* Miners upgraded and BTC.top proceeded with the plan.
* An unknown miner mined a block appropriating many segwit coins.
* Prohashing mined a block on top of the unknown miner.
* BTC.top orphaned the two blocks.
* Prohashing team complained.
* Most discussion was about
  * The reality that the majority of the power uses Bitcoin ABC and the risk it represents.
  * If the person exploiting the bug was a gray or black hat working with the unknown miner.
  * If it was morally correct or not for a miner to take that action.
  * If enabling segwit recovery had been properly planned.

eoqs51v,real_mark,64,"The main difference is the use of the Scrypt hashing algorithm to mine. This is different from the Bitcoin algorithm which uses SHA256. This allowed early miners to mine bitcoin on a gpu and litecoin on a cpu at the same time, this there was a huge crossover of early adopters who mined both coins. 

This algorithm is also an improvement because scrypt is harder to make ASIC miners for. This makes mining more decentralized as there is less of an “arms race” to get faster ASIC miners. There are ASICs available for scrypt now, but litecoin (I believe, hopefully someone with more knowledge can verify this) can still be mined for profit on a gpu or cpu while i presume (I haven’t done the math) that mining bitcoin on a gpu or cpu is not profitable on bitcoin. 

Other advantages litecoin has is faster on chain transaction confirmation times as a block is mined every 2 minutes and 30 seconds rather than every ten minutes. It also has less problems with cultural infighting and has clear leadership and direction for future updates and upgrades, including the proposed use of encrypted transactions making the coin more fungible as cash and less subject to government draconian laws. 

The lightning network and Segwit were both implemented in litecoin without a hitch, unlike the bitcoin core vs cash wars. 

The most obvious difference, besides the algorithm is that there are 84,000,000 total litecoin to be mined while bitcoin will only have 21 million. It is also 3 years behind the bitcoin halving schedule.",2019-05-25 23:55:51

eoopeyh,CatatonicAdenosine,56,"I think there's an interesting question buried somewhere in here about the extent to which we expect honest miners to defend the integrity of the blockchain. The point can be made clearer with an analogy—we can discuss afterwards, if necessary, whether the analogy speaks to the attempted appropriation of funds and consequent re-org. 

Consider a hypothetical scenario in which a vulnerability is discovered in Bitcoin that allows miners to either appropriate funds from unwitting users. If a miner exploits the vulnerability before it can be patched, then how would we expect honest miners to respond? Should honest miners accept all valid blocks and continue mining on top of the longest chain, regardless of whether or not these valid blocks contain the exploit? Should honest miners recognise that the exploit undermines the integrity of the network and orphan any block in which the vulnerability is exploited? Or finally, perhaps we think that miners orphaning exploit-blocks undermines the chain *more* than the exploit itself? The question is: what should honest miners do, and what do we expect them to do?

Since Bitcoin introduced the Segwit soft-fork, Bitcoin Cash has faced the problem of what to do with coins that are accidentally sent to segwit addresses on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Bitcoin Cash developers introduced a new address format precisely to circumvent this problem, but use of the Bitcoin-style address format still persists in some wallets and services, so the mistake of sending Bitcoin Cash to a segwit address remains possible.

Some large miners have historically allowed users to recover these coins by approaching them directly. Segwit addresses are ""anyone can spend"" on Bitcoin Cash, because of the lack of segwit, so for a small fee some miners would construct a non-standard transaction to recover these funds for users and mine it in their next block. But the introduction of the ""clean stack"" rule in the [November 2018 hardfork](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2018-nov-upgrade.md) to fix malleability (the same as [Bitcoin BIP 62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki) rule 6) inadvertently made these segwit addresses irrecoverable. After community concern about these now lost coins, this was fixed in the May 2019 hardfork and these addresses could once again be recovered with the help of a miner. However, these ""anyone can spend"" addresses were exploited by an unknown miner immediately following the May 2019 fork. 

This lead to the dilemma: should the majority of miners orphan this valid but underhanded block, or should they accept it and extend the chain? I think this dilemma is comparable to the hypothetical I sketched out above, and some miners decided that the right thing to do was to orphan the block in question (at this point it was buried under 1 further confirmation) and send these UTxOs to addresses where only their rightful owners could recover them. As it turned out, these miners were supported by majority hashrate.

Now, perhaps this was the wrong course of action, and perhaps it did undermine the integrity of the network *more* than allowing these addresses to be exploited. Miners were protecting these coins for their rightful owners, but this norm is not included in the consensus protocol. And if miners can be expected to voluntarily enforce *this* non-consensus norm, then what *other* non-consensus norms (legal or political) may they be expected to enforce in the future. So, maybe this event did set a bad president, but I don't think it's *obviously* true that it did. I think there's a good case to be made that the majority of the Bitcoin Cash hashrate did precisely what they are economically incentivised to do, and protected the integrity of the network.

As I said the other day, the current ""custodians"" of Bitcoin are idiots- this Twitter thread is proof enough for me. I wonder if they realize how ""normal"" people read this stuff- it sounds absolutely fanatical.

If your coin *requires* radical overthrow of the existing financial and world order in order to be successful, I daresay you are going to be out of luck. *At best,* BTC may leech some of the gold market in the near term, which is an $8tn market and would still represent substantial upside. But if you think people are going to use it as every day money any time soon, you are likely delusional. If it was more natively programmable and extensible, I might believe it has a shot at this. The problem is that it is not, and chains like Ethereum are, and possess similar focus on decentralization and arguably more focus on long term sustainability.

I hold BTC, and I like it for what it is, but I truly despise these obnoxious takes from these dudes who seem like they're sitting in their mothers' basements, acting like they are crusaders in a holy war, when in fact many are just wannabe, incapable mercenaries working to line their own pockets. These guys want to overthrow the system, yet the most exciting news they've had in weeks is Microsoft creating an identity project on-chain (which also uses Ethereum) and that AT&amp;T now accepts crypto for paying your wireless phone bill via BitPay. LOL.

Ethereum has a very good shot at changing the world, but it won't have to do so by destroying it. As it is used more and more, it will become more economically important. And perhaps the decentralized and emerging ""Ethereum Economy"" will end up making the world economy more accessible and less rent-seeking. And in doing so, it very well may create some of the world changing disruption Bitcoin Maximalists seek, although I doubt it will require a bloody revolution to do so.

Bitcoin Maximalists are missing an important fact: they think you can foist their world and economic views upon others. This can work if you are powerful enough or your product is useful enough, but I don't think the Bitcoin supporters are socially or politically powerful enough, and I am not sure that Bitcoin as a product can be useful / scale enough. *Ethereum doesn't require anyone to accept any ""religious"" belief- it just requires people to use it, whether that use is direct or indirect.*  The more Ethereum is used, the more it will change the system irreparably.

Open-mindedness and approach-ability are important for an open source movement. This is why Ethereum continues to attract real world development talent at a rate which dwarfs other chains completely. I tend to hold very weak ideas on what Ethereum *should* be, although I do believe in some use cases more than others. Rather, if you're a developer with an idea, and you if you can make it work (especially with regard to fee structure and tx capacity), then I believe you deserve a shot.",2019-05-25 23:54:19

Segwit addresses are ""anyone can spend"" on Bitcoin Cash, because of the lack of segwit, so for a small fee some miners would construct a non-standard transaction to recover these funds for users and mine it in their next block. But the introduction of the ""clean stack"" rule in the [November 2018 hardfork](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2018-nov-upgrade.md) to fix malleability (the same as [Bitcoin BIP 62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki) rule 6) inadvertently made these segwit addresses irrecoverable. After community concern about these now lost coins, this was fixed in the May 2019 hardfork and these addresses could once again be recovered with the help of a miner. However, these ""anyone can spend"" addresses were exploited by an unknown miner immediately following the May 2019 fork.

This lead to the dilemma: should the majority of miners orphan this valid but underhanded block, or should they accept it and extend the chain? I think this dilemma is comparable to the hypothetical I sketched out above, and some miners decided that the right thing to do was to orphan the block in question (at this point it was buried under 1 further confirmation) and send these UTxOs to addresses where only their rightful owners could recover them. As it turned out, these miners were supported by majority hashrate.

Now, perhaps this was the wrong course of action, and perhaps it did undermine the integrity of the network *more* than allowing these addresses to be exploited. Miners were protecting these coins for their rightful owners, but this norm is obviously not included in the consensus protocol. And if miners can be expected to voluntarily enforce *this* non-consensus norm, then what *other* non-consensus norms (legal or political) may they be expected to enforce in the future? So, maybe this event did set a bad precedent, but I don't think it's *obviously* true that it did. 

Indeed, I think there's a very good case to be made that the majority of the Bitcoin Cash hashrate did precisely what they are economically incentivised to do, and protected the integrity of the network. They prevented the obvious ""theft"" of user funds with a two-block re-org and redirected these funds to their owners. Anyway, regardless if whether they were right or wrong, I certainly don't think this was an example of a 51% attack.",2019-05-25 09:55:12

my belief is bitcoin can/will be used as a replacement for gold, but even this idea has not been proven out yet (we wont know if its true until the next major strain on the financial system). its black and white, and dangerous, to believe that 1) because the world has high levels of debt and 2) because inflation exists within the financial system, fiat currencies will fail and bitcoin will outperform. theres actually a high chance that even if bitcoin catches on like i hope it will, US dollars, singaporean dollars, and swiss francs will outperform bitcoin in the next financial downturn. holding a basket of strong currencies, for those interested in wealth preservation, is a smart move. something to think about for those concentrating their wealth in this unproven asset class.",2019-05-26 16:19:42

eoutvr7,Merlin560,62,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

The bouncing up and down continues; albeit with lower and lower volume.  This is historically how these formations resolve.  The longest one was about 14-16 columns wide—so we “might” have a while to go.   Does this mean the end of the parabola?  (God, I hate the phrase—I think it was because my calculus prof was an A-hole.). Not necessarily.  These formations have resolved both ways; so it’s a little early to made dire predictions.

Here are the day’s numbers:

1.  We dropped a box in the column to a new low of $7,882 overnight.

2. A reversal would happen tomorrow with a price above $8,000.   We would continue down the column of Os with lows below $7,850.

3.  A negative breakdown occurs  under $74,50.

4.  An ascending triple top breakout happens at a price over $8,200.

5. The formation is 8 columns wide now—this is tipping towards the long end.  This means the “spring” is getting coiled up and when it goes it should move (in either direction) fairly fast, and fairly far.

6. The trend is still positive with a reversal point way down at $5,600.  That is 47 boxes away—that is a pretty safe distance for the day.

In summary; I expect more of the same for a couple more days.  Watch the direction and the volume.  Aside from that, keep the nerves settled.  

Remember, in the US—tomorrow is a holiday.  So the normal markets are not open.

That’s huge. That’s not like he spent $6k on a stupid motorcycle he doesn’t know how to drive or bought a $250 steak when he went out to dinner with the guys one night just cause he felt like it. He took $200k from your guys savings, lost it, &amp; then didn’t tell you &amp; thought...what? You would never notice it was gone?

If he thought this was such a sure fire, highly probable way to make some money, he would have probably consulted you (bc if it’s such a good idea, why would you say no?) The fact that he didn’t is super sketchy in that he probably knew you wouldn’t be on board or knew bitcoin might tank. &amp; he did it anyways. &amp; this is total speculation &amp; probably distrust on my part, but he also could have just been using yalls money to try to make a profit, &amp; then returned the 200k to your savings &amp; kept whatever else he made off bitcoin for himself.

There are no withdrawal limits as long as you transfer your coins from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro, and withdraw from there. You can also purchase cryptocurrency from Coinbase Pro at reduced fees.

Coinbase is a very reliable site and one of the safest. All funds are insured and the exchange is fully regulated. They got a lot of flack from the BTC camp because they supported Bitcoin Cash pretty early on, so now every time someone has a problem they post it in r/ bitcoin and it gets a million upvotes.

Coinbase is not a bad company, and for most people they work very well. For a minority, especially during the last bull run when they were onboarding a million new customers a day, they suffered severe support shortages and were backed up on tickets pretty badly, as was Kraken and quite a few other exchanges. They should have handled it better, but they are not a crap company.

As far as monitoring what you do; they are a fully regulated US exchange. The IRS (US agency) took them to court a while ago and tried to get an obnoxious amount of information on their customers, but Coinbase fought them in court. Eventually the judge ruled that much of what the government wanted was excessive. Now it's basically customers who transact more than $20,000 per year, or more than 200 withdrawals/deposits, or certain kinds of transactions, etc. get automatic forms filed to the government. I'm not sure if it's just US customers or everyone. Do a search on their website and I think you can read more about it. Also, your transactions are followed once you withdraw.

ep4y3m3,Merlin560,58,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

A short post today.  We are in a high pole warning situation.  The target price is down around $8,400.  I expect us to repeat the pattern from last week.  We will probably bounce around for a couple of days until it breaks one way or the other.   Because the trend is up, we are “obligated” to be positive, so I am going to guess we go up by the end of the week.

I know this is a short term trading sub-reddit—and that is cool.  But I would suggest that when folks are posting things like “end of the run”, or “the bull is dead” that they put a time frame in the statement.  I think its clear the last formation is done, and a new one is forming.  That does not mean the “bull market” is over.

And talk of a parabola should be over a much longer term.  The one in 2017 went from November through January.  That was a quick one that actually started much earlier that summer and went through a number of internal formations that looked very much like the formations we are seeing now—along with the associated disruptive events (Segwit, ETF failures, BCH hard fork, etc.)

A favorite phrase of mine is to “keep it in context.”  For example, back on April 10 the formation of a Bullish Catapult was triggered when we passed $5,350.  It went up, but then failed within a couple of days because of the 7,000 coin loss.  But the formations were in the context of 30-60 days—not “tomorrow.”  Since then, we topped at $8,947-0-and we still have two weeks to go to remain “in context.”

I mention this to make a point—not to beat my grey haired and soft chest.  Make sure you understand your “context.”  And make sure when you are discussing your calls, comments, or forecasts…you express your context.  It makes for better communication, and less drama.

Bitcoin won’t be as fast or energy efficient as other crypto currency’s since it uses pow. 

Is there an assumption bitcoin can’t evolve as well? (Segwit, lightning, and more later?)

Bitcoin history doesn’t matter since pow can be swapped to another chain. 

This is the assumption that the other chain is running sha256 as the algorithm to mine. Secondly the other chain would also be pow since sha256 is a pow algorithm. 

Btc has been going for 10 years without a successful attack on the chain (reverse or double spend). Not many other chains can say the same. 

I 100% agree that crypto subs focus way too much on price action and bullshit tech articles about partnerships with different companies or that they accept crypto now when it’s just a 3rd party service that uses crypto will change to fiat for them. These type of posts are terrible for discussion.

 * Reddit Administration holds complete control over the entire site, can censor content, ban users, and can depose moderators.
 * Moderators hold nearly-complete control over their own particular fiefdoms, can censor content and ban users
 * Users can vote content up or down

Very few subreddits actually attempt to hold a vote on subreddit policies by users. Reddit Administration also rarely exercises their dictatorial powers - even against known bad actors. Moderators thus hold most of the power in shaping their communities in practice. Rarely, user revolt will trigger moderators to change practices, or spur the creation of new communities with different moderation.

However, most moderator abuse goes unchallenged. Reddit is a ""free speech"" platform, but that really only extends to your ability to create new communities. Within those communities, moderators are generally free to rule as they see fit. Content restrictions can include both explicit bans on certain topics or bans on specific users who associate with other communities.

For example...

 * You aren't allowed to say anything nice about Bitcoin forks in /r/Bitcoin
 * You aren't allowed to say anything even moderately critical of Trump in /r/the_donald
 * Support subreddits, such as ones for survivors of abuse, have standing policies to ban anyone who posts in certain abusive subreddits, regardless of content
 * You aren't allowed to post unsourced information in /r/NeutralPolitics

Some subreddit rules are acceptable, but the problem is that Reddit culturally does not care about how those rules are made. What the admins mean by ""free speech"" is not the rights of users. It is the rights of moderators - a far smaller subset of lords in the Reddit nobility. This means that it is not a democracy - the views of Reddit users are generally disregarded in many cases and the only vote regular users has is what communities to patronize.",2019-05-28 14:06:33

Problem is that most people early IN on Bitcoin got the conclusion that this is easy money and those people didn't really have to choose between thousands of coins. Just one would be the all-out-winner.

Unfortunately then Blockstream came and stopped it from growing and we got hundreds and then thousands of alt-coins that actually got pretty valuable.  
Then we got the ICO craze and the everyone will suffer from some level of fear of missing out (FOMO).

It can be bad on the nerves, as we are essentially talking about gamblers here and there is so much choice that will cost real money if you don't make the right one.

This article about the GBTC investment trust contains a ton of up-to-date data and is an extremely valuable read.  One thing that stuck out to me was the 11236 BTC accumulated into the trust just in April alone.  Compare that to the number of new BTC minted per month currently (12.5x6x24x30) = 54000 BTC.  So currently GBTC alone is soaking up 21% of the new supply of BTC.  This will **double** in less than one year after the halving.  And we're clearly in the baby stages of the next bull cycle, which will likely increase the rate GBTC soaks up new BTC.  If we don't get any ETFs in the next year, it's not unreasonable to assume GBTC alone will be soaking up over 50% of newly minted BTC a year from now.

ep6ssl6,flossboss666,39,"Ripple’s a private company with offices and employees worldwide. XRP is a digital asset. Ripple sells software to banks. They already have over 200 customers (many of the biggest banks &amp; financial institutions in the world). Most of those customers are not using XRP...yet, but they most likely will. I won’t go into the non-XRP services here except to say that they save customers money now and provide a steppingstone to using XRP.

X-Rapid is a service built by Ripple that uses XRP. They describe it as providing “liquidity on demand.” To understand why this is so neat-o-burrito, you need to have a basic understanding of how banks move money now.

Let’s say I’m a US bank with US customers. One of my customers emigrated to the US from Thailand, where their family still lives. They want to send money to their family in Thailand. They bank with me, but I don’t have a branch in that country. In order to process the transaction, I have to keep an account in a Thai bank, with money denominated in the Thai currency. It’s my bank’s money, but it just sits in a Thai bank until I need it. This is called a Nostro account, and I need them in a lot of countries to make sure I handle the needs of my customers.

There are many problems with that scenario.

1) The money in that account isn’t able to work for me. It’s just there to provide liquidity; that is to say, money when I need it.

2) in order to let that Thai bank know that my customer wants to move money, I have to use a messaging network called SWIFT, which is decades old. SWIFT loses messages often, has high transaction fees, and takes many days to process. Foreign currencies, like cryptocurrencies, fluctuate against each other. During the days that transaction takes to process, I may have lost money in the exchange due to volatility. Not good for businesses. Makes all kinds of hedging required.

3) What if I’m a small bank, and don’t have the money to just park in a bunch of accounts all over the world? How can I be competitive? I guess I could use another bank’s nostro account and settle between us, but that’s another layer of complications and delays.

Enter X-Rapid. What X-Rapid will do is use XRP as a bridge currency. Liquidity on demand. I click a button, the software buys XRP on the open market at the best price, sends it to the destination country, sells the XRP for local currency on an exchange there, and deposits the funds into a foreign account.

And it does all this in about 3-5 seconds. And it scales. And it’s secure, and immutable, and all that delicious blockchain Jazz. It also only costs fractions of a cent compared to other first-mover cryptos.

Want more? There’s more. So much more.

XRP supports smart contracts. There will soon be a stable coin issued on it. You can tokenize other assets on the Ripple Ledger. Always wanted to invest in commercial real estate or a Hollywood movie but don’t have millions of dollars? When assets become tokenized, you can buy $100 worth of a parking garage.

Ripple sells XRP out of an escrow and uses the money to build out the network. The X-spring initiative funds start-ups and entrepreneurs who ha e cool ideas to further adoption. Lots of cool stuff has come out of this already.

You’ve got Coil, which is a subscription service to pay content creators. You’ve got forays into micropayments in gaming.

And then there’s the interledger protocol. Want to pay a subcontractor in Pakistan, and you want to pay in Bitcoin and have them receive local currency? ILP baby. Can you say “interoperability?”

Basically Ripple has implemented solutions years ago to problems that companies and other projects are just starting to consider.

It is easy to demonstrate by observing the Montenegro-Rio complex number plot on the 5 minute log chart.

The next bitcoin ATH will be significantly higher than all other ATHes.  Unlike worthless fiat-backed invetments, it is mathmatically impossible for a subsequent bitcoin ATH to be less than the prior.  This is due to the fact that Bitcoin is inflation proof and the value of bitcoin is constant (1 BTC == 1 BTC).  Fiat is printed daily and even very bullish stocks have ATH's that are less than prior ATH's -- both in real and nominal terms.

One thing worth noting is that NAno uses a unique data structure called the Block Lattice, which means each account has its very own blockchain (rather than one global ledger like bitcoin). This allows the transactions to be very fast and fee-less as there is no competing transactions.  
Challenges such as spam mitigation and ledger bloat will have to be overcome, and there is a ton of work underway to make the network more robust, meaning Nano has yet to reach its full potential as a digital currency.",2019-05-30 18:47:31

epdysmk,c0wt00n,53,"there are lots of different flavors of proof of stake. They actually just changed the terminology for what nano is, but I forget what it is. Anyway, the way it works is that you select a representative to vote on transactions (you can choose yourself or someone else, any account can be a representative). The number of nano you control is the number of votes. Representatives that have over .1% of the coins delegated to them their votes go to securing the network.

with PoW coins, you need 51% of the hashrate to attack the network, with a coin like nano you need control over 51% of the votes. This means you either need to own 51% of the supply (or have convinced 51% of the supply to delegate their votes to you). Which means that besides being absurdly expensive (most likely impossible) you have a pretty big incentive not to ruin the network, since you make your money worthless.

It's kind of a myth that people need direct financial incentive to run a node. Look no further than bitcoin for an example. Ten thousand plus people are running bitcoin nodes, and they get no money from that. You can see it already on the nano network, there are many many hundreds of node operators even tho they are not directly incentived. Running a node is very cheap, so people do it because they support the technology, or because its fun, or because they have a large stake of nano and want to ensure the security of the network.

Nano is fully confirmed in the second it takes to get to your wallet. It isnt like PoW coins where you need to wait X number of blocks to be safe. There is also a feature being added called ""Block cementing"" which makes reorgs like what was just done to BCH and what was talked about being done to BTC after the binance hack, impossible.

Nano was distributed through difficult captchas, this was done to give a fair way for anyone to get nano, not just the rich elite in an ICO or a big mining conglomeration. Lots of the nano went to south american countries and then was sold on exchanges. You could concot some conspiracy theory that the devs secretly horded it, or gave it to themselves, or that someone bought it all up when it went ot exchanges. But this is silly in that there isnt a single bit of evidence for this, and lets say hypothetically that did happen, how would that be different from a whole host of coins whose founders own a HUGE chunk of the coin (BTC, XRP, DASH, XLM, etc etc). Also if someone spend a few hundred grand to buy a coin worth less than a penny, in hopes to make it big, well good on them, the same can be said for any coin that started out with a small value.",2019-05-30 09:35:12
epf2dta,WoefulKnight,52,"First of all, I want to congradulate you on finishing your Silicon Valley spec!!! That's an amazing accomplishment that you should feel very proud of. 

Now that you've written one, all you have to do is write a few more! 

Second, I'll warn you that this may come off harsh, but I've always felt it's important to tell a writer the truth about their writing. It's through our first writings that we create our best writings, if that makes sense. 

OK, buckle up and feel free to ignore, but there's a lot of things that I think can help. 

\*\*\*

First two pages I can tell you haven't found your voice with the show yet. You've got the enthusiasm which is important, but your first scene would have a very hard time making it on film. 

Satire requires a deft touch. You're beating the audience over the head with the jokes and characters. I get that the Senate is all Old White Men who don't understand the internet, but you're throwing obvious tells into where you think the audience SHOULD be laughing. 

Satire like Silicon Valley uses their characters to flaunt the flaws in Silicon Valley. You should do the same thing with your Senators. Gavin Belson is a cartoon character, but his character makes sense within the universe. Your senators haven't earned that privilege yet. They need to earn their cluenessness so that the jokes pay off (witness Gavin Belson's signature on the Box prototype).  Just throwing out ""HAHAHA GET IT? THEY'RE OLD AND DON'T GET TECHNOLOGY!"" jokes aren't worth the lines you're giving them. 

Realistically the senators should appear as if they have an idea what the Internet 2.0 should be, but slowly revealed as being clueless to what the Internet 2.0 actually means. Saying a senator got scammed by giving away his bank account is unrealistic and loses a connection with the audience. A better connection is having one of the  senators know enough about the internet to invest their life savings in Bitcoin at the peak of the bubble. That is to say, your senators should have just enough knowledge to be extremely dangerous to Richard and the crew. 

You're talking down to your audience (a mostly sophisticated tech-savvy group) by using things like ""I just installed the internet with the big blue E."" There ARE people like that, but again, your senators have to earn that privilege to be that dumb before the audience will accept those jokes. 

Having the G-man come out of a vent is completely out of the voice of the show. The G-man should have immediate access to Richard and not need any introduction beyond whatever Jared tells Richard. That's how you show the government has power. A meeting Richard can't say no to. 

Gavin's character should have been made massively rich after Hoolie was sold to Amazon. His flaw is envy and wants all the same success and goodwill Elon and Bezos have garnered over the years. He should have made out like a bandit after Amazon bought Hoolie, but that success doesn't mean anything because he's not the person in charge. 

He shouldn't be desperate. He only acts from a position of strength, whether that's real or imagined. Having him beg Richard for a chance to get in on the Internet 2.0  project is not in character at all. I see why you did so in aiming for his redemption at the end, but Guifoyle could have just as easily (and really should have) served the same narrative that Gavin did in the end. 

It was far too easy for Richard to pee with all those people around him. A better approach would have been Guilfoyle ambushing Richard in the bathroom, preventing him from peeing, making Richard more uncomfortable and unable to pee. You can also use Richard badly needing to pee as a punchline to get out of the scene once Gavin finishes his spiel. Also, Gavin's advice is never free and always conditional (like you say, one good deed doesn't cancel everything else out). Imagine the audience's reaction if Gavin agrees to leave the bathroom to let Richard pee only if he can give him advice. 

Finally, if you're going to begin your episode *in media res,* then you need to come back and check in with the senators at some point in the story, whether that's at a midpoint before the ultimate resolution to this episode, or as an epilogue. We should have some kind of connective tissue with the opening scene to pay that off - even if it's another joke at the senator's expense on what they understand about the internet. (For example, a final scene with a senator asking Richard a very basic question that was explained multiple times for the audience during the episode).

That's it, I know how hard it is to write a spec, so I hope you take all this criticism with a solid ""Atta(person!)"" behind it all. 

Good luck in getting into your writing program!",2019-05-30 13:23:08

epbniru,Merlin560,49,"PnF Update Lesson for the Day

Today, I am going to take on the role of being a bit of a teacher.  If you just want the chart--the link is at the bottom.

There are a lot of obvious ""noobs"" here.  Nothing wrong with that.  Really.  Some of us old timers could use an injection of enthusiam.    So I figured I would do some 'splainin' about how this stuff works.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning’s chart includes some things that I haven’t put in older charts.  And I want to be perfectly clear that these are “general” guidelines and predictions.  **Under no circumstances am I going to allow myself to be held to the Indications posted here.**  They are for demonstration purposes on how to use TA to make an assessment of where things could go based on history and certain elements that are well known.  Use YOUR tools to make YOUR decisions.

So look at my chart and see the following: 

&amp;#x200B;

* 1.  We have the “pop” up so frequently seen in Bitcoin over the past several years.  This was a sudden breakout from the previous formation.  This high pole is the start of a new formation.
* 2. We have the drop—which happened yesterday.    The drop took us down to the high pole warning target (50% re-trace of the high point).
* 3. Now we go into the Fiddle and Diddle. This is the blue shaded area.   This is the formation of the flag or banners or pennant or whatever you want to call it.   This is the frustrating part of the formation that can last for a few days or as long as two weeks.  Think of this as a scrum in Rugby where the two teams—buy and sell—push against each other with equal force.  This is the choppy trade where, if you are careful you can make some money if you are aware of the target prices and watch the volume.  During this time the speed of moves slows down, and the overall 24 hour volume declines to a crawl.  Both sides are exhausted.
* 4. Finally, the double ended arrow is the break.  This is usually accompanied with volume and speed.   Going up, this gets the cocky shorts caught in a bind.  Coming down, the speed, volume and length of the column will rip your face off and you will be wrecked.  Estimate where YOU think its going and how you will protect your trades.

&amp;#x200B;

Using these charts with other tools will help you be able to take the noise out of the market and predict, with a decent level of certainty, where we are going and how explosive any move should be.

Today’s numbers are in the box on the chart.

I will leave the shading on the chart for the next few days.  But the first person that says, ""it moved outside your lines, you suck” will get a nasty response from me.  Please feel free to pile on and down vote them as well.   This is not an exact science.  I am trying to not only use my tool, but show you how I use it.  It will make us all better traders.

Entry level construction tends to pay the most you just have to learn to bust your ass but take my word for it your body will get used to it and you'll develop some pretty good muscles while you're at it.  and put a fraction of your paychecks into Bitcoin until you build up that one Bitcoin again.

epkqzsh,SloppySynapses,35,"Hey everyone! Earlier today I said if we go below $8.4k that we would revisit $7.2k or $6.4k. I believe this breakdown will provide a lot of people a low re-entry. Here are my reasons why:

There are bear divs on the 1d and 3d unless we can manage to climb back above $9.1k again.

We broke the very well-fit parabola we were building since the very bottom. The classical target is an 80% retracement but I don't really think we will go that low.

We broke it down at the top with a huge ascending wedge with a nearly perfect volume profile, decreasing volume in the wedge + huge volume on the breakdown:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/34Ts2e09/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/34Ts2e09/)

I looked at a few ascending wedges and they seem to perform quite well with bitcoin- the target is the bottom of the wedge if not an extra 10-20%.

[$](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Er7kXDSL/)13k-20k ascending wedge:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/9eQGctzy/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9eQGctzy/)

$9.3-$11.7k ascending wedge:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WsE5wnH1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WsE5wnH1/)

$6k-$6.8k ascending wedge: 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/73ahljuH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/73ahljuH/)

If we follow the targets BTC has historically had, we can expect at least $6.8k and possibly an overshoot like the wedges above to \~$6.4k: 

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/cEKPtpbF/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/cEKPtpbF/)

I was going to consider playing the bounces, but given that we're coming out of a parabolic run that's breaking down on high volume, I may not try catching the knife until my targets hit. That and the fact that each ascending wedge breakdown seems to have been a relentless downtrend until relief is found at significant support. 

Contrarian viewpoint: if the $7.9-8.2k area holds as support, it's possible we are in an ascending channel:

epjod4i,mitchgc1,34,"Best described through an example:

You have $100 in your account. You can leverage  at a rate of 1:5. Meaning you can buy (long) or sell (short) up to $500 worth of bitcoin.

You  keep 100% of the profit on that trade. 

If you open a $500 long and the price of bitcoin increases 20%. Your $500 goes to $600 and you just made a $100 profit - you now have a $200 account balance. On the other hand... If the price decreases by 20%, your $500 goes to $400 and you get liquidated because you cannot cover more than $100 worth of losses.

Shorting allows for traders to bet on the price falling. When the price falls by 20%, you gain the $100. If it raises, you get liquidated because you cannot cover more than a $100 loss.

Basically amplifies all trades in an already volatile market for the people who want to get rich quick(er).",2019-05-31 07:51:56

epiprab,jambocombo,29,"Yes, Ripple/XRP is a huge scam. It was never freely mineable, as all units of its ""currency"" were created immediately and wholly reserved by a single entity at its inception, and, as the poster above me pointed out, most still haven't been given out to anybody. Would you use MicrosoftCoin if Microsoft owned 60% of them? Then you have no reason to use Ripple.

Satoshi Nakamoto also has a large number of Bitcoins (if he's even still alive), but the difference is that he mined them the same way as everybody else, in an open network that anybody could participate in with him from the very beginning, where others (like Hal Finney) were able to and did mine coins along with him. He didn't reserve anything explicitly for himself.

Ripple/XRP is only faster than Bitcoin because it's vastly less secure, sustainable, and decentralized too. Ripple Labs has also been fined by FinCEN, the only cryptocurrency backing company that I know of to have a problem with them (which is because Ripple/XRP isn't actually a cryptocurrency but basically a corporate token).
