eyoxl9v,mrilirgashi,9,"This article is filled with false accusations, misleading statements and incorrect facts.

At least do some proper research:

1. Litecoin is not a ""token"".
2. All the LTC from Charlie Lee's selling is being donated to the Litecoin Foundation. Hence why we've seen major partnerships recently  - UFC, Glory Kickboxing, C&amp;U Entertainment, Miami Dolphins, HTC Exodus, Cheapair, Surfair..etc because of these donations. He also doesn't need financial stake in order to be motivated to work on Litecoin as he is intrinsically motivated (not extrinsic).
3. Some miners leaving the network doesn't constitute a spiral death. Bitcoin miners left when BTC when to $3,200 but it didn't die right? That's the beauty of a mining difficulty readjustment.
4. Litecoin has never had 40 developers, it's always had 3-4 developers working on the protocol consistently since the start.
5. The UFC sponsorship was actually profitable for us in terms of brand awareness and recognition which was the main goal of that campaign.

In my opinion, DCA buy and hold is the way to go and that has been my strategy since the 2018 meme triangle broke down. I wont pretend like I know what the market is going to do tomorrow, but I'd like to pose two simple questions:

How has demand changed for Bitcoin over time?

Is supply going up or down?

&gt;Sad how he fractures the community to set up a /bitcoin style echo chamber.

This is an offensive statement. There's no Bitcoin style echo chamber nor censorship as many have been saying. It's just a narrative -- another one -- attempting to distort the truth and bring people back in to the old cesspool.

This comment is about DCInvestor and that's why it hasn't been removed, so we're not accused of things we're not. If this comment was about someone else, I'd have removed it already because 1) adds no value to the discussion about Ethereum or DeFi; 2) it's not fun nor interesting; 3) it's a clear attempt to bring back a topic that only trolls care about.",2019-09-01 01:46:53

- now you can have the safety of holding your bitcoin as if it was money at the bank with the same ease and peace of mind. Everything is set in stone directly on the blockchain, if anything does  happen to the btc now you will have the official ability to sue registered complient entities meaning you are now protected by both the btc blockchain and by European law. 

- Euro deposits are insured by the German governement. (Which is pretty normal for banks).

- No crappy software or wallets by some nobody crypto company, everything proffesional and regulated by financial authorities. 

- Easy buy and sell with official documentation; f.e. no transaction history that ""dissapears"" after 3 months like on most exchanges. Have fun prooving previous purchases for taxes.

They will also move into gold because that is a proven store of value for thousands of years, and it has deep deep liquidity as well. 

Bitcoin is only 10 and a bit years old, hyper volatile, completely unproven in a recession, and facing regulatory issues worldwide.  It's as high risk as it gets.  It's more probable that institutional investors flee that risk as things go to shit.  

Obviously we all hope that's not true.  But the odds are not in our favor.

Didn't you notice that since btcs all time high, when transactions fee skyrocketed, btcs transactions are stably below limited capacity? 

That basically means we reached choking point in btc and because of that we know now that btc can't function as money.

eyobur5,dEBRUYNE_1,5,"&gt;The problem I see is that not many people see the issues in BTC, or will for a few years IMO. Monero may be doing great things, and making huge strides, but BTC is barely used and works mostly fine.

Issues do not become problematic all of the sudden. The awareness gradually increases until you reach some kind of tipping point. Arguably, the fungibility issue has received more awareness in the last six to twelve months. Furthermore, I'd posit that fees will inevitably rise to unsustainable level again, which will result in people looking for alternatives (such as XMR, which, due to Bulletproofs, can ensure fees remain reasonably low). 

&gt;It will be a long and slow transition as more people see the scaling and fungibility issues in BTC, but I don't have high hopes for XMRBTC ratio in the meantime.

The mistake you are making is to not make a relative comparison. In 2016-2017 XMR traded at a substantially higher BTC price at weaker fundamentals and significantly less awareness for fungibility / privacy and usability (i.e. fees). Additionally, people often mistakenly extrapolate the current trend that is in motion and believe it will continue indefinitely. The crypto market is dictated by cycles, i.e., bull versus bear markets as well as Bitcoin versus altcoin dominance.

Lastly, the main point I was trying to make in my initial comment is that Monero delivered stellar fundamental improvements whilst promising relatively little (the 'broken dreams and promises' notion does not apply to Monero).",2019-09-01 02:50:49

eyqxtke,kant12,1,"Supply isn't decreasing. It's just increasing at a slower rate. The demand would still need to increase at that rate or greater and can't simply stay the same. 

Besides it's really only useful to think in these terms with commodity markets and things people actually have a real need for. Too many people don't need bitcoin they just buy it because they're hoping for easy money and since there's so few people and the volume is so low it's very prone to manipulation.

Most investors are morons.  Just because somebody says they're an investor doesn't mean they know what they're doing, or that they've been making money and/or beating people like me who just buy and hold long term (stocks, Bitcoin, whatever...)  

Most people have no clue about what Bitcoin actually is, nor the basics of how it works.  Some do, and we're buying and holding long term.  

Most people have no clue about bond yields and/or yield curves.  Most people have no idea what a central bank is nor what a central bank actually does.  Most people have no clue about money, nor where their money comes from, goes to, etc.  Most people have been brainwashed to believe that Keynesian ""economists"" know what's going on, have the answers... 

Most people are struggling to get from paycheck to paycheck without accumulating even more credit card debt.  These people don't have wealth to protect, and they have no funds to invest long term into Bitcoin.  

Some of those with significant wealth are about to find themselves motivated to learn all about Bitcoin, and to start Buying it as a hedge, as a ""safe haven asset"".  The others will simply be wiped out.",2019-09-03 00:22:52

eytj0zt,SilverHoard,1,"As it stands, the entire crypto market is still tied to Bitcoin.

My guess is that after the next big pump and ""altcoin"" cycle, alts will decouple from Bitcoin and we'll start having a more realistic market based on tech, development, community interest and marketing. And I believe Tron will be one of the big gainers in that.

To me it's incredibly silly that the market follows BTC in the first place. It's based on the habbit of measuring everything against BTC because before the 2017 bull run there were barely any alternatives. Now there are. Tons. And there's also been tons of infrastructure built since then.

The market isn't the same as it was pre-2017, and it's only a matter of time before everyone realizes that and BTC loses it's first mover status.

I mean let's face it ... if the market made any sense Bitcoin wouldn't be in the first spot right now. There are far more impressive projects out there that can do so much more, and even just in terms of alternative currencies, Bitcoin isn't the best one at all.

It just says to me we're still early. So either the market decouples from BTC, or people lose interest since then it's clearly not about the tech, and the market slowly dies. And Bitcoin just does it's thing, which in that case wouldn't interest me anymore.",2019-09-03 00:24:15

eytlw2e,bobsburger900,1,"Blockchain-based payments firm Eligma on Monday announced that it has secured ‚Ç¨4 million (almost $4.3 million) from Roger Ver‚Äôs Bitcoin.com and venture capital Pangea Blockchain Fund.

Launched in 2018, the Slovanian company is aiming to provide payments infrastructure to merchants to accept payments in digital currencies via point-of-sale (PoS). The company has already developed a solution called Elipay, which allows merchants to accept payments in both fiat and crypto.

Though the company initially targeted its home market in Slovenia, it also expanded its reach to partner with several businesses in neighboring Croatia. Now with the fresh capital, Eligm is aiming to tap the international markets.

Commenting on the funding, Dejan Roljic, CEO of Eligma, said: ‚ÄúEligma effectively solved this problem with Elipay, which enables instant crypto transactions; furthermore, the merchant receives settlement in local fiat and is thus safe from crypto volatility. This makes the use of cryptocurrencies quick and effective for daily use. We must not forget that cryptocurrencies were envisioned as the electronic cash of the future.‚Äù

Easing crypto payments for the retail industry

Per the company, it has already established itself in more than 430 locations in Slovenia and Croatia, including hotels, shops, restaurants, and sports facilities.

Earlier, the company also partnered with Bitcoin.com to offer its services to the 4 million users of its wallet platform. The company is planning to partner with other wallet providers to bring more users. The platform is also offering 2 percent of spent tokens back in the user wallets in the form of ELI tokens.

‚ÄúBitcoin.com is investing in Eligma ‚Ä¶ as we drive more and more adoption and make it easier and easier for more people in more and more countries around the world ‚Ä¶ to use cryptocurrencies in general,‚Äù Roger Ver said.

Bitcoin.com also jumped in the crypto trading industry and launched its crypto exchange earlier today with a unique ‚Äúnegative‚Äù trading fees to attract traders‚Äô attention.

Because people were forced to use the currency their government demanded them to use.

It has everything to do with laws.

Bitcoin isn't in one country, it's global.  And money works different.  If there are two competing currencies, they don't just co-exist.  The better one wins out, because those who use the inferior one will simply lose all their value in the long run compared to those who use the superior one.

ELI5 hypothetical:

(1) ButtBuck is a hypothetical deflationary currency. Its buying power quadruples yearly, meaning that if 1 ButtBuck buys 1 Widget today, a year from now 1 ButtBuck will buy 4 Widgets. 

(2) A Widgets is shorthand for ""desirable stuff."" In this ELI5, we're assuming that Widgets are what we want, and, unlike cats, one can never have ""too many Widgets."" Maximize Widgets FTW.

(3) You can invest 10 ButtBucks in a Widget factory, a factory that makes widgets. This guarantees 100% yearly profit denominated in Widgets -- in a year's time your investment will be worth 20 Widgets.

(3 a)...or keep your ButtBucks in a mattress. Doing this guarantees 300% profit, denominated in Widgets.

(4) You're not the only one using ButtBucks -- the whole world is. Most are also capable of doing basic math, and understand that being able to buy 40 Widgets a year from now is better 20 Widgets a year from now..

No idea what you mean, I never suggested that.

Already responded to that once.  The LN includes the ability to route payments but is not limited to just that.

That would be 12 transactions for the network (on-chain) cost of just 2 transactions.   If you can't see how scaling is involved here, there's not much I can do for you.

The appetite for investment is in large part coming from the Bitcoin bullshit we've been watching for the last 2 years.  When Bitcoin hit that $20,000 ATH and you started seeing the BTC conferences with Lambos and private jets, a lot of people started to take an interest and want a part of that.

Well as you know, bitcoin is a sham and most exchanges do things that are completely illegal.  So a lot of guys who wanted to get on that train decided they still wanted to invest, but they want to invest in the US equities market.  This combined with those apps where you trade ""for free"" has really driven this push that you're seeing.

Remember when movie stars started playing Poker and then all of a sudden guys started getting really *really* into Poker?  Maybe a little too seriously?  This is just natural human behavior.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe analogy here is that Satoshi Nakamoto incubated Bitcoin but it‚Äôs totally irrelevant to its current usage, and that‚Äôs my opinion on Kik Messenger. They were planning to incubate it, but it would quickly be able to take on a life of its own.

Seems like they believed in the vision for an ecosystem. Kin's just a digital coin. Its secondary market value is determined on the secondary market. People are allowed to speculate, and they buy all sorts of things hoping they go up in value; it doesn't change the primary purpose of the coin.

ethereum is a moonshot, but respect the risk of failure.  The economic model is more ambitious for better or worse. There are unintended consequences when you experiment with economic incentives.

In 2017 the lions share of the supply was distributed to ICO projects. Those developers have to sell their ether to keep the lights on. And none of them have gained any sort of main stream traction. So the ecosystem just isn't pulling it's own weight.

Bitcoin is succeeding because very few coins recirculate back on the market. It's not intended to stimulate economic activity like ethereum is. It's only meant to be a rogue ticker symbol that can store an excessive amount of wealth. Nobody really has to sell.  They don't have employees to feed or overhead to pay.

As for following the trend though, I agree.  Bitcoin just had a huge rebound from 3.5k to 10k.  Historically, alts lag behind Bitcoin by about six months (don't quote me on the actual lag time).  So hopefully we will see a trend reversal on alts soon.

I also agree that VTHO's massive supply is likely a big part of what is driving the price lower.   I don't think that eating through that supply will happen any time soon, but just taking a look at the transaction growth over the course of the year makes me daydream about what the activity will be like a year from now.

"" they [banks] create money out of thin air""
No, they don't.  The treasury creates money and provides it to the Federal Reserve, who lends it to banks.  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/082515/who-decides-when-print-money-us.asp

""FIAT banking is immoral"" 
No.. just no. I know we can't all be experts on every topic, and economics are enormously complicated and multidimensional, so I don't fault you for misunderstanding.  However, I'd highly recommend doing some reading on the basics of monetary policy.  In essence, the Federal Reserve attempts to *limit* things like inflation and unemployment through the careful controlling of the money supply.  It's a heavily studied process, and the theories have changed over the last couple hundred years based on the achieved results.  But, the fact is creation of money is an absolute essential part of our economy.  I highly recommend reading through this article: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/monetarism.asp.  The concepts surrounding monetary policy are not immoral conspiracies, they are proven facts with decades worth of results to back up the various approaches to curbing unemployment and inflation.  

""Stop mixing in irrelevant concepts like capitalism"" - this is like saying let's have a discussion about water but only focus on the properties of hydrogen and ignore oxygen's existence.  You'd be convinced water is highly explosive. You can't just remove variables from an equation to make it simpler to understand.  You end up with the wrong answer when you do this. Capitalism is another piece of the economic puzzle that must be considered when discussing things like the creation of money, inflation, lending, etc..

Bitcoin cannot, and will not, make for a better national or global economy.  It just isn't that simple.  You can't look at one element of the economy (inflation) and say ""aha, eliminate that and everything becomes perfect!"" The world economy has more dimensions than that.",2019-09-07 04:51:21

I did so its easy to reply again.

&gt;You're making quote walls copying pasting 1 statement because you're getting evasive.

what statement is that?

&gt;Answer these 2 questions right here:

LMAO you have passed over 95% of my questions, you just have no reply to the vast majority of them.  But ok, I can reply to them again.

&gt;1) So why did Blockstream coin the term Bcash? 

To differentiate between the two coins

&gt;What was their intent creating that pejorative?

their intent was to differentiate between the two coins.  You havent shown that Bcash is pejorative.  If anything the word Bcash dissociates you from TOXIC BTC and TOXIC blockstream, thats a good thing right?  

&gt;2) Why did they fire shots first? 

How is differentiating between the two coins and dissociating BCH from TOXIC BTC and blockstream bad for you? Why do you consider this ""firing shots""?

&gt; Bcash was used before Bitcoin Cash even forked.

Ok, probably to help people differentiate between the two coins

&gt;I can link to articles for proof.

well youre wrong, - Jury Awards Apple $539 Million in Samsung Patent Case

&gt;Brand name is a real thing and by referring to Bitcoin Cash as anything but means you're looking to damage someone's reputation.

And you guys think the BTC brand is bad and broken and doesnt work, so were doing you a favor by giving you a fresh start.  You wouldnt want people to think your coin was taken over by blockstream do you?

And lets consolidate 2 conversations into one, replying to you here -

The real reason nano crashed is because there was built up sel pressure of people waiting for Binance to list at the same tome bitgrail collapsed. The $35 price was not likely ever the true supply demand price. I think it would never have soared passed $4 in the 2017 environment if not for a perfect storm.

ezluiv1,Hodor7777,1,"&gt; accountability related to past XRP sales

This statement caught my eye.  What is Ripple accountable for?  Is the Ethereum Foundation accountable for its sales of ETH?  

&gt; if Ripple goes public they can take their IPO money and do a slow fade out on XRP.

Can you explain why the founders would not want to capitalize on their XRP holdings?  How would the value of XRP benefit from this action?  Completely illogical.  

&gt; Ripple‚Äôs biggest accomplishments so far have been onboarding banks to xCurrent and buying a large stake in Moneygram.

No.  Their biggest accomplishment so far is building a solid foundation technically and business-wise for the Internet of Value, all the while battling intentional misinformation and hostility from Bitcoin protectionists.  

&gt; So far, XRP is a lovely dream.

No.  Banks and remittance processors are using XRP to process payments.  The software tool is called xRapid.   

Your attempt to wash away facts with emotional statements may work with a small percentage of readers, but not this one.  

&gt;   they can usually only do one thing well (xCurrent)

Why are you saying xCurrent is the one thing Ripple does well?  Can you provide any supporting facts for your statement?  

&gt; chasing a dream of XRP

This is the second time you've compared XRP to a 'dream.'  I'm sensing a theme here.  What about all the banks and remittance processors using XRP as we speak?  

Source:  https://twitter.com/hmatejx/status/1170005598160805888?s=20

Yes, very little energy, relative to bitcoin.  You are free to do the research yourself if you believe you can prove otherwise.  We know Bitcoin is using the equivalent [energy](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption) to the entire country of Austria right now.  

&gt;Does gold have a practical use? Like decorations?

Were you born like 100 years ago?  Gold is critical to modern electronics seeing due to its conductive properties.

&gt;All wasteful? Those other solutions you mention are centralized

I didn't mention a single solution that is centralized, mostly because I mentioned specific solution.  But if we are to talk about solutions, yes, there are plenty of that exist that remain decentralized and permissionless.

&gt;Bitcoin mining moves to more efficient processors and cheaper electricity, a lot of cheap electricity comes from green sources.

That is an argument for more wasteful energy usage, not less, and much of that will continue to ride on traditional energy sources.

Compared that scenario to bitcoin: bitcoin is still inflationary even with the promised ‚Äúhard cap‚Äù (no body knows if that security still works when block reward approaches zero).

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! üòâ

Medium Interaction|$75-150/day|This is a middle of the road option where we talk as I'm available. You will occasionally receive photos with this option. With this option I am open to receiving any pictures of yourself you'd like to send including NSFW ones and will be more open to NSFW questions. 
High Interaction|$150+/day|This is a very involved GFE where I interact with you at a similar level to a significant other. Chat will be constant throughout the day unless I have matters to deal with or I am sleeping. I will reply as much as I possibly can. You will receive a mixture of live and gallery photos throughout the duration of the GFE because I love to show off for you!

1) Ask your parents or another adult to help you. Most parents are reasonable if you come to them and say you want to work part time , make a budget , and save some fiat currency, invest in a IRA/stocks , and Buy some Bitcoin to make money for college or a future business.

2) Coinatmradar.com - If you have a cellphone , many atm's will allow you to buy with sms verification instead of ID verification (7-15% premium)

3) Localbitcoins.com, hodlhodl.com - Buy locally in person (7% + premium)

4) purse.io - Buy with credit or debit card or amazon points for 15%+ premium

This happens on a HARD fork. And after much research it turns out this is simply an upgrade, or a SOFT fork. So no duplicates will occur.

However, some have also said that IF, and i do mean if miners do not upgrade and continue and splits long enough to live on another chain then yes, two different sets of coins 'may' occur. But the general consensus is that this is unlikely to occur because they too have stated they will all upgrade.

eztrfro,Dixnorkel,1,"&gt;Yeah I see the volatility and upside in value as a perk.

&gt; I see a ton of value and use cases for Bitcoin and crypto. Cheap and fast retail payments is not one of them. 

You're supporting conflicting stances here. Businesses see the volatility as a perk as well, and the ones that don't are able to use services like Bitpay where the default option is to cash out immediately.

You're also not basing the arguments against increasing capacity on reality whatsoever. Making Bitcoin more restrictive to use means that less people will buy into it, meaning the volatility will continue and likely trend downwards. The reason that price fluctuates so heavily is because so few people hold, buy or sell any.

If you think that there's no demand for cheap and fast transactions, why is LN being developed? Why do Venmo, Cashapp, Paypal, etc. exist? These arguments make it sound like you're completely disconnected from reality, I'm not even sure what metrics you're basing them on.",2019-09-11 02:36:05

eztuace,VancouverSB,1,"I am sure you are a super smart person; however, a few recommendations as someone with life experience.

&amp;#x200B;

It was deeply troubling &amp; disturbing to hear some of the horror stories from the ladies on the site. There are some heartless &amp; selfish men. So  I started compiling the below info based on the feedback from lovely ladies that I have exchanged messages. Hope this wouldn‚Äôt offend you.

&amp;#x200B;

FYI

&amp;#x200B;

Takeaways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A lot of men are trying to have sex without paying or paying very little.

2)If it is too good to be true beware. Offering a lot of money or promising a lot of money.

3) Assume the worst of most people until they prove otherwise

4) Do not show desperation for money they will take advantage of you. If you are in a vulnerable state they sense it.

5) Make sure no one manipulates you by agreeing to a platonic arrangement &amp; then trying to force you into intimacy.

6) Some are good at paying well on the first intimate date and then they cheat on your 2nd date by not paying as they had gained trust in you.

7) The promise of being exclusive or long term but they are meeting others. Please clarify.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are under 21 please be extra careful as you get targeted because of your age.

&amp;#x200B;

Please protect your identity until you trust them. For texting consider using [https://www.textnow.com](https://www.textnow.com) \- Free

&amp;#x200B;

Simple tips to avoid people wasting time - Say in your profile - ‚ÄúI am NOT looking to trade sex for money.‚Äù Also say you are in an open relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch out for scammers who will say they want to test your trust or want your help. They will send you  money ($1-3K). Some of the money is supposed to go to you and the rest of it they want you to do like a ‚Äútrust‚Äù exercise. So with the rest of the money, they will tell you to buy iTunes cards and then send it to them or send them back 1/3 of the funds or Bitcoin. It is a fraud check and the money will be taken out of your account a few days later.

&amp;#x200B;

Some red flags

&amp;#x200B;

\- Inpatient &amp; Pushy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Too good to be true in terms of promising a big allowance or pay per date. Unless they pay you it means nothing. Remember, unless the person spends the money on you, it is just all talk.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Agreeing to pay a large allowance per month and after getting intimate once you will not hear from them.

\- Or pay what you want on your 1st intimate date and not paying on the 2nd date as they have gained trust in you.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Wanting to meet at a hotel or Airbnb room. They will not pay or will see you again. Wanting to meet you late in the night in a car. -Meeting at a HOTEL or car should be considered as either they have something to hide or no intention of paying.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Promises of shopping trips &amp; vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Always trust your instincts and feelings over the money. Please remember NO money is worth your long-term mental/emotional &amp; physical health.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Always the first time meet the person in public preferably during the daytime.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Only accept beverages that are unopened. Best is if you don‚Äôt drink on your first date or have 1 drink. If the guy insists &amp; forces you that is a red flag.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Establish boundaries in the beginning. Men will push to have sex without condoms please DON‚ÄôT takes any risk that will impact your long-term emotional and physical (STD) health. They will ask you to go on birth controls. No money is worth taking any risk. This includes BJ.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard some many women being tricked into having unsafe sex and not even giving any money or after having sex in a hotel room taking off when the lady goes to use the washroom &amp; stealing the money from the handbag.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My understanding is that there are lots of men here that have multiple sex partners &amp; only meet ladies to have sex once even though they might portray there are interested in a long-term arrangement. They are willing to pay more money for the first meetup. In terms of getting STD, these guys pose the highest risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Ladies who are experienced ask men to get tested &amp; show them the results before they will start an arrangement. It seems men will lie the number of people they have met on SA.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, watch out for guys who use sugar mommy accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

Some men will do everything possible to have sex on the first date. They are so smart &amp; find ways you to make you trust them. Some men are only interested in having sex for free; 1) By getting you intoxicated and 2) By promising a lot of $.

&amp;#x200B;

One way to test them whether they are violent is to ask them of their sexual fantasies.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ensure you indirectly find the person‚Äôs history on the site. If the person is with multiple partners then you might want to ensure his health is clean.

&amp;#x200B;

It is sad when men either take advantage of women or don‚Äôt respect women; plus a few minutes of my time will result in ladies like you to prevent stressful situations.",2019-09-11 03:06:26

ezulqmx,nowitsalllgone,1,"&gt; Is it even possible to recieve bitcoin on LN without first having Bitcoin, and using it to open a channel on the lightning network?

Yes, that can be done. Someone can send your first bitcoins directly in a lightning channel that they simultaneously open with you. The command for this in LND is:

&gt; lncli openchannel &lt;node id&gt; --push_amt &lt;amount&gt;

You would just replace ""&lt;node id&gt;"" and ""&lt;amount&gt;."" A node id is a random number similar to a bitcoin address (but has a different purpose, it's more like a MAC address than it is like a bitcoin address, every lightning wallet has one).",2019-09-11 07:40:44

A competitor to FluidStack gives money based on work. HoneyGain pays you for how much bandwith you use. I made a TON more money off of them (although I did not work long enough to get paid, I 'made' about $7 vs FluidStacks $1.33), but they seem to be sketchy as hell, and did not mention using CPU's for extra money. I also gave them more bandwidth, so this could just be an issue with bandwidth on the FluidStack side. Which connects to the this point the top poster made.

While you seem to know more about the finer details of the programming, the market has decided that Bitcoin is the king, and every other Crypto has to fight over the rest. I do know that Litecoin has never had downtime. 

If it was all about tech and fundamentals then probably Nano, Tezos, or Cardano would (or will) have the largest market cap / trading volume / adoption but they won‚Äôt, Bitcoin will. 

We can argue all day long but only time and the market will decide. 
If on September 11th 2024 you‚Äôre right, then hats off to you but I think i‚Äôll sit it out with proper Bitcoin, a cheeky bit of Litecoin and some Cardano.",2019-09-12 00:01:02

This is where Bitcoin skeptics overshoot. There is a genuine innovation in Bitcoin. It's just that the stuff that ended up being built on that is wonky. Bitcoin's designer(s) were great cryptographers and distributed systems developers but quack economists.

I also think a lot of what's wrong with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency merely mirrors what's wrong with our whole society.

#Kik 
Vanilla is *$3/min* I'm into JOI mutual and general sweet stuff.

*$4/m* for vanilla with extra requests like dialog, lingerie or toys

Fetish is *$5/m* I love butt stuff (both ways), bdsm, ddlg, Domme, switch, sissy training, cei, and lots more just ask!

* creampie - $10 pussy $20 anal
* cosplay/elaborate dress - $10-50 (Jinx would be a $50 example, Misty would be $10)

***

#Custom Videos

My custom videos can range dramatically from $100 all the way up to $1500 depending what is entailed. I have so many options and abilities it's usually much easier to get a summary of what someone wants first, then discuss what's possible within that realm. I generally do not produce a clip shorter than 10 min in length. All my videos are filmed using dslr or mirrorless cameras and edited on Adobe premiere pro. I use professional sound equipment to also allow for asmr quality audio. If you prefer a video made on phone or gopro, this can be discussed and a new price tier open to you, but you forfeit the quality you see in most my videos. Please PM me for more information!

***

#Custom Photos

***Vanilla***

$25 - 10 pics in custom poses

$50 - 30 pics

$75 - 50 pics

You may choose what I'm wearing, limit of 3 outfits per set or a surcharge of $20 will be applied.

***Fetish***

$40 - 10 photos

$80 - 30 pics

$120 - 50 pics

These can be XXX including toy play, hardcore content, etc. Please PM for details.

##My hard nos

Pain, Blood, pee, scat, mommy stuff, baby stuff, extreme negative fetishes (being mean), humiliation.

f00j1a2,1ncehost,1,"The fundamental reason for Fiat money, which is to incentivize economic growth, is having diminishing returns due to a slowing in technological innovation.

If there are less technological breakthroughs, the only way a society can continue to grow is by competing with other societies. The primary way in which this is occuring is by artificially keeping labor costs low by high inflation (not cpi, but true inflation which is approximately money supply growth or around 8%).

Increasing competitiveness by reducing labor costs has the effect of forcing a population to become more efficient. The population makes purchasing decisions towards products that use less energy to create and distribute. This lowers consumption, so the europeans have created negative interest loans to prop up consumption in key areas.

The effect of all of this is wealth redistribution to the people who have the finances and reputation to afford leverage in asset classes that beat true inflation, such as equities. Its only a matter of time before the wealthy and the poor exist with no middle.

There is no escape because this is the natural order of humanity in between periods of technological breakthroughs. Bitcoin will allow a small minority of people to beat inflation but bitcoin doesnt produce anything so eventually it will only be a means of preserving wealth.",2019-09-13 00:34:10

f00oysc,thieflar,1,"&gt;If I didn't hold any coin would you even have an argument?


If you weren't holding such heavy BCH bags, it's doubtful you would be investing such a preposterous amount of effort to trash-talk Litecoin, because you wouldn't feel threatened. In that scenario, there would have been no deranged comment history for me to highlight, so to answer your question: probably not!

&gt;The 3 events I listed above are true whether you're happy about them or not.

Again, I have no particular interest in Litecoin. What I have been pointing out is **how obviously afraid you are of Litecoin**, almost certainly because you're terrified of its price performance beating that of the altcoin *you're* invested in (which it **has**, historically). This fact is true whether you're happy about it or not.

The fact that you're so desperately avoiding acknowledging the hash-share and price performance points I've raised just hammers this home.

&gt;It's obvious you're not happy. 

I'm perfectly happy. I hold Bitcoin. The *real* Bitcoin. Neither LTC nor BCH holds a candle to it. I am not threatened, I am amused by how threatened *you* obviously are.

&gt;I do have to say you have balls of steel to hold crypto post Dec 2017 bubble.

Thanks. I do, indeed. Been holding Bitcoin for *many* years, I've held through multiple bubbles and managed to take significant profits towards the top of each (some of which I've reinvested at subsequent lower prices, some of which I've divested into other assets, some of which I've simply spent and enjoyed). I also had the foresight to convert my airdropped BCH altcoins into BTC at almost 6x the current price ratio, so in a way, you sort of paid for my last vacation. Thanks!",2019-09-13 01:08:52

f05n533,Unifuture,1,"Challenge accepted :)

Brave has millions of users. Being a ""crypto oriented"" browser enabling users to earn money by browsing I believe a huge number of crypto enthusiasts are using Brave, for that and more reasons. This has incredible value when you think about it. Brave is the ""window"" to everything crypto for so many. With that comes incredible opportunity, perhaps in a way similar to how Microsoft was able to eat the ""window"" to the pc (no pun intended haha)

Consider this fact above. Imagine the power and possibilities. They can essentially pick the winners, on-board all sorts of projects, dapps and other things that would gain huge value by it.

Brave could then either build their own wallet, dex, crypto shopping index, vpn services, hosting, even add visa card to spend BAT.

Or they could of course partner with x project and create some type of new utility for the BAT token, by for example enabling BAT to be spent everywhere by having some third party BAT/USD exchange functionality, or huge discounts.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that Brave &amp; Bat makes it possible for users to earn money while browsing. Literary could not imagine a more powerful feature. How does any browser really compete against that?

Since so many users (already millions) have BAT within their account, websites are incentiveized to accept BAT as payment. BAT is essentially in many cases to most accessible money the visitor has, only a click away.

Users can also donate various a wide range of platforms. You can tip a twitter account, a reddit account and so forth. If that reaches a certain saturation then BAT will become the ""tipping coin"" the one all sites enable, as thats the coin everyone using the Brave browser has.

Considering all this, can BAT actually become what Bitcoin dreams of being? You get it basically for free while surfing, you can spend it everywhere or tip anyone. natively within the browser with zero fees.

Will BAT also be more widely distributed? I would argue for sure. Those who have the most incentives to use Brave are those who have less money. Kinda beautiful in a way. Interesting to think what may happen once India and other relatively poor countries join the BAT economy.",2019-09-14 07:35:13

The number of developers and projects around Eth is undeniable that Eth will be a strong ecosystem. It is just matter of time for Eth to take the first place because cyptocurrency is all about developers. When bitcoin lightning network fails, it will be time for Eth2.",2019-09-15 05:57:39
f096ly9,dashrandom,1,"&gt; I think it's different from a chargeback, in that it can only occur with a provable fraud attempt, whereas merchants who take credit card can get 'chargebacked' for almost any reason. I'd say that's a substantial difference.

That's not possible where I'm from but I understand it's possible in the US.

&gt; I can see why you'd make the analogy, because it has some passing similarities. However, there are several key differences (some of which I've mentioned) that could mislead someone into getting the wrong idea about how LN transactions work. In this case, I disagree that the dollars ever needed to exist. In fact, at the moment of payment (before 'settlement'), the 'money' is created out of thin air. That is, nothing needed to exist at that moment, and if the credit card company went belly-up, they'll never exist. This reaches back to my previous point. In the LN, that 'money' is actually backed by real Bitcoin. If the node goes down, you won't lose the underlying money.

Wait wait wait... you don't actually think merchants aren't paid till the end of the month right? Merchants are paid **immediately** when you pay with a credit card (or as immediate as the payment processor takes). It's only you and the bank that settle once a month. The money isn't created from no where, it's paid to the merchant on your behalf by the bank and the bank then waits for you to provide them the funds when they give you the bill. This isn't the same are creating money from nothing except if you spend more than you make. If the bank went belly up, they'd already have transferred money to the merchant, what's wiped clean is **your debt**.

I agree there are some differences but lightning transactions are indeed IOUs since the bitcoin never leaves the origin wallet till the channel are closed and the transactions broadcast to the blockchain.

&gt; It's true that it doesn't exist as a payment to the merchant on the blockchain, so I agree that it's not the exact same as a typical Bitcoin transaction, but the differences between them are not as big as the differences between cash and a credit card, IMO. You'd be on more solid footing if you compared it to, say, exchanged postal service money orders or something. However, I don't think they have a great real-world analogue at this point.

I think the best real world example is actual tabs between friends. And I'm not trying to troll here. Sometimes I have tabs between friends when we go on holidays and we only settle after the holiday is done or once every few days (i.e. when the channel closes). Money never leaves our wallets but we are both aware that we do not have the full value of the money we have as we owe each other some money.

When we do eventually settle, we won't perform each transaction in the order we spent the money, we'd just pull out a calculator or excel sheet and tabulate the final result. Just like how lightning would do.",2019-09-15 06:01:52
f097kwp,libertarian0x0,1,"We have time to prepare. In Bitcoin, addresses are not the public keys but a hash of them, so you don't expose your public key untill you spend it. Even if quantum computers could break ECDSA, it won't happen fast enough before the transaction gets confirmed and the remaining funds moved to a newer address. 

The issue comes from already spent address, I don't know how this will be solved. In IOTA, you cannot re-use any address, this makes IOTA quantum-resistant AFAIK.",2019-09-15 06:10:44

f0956c3,Khrimz000,1,"&gt;Electroneum will dethrone Bitcoin within the next 5 years. Mark my words.

&amp;#x200B;

WOW.....You GROSSLY underestimate bitcoin...not to mention the other competition ahead of Electronium to begin with.

The crypto space was COMPLETELY different when bitcoin was created. It is foolish to even compare the two...to be honest. What you seem to be forgetting is that there are SEVERAL GREAT cryptos out there that are better than bitcoin also...Ethereum, NEO, Ontology, Elastos, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, ICON...hell...Ethereum is what 90 percent of cryptos, ERC 20 tokens are built on.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin was the ONLY crypto in its space..it was the first...ZERO competition and whats fascinating about bitcoin is that its decentralized. As in, truly decentralized. Meaning, you cant shut it down from its HQ because bitcoin has on headquarters.  


That alone is amazing..and fascinating. 21 million blah blah blah etc but the fact remains, its TRULY decentralized. Plus Bitcon Futures is already underway, then theres this: [https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/](https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-trust/) , Fidelity offers BTC to their customers now, if im not mistaken...its all over the news (Especially Forbes...even tho they hate quite a bit but its there nonetheless)..i could go on.

You have absolutely no proof that 3rd world countries have heard of bitcoin than electroneum. I believe you are lying to be honest...but still...you have to break into the top 50...and thats VERY hard to do given the competition that are much more well know and established.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin didnt need an idea for expansion...it just did with nothing more than word of mouth..now it dominates the crypto space by FAR. 

&amp;#x200B;

About your ripple comment....well...bitcoin started off at what..a penny..and its ATH was 19k...again...stop the comparisons...also there are BILLIONS of ripple as compared to now less than 21 MILLION BTC.

Weak argument man....BTCs accomplishments should shock you in its success and it didnt need an ICO, it didnt need Millions of dollars, it was peer to peer...and look where we are today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It never ceases to amaze me  how people ALWAYS forget the simple supply and demand. 

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I believe that you are **VERY** wrong in that statement of yours that I highlighted...",2019-09-15 05:49:16
f096q3b,CSFFlame,1,Bitcoin (and MOST other cryptos (not ETH)) don't have an owner.  They are basically just protocols everyone follows.,2019-09-15 06:02:55
f095i65,jstolfi,1,"&gt;  I like how you say that reversing a payment for an illegal purchase like it is some needed feature for a buyer.

You got it garbled:

+ Fraudulent merchants -- who announce gold but deliver crap, or don't deliever anything -- need payments to be irreversible because otherwise their victims will reverse them.

+ Sellers of illegal things need payments to be irreversible because otherwise customers will reverse the payment after receiving the stuff, knowing that the merchant will not go to the police.

Honest merchants may suffer from fraudulent reversals,but they can appeal to the payment processor -- who, by and large, has a strong motivation to process legitimate appeals, hunt down the fraudsters, and send them to jail.  While those merchants may wish that payments were irreversible, the sensible ones know that their clients must have the right to reverse them in some cases.

&gt; Using bitcoin as a settlement layer you can build systems that can contain features like reversibility for commerce if necessary. 

As I wrote, that basically would be re-inventing the wheel.  Those ""systems"" already exist, they are called ""banks"" and ""credit cards"". 

&gt; Who is saying anything about [Bob Ross's] artwork? When you put paint on the canvas the layer is clung unto the canvas you can paint over it but molecularly it's always there right?

Sorry, but know about painting even less than you know about money...

Real artists will scrape or wash off, and repaint, the parts they are unhappy about, many times over.  That is why they may take years to finish one painting.  Bob taught how to finish a painting in 30 minutes -- that is why he could not make corrections.

&gt; I feel like you barely read my words and fail to see how they connect to each other. 

I admit to that.

&gt; The banks were basing their entire lending off a similar model the dollar backs itself off of, that things will continue to grow no matter what.

That is so deeply wrong...  The dollar is not ""backed"" by mortgages or anything.  It is ""managed"" by the Fed, that continuously adjusts the circulating supply to keept its purchasing power stable minus a small planned loss.

&gt; &gt; And, conversely, crypto cannot do anything to avert such crises. 

&gt; You avert the crisis by not basing your economy out of magic money so youre not blind sighted when you magic money doesnt do what you wanted it to.

Again, the crisis of 2008 had absolutely nothing to do with some flaw of the US dollar, that retained its value through the crisis.  

Suppose that Bitcoin has been invented in 1999, and by 2008 it had completely displaced the dollar.  How could that have prevented the 2008 mortgage crisis?

&gt; That's numerology

No, it is not ""numerology"".  The flow of money in ""Crypto Space"" is: 

+ Investors give 15 million USD each day to the miners, and maybe even more to Exchange operators.  Then Investors shuffle some more money among themselves.

That is *all* of it.  There is no other source or process anywhere that will give money to the Investors -- in the past, present, or future.  The morons who invest and trade in cryptocurrencies have lost already 10 billion USD, maybe more; and will only continue losing as long as they stay in the game.  The longer crypto stays alive, the more they wll lose; the higher the coin prices go, the faster they will lose.  Some may make a profit, but only by taking more money from other Investors, beyond their fair share of the general loss.

&gt;  its the same bullshit that hedge funds and traders use but pretties it up to make it look legitimate. Don't act like it's solely a crypto thing. 

That is what makes me mad: the shameless crypto scammers telling people that crypto is just an investment like any other, such as stock or stock-based funds.  It is not.  Investing in crypto is somewhere between investing in a pyramid scheme and investing in a lottery.  The expected return on investment if positive for stocks in general, very negative for crypto.  It is mathematically obvious that most crypto investors, as well as the average investor, will lose their money.",2019-09-15 05:52:05
f09803j,Seccour,1,"Altcoin mean alternative coin. Aka anything other than Bitcoin. So the coin you're promoting an altcoin. And the fact that this unknown coin is not only promoted by you but by someone else in the comment is why I'm so offensive.

f094o1j,Mkkoll,1,"I've dabbled in Ethereum for a good 12 months now. I threw a few hundred quid in somewhere along the path to the top in early 2018 then got a bit more bullish early 2019. I've passively lurked and intermittently contributed to the reddit dailies and followed the general crypto news on and off in that time. 
 I've never taken this tech seriously enough. 

But now I think I know enough to understand that Ethereum is going to be THE block chain of the future. Most development momentum. High decentralisation. Active community. Dev leadership focussed on building with the correct philosophy. Aiming for more decentralisation and more individual financial and decision making freedom. Bitcoin wants this too. But it lacks forward thinking dev! It is stagnating and solidifying as a protocol in hopes to keep it a 'store of value'. 

Im going all in on Ethereum . Not financially but with my free time to expand my knowledge of the future of transactional interactions. I want to understand the tech more. I want to experiment with the dapps and find the ones that are truly killer. I want to participate in the forefront and bleeding edge of tech and be able to say in 5-10 years that i saw which way the wind was blowing in regards to this technology.

Some form of block chain is going to be operating  and central to human digital infrastructure in 200 years. And my instincts are it's roots are going to be from Ethereum. Mark my words.

f094x14,rjm101,1,"The dollar is only as good as the feds word and the market that prices it.

&gt;The dollar has close to a 100 year record of stability

You call a [\~96% devaluation of purchasing over this time](https://howmuch.net/articles/rise-and-fall-dollar) stable?

&gt;there's a guarantee against fraud and even the collapse of the bank (the  FDIC insures deposits).  You have nothing of the sort with a crypto  exchange.

Firstly the idea behind crypto is that you hold your private keys so that this wouldn't be a problem in the first place because there's no bank involved that would need bailing out or insuring. That being said some do use exchanges and foolishly just keep it on there with little protection in place in the event of hacks etc however some of the more reputable custodys like [Coinbase, BitGo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2019/09/05/lloyds-of-london-aon-and-others-poised-to-profit-from-cryptocurrency-hacker-insurance/) and [Bakkt](https://twitter.com/Bakkt/status/1171040208105758720?s=19) are insuring their holdings which is a good start.

&gt;The value of crypto has become so unstable

I've already shown you [Bitcoins volatility is falling](https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1165818215894663169). It hasn't become more unstable at all.

&gt;Instead it's morphed into an investment instrument, which is antithetical to what its inventor originally wanted.

If you read Satoshis comments he himself compares it to the likes of gold and a commodity rather than a currency as time went on. Perhaps he evolved his thinking on it or perhaps he didn't, we don't know however there are plenty of inventions in this world that ended up being used in very different ways than the they originally intended. Users always find the best use case and there isn't anything negative about it. 

In my opinion as the market matures and liquidity grows the volatility will die down. It will get to a point where Bitcoin is considered stable enough where people have amased these holdings as an initial investment but now that the large price increases are thing of the past and more support for it has amassed they will be more willing to spend it. This doesn't mean it will be suddenly dumped because it will still be better than holding traditional fiat currency because of its limited supply and continue to enable other things like easy cross border payments and be a censorship resistant form of money.

&gt;What good is bitcoin when you can't buy anything with it?

Even if we assume zero merchant adoption Bitcoin can still easily be spent using things like the [coinbase card](https://www.coinbase.com/card) or [tenx](https://tenx.tech/en/) which automatically converts the required Bitcoin to your local currency at the point of purchase.",2019-09-15 05:46:56

f09dr09,earthside,1,"I was venting to a coworker the other day about exactly the two conflicting constituencies you're talking about. But I've thought about it some more, and now where I used to see ""infrastructure-costs"" vs ""cash-like use cases"", all I see now are ""rational decisions"" vs ""irrational decisions"". As per game theory, the real genius of Bitcoin is that it's designed in a way that if all actors are rational, then miners', users' and developers' incentives and priorities would align, and everyone wins. Needless to say the crypto-space is full of irrational actors, and so the Bitcoin experiment continues.

Occasional irrational decisions are inevitable, and the conversation here is the effort to correct them. I'm not as pessimistic about this situation as much as other people are. The conversation happening here is happening exactly as one would expect on the Internet. This is how I'm interpretting this situation:

1. A lot of spam-like transactions happened on the BCH network. (Neutral)
2. Miners were found mining tiny blocks, resulting in a congested mempool. (Irrational)
3. Users (and probably some merchants various devs) got pissed at miners for mining tiny blocks and at devs for the 2MB default. (Rational)
4. [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) reacted by configuring to 32MB blocks in their mining pool. (Irrational based on previous data)
5. Amaury pointed out that configuring to 32MB constantly is a bad idea. (Rational based on previous data)
6. People interpretted that in the worst way possible as if Amaury was defending ""2MB"" specifically. (Irrational)
7. I'm now suggesting that that's not Amaury's point at all. He mentions merchants as first-class citizens, and never even tries to defend the 2MB default in the talk. (Hopefully rational)
8. Now I see you're proposing a target SLA of no more than 0.005% full blocks. (I'm still digesting it, but I'll get there)

This is a conversation. I suspect it will happen again. If these dialogs can persuade miners to use a systematic procedure to use rational parameters going forward, that would be great. This is not a dev issue as far as I can tell, although I find the 2MB default unnecessary. I think this is a miner issue. Both ""2"" and ""32"" are arbitrary numbers. ""20"" isn't arbitrary. The miners had better be rational actors based on this information.",2019-09-15 07:09:38

f0e7p3d,FinCentrixCircles,1,"Most of your argument for bitcoin's value hinges on it being censorship resistant, but what you fail to see is that censorship resistance is basically useless given it's public ledger. States have more than enough power in KYC/AML, exchanges and blockchain analysis to limit your ability to use Bitcoin without repercussions. 

Even in scenarios where the state isn't you adversary, such as when the Evolution dark market thieves were trying to wash their Bitcoin via the BTC-e exchange were turned away because their coins had been blacklisted (note this exchange finally closed because of money laundering, so was no friend to the state) were turned away--so even in a preposterous maximalist's dream world were everything runs on BTC, you'd still be beholden to having your decisions censored by anyone viewing the blockchain who didn't like your purchases or agree with your behavior (Note your behavior may even be brought up decades later similar to when celebrities are publicly shamed for behaviors normal in their era). I always find that people arguing that Bitcoin is censorship resistant haven't thought about it in a deep way as a public ledger makes your spending habits public domain and you don't want your financial history to be subject to the same public scrutiny as your social media accounts (not that you really want that either in many cases). 

TLDR: If your goal in censorship resistance, you want a private ledger. 

Also, the rise in mining difficulty doesn't thwart quantum computer attacks, it's well known the algorithm will need to change.",2019-09-16 01:18:20

f0lxbto,SmokeyMcB0ngwater,1,"""You think people are going to rush loot hotspots without a gamma with only a hatchet?"" Yes. That's what they will do. Backpack instead of a gamma. Running faster than you ever will with Fort armor and your tacticool m4. You'll never see them. Then, when you finally decide to extract, you'll be mowed down by the exfil campers that only brought a mosin and are still faster than you.

""One will certainly not hatchet run shoreline resort because one will get killed."" It's still the only low risk/high reward gameplay. ""Because one did not bring a gun therefore one will get dudu from that run"" Now you're literally only speculating survival rates, which is highly pathetic of such an esteemed employee of law.

""Even if you do loot that bitcoin, do you honestly think you will get past all the players, and worse yet, scavs safely on your way to extract?"" Yes. See how easy that was to answer? They're faster than you and your ""HARDCORE TACTICOOL ELITE REALISM"" build.

""Maybe sometimes you will get lucky, but you won't survive enough times for it be a viable option"" No risk/all reward makes it worth it every single time. Have fun only getting my dogtag. c;

""And yes, I might not get that bitcoin, but whoever kills you will"" Oh, okay, let's just encourage exfil camping even more. I'll just exfil camp and let you bring all that delicious loot to me instead of having to actually do any of the work c; That gas analyzer you had to find in raid? Now mine and anyone else smart enough to realize that the ""HARDCORE ELITE TACTICOOL REALISTIC"" squad will just do all the work for them and one well placed mosin round will allow you to take everything.

""No, instead if someone is actually forced to hatchet run, they will go for weapon boxes, ammo boxes...""

Wrong. Absolutely wrong. They will go for the bitcoin and get there first because, once again, they have nothing on them and will be faster than you. Once you finally arrive where they looted, they've already extracted and you're going to find nothing. Why go for ammo boxes and weapon boxes when they have no ammo and you have no way of storing magazines that are two slots or more? If anything, you'll have just a shit ton more hatchlings and in two forms now. You'll have the hatchlings that sprint to Marked room and leave, and now hatchlings who know that they can't keep ANYTHING they find, so they sit in a bush for 20 minutes to pick up weapons off of fallen scavs. What THRILLING gameplay you're encouraging.

""Oh my god all of a sudden we have money! No way! But wait, we actually had to think a figure out a strategy"" Yep. Sitting and camping to wait for everyone else to kill scavs, and/or rushing to loot heavy spots before anyone else can (since they have nothing on them). If you sincerely think that's complicated and dense strategy, then I bet coloring-by-numbers must be the equivalent to a SAT score to you.",2019-09-17 23:50:03

Triforce Coin is going to back their own tokens with MARP and silver they got and getting it set up legally before launching anything. So for now it's just an Erc20 token.",2019-09-18 07:46:37

f0n2uc6,bitusher,1,"under 18 how to buy BTC-

1) Ask your parents or another adult to help you. Most parents are reasonable if you come to them and say you want to work part time , make a budget , and save some fiat currency, invest in a IRA/stocks , and Buy some Bitcoin to make money for college or a future business.

2) Coinatmradar.com - If you have a cellphone , many atm's will allow you to buy with sms verification instead of ID verification (7-15% premium)

3) Localbitcoins.com, hodlhodl.com - Buy locally in person (7% + premium)

4) purse.io - Buy with credit or debit card or amazon points for 15%+ premium",2019-09-18 07:24:49
f0n4sqe,TheSultanOfSwagger,1,"Most of the BTC and ETH moved on chain by value is to self balance transfers. People and businesses moving funds between their own wallets. On top of that, you have no way to know what people are actually sending and what is change. The other big contributor is moving funds between exchanges and mining payouts. None of this is real economic activity, it‚Äôs just part of making Bitcoin work.

LN might only have 800 BTC in channels, but that is more than enough to be making a lot of real purchases. I spend LN on Bitrefill all the time. I pay to read articles on sites like yalls.org and various clones. I pay people in person with LN for goods and services. The total number of transactions is way more interesting than the total value of transactions. It is the number of transactions that is relevant to scaling and real world use. LN is still really early tech that very few businesses have adopted and it is already very successful. 

Wallet of Satoshi which just recently became generally available on iOS and Android tweeted in August that they passed the 100,000 transaction mark. As I mentioned, LN is the second most common payment method on Bitrefill. As more services support LN the transaction numbers will only grow, and unlike BTC and ETH, there is no transaction throughput limit.

It doesn‚Äôt matter how many resteraunts in Europe accept BTC or ETH. If people actually started trying to pay with crypto the fees would skyrocket. Eventually the payment processors will support LN and then everyone will actually be able to buy lunch with crypto. Globee and CoinGate (2 of the biggest BitPay competitors) already support LN.",2019-09-18 07:48:57
f0n2zw9,brianddk,1,"Your state (Washington) has decided that they want any company touching bitcoin to get a license.  Each license can cost a ton of money and not every company may want to pay the legal fees and licensing fees.

You will need to start researching all the companies that are licensed to turn Bitcoin into USD in your state.  Sorry you have to deal with it.

I'd try r/binance, r/kraken, r/gemini, r/coinbase, r/localbitcoins, r/mycellium

Good luck...",2019-09-18 07:26:39
f0n3dny,mikenard77,1,"Volume is not always a direct correlation to price. You can say the same for many assets from 2017, even bitcoin( volume is higher now than at 20k). Just because its meant to be used as a bridge currency doesn't change anything, the asset still needs to be held by someone at all times. 

transactions on ripple net are private, its not a blockchain.. when they use xrapid, xrp is simply sent between two exchange accounts on the xrp ledger, nothing else is visible. Even if they use xrp without xrapid, you would just see xrp being moved between random accounts on ledger ( in many cases custody accounts), to further that they would likely be  using payment channels, which  means that's 10000 transactions can show up as one transaction on ledger.",2019-09-18 07:31:18
f0n51wi,UsernameIWontRegret,1,Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin is only amazing if you bought in early. But if you're now looking to make money you've long since missed the boat.

&gt;  Efecto Letes: por primera vez desde las PASO subieron los dep√≥sitos en d√≥lares  El Cronista- [Imagen de MARIANO¬†GORODISCH](https://www.cronista.com/export/system/cmsMedios/users/u20170530_124753530.png_1590972484.png)
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; El viernes Hacienda pag√≥ un vencimiento de Letes por al menos u$s 165 millones, que 17% estaba en manos de fondos locales y no se inform√≥ qu√© cifra ten√≠an las personas f√≠sicas. Pero sin dudas fue el efecto de ese pago lo que provoc√≥ que, por primera vez desde las PASO, aumentaran los dep√≥sitos en d√≥lares, aunque apenas u$s 16 millones, al pasar de u$s 22.561 millones el jueves a u$s 22.577 millones el viernes, √∫ltima cifra oficial disponible.
&gt; 
&gt; Claro que hay un circuito para el pago de Letes: primero el Tesoro le paga a Caja de Valores, Caja a las Alycs o bancos y √©stos a los clientes. A las sociedades de bolsa les acreditaron a eso de las dos de la tarde. Si un comitente quiere sus d√≥lares se los deben transferir a su cuenta de banco. Si son muchos que piden lo mismo van a la fila. En el caso de los comitentes con tenencia en bancos, es posible que el sistema les acredite tarde.
&gt; 
&gt; Lo cierto es que dos meses antes de las PASO los dep√≥sitos privados en d√≥lares hab√≠an crecido casi u$s 2000 millone, hasta alcanzar un r√©cord de u$s 32.578 millones, ya que los ahorristas usaban la caja de ahorro como una suerte de caja de seguridad gratis, compraban divisas a trav√©s de home banking y no iban a retirarlas.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero desde el cisne negro del lunes 12 de agosto, los ahorristas retiraron u$s 10.000 millones, el equivalente a m√°s del 30% del total, aunque el ritmo ahora cay√≥ al m√≠nimo, pues el retiro es de u$s 150 millones diarios, frente al r√©cord de m√°s de u$s 1000 millones en un solo d√≠a.
&gt; 
&gt; Miguel Zielonka, director de Econviews, cree que los dep√≥sitos van a seguir cayendo, aunque idealmente a menor ritmo si no hay nuevas sorpresas: ""No veo que el nivel de dep√≥sitos en d√≥lares llegue a cero, pues hay institucionales que no se pueden ir y tambi√©n hay un monto peque√±o transaccional que los individuos retienen en los bancos. Tal vez los dep√≥sitos privados lleguen a u$s 15.000 millones justo antes del cambio de Gobierno. Se basa en que est√°n saliendo u$s 150 millones por d√≠a, y multiplica esa cifra por 20 d√≠as h√°biles por mes. Por dos meses y medio, dar√≠a una ca√≠da de u$s 7500 millones sobre el nivel actual de u$s 22.500 millones.
&gt; 
&gt; Gustavo Neffa, director de Research for Traders, analiza que esta reacci√≥n es un poco el miedo que tiene el mercado al sesgo de las pol√≠ticas que el Albertismo podr√≠a aplicar: ""Pero como a√∫n no se sabe cu√°les ser√°n, por lo cual quiz√°s est√©n exagerados los miedos. Lo cierto es que el problema est√° centrado en la solvencia del Estado, y se est√° trasladando a la solvencia del sistema bancario que ven√≠a muy bien capitalizado, rentable y sin mora hace un a√±o atr√°s"".
&gt; 
&gt; Para el consultor financiero Mart√≠n Mazzeo, el ritmo de salida de capitales depende de tres factores: ""El endurecimiento de los controles genera fuga, el cambio vertiginoso en las normas aumenta la velocidad de salida, y la incertidumbre con respecto a la reestructuraci√≥n de la deuda profundiza la salida de capitales"".

f0nugi5,Zelulose,1,"Sorry, I meant tangle. In fact, Tangle is the only thing that can do this. The amount of computing power that would be needed on block-chain is too great. But the reason is that a decentralized trading platform that is free will start as a crypto swap exchange and eventually grab a future of tokenized stocks or assets. There will be noone profiting. No market manipulation from a big exchange just regular true free market's. By being fee free and using crypto's like IOTA with no transaction fee, amazing arbitrage trades can be made which will stabilize the global economy and speed up the coins adoption as it is swapped with other coins and spread around.

This kind of exchange would be as difficult to create as a multiwallet/cryptocurrency. But once made, it would end private exchanges slowly as more of decentralized exchanges would start to pop up to deal with corrupt exchanges like forex or crypto pump and dump companies like binance. For example, If is hard to buy IOTA from Europe but it would be easy to swap bitcoin from a European for IOTA. But right now binance controls most of the IOTA supply in one direction. They sell the coin and they don't buy it. It is hard to find other sellers for this coin that is not expensive unless you join an exchange which also has a withdrawal fee making the coin hard for individuals to want in their own wallet. Binance is like forex. Price manipulation and a deceptively low spread that adds up quickly. The decentralized coin swap would open doors for adoption and arbitrage and reduce market manipulation and government control. If anyone made it for this coin the fee less nature of the coin would make it more valuable than any coin and speed up its adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

\-companies are the gateway to crypto access and manipulation.

\-governments can regulate companies.

\-0 fee decentralized exchanges with transaction free currency create a free market outside of company or government control.

\-This paves the way for the first free version decentralized ""NYSE"" in a future world of tokenized shares and the end of market makers.",2019-09-18 13:33:42

But please read my listing thoroughly and know what type of thing you‚Äôre looking for before messaging. Thank you! üòá

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Who I am:** Fiona üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm married, I‚Äôm hot, AND I have a great personality. I like to joke around and tease you; I don‚Äôt take things too seriously and I enjoy a friendly and easy conversation/ transaction. You will love working with me, I guarantee it! I‚Äôm a pole dancer so I‚Äôm in really good shape and I‚Äôm flexible af. I‚Äôve been told on several occasions that I am the best experience someone has had on Reddit and that their money was well spent! So, there‚Äôs that ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**My Domme Personality:** I am a SENSUAL DOMME! My natural Domme style is *very* much like Ceara Lynch (it‚Äôs uncanny, actually). I do enjoy CBT and wearing a strap-on, but aside from that, I‚Äôm only sort of into tasks or physical humiliation. I LOVE the verbal and psychological side of things. Additionally, I am versatile in my approach and I really enjoy catering my style to my subs. If you desire a bitchy and bratty Domme, a more nurturing Domme, a more seductive Domme...that is exciting to me and I will 100% deliver on all fronts üíã

**Vanilla/Sub Personality** Well I‚Äôm just myself, and I am a COCK TEASE! üòÅ I would change my Reddit username to that in a heartbeat if I could. I will get nakie though as long as you pay my fee for it! During a session, I will masturbate over or in my undies and will make a lot of noise (moaning etc.)but I won‚Äôt be setting up the camera in front of my naked pussy and letting you watch me finger myself, for example. Sorry boys! I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable with it due to my relationship status. Don‚Äôt let that deter you from contacting me though, I‚Äôve never had a complaint. U will LOVE the way I tease!!! Trust me üëÖ

**What I DO NOT offer:**

* Classic Sexting with no Domination or BDSM / Roleplay involved. (For example: your cock is making me wet and I‚Äôm fingering myself thinking about you.) this type of sexting is just not my bag at all lol. 

* Explicit Masturbation (naked pussy with fingering, toys) 

**PS. I ALWAYS SHOW MY FACE!!!!**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

**KINKY SHIT**

* Findom, Homewrecking, Cuckolding, Humiliation, Degredation, SPH, Sissification, Foot, Ass, Titty Worship, Chastity Play, Pee videos, Pegging, Toe Sucking/ Sniffing, SPH, Bi/Gay Exposure, CEI, Forced Bi/Gay, Pet Play, Giantess, Squashing, CBT, Pervy Play‚Ä¶.Don‚Äôt see something you like listed here? Ask me! I‚Äôm probably open to it. (No poop stuff tho)

**Submissive Kinks** - I am also okay with VERY LIGHT SUBMISSIVE STUFF. IE calling you Daddy, spanking, asking you if you like my outfit, wearing a butt plug (i have a few tails and jewels) being your little princess, Dildo Blowjob, Gagging, Swallowing, etc. this is a VERY light kink, and I‚Äôd like to mention that for these sessions, I prefer directions over any type of sexting. If you have any questions about this or want to run a scenario by me, please do. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I understand that simply running a node has little impact on the security of the network other than providing a few more geographically dispersed copies of the ledger and some network routing capacity.

The thing that triggered this line of enquire was listening to this excellent interview with Eric Voskuil  https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/tales-from-the-crypt-a-bitcoin-podcast/id1292381204?i=1000449414723 

He mentions the probable trend is increasing threshold for onchain transaction sizes and by supposition, reduced use of full nodes by individuals transacting through their full node.

The economic activity I mentioned is the transactional activity (either low size and high volume, or high size and low volume) https://twitter.com/giacomozucco/status/1174446232334475264?s=21.

As the network evolves to higher onchain transaction fees with less low size, high volume transactions taking place the transactions for smaller amounts will migrate to second layers.

This ultimately leaves progressively higher size, lower volume transaction onchain. In this scenario the players undertaking these transactions will be entities that will likely care less about ledger size and bandwidth costs.",2019-09-19 07:33:05

f0pwnnj,adventuringraw,1,"today I learned about emergent coding. Looks like a whole lot of hype that won't work in the real world. As for any idealistic silicone valley bullshit about this technology changing the world and helping people in the new economy, in general, I have yet to see the gig economy do anything other than create yet another breakdown of worker protections. Uber/Lyft sure as shit hasn't exactly led to a Utopian change.

That said, from a purely ML perspective, at some point in the (distant) future when there are methods for generating code to fulfill some task, a paradigm like this could be useful as a way of thinking about how to disassemble programs into sub-components and (ultimately) writing/reusing code into large scale projects. There was a cool paper on reinforcement learning using typical model-free approaches to learning motor programs, then a higher level scheduler to use those low level programs to accomplish goals. At best I can see this conception of emergent code in the same light as bitcoin... some promising technology turned into a giant speculative bubble without actually being able to fulfill on the original practical real world purpose.",2019-09-19 08:27:16

f0svecw,MattAbrams,2,"I've been looking into how the new Binance Lending ([https://www.binance.com/en/lending](https://www.binance.com/en/lending)) works.

From what I see, it sounds too good to be true.  Why am I in the mining business working 7 days a week if I could just sell 100 bitcoins into Tether, and earn a salary of $100,000/yr by doing absolutely nothing?  There has to be a catch here.

Is the catch that Binance has ""socialized losses"" that they pass onto customers in the case of price swings?  Even if they do that, how likely are price swings for a stablecoin?  Is it that Binance doesn't insure its funds, so that if someone steals the money the lenders are out of luck?  Is it that people have to worry about Bitfinex's solvency for Tether too?

The next idea I had is that this sounds like some sort of ponzi scheme, promising impossible returns when CDs are barely breaking 2% and interest rates are going down every day.  But this isn't some no-name company, it's one of the largest exchanges in the world.

What am I missing about this product?  If it's this easy, why are people making hundreds of posts every day, most of them losing money trying to trade bitcoins?  Why worry about bitcoin going under when you could just let others deal with that and get a constant 10%?",2019-09-20 01:41:12

f0sild7,rapidak,1,"Loved the speech, not too long but on point. My take from this, and my overall view on the market today would probably be this - 

We are currently focused on the ""crypto"" market, when you talk with anyone about Bitcoin, Vechain, or any other project, we are talking about crypto. However, what we really should talk about, or what we should evolve to, is the ""blockchain"" market. The point of being a currency is just one of the uses, mostly taken up by daddy bitcoin, but overall we should be focusing on the fact that this is about blockchain, not only about currency.

Blockchain is much more than a currency. Bitcoin took the idea of block chain, and put a currency around it. It has its ideals and principles, most argue that the point is an independant financial system out of the hands and reach of banks and governments, power to the people, control your own money. Bitcoin took this idea and developed and spread it over a course of 10 years to get to where it is today. But that is just one use of blockchain technology. That use case took 10 years to develop. 

Now, lets imagine that a different, corporate/business oriented use for blockchain is developed for 10 years. That has a much bigger reach imo, but even if it had ""only"" the same reach as the currency use case, can you imagine where it will be, where Vechain will be, after 10 years of development? It was only two or three years ago that Bitcoins worth was in the hundreds, and going up to thousands was unprecedented. The rise in value was exponential, once it took off, it really took off. 1 dollar to 10 dollars is a 10x. 10 to 100 is another 10x. 100 to 1000 another 10x. And then 1000 to 10000. Imagine what is coming, 10000 to 100000?

If we apply this same exponential growth to other blockchain uses, the possibilities are endless. Yes on tenth of a cent times ten, one cent. Ok. Then 1 cent to 10. Then 10 to a dollar, a dollar to 10 dollars, 10 to a 100. Once it gets going, it goes fast. We are simply too early. I honestly believe that the enterprise use of blockchain can be a bigger use case than what I call the ""currency"" use case which is the dominant  and leading one, for now. Overall I think Sunny and co are on the right track, Vechain is going places. We are still in phase one, and we need to be patient. The jumps from one phase, ie from tenths of a cent to cents, and from cents to dollars, will be fast and abrupt. Right now its all about positioning yourself for that jump. It might still be a while till we get there (my honest opinion is 2021 after Btc has finished its 2020 moon mission), but its coming.",2019-09-20 00:05:20

##Skype Shows

It's been a while since I offered cam shows, but for a limited time only I will be available for live cam shows done over Skype!!!! Each show is subject to individual pricing, but the general pricing is as follows:


* Clothed chat - $5/min

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! üòâ

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun

f0x61jy,pseudonympholepsy,1,"Interesting thing about sidechains is that they can be compared to all of the blockchains that were built on the same codebase as Bitcoin. Litecoin is almost a direct copy of Bitcoin, with a couple of modifications. Once Bitcoin was up and running and especially since it had huge sums of money thrown at the network... it had to develop in a more conservative manner. It needed stability and the devs couldn't be scrupulous; the had to take into consideration how every little change might affect x y z. 

Litecoin and other Bitcoin spinoffs could experiment more. They could be crazier and adopt wild ideas. Whereas Bitcoin had to remain ""boring"".

Because of the similarity in the codebase, Bitcoin could often directly adopt the changes made in Litecoin, etc. once these had been proven to work/improve upon something. Every single Bitcoin replica that made changes to the original code became testbeds for the improvement of the original Bitcoin project.

Sidechains are also evolving more frivolously... they are making changes to governance, to inflation and so on. The side/sisterchains that run on EOSIO software become testbeds for the first EOS network. Key difference being, that EOS was built with this is mind. We want as many competing side/sisterchains as possible. The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is going to connect all of them and they will all work together in unison.

f0wdteg,cbct73,1,"&gt; I don't see how cash-settled futures can win the long game if the majority of market participants accumulate with strong hands...

**If** is the key word here. We can hope, but is not clear that it will play out this way.

The comparison with Comex gold futures might be useful. There you also have the option of taking physical delivery, but very few people actually use it. Since it is fairly typical that derivatives market volume exceeds spot market volume by a large multiple as a market matures, the CME market could become highly influential, as long as people are willing to trade 'paper' bitcoin at the same price as 'physical' bitcoin.

It will come down to consumer preference. Let's hope the bitcoin narrative leads to a strong preference for 'physical' bitcoin, at least for long term investors. It has to become *cool* to own physical. (Small talk on Wall Street: ""I just added bitcoin to my portfolio."" ""Which kind? Did you get the real one, or just the paper one?"")",2019-09-21 03:45:40

I love teasing vanilla mutual masturbation sessions where I strip and torment you before fucking myself. I also love being a domme goddess. Either way, I'm not submissive and don't take orders.

Some of the fetishes that I enjoy are masturbation/orgasm control, body worship, JOI, humiliation, forced anal, begging, sissification, cuckolding, CEI and findom.

**Custom Video Rates.**

Starting at..

5 min. $65

Price may be influenced by content and length.

**Other Important Info:**

\- I charge 5$ extra for outfit requests. I also charge an additional 5$ PER any alterations to makeup or hairstyle or shoes.

Currently I usually start shows in just a low cut tank top/Tshirt and

panties or lingerie or i cycle through different types of lingere each day. If you want a little more, I offer

lots of different lingerie, sports wear, or normal clothes and shoes. But im always wearing something sexy.

\- I also Charge a 5$ increase per 10 mins on group shows as they require more organization and prep on my end.

\- I do not start my shows naked.

\- I have a standing rule that I call 'Three Strikes, you are out' Which means, I do not keep clients on my list

who pry, or make repeated contact but no payment, time wasters or rudeness. I understand things happen and

sometimes arrangements don't work out.. But i also think three chances is plenty. If after three chances you

find yourself unable to contact me and are unsure why, In all likeliness you have been blocked. This also applies

to clients who have paid before/have become regulars. The only way to become unblocked is to submit a payment

through my ad, (including your skype ID) and then i will unblock you and contact you for a show to avoid wasted time.

\- I also BLOCK without warning for the following reasons....Calling without payment, Unsolicited pictures,

dishonesty about payment, and asking for free shows, pictures etc. If you find yourself unable to contact

me after having done any of these things, Please follow the steps above in my 'Three Strikes, you are out'

Rule to become unblocked. Although you may earn the privilege to be unblocked, previous offenders are kept

on very short leashes and second time offenders are never forgiven. We are all adults, so act like it.

\- I always show as online on Skype because i am signed in on multiple devices to make reaching me easier.

If you message me I will get back to you as soon as possible. I however, do not always respond, as i may be

in a show or unavailable. The best way to reach me is messaging me immediately when you are ready to pay for

a show. I can't guarantee times and i don't really work on a schedule.

\- If you submit a payment without talking to me first, the show will be given at a time convenient for both

me and the client.

**By adding me on skype you are agreeing to these terms and understand that i am providing a service upon a**

Eurodollars are US dollars held within the european banking system - 'european' + 'dollars' = eurodollars.  When european institutional investors put on the eurocarry trade from above, either the loan holder, the comm bank or the investment bank will need to hold USD as a liquidity buffer to the loans held.

f0wcru0,ssvb1,1,"&gt; can you point to any BCH holder

Many people used to be BCH holders simply because BCH got airdropped on them. And some of them are still BCH holders if they never bothered to split and sell their coins yet.

&gt; who uses the term Bcash? Because all I see is the haters using the Bcash term.

You are either an altruist who sacrifices everything for the greater good (I don't know anyone like this).  or you are self interested (first basic concept of modern economics).  I don't think bitcoin spawned out of altruism.  It spawned out of distrust of the modern financial system.  There are /were those who stood to make alot of money should their ideas succeed.  That's the opposite of altruism.,2019-09-21 03:34:52

f1155d0,PhantomFortune,5,"Ratio gained 38% over the last 2 weeks. We are down 4%. It's O.K. It is normal to give back some on the way up. I see the ratio increasing on a bitcoin downward break.

Here's why.

BTC needs to fall 8.5% from current prices to make a new low. That **should** bring on dumping as it searches for its next support. ETH would need to fall 22% from current prices to make a new low. There's no reason for people to panic sell eth before then. ETH still has support levels at 200, and another at ~186. While bitcoin went sideways for 3 months, ETH bled out, along with the other altcoins. IMO, they already had their suffering, and they will gain on their ratio with a bitcoin drop.",2019-09-22 12:00:05

f13mb9p,concernedcustomer33,3,"One of my favorite indicators is MVRV for Bitcoin.  It provodes a sense of whether the average holder is in profit or loss.  When it's well above 1, most people are sitting on gains; when it's well below 1, most people are underwater.  In the log scale view, the long term MVRV chart makes it clear that swings are damping out over time, and that cycles bear remarkable similarity to one another, even as there are obvious differences.  

Right now, the big question is whether BTC is about to break up or down from its descending triangle.  I see a lot of similarity between now and early Feb 2012, and one could make a case for similarity with both early Aug 2015 and early Feb 2016.  In the first two cases, a sharp but brief dump was imminent; in the last, it was about to go up for almost two years.  I'm on mobile, so my apologies for the lack of markup in this chart.  

The ETHBTC ratio is looking good.  I expect another push up to the range I mentioned previously.  Even if BTC dumps, that should cushion things a bit.  Good things are coming our way.  Be patient.

It's the curse of being a fast typer. I end up writing small books for all of my replies. Use cases I understand in general for smart contracts, I just have concerns about Ethereum being the winner of the smart contract platform game is all. To me it's the Bitcoin problem again, they've gone with the miner model and so they have in-built incentives to maintain that status quo due to miner investment, and so really really big core protocol changes are hard to happen. I know VB is pushing for PoS which is a positive, but we'll see what happens. Won't be surprised if that never sees the light because I don't imagine it ending well when all of the people who invested in ETH mining gear have dead investments.

In that event, you woudn't even need exchanges. People could get paid in bitcoin, do their spending in bitcoin, and no exchange would need to be used in the process.

Now the BTC community hinges their hopes on their asset being permitted on exchanges, because that's the only channel for liquidity. Without retail and ""small casual payments"" ([from the white paper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)), it is a speculative asset dominated by centralized exchanges and dependent on permission from gatekeepers like the SEC, and not a permissionless currency.",2019-09-22 13:37:41

f110169,aminok,2,"&gt;Whether you like it or not, BTC has been the pillar that the rest of the crypto market has built itself upon.

Bitcoin is the pillar that the crypto market was built on. Post-2017-BTC is not Bitcoin. It barely resembles what originally inspired the cryptocurrency movement, which can still be seen in the archives:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20150212094459/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability](https://web.archive.org/web/20150212094459/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability)

The new BTC doesn't hold any promise of giving the world financial self-sovereignty. With a limit of 300,000 txs per day, 99% of the world population will never be able to own BTC with their own keys. That's just a mathematical reality, that no empty promises about L2 tricks like LN can negate.

Memes alone are not a sturdy foundation for value, and provide no empowerment to the population the way actual cryptocurrency adoption and utilization can.

Approved ETF's tend to pump the hell out of any market.


Though, you're right that Bitcoin will still rise in value. We just may need to wait longer for that ETF pump. Plus, the more corrupt they are in their decisions, the more attractive Bitcoin becomes and this whole ETF resistance is clearly more veiled corruption. 


The only way Bitcoin will be destroyed or permanently suppressed is if our financial systems decide to make it as fair as possible for the average individual. A system that would work for the people instead of working to take from the people. I don't see that happening anytime soon and I suspect things will only continue to get worse from here. This is what Bitcoin was designed for and the main driver of it's value and even speculative value. It's a monetary system built for the people by the people.

There are methods that Nexus uses to make it less suspect to quantum computers, but it's still using a signature scheme that's not quantum resistant, and therefor wouldn't be able to claim that they are quantum resistant/secure (and to their credit, they likely don't because that would be a pretty big misuse of terminology).

f160mua,Videlicet8,5,"Let's start with the basics, and from those, I hope to shed some veracity on this conversation. Firstly, I created Nexus, and was working on solving issues in quantum resistance back in 2014 before this ever became a FAD. Let's look at the basis of the meaning of this word:

""The field of quantum-safe cryptography, also called post-quantum or quantum-resistant cryptography, aims to construct public key cryptosystems that are believed to be secure even against quantum computers. Ongoing advancements in physics point toward the eventual construction of large-scale quantum computers.""

So, according to this definition, being quantum resistant is based solely around using cryptography that has no known post quantum attacks. Based on this definition, let's look at the cryptography we use:

1. **SK** \- Skein-1024 and Keccak-1600, combined together into a single root hash. Used for hashing all public keys, blocks, and transactions. This provides 256-bit to 512-bit quantum resistance against grover's algorithm.

2. **Argon2** \- Password hashing algorithm, with variable time complexity and memory requirements for the generation of private keys in a signature chain, providing brute force resistance to ASIC's, FPGA's, GPU's. This is quantum resistant up to 256-bits, assuming quantum memory is available in the next two decades.

3. **FALCON** \- Fast Fourrier Compact Signatures over NTRU, or in other words, Lattice Based cryptography, using the NTRU Lattice, which is quantum resistant 

4. **Brainpool512** \- Provably random ECDSA with 512-bit output length, which currently is NOT quantum resistant with the requirement to break it due to the output length, would be 3,700 qubits, compared to 1792 qubits for any other cryptocurrency.

Currently speaking, FALCON is an optional setting, that, with the click of a button, upgrades your entire wallet to use post-quantum cryptography. This means, that at any time, for no risk, a user is able to choose to protect their signature chain with improved cryptography. Any previous keys in their sigchain are already discarded, but, if attacked with a quantum computer, they provide nothing of value to the signature chain. This means, that out of the 4 functions mentioned above, 3 are quantum resistant. 

**So how is this fourth function protected?**

By the design of a signature chain, think of it like a personal blockchain of your transactions, where the end of this chain is appended with new transactions, in sequential order. Before this transaction is made, there is no reveal of public keys, only what is termed a ""Next Hash"". The way one gains access to a signature chain is two-fold:

1. They reveal the public key that created this next hash

2. They provide a valid digital signature (whether FALCON or Brainpool depends on sigchain configuration)

How does this protect Brainpool512 in the event someone decides to not use FALCON?

Let's look at the hypothetical scenario displayed above, where a MITM attack is what is being used as the basis for the argument that we are not quantum resistant. Let me start by reminding everyone that man in the middle attacks have nothing to do with cryptography, what they have to do with is someone ""eavesdropping"" on you, and capturing your packets and then forwarding those to the remote. For an attacker to be able to create this scenario above, they would need to have complete control of the user's internal network. 

Let's assume this user is absolutely under a MITM attack, how do we protect against this? We use encryption from end to end nodes, and authentication on the network protocol. What does this mean?

**In order to successfully pull off a MITM attack, you would need to control the sigchain of every single node that the user is connected to. Why?**

We keep a hash in each node's crypto object register, that is a hash of the certificate being used for SSL. This means, that the attacker cannot pretend to be this other node, as the blockchain becomes the certificate authority.

Next, we provide additional protection against this type of attack, by requiring authentication before a node will accept any meaningful data. This authentication message is signed by another key in the crypto object register, that can in itself, be either key 3 or 4 mentioned above. In order to successfully authenticate a connection as a MITM attacker, they would need to gain access to another key that would not be made available to them (since this key itself is not public knowledge). 

So let's recap, assuming as a prerequisite that your WiFi is already hacked by this attacker, and also assuming the attacker has a 3800 qubit quantum computer running the Proos-Zalka algorithm (a form of Shor's), and that this user has not clicked a button that upgrades them to post quantum cryptography:

1. Man in the Middle attacker needs to first: brute force user's certificate key by first brute forcing the hash that creates it, or waiting until the user's node sends it out in a key exchange. They cannot create their own certificate like a normal MITM attack, since the blockchain acts as the certificate authority.

2. Then attacker needs to: brute force user's authentication key by brute forcing the hash that created it. They could also wait for an authentication message, and attempt to offline break this public key to forge an authentication message. 

3. Then attacker needs to break the remote node's authentication key (assuming they can forge signatures on every open connection which is 16+ nodes, and that the remote node is not already using FALCON).

4. Then, they would need to wait for the user to create a transaction, to have their public key revealed, and in less that 500ms, break this public key. Yes, less than 500ms. Why? Because this user would already be connected to many nodes.

Okay, so, in this hypothetical scenario that seems to be the basis of arguments against our quantum resistance (despite that most of our cryptography is quantum resistant), there is little to no chance this attack would be successful? Why?

**We consider the most valid transaction the one that nodes received first.**

Let me explain how this works:

The most valid transaction is the one nodes received over the network first. With the internet round trip time taking roughly 200ms, this is your average packet propagation time. This means this attacker would have this much time to break this public key, if the user decided even with the public threat of quantum computers that they want to continue to use brainpool.

**Okay, last recap:**

1. We use 4 types of cryptography, in which 3 of them are quantum resistant

2. In order to MITM attack, an attacker would need a very large quantum computer, have control of a user's Wifi, and break a lot of public keys to hope they can fake connections with nodes.

3. If number 2 is successful, and the user has not enabled post quantum cryptography, the attacker would then need to wait for the public key to be revealed in the transaction, and, in less than 500 ms (being generous), forge a new transaction (which is computationally infeasible even with a quantum computer, because Argon2 at current settings takes 1000ms to create a transaction and 64MB of RAM), and then hope that they are able to shoehorn their transaction into every other node's memory pool, with none of them receiving the user's transaction first.

**So is Nexus Quantum Resistant?**

Basing strictly on the definition, yes, 75% of our cryptography has no known post quantum vulnerabilities. As you can see, it's becoming quite a logical fallacy to make up these pie in the sky scenarios, just to attack Nexus and say we aren't quantum resistant, that's like saying Bitcoin is insecure because I can theoretically buy all the ASIC's in the world and try to 51% attack the network. There is a point where the resistance to attack far exceeds anyone's capabilities or resources to attack it, which is generally where technology is considered safe.

Well, I hope that this gives other people some insight into our technology, and how we have been approaching  the threat of quantum computers since the project was formed in 2014. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

f18x9dz,Keefryan,5,"FROM ANOTHER SITE :

Can we please stop these Quantum Computer spams going around recently all over the forum? There are numerous topics regarding ""Can bitcoin be destroyed using QC?"" and people making the same posts over and over again. As of now, the Quantum computers would prove a threat when people tend to reuse the same addresses over and over again for receiving the coins. On such instances, public key of the bitcoin address might be figured out which with the help of QC can be helpful in displaying the private keys.

Currently there are no real ways or ideas where a QC can break through the SHA256 function and find out a public key but OTOH a future QC can break a public key cryptography and reveal the private key. The QC pose a threat for PKC type of algorithms but they cannot break the hash functions and if they come nearer to them, we can certainly double up the bit sizes. QC require around 1500 qubits to crack the ECDSA algorithm and the current working IBM Q System One has only 20 quantum bit. So it might take around 10-20 years for a quantum computer to reach at least 1000 quantum bits.But at least our bitcoin developers would find a way to adopt Bitcoin with Post-Quantum Cryptography techniques.

The recent Google's Quantum Supremacy is said to have an array of only 54 qbits which is only 2.7 times the qbits developed by IBM Q. When we find out a possible way to break ECDSA, we would be adopting for the post-quantum cryptography. Security Engineers and Hackers are always same and neither of them can win the game of security always. For instance, if a hacker exploits a system the security expert finds out a way to minimize the vulnerability at the earliest.

I've seen a few people argue that BTC is an excellent SoV because it's up thousands of percent in 5 years. But that makes zero sense to me..

Leading up to the insanity of December 2017 and it hitting $19k, Bitcoin was being speculated on being THE global digital currency...it's massive rise in price was almost purely based on that speculation. At the same time it was proven that the fees to transact on Bitcoin once the network was filling up were far too high to be used as a global currency (they were averaging $50 a transaction at the time!)..

So then it became a 'Store of Value'... The market for Bitcoin has completely changed and it's not being bought to be used as a new global currency to replace fiat.. nobody is going to be using it to buy coffee. Since it has become a SoV it has had only 7 months out of the last 21 months (since Dec 17) where it has been trading above $10k.. so how does that at all prove that it is a viable SoV?? You cannot use it's rise on speculation of it being a currency as proof that it is a SoV. That makes zero sense to me. And even lately the price fell from 13500 to 9500 in a couple of monhs. How does a SoV lose 25% value in 2 months and still be referred to as a SoV?.. Because maxis will argue that it was once $200. Ridiculous.

I'm hugely grateful what Bitcoin brought to us. It may have a future somehow..but I really can't see it. It's not upgradable and it's usage gets worse over time as issuance is reduced and miners have to rely on fees for the network to survive..where do those fees come from if it is too expensive to use?

If the limit was set at 1MB, that is the correct answer as far as it goes...

&gt; Let's not pretend that the whole of the world can magically get everything together. For every billion people to work out exactly the same, they need to run the entire industry at high speed and that's just to get to the point where they can.

This is exactly how we think Bitcoin works.

The network gets stronger the more it is adopted and less it will be lost. Because of this, there is a finite number of Bitcoins that will be created and there are many factors which limit the number of Bitcoins that will be created.",2019-09-25 00:01:35
f1blqee,Anen-o-me,1,"&gt;Gold has value for its intrinsic properties. 

Name an intrinsic property that makes gold a good money and you'll find that good crypto has the same intrinsic property. This is what I'm talking about. And btw, tangibility isn't one of them. 

&gt;~~It's tangible~~

No one cares if money is tangible, the dollar has been mostly digital for decades.

&gt;and scarce in nature, 

But again, as I pointed out, it's true scarcity is overstated, and through asteroid mining in the next few decades the supply of gold will rise tremendously.

This is not true of bitcoin whose true scarcity is known precisely.

&gt; It's been used as money for thousands of year, so we can measure the value of it.

It hasn't been used as an exchange money in my and your lifetime. Neither of us have likely ever bought anything at a store with gold.

&gt;Bitcoin has to rely on its price to function as money. 

What does this even mean. Gold has a price too, ya know.

&gt;It's a brand new concept that was created from computer code, and has a cost to maintain stability of the system (mining operations); so there's not going to be a widely accepted price the market can agree upon.

That's a silly conclusion. It's still in price discovery mode because it's new. This doesn't mean it won't one day fund a very stable price, especially if it becomes widely demanded.",2019-09-25 00:05:53

f1f21h8,mcmuncaster,1,"There's no real such thing as a SoV by your definition - because no asset is pegged to everything else. All of them fluctuate, gold fluctuates, silver does, real estate does...they all go up and down. Stocks go up and down, but you put your wealth into the stock market. Any wealth advisor will have levels of risk based on time horizons - you might need the money in 3 year vs. 5 then they will make different recommendations then 20 or 30.  Most HODL'ers advocate a 3+ 5+ 10+ time horizon (they use the term low time preference) and in that regard daily moves don't faze them as much as length of bear/bull markets.    

Medium of exchange however is a different story. Mom and pop who buy the safest of the safe investments (tbills) would never accept a payment in a thing that varied by 10% in front of their eyes - the exchange risk is too high.  

   

   

Until Bitcoin quits having these wild swings it will never succeed as a payment mechanism - except by speculators who are equally ready to take on massive risk. I get paid in Bitcoin, and in some cases that can mean I made 3K in a week, but only 2K for the week shortly thereafter....that is not friendly to a payment network.   The price will only get more stable when it has sufficient economic mass that someone selling 100M in Bitcoin won't move the market, nor will someone buying 100M of Bitcoin. We need the price to go up if we want it to have price stability, and we need price stability if we want it to be a MoE",2019-09-26 03:16:21

f1f4tf1,Kp4200,1,There are good carts what are people talking about? Just make sure to buy it from the dispensary. Anybody who says those cartridges from the dispensary are bullshit is just stupid. Avoid anything under $50 if u want a real deal and always get it from the dispensary or someone with access to the dispensary. After trying all the danks out and all the fake shit And when I had first started them I thought you know at least it gets me high. The cartridges I get for my Dispensary there I just need one puff off of her two puffs off of the gelato one is so good. It‚Äôs by HAF And they are real BS I‚Äôve been through every single one of these bullshit to try to save money by buying off the Internet or whatever in bulk. Just go to the dispensary don‚Äôt listen to the replies on here. If somebody is telling you not to use cartridges at all they just have had bad cartridges. Right now there‚Äôs a big attack on cartridges though going on. Have died or whatever had lung problems from smoking the ones that are covered in fake and have all sorts of weird shit in them burn your nose your eyes. If you get it straight from a dispensary it is not going to be fake regardless what anybody on here tells you. It‚Äôs just a big attack on cartridges right now do you know I thousand hundreds of thousands of people die from cigarettes but a few people had a problem some lung problems from cartridges and now everybody says there‚Äôs no real cartridges... But there still a real cigarettes? We‚Äôre talking if the deaths were all even real you could count them on both hands probably. Probably all from black market carts sold for $15-$40.... just be careful. Dude buddy who responded to you is wrong there because I smoke flower and I smoke cartridges believe it or not the cartridges are part of a prescription I live in a not legal state but medicinally legal state. Pm me of u want to know more. But don‚Äôt give up on cartridges. Have you tried the live resin cartridges? It‚Äôs like a major dab every hit. They are called ‚Äúzen‚Äù if I remember right. Also remember all the fake ones are usually copies of real companies. I haven‚Äôt had a problem with any cartridge except for the ones that were $15-$45... It‚Äôs all about cutting the oil with whatever they can and taking out the good part of it for themselves or to sell to other people and then they put that cut in there and that‚Äôs what burns your nose in your eyes if you get one like that or that‚Äôs what causes the pesticides... Stick with the Dispensary you will be fine in my God do they have a lot of different flavors too it‚Äôs just like the black market except they taste legit and never let me down. I smoke half flower half cartridges. HAF brand make me want to quit weed because the carts  are better for the high or pain relief. Plus smooth and makes weed taste less fore. After going through some HAFs I‚Äôve considered cutting way back on weed because for me they work way better. Even surprise my friends. I went through so much bs carts before manning up and just paying dispensary prices. PS all these cartridges that say 90% or 9395% are not even close they are lying straight up after you try a true 95% cartridge you will understand what I mean one big rip off that thing and you are baked if it‚Äôs not like that and it says 95% on it then it is fake. Basically it‚Äôs all fake unless you go to a dispensary I learned the hard way take it from me. Lol for real. Stay away from everything sold on the street right now. It‚Äôs all home made. They buy the box out then they buy the empty cartridges and then they fill them with a syringe. But nobody values anybody else‚Äôs life so there is value money so it‚Äôs all about how much money they can make not all about how much they can help someone or how much money they can help somebody save. How about this one or about how much lifespan they could help somebody save. If you see somebody smoking danks dabwoods cookie carts chronic smart carts... chances are they are a counterfeit. More than 95% of the time actually. Dispensaries kick ass. Pm me (if you want) I can show you what I‚Äôm talking about with pictures.  They are really making a bunch of money right now and hurting a lot of people. And the people they are hurting are too stupid even know it. That‚Äôs not me being me and you that‚Äôs me being honest like you could tell them over and over and over again that‚Äôs not real they don‚Äôt give a damn... just want your money. Stick to flower if you can‚Äôt find trustworthy cartridges And no normal cartridges are not every flavor of the rainbow it‚Äôs usually weed favors I mean they‚Äôve got obnoxious with some of these flavors In my opinion they‚Äôre busting their selves by coming up with all this new shit like they‚Äôre like if the box doesn‚Äôt look like this now we updated the artwork on it so that nobody can fake it anymore that‚Äôs all just to fake everybody Into believing that these are true companies they give a damn about anybody the reality of it is they are not real companies they‚Äôre just little middleman dealers did you have a whole bunch of them and package them all up. Usually want cash app payment so They‚Äôre pretty much invisible to you. It‚Äôs like they sell you some stuff they know could kill you possibly most likely it won‚Äôt but I‚Äôm just saying they don‚Äôt want you to know anything about them. This is why bitcoin is a popular currency right now. The people selling the fake ones want to remain anonymous where they‚Äôre living at all the way to the point to where one of the people are used to get them from in California all of a sudden said that he was in Texas. Don‚Äôt use zelle and don‚Äôt use cash app unless it‚Äôs someone you personally know. After you send that money it‚Äôs gone... If you‚Äôre going on a mission to find cartridges you got a big ass one ahead of you And it‚Äôs not a cheap mission either because most likely you‚Äôre going to get scammed a few times along the process I‚Äôm not even gonna tell the amount of money I got scammed for. But it was a lesson learned and now I have access to what I need without worrying. I wished found this access $1000s of $ ago though. I always wanted the $20 ones because I wanted to save money I didn‚Äôt realize if you step it up to the 50 or $60 ones you get some good shit. In that bad boy will last about a month depending on how you‚Äôre hitting it(I always have flower also so.. may be dif for you.,2019-09-26 03:43:07

My name is Jeanson James Ancheta - The famous Ancheta.0j0x on the darknet!
I am an experienced software developer and I am the best hacker. 

10 months ago, I hacked this email address. You can check it. I am sending this email from your email address now.

I injected my code to this device and I started to monitor your activity. My first idea was to block and encrypt your files. And than I would ask for a small fee to release them back. But than one day, You visited some dirty websites. You know what I mean naughty thing. And I silently activated your front camera and recorded You. Yes! You were playing with yourself. What a funny video. 

Now, I stole contact list of yourself. I have all the friends list. A lot of information is downloaded to my system. 

I am asking from you a small fee of 699 USD. If you don't pay, all the naughty screen videos will be sent to your friends and family. 
I will distribute them to everywhere. I spent a lot of time monitoring you. This is the cost of my time. 
I promise that I will delete these files as soon as I receive the payment. I don't need it.

Send the amount to my bitcoin address:

I give you 36 hours to complete the transfer. When you open that message, I will know it and the countdown starts.

Be smart, do not ignore me! Do not click on every link you see. Always use stronger passwords on the internet. Never trust anybody!

Good Luck

f1ftty4,brianddk,1,"&gt; There is no doubt that bitcoins software will evolve to cope to the latest threat well before quantum computers can crack the already inherently secure nature of bitcoins code.

In some magical future QC reality, how long do you think the following will take?

1. Roll out a PR to bitcoin github repo to replace secp256k1 with a QC resistant cipher ( ___ many months )
2. Test verify and promote the PR to an official release of `bitcoind` ( ___ many months )
3. Time for consensus triggers to activate the new softfork ( ____ many months )
4. Time for HW / SW wallets like Electrum and Exchanges adopt the new address format ( ____ many months )
5. Time for all the existing P2PKH UTXOs to move their coins to a new QC resistant address ( ____ many months )

I think it would easily take 2 years to get 50% of addresses in [5] moved over to a new format.  I still have wallets / exchanges that don't support bech32.

Agreed that we are ***way*** more than 2 years away from a 10 minute solve of secp256k1 with QC, but I think the new address format deployment would take longer than most assume it would.",2019-09-26 08:07:45
f1fu9uf,Bad_Investment,1,"&gt; Bitcoin needs to move slowly and be conservative. We're still breaking new ground here, so I'm happy the 100+ devs working on Bitcoin and lightning are testing their code VERY thoroughly.
I'm all for good software engineering practices. The issue is that Bitcoin as a L1 protocol is simply outdated. Ethereum's current L1 protocol has all the same functionality and much more. Lightning as a L2 scaling solution is also behind. We have L2 in the Ethereum ecosystem with far better performance and liquidity already.

&gt; This doesn't make sense.
See above. It is not competitive in any of the technical domains that matter, such as scalability and extensibility. Addressing these issues at L1 isn't on the roadmap, and lightning isn't showing very much promise.

&gt; SoV narrative has worked like a charm up till now
Something tells me that it's current price isn't related to SoV as being a reality. We'll see how that usecase plays out.

* This dump is still on low volume on retail exchanges. That means the money that traded against stable coins just changed hands and is still in the system. It has to be re-invested.

 IMO People who are losing hope ATM came into this space too soon. To them I'd say  this : Yes , you have the right to ""lose all hope"" and sell. Frankly right now, you won't be missed.  But I also know that you will come back. 

But  they should go while we are still trying to build this thing.  Let me explain : 

 We won't create value that you guys are soooo desperate to have simply by using it as a get-rich scheme  ""√Ä la bitcoin"". 

Sure you can trade and trade and hodle,  but this is a world computer we are talking about and  this computer work.  

Devs do not care about the daytrading money.  Devs  dream about the pure world changing possibilities with this system .   We can now do stuff that we theorized in school  as impossible! 

This is the REAL innovation here . BUT there are still fundamentals problem within this world computer that a lot of DEV are trying to solve right now. 

Ethereum is being built from scratch . We have to re-invent every  single thing we took for granted the last gen (web 2.0)  Rethink every function,  build every library and so on.  The good news is that DEV's are making huge leaps every couple of months. It goes faster than ever  because we are building this thing on top of proven web 2.0 tools collaboration and tech coupled to Ethereum. We are less than 2 years away .

CRYPTOCURRENCIES

ETHUSD: Ethereum Prices‚Äô Double Digit Slide Might Extend in the Days Ahead

Written By¬†Alejandro Zambrano¬†on¬†Sep 24, 2019, 22:06 BST

Ethereum prices (ETHUSD) just experienced a substantial decline of about 18 percent. The decline started around 19:45 London time, which also was when we saw declines in most major cryptocurrencies. It looks like the fall originated in Bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the price declined below the important July 17 low of $9052 and appears to have triggered a huge cluster of stop-loss orders sending prices lower. At the time of writing, all major cryptocurrencies were down by double digits.

Ethereum prices (ETHUSD) slid below their August low of $164, and reached a low of $154, to bounce back as it looks like bargain hunters decided to buy on the price dip. Nonetheless, the trend in Ethereum prices remains sharply downwards, and it will probably take a few days until prices stabilize. In case the slide in prices continues then ETHUSD might reach the April 25 low of $148.88, followed by the March 25 low of $132.69. The trend will remain downwards as long as the price trades below September 19 high of $224.79.

I judge that there is no clear pattern in Ethereum prices that suggest a significant slide in the price, but the trend remains bearish and needs to be respected. However, if we use the descending triangle pattern in Bitcoin prices to derive a target for ETHUSD, then it suggests that the price could decline by another 20 percent to about 119 dollars per coin.",2019-09-27 08:47:00

This reinforces something I've been saying for a while about this space:

If you believe cryptocurrency and blockchain are going to be a part of our future, it's not going to ""just be Bitcoin""- it's going to be ""Bitcoin AND Ethereum."" I'm really not sure about anything else, to be honest.

Ethereum is in a great position to draft off of currently #1 Bitcoin and its broader adoption as an accepted financial asset, and it is comparatively undervalued given that recognition. Ethereum also has the unique advantage of being useful for many purposes which Bitcoin simply cannot achieve on L1, and hasn't traction in achieving on L2.

For example, they can sue Microsoft if they put out a version of the language that installs bitcoin miners on machines. They can't do that with GNU R. And yes, they could vet GNU R but the cost of vetting, building infrastructure/processes to vet, and the general hassle is more expensive than paying for licenses for MRO. These decisions are made by non-programmers who don't know anything about how incredibly tested an open source project like R is. 

Besides that, the reasons for using MRO have lost teeth I feel. But that's because R 3.5 implemented a lot of the features that Revolution Analytics built into their implementation of R. It uses intel's MKL library for math operations and combined with some native parallelization on certain operations, it's supposed to be faster but I don't really use R for speed ‚Äîthat's what I used Rcpp for!",2019-09-27 06:23:28

And don't even get me started on the fact that the CC transaction doesn't really lock when the transaction ""goes through"".  Everybody has just agreed that a promise to pay has occurred.  Then a day, or two, or three later, the transaction actually clears or locks in real life.  Hideously slow.  Hideously easy to game/steal.

The 64 Billion dollar question is how to inform the world of this fundamental change in how money and banking *must change.*  Because it absolutely will change.  Dash should be at the very front of that change.",2019-09-28 11:47:01

All this price suppression is also a natural part of the market, and it has been happening since the U.S. government dumped the SilkRoad coins.  That's the beauty of Bitcoin: it won't work and will backfire in the longer run.  The guys shorting now should have figured that out last year.

IIRC the amount of new Monero created per time will approach a zero percent rate over time. 

There is inflation as you are describing it, which is an increase in the available units of currency over time. But inflation and deflation in economics refer to the value of the money, not the supply. Inflation in this case means money is worth less over time. These are not mutually exclusive. The money supply can go up and the value of money can go up as well.

3. Create a back tester that runs (quickly) through your test data and sends each new price/candle to your algorithm.

Then tune the periods and number of averages.  I had bitcoin turn $1000 into millions with a 10 minute (5 second candles) vs a 30 minute (5 second candles).  Then I modeled fees and it all fell apart and broke even.

Model fees and if you are really clever the order book and have fun.  Compare your profits to what buying and holding would have netted.  Test against different market types, it's easy to fool yourself into thinking you have a working algo if you only test against a Bull market or a Bear market.",2019-09-29 23:35:05

However, an interesting side note is that the Petro Bank has been using bitcoin to sidestep international sanctions.  So, the evil tyrants actually are benefitting from bitcoin as much or more than the citizens!",2019-09-29 12:44:00
f1sjsxa,thunder75,3,"Very watered down

There's a ledger that keeps track of Bitcoin transactions. This ledger is kept up to date by utilizing other people's processing power. Every few minutes a chunk of Bitcoin is released. The first computer that can successfully solve a complex math problem, in turn keeping the ledger up to date, earns those Bitcoins.",2019-09-29 13:04:21
f1saots,ManyArtichoke,3,"Understandable. I'm a Brave/BAT supporter, but it's totally separate from my interest in Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general. I have plenty of centralizated companies I support and plenty of decentralized entities that I also support. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to compare BAT to Bitcoin. 

I support Bitcoin because it's decentralized, permisionless, borderless, and censorship resistant. 

I support Brave because I think the digital advertising model is severely broken and Brave offers a novel solution that gives more power to users and content creators. Google, Amazon, and FB have an insane share of the world's digital ad revenue. It's a bottleneck and a monopoly that benefits a handful of people at the expense of every other content creator, publisher, and user on the internet. 

Bitcoin is a major technological breakthrough that will completely revolutionize distributed systems and global finance. It has the potential to fundamentally change the way we organize society. 

BAT is the only centralized ""cryptocurrency"" that I support because it's working towards goals and values that are important to me, and for which it doesn't need decentralization to acconolish.",2019-09-29 12:06:41
f1uqpin,mvictordbz,3,"Seriously, IOTA is in no way complex, people just don't run after information. IOTA is just like Bitcoin but the blocks only have 1 transaction, these have some implications, but anyway... 

This FPS consensus is pretty simple actually, you query the opinion of random people on the network about a transaction, then you change your opinion according the majority, of course it has some more details but that's it. Don't need to start talking about attack vectors, they are addressed and teory/simulations show promissing results, follow the discord tanglemath channel for more information (or read the whitepaper).

If you think about it, the FPS is just like life. Here a analogy, you wanna buy a smartphone? What do you do? You will ask your friends about it, depending on their answers you will change your own, maybe you don't ask friends but search on google or watch a youtube video about some xiaomis, but in essence it's the same.

Plus, you know what's cool about coordicide? Its modularity, you can have multiple differente kind of consensus, you can choose any or both, you can add new ones later. In the beginning there will be the FPS and CA (cellular automata) consensus on the network. Both are really fast, I'm talking about miliseconds you can extend to some seconds (2) just to make sure. Anyway, I'm looking foward to it.",2019-09-29 22:04:49

EDIT:

The previous, source transaction (input) is also unconfirmed, this may be the reason. Also it has very low priority:

Miners are definitely using coin days destroyed filters, still they should process the transaction if mempool is empty.

Also, the BCH hashrate has huge spikes lately.

Can anybody shed some light onto this matter?

f1wpchu,c0wt00n,20,"&gt;but what can I actually spend it on?

you arent supposed to spend it, you are supposed to HODL it and hope to get rich. You desperately want to try and get other people to buy it and spend it tho. No one is really sure how, but the most popular approach is currently to shill it like crazy, preferably on r/cc where it must become your sworn duty to upvote anything that casts nano in a favorable light and downvote anything that doesn't. Also make sure and point out how Bitcoin fails as a peer to peer currency. Basically pretty much anyone you see with a bitcoin logo next to their name is your new enemy. Other options to shill are twitter. Anytime some company tweets something in the form of question about what coin is best for their doodad, you want to rally the troops as fast as possible and get everyone to reply that nano is in fact the best (#feeless #greencurrency #bitcoin2.0), now these companies have no actual interest in the answer to the question they are just trying to get as many people to reply as possible because they are themselves shilling, but don't concern yourself with that. Just like religion this all works best if you don't ask too many questions or try and peek behind the curtain. Welcome to crypto!",2019-09-30 05:10:02

It will work out even worse than it did last time.  If you enjoyed the ride from $3K to $13K, the ride from $7K to $50K will be the thrill of your lifetime.

f1yncde,GKLemon,10,"Bitcoin looks ready for relief bounce to 9k:

As I have said in the post [earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/d9eh2u/daily_discussion_thursday_september_26_2019/f1lhf1j?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I wasn't going to front-run the oscillators and stayed in the short waiting for the beginning of the relief bounce. This brings us to where we are now:

The two important factors that would make me exit my short and enter long mentioned earlier this week is as follow:

*For now, staying in my shorts until 1 of the 2 occurs:*

1. *Another test of 7.6-7.8k at which point I will exit short and enter leveraged long targeting 9k before continuation downward*
2. *A sustained daily close above 8.3k, at which point I will exit short and enter leveraged long leveraged long targeting 9k before continuation downward*

For now, I've exited my short at 7700 and entered 50% long at CA of 7750 with more bids from 7600-7700. If price breaks back above 8150-8200 I will also enter a more leveraged long position. We should see a relief bounce over the next week or two towards the $9k area before more downside continuation.

The price is not ready for a real recovery, but a short term 1k relief is in play potentially.

As for why I believe relief bounce coming in?

1. Big ass bullish divergence staring at us in the face.
2. Longer time oscillators have found ""bottom""
3. Buy-pressure on the dip significantly outweighs sell pressure on A/D
4. Why is this relief instead of recovery: Longer-term oscillators don't show relief in play before more downside: we will need to consolidate at higher levels for weeks if this is recovery. If we get a sharp reaction downwards in the 9k-9.3k area, we will see a more significant downside.
5. We have not swept the lower area of liquidity for the liquidity squeeze.

Have fun trading!

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. it is extremely unlikely for us to dump-through to the 6k region from current price level without a bounce in between. But I believe the 6.8k-7.3k area is definitely in play sometime down the line.",2019-09-30 14:08:55

f1y6bvr,mondy0831,7,"I never understood the issue with inflation. In the macro-economic sense, inflationary currencies are necessary to discourage deflation. The fact that SDF uses inflation as a funding source never bothered me either. In the long run, if Stellar were to be considered as a globally viable currency, there would need to be an inflation mechanism built in. 

On the ""investment front"" many folks here now didn't get in during 2017 because they most likely didn't notice Stellar until during or after the run in late 2017-early 2018, hence they are sitting on negative balances. To your point, I can say I'm one of the lucky ones who saw what Stellar was early and still am hanging on without much of a loss. Yes, I should have gotten out last year at the ATH, but the off-ramps weren't as well-defined as they are now and I really always planned to hold for several years, precisely because of what I saw happen with bitcoin.

 It's easy to see why folks might want to move on, though. All I can say is if you continue to accumulate during these times when the price is low, you could be in pretty good shape in the years to come when there is real adoption.  Lots of things are happening now, with countries such as Ukraine planning to legalize cryptocurrencies as a method of exchange. The Franklin-Templeton use-case test is much bigger than anything going on in the crypto space. There isn't anything else that even comes close. With $700 billion in tokenized assets, the Stellar network will contain more value than bitcoin ever did, even at it's all time high.

f1y4dza,JustsinTrudeau,6,"The LINK token is a scam. Let me tell you why.

Bitcoin has slightly less than 6000 full nodes running, and having a full bitcoin node is so easy even a downie can do it, unlike a chainlink node which requires enterprise-level power and internet (check the gitter this is from thomas hodges mouth) as well as more technical prowess.

Under the best case scenario Chainlink has 6000 nodes running ""staking"" a very generous 10,000 LINK tokens each (the real number before diminishing returns is likely much lower) that is only 60 million chainlink tokens taken out of circulation, leaving more than 940 million tokens to be dumped all over your smarmy little linkie faces. There will literally be no demand for these tokens. Each smart Contract will split it's payment among the 6k nodes, meaning unless there is a massive volume of smart contracts utilizing the network there will be very little money in running a node.

Get out now while you still can. I didn't realize how few nodes there were in bitcoin. I thought chainlink could easily have a million nodes but that is not the case.",2019-09-30 11:06:30
