evmckbt,DCinvestor,20,"Hey guys, a bunch of you have mentioned to me how difficult it is to get into Twitter, and I get it.  It's hard to know who's who, who you should follow, etc.  But there is value you can get on Twitter which you might not get here.  You can hear from and even engage with influential folks directly, and get up to the minute updates (if you really need them).  Even worse is that Twitter will start suggesting many large accounts to you which are run by Bitcoin Maximalists, who often present a distorted or myopic view of the space.

So to simplify the process, I've pulled together a few lists of people and of projects which this community might find interesting.  They are works in progress which I hope to refine over the month of August, and then make continual adjustments as time goes on.  You can find them here:  [https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists)

Feel free to subscribe directly to these lists and their content will start to appear in your feed, or  you can always comb through the list and add the folks you'd like. Also feel free to recommend them to others if you found them helpful.  *Please note that inclusion on these lists is not an endorsement of any form by me.*

**Ethereum Starter Pack:**  [https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/ethereum-starter-pack](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/ethereum-starter-pack)

This is a group of folks who Tweet often about Ethereum and share productive points of view on it.  It's curated to be somewhat newbie friendly, so some familiar names may be missing. To clarify, this is also a pretty pro-Ethereum crew, with some familiar names and some you may not have heard of, but nearly all do a good job at trying to educate newcomers with their perspectives.  You can certainly follow others to get more contrarian takes, and perhaps my next project will be to pull together a ""Ethereum Contrarian Pack.""

**Ethereum Projects**:  [https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/ethereum-projects](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/ethereum-projects)

This is a list of accounts from projects important in the Ethereum space.  This list in particular needs some additions which I will strive to make over the month of August, but it's in good enough shape to share here with you all now.

**Crypto Analysts (read Traders)**:  [https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/crypto-analysts](https://twitter.com/iamDCinvestor/lists/crypto-analysts)

These are crypto analysts, chartists, and traders who I keep tabs on.  Be *very* careful following trading ""advice"" on Twitter, or anywhere for that matter.  You of course have people talking their books and presenting very narrow analysis which suit their purposes.  What's also interesting is how most Crypto Twitter Traders eventually devolve into this type of shit posting where every other post is basically an ironic post which can't actually be taken seriously, with the exact opposite being meant of what is said (what could possibly go wrong with this?).  Read with extreme caution, but over time, you'll start to get a sense for the sentiment of the market by reading these folks' content.

That's it for now.  If you have any strong feedback, feel free to let me know.  I'll post about this every once in a while as we have newcomers drift in.  Thanks.",2019-08-01 05:49:49

&gt;""While other blockchain platforms (e.g., the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum) work on switching from Proof of Work to other, less energy-consuming consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake, it is likely that Bitcoin will continue to use the established algorithm. **Miners, who have a large influence on the development of Bitcoin, are not interested in removing the algorithm, which is central to their own business.** Therefore, it is likely that Bitcoin will remain the largest energy consumer among public blockchain systems and will continue to consume a considerable amount of energy.""

**Preventing the 51%-Attack: a Stochastic Analysis of Two Phase Proof of Work in Bitcoin (2015)**

Martijn Bastiaan, University of Twente (Netherlands)

&gt;It is easy to see that large pools therefore have a low variance on the number of blocks they find. This reduces risks and mostly increases profits for small miners. Large pools are thus likely to grow even more, leading to “superpools”. Pool operators can perform certain attacks on the network as soon as their pool reaches a substantial percentage of the network. This is often described as the 51%-attack. Recently, a pool ([GHash.IO](https://GHash.IO)) held 54% of the hashrate for a day, which exceeds the theoretical attack threshold of 51%. Although the community swiftly responded by transferring mining capacity to other pools, the incentives to create large pools are still present, luring for another chance to disrupt the network.

**Blockchain Exhumed (2017)**

NIT Surat, India

&gt;Security Challenges: As the bitcoin blockchain is public, and there is no central authority, it is prone to some security challenges. One has to make sure that no one is able to do the following.

1. Double spending of the coins
2. No one should be able monopolise the network: If someone gains control of the majority of the network, he can do anything he wants, and would bring down the whole system. This is prevented by using proof of work, assuming that no one would be able to outnumber whole network in terms of computation power. It would be very hard to compete against the whole world in terms of computation power. Such case could happen if many people form large pools and one of those pools gain the monopoly, but this has not yet took place.

&gt;The Proof of work scheme used by bitcoin wastes so much of computation power and electricity, just for verifying the transactions and running the network. No useful computations are performed in it and hence no good is done to the society.  
&gt;  
&gt;The total amount of bitcoins to be produced are capped at 21 million coins which is expected to happen in 2140.\[33\] After that there will be no mining incentives. Only transactions fees should serve as incentives for the miners to mine the blocks. How would network be then \[secured\] is a question.

Blockchain challenges and opportunities: a survey (2018)

School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University

&gt;**Stop the tendency to centralisation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Blockchain is designed as a decentralised system. However, there is a trend that miners are centralised in the mining pool. Up to now, the top 5 mining pools together owns larger than 51% of the total hash power in the Bitcoin network (bitcoinwrldwide, n.d.). Apart from that, selfish mining strategy (Eyal and Sirer, 2014) showed that pools with over 25% of total computing power could get more revenue than a fair share. Rational miners would be attracted into the selfish pool and finally, the pool could easily exceed 51% of the total power. As the blockchain is not intended to serve a few organisations, some methods should be proposed to solve this problem.

I think Bitcoin as a store of value is firmly established and adoption will continue to grow.  The money will still trickle from Bitcoin to new hyped projects, probably leading to a lesser alt season in 2021.  Privacy coins and other more scalable payment coins or 2nd layers should have a future.   I think the most interesting thing is what comes out of all the experiments happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.  A lot of them are hyped up but something big might happen in the future.  And it doesn't necessarily have to be Ethereum but it's almost as if the entire crypto mindshare is there right now.  BTW, I am not currently holding ETH so not shilling it.",2019-08-01 07:19:39

evmf94r,VictorCobra,4,"Sweet! Thanks for the kind words! Wyckoff is pretty interesting. I'm much more of a visual guy and into patterns, so I definitely follow Wyckoff's reasoning a bit more than Elliot wave theory. I use a lot more Wyckoff terminology in my analysis anyway.

As for Uranium...I'm not an expert on stocks or commodities. In some ways, they're less TA-driven than crypto haha. But looking at the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/d8vcv6aE/), it appears to be finally breaking down from a very long descending triangle. There appears to be a lot of volume though, which could indicate some level of demand over the last few years. But the RSI (purple) is breaking a support level, and the Ultimate Oscillator (red) is showing a hidden bearish divergence - it's not anywhere near bottom, even though prices are low. This could mean that price won't reach a bottom until the UO breaks down to a new low. The ultimate oscillator is the most accurate indicator I've seen in markets. It accurately predicted that Bitcoin had bottomed at $3.2K, when many other indicators were showing a remaining bearish possibility. The falling wedge you're talking about on the URA chart is only visible when [zoomed in](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uohOXqoA/) to the last couple of years. I don't see falling wedges as bullish unless they occur after an impulse move to the upside.

But on the bullish side, I think if it breaks the $13 zone it could be a buy. Even though something has dropped 80-90%, it doesn't mean it's a good buy. Someone in my small Telegram group recommended that people buy [GameStop (GME)](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NE69q0zq/) at $5 recently, but I told him there was a very real possibility for them to simply go out of business, since I noted them closing stores in Manhattan, and the same happened to Circuit City and even Blockbuster before they went under. I said I wouldn't touch it. Since then, GME has [dropped another 20%.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/S1UNDxtV/)

evmfv1k,mr_sew,3,"&gt;IGM survey: A substantial source of  the value of decentralized private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin,  arises from their convenience for use ~~in illegal activities~~.

There.  I fixed that headline for them.

I detect weasel words.  So if something is convenient to use legally, by definition, does that mean that it would be inconvenient to use illegally?  No.  Convenience is convenient no matter weather its use is legal or illegal, especially when it comes to currency.

I find cash to be quite convenient.  I use it all the time for legal activities.  Makes me wonder if the convenience of cash makes it usable for illegal activities.  Nah. Probably not.

I also, use my bank too, for debit card, (because filling out all those numbers, and date, and name, and address every fucking time, or storing it with every vendor I ever do business with so it can be hacked and stolen, or using it at gas pumps, so it can be copied and stolen, or restaurants so it can be copied and stolen, and then so when I find out about it I can call the bank and let them know so that I can have it disabled, and then wait 7 days to get the replacement, which is so convenient), or taking an hour off work and going to the bank, during the most inconvenient hours of the day to do a wire transfer, and then having to check their work after they type it all in by hand and get it wrong twice, and then having to pay them for the privilege of wasting my most valuable hours of the day, or having my debit card deactivated just because I have not used it in 6 months, and no one thought to tell me about, because that is fucking customer service, or the bullshit fees for doing nothing, or the bullshit low interest rates on cash that I have idle, while they loan money out at 9%, but pay me 1% or less.  Yeah because banking is so FUCKING CONVENIENT I cannot imagine why the fuck everyone does not use them!!!!!!

Fuck!

I do legal activities all the time and I do not want to use a bank.  You have to be desperate or ignorant to use a bank.  Whether or not you are doing legal or illegal activities, banks are not nice, nor helpful, nor convenient.

But just to have a little fun, I like to make weekly withdrawals in cash for $2,500 each from one of my banks, and then when I have $10,001.00,  I go to my other bank and deposit it.  Then a month later I switch the withdrawals and deposit back to the other bank.  They have to report that shit, then when the FBI checks my accounts all they see is that I am legally moving $10,001.00 from one bank to another in the banking system.

We're seeing this shift now as Bitcoin being used as cash is now pivoting to Store of Value since it doesn't work as cash anymore.

Also the Beta VS VHS thing doesnt apply in this case because you're talking about hardware investment for both producers and consumer in the market and and early portion of movers adoption on tech over the other giving it a foothold and precedent.

**View**

* Bitcoin looks set to test falling channel resistance at $12,030, having invalidated a bearish lower-highs pattern earlier today.
* The rise in bitcoin’s dominance rate to the highest level in over two years indicates the price rise is sustainable.
* A UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the falling channel breakout and allow a rally to $13,880 (June 26 high).
* The bull case would weaken if BTC closes today (UTC) below $11,120, although that looks unlikely.

Just reading the news there is an almost daily report of some country or bank looking for ways to get in the crypto game, and what is their main interest? Payments, in some form of digital currency, or remittances. Countries and banks aren't into gaming, gambling or porn. They want ways to cut costs and Stellar offers an alternative to the current system. They aren't going to use Ethereum or bitcoin for payments when they realize how expensive and slow they are. Other crypto currencies aren't designed for payments, except for Ripple, and while others could be adapted for payments, it will be hard. Why not go with easy?

Maybe it's just the technology du jour, but no doubt it's getting attention, and while there are other payment technologies being offered by the likes of SWIFT and Western Union, Stellar is gaining a huge foothold through WW and other partnerships. When entire regions like South America, Asia and Africa come online, they're going to require a lumens in order to operate on the Stellar network.

Most of these cryptos wont last but they are appealing to people because they think ""I could buy a million at fractions of a penny and if it goes bitcoin Ill be rich"". Truth of the matter is, bitcoin only went to crazy 20k values through market manipulation, which bitcoin has shown to be more and more resistant to. People got bit by fomo and arent willing to get bit again. 

I have tons of crypto from back when mining made sense, so I still sub to most of them for news, but news and delusion are not the same thing, and this sub is full of delusion.

The way price is going up it will be easy over 5 mill a piece by that time and even fraction of bitcoin mined would be way more worth than monero. Transaction fees will be significant by 2140 but with lightning fully onboard won’t be a problem for common users. Also by 2140 hardware tech would have evolved to a point that running bigger blocks on even a cell phone will become possible so layer 1 will also scale to a point where miners will continue make huge profits by simply clearing global transactions.

But yes.. i also assume that bitcoin holders have a stake in the p2p network working.

Look at bittorrent, some users seed torrents for years, why do they do that? I assume they simply support the concept of free information or something

&gt;And in any case you're still asking we how an SPV client could do something a full node still can not do.

Of course a full node can do it (test if a block follows consensus rules), that is the entire point of the bitcoin software

You know, you cashed out into USD and all we've seen is just BTC going up, alts getting massacred but in USD we are still quite far from bottom. This feels like fabricated behavior and I personally don't care about what others do. Think about it as accumulation. In order to go up you need weak hands to be shaken, let coins move from hands of impatient to patient. If you know when to sell, you should see 98% discount as quite good buying opportunity. Because vast majority of others is in incomparably worse position:)

And for the devs, I think you just got used to much for average shitcoin project where development is funded by selling own token and half of the team is just coming up with partnerships and hype to keep it alive. Then you have projects like Bitcoin and Sia (if you dig deeper you will start understanding and seeing Bitcoin as your own money and Sia as your own data). They have different purpose and Bitcoin is way further in the adoption, but the point is that Sia became production ready and apps and tools are already emerging. No one knows because no one is watching. Yet. But the devs do their best, they are constantly posting updates, new releases and they simply focus on product because only working and successful product will earn them money. Or the VC investors (which just gave the team $3.5M funding). Siafund pays out reward in SC so it matters.

But devs are not in control of the network or the price. There is natural discovery and that's why it is so difficult to comprehend for people... they are used to garbage and for them Sia just looks like dead project.

ew1oem0,fresheneesz,1,"THE LIGHTNING NETWORK

&gt; Lightning is starting over from Zero

That's ok tho. It will grow faster than bitcoin did because its part of bitcoin. 

&gt; Lightning on the other hand is much more difficult with many other problems to be solved

I agree that accepting bitcoin through the lightning network has barriers to entry. However, the barriers to getting into cryptocurrency in the first place are higher. Once you're in, the lightning network is harder than an alt, but still within the threshold of learning that person has proven they're prepared to handle.

&gt; Withdrawing, hodling, and then selling 100%

If we're *really* talking about the most common use case, it actually does. Its:

1. Buy bitcoin on coinbase
2. keep bitcoin on coinbase
3. sell bitcoin on coinbase

Since Coinbase is custodial, they could have a single lightning channel they let users use. And those users could still sell 100% of it back whenever they want to, because its all on the exchange.

But even if we're talking about ""Withdrawing, hodling, and then selling 100%"", lightning still works (or will work). When splice in / splice out is a thing (I think lightning labs calls it loop in and loop out), you could withdraw directly into a lightning channel, use lightning however much you want, then when you want to sell, you can sell 100% of it with an on-chain transaction. Coins are not ""stuck"" or ""locked"" in the lightning network. So saying you can't send 100% of your coins with lightning presents a false choice. You don't have to choose between only lightning or only on-chain. You get both.

&gt; The reality is that none of the major businesses are adding lightning support

The lightning network isn't ready yet. It needs a few more years of development. Remember the idea is only 5 years old, and was only implemented 2 years ago. At that stage, I don't think bitcoin didn't even have a GUI.

I feel like I need to clarify, are we talking about future bitcoin or curent bitcoin? Cause if the lightning network forever stays in its current state, then all the things you're saying are right. But if lightning continues on its expected path, then I stand by all the things I've said.",2019-08-06 02:57:18

When you sent your Bitcoin from your paper wallet to your hardware wallet, the transaction was broadcast to the Bitcoin network.  Chances are the Bitcoin cash you control is still at the address on your paper wallet, and assuming it is still there, so is the BSV from the hardfork that occured with Bitcoin Cash later on.",2019-08-06 03:03:28

People do not buy smart phones because they believe it will value higher in the future (on the contrary everybody almost universally agrees they are depreciating assets except for little vintage value on some) but for its' utility. On the contrary very little number of people buy Bitcoin for its' utility (as can be seen from BCH) but for its' potential value increase/decrease.

This is like comparing smart phones to gold. Very few people buy gold because it is a great conductor. They buy it because they think it is a rare enough element that is universally accepted as 'valuable', so it is mostly a 'value play'.

Just my two cents; the analogy itself is not comparable and anything built on top of it therefore is losing the points you are making. I think you can find better alternatives to point out the same findings you have by using things that are not used for their utility.",2019-08-06 02:33:39

ew4hhr4,WoofKibaWoof,1,"Theoretically bitcoin supply is going up, but at an exponentially lower pace when compared to Fiat. Bitcoin is capped, Fiat isn't. 

Add to that the number of initial bitcoin adopters that lost their wallet keys and the bitcoin total supply is even lower. Meanwhile more credit is being created and more money constantly printed. 

Not to mention the ""hodl"" consensus, which is basically agreeing to not sell for worthless Fiat.

So the longer this goes on the more crappy pieces of paper you'll need to get to trade in for 1 btc.

Personally, I'm not buying more unless there's another huge crash and I'm holding what I have until I can trade it for a house. Might be 10 years, but it's still better than a mortgage.

It's interesting times we live in. We have government money (Fiat), private money in development (that crap to be issued by that super trustworthy company that I'm not going to name), gold &amp; silver (basically nature's money) and bitcoin (the people's money).

Currently everyone accepts Fiat, because the consensus is that most people still trust governments. Some might accept gold &amp; silver, but it's not that easy to transfer or trade and it also requires some form of government to work.

We'll just have to see if the consensus changes.",2019-08-07 01:58:51

pr0nh0li0's Bullmarket Correction checklist:

* 200 Day MA safely intact? ✔️✔️ (didn't even get close to touching)
* 50 MA broken back through with conviction ✔️✔️
* Weekly RSI sub 60 ✔️ (the candle didn't close the RSI &lt;60, but *it did* touch under the most recent week we were close to 9k)
* Daily volume minimums still increasing? ✔️  [(link)](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aCJJWVah/)
* Local top still has an MVRV &lt; 3.5 (preferably lower) ✔️ (local high peaked at 2.5)

For fiat to crypto currently the only way is p2p meeting at a cafe and paying cash or using a bitcoin ATM. I don’t think that’s gonna change anytime soon either unless you could convince your boss to pay you in crypto. And even then, they would know you as a crypto holder. I think p2p is gonna be king for the foreseeable future. Until they start asking you where your bitcoin went, can’t cough them or a receipt that you spent them up?

ew4g1xd,blue2684,1,"I go for younger SD in the nyc area. I’m assuming the younger daddies you’re referring to are the mid-late 20s to early 30s.  The finance field has some guys who are very rich at a very young age. These are your gifted traders or people who got lucky with bitcoin. Or serial entrepreneurs. (Net worth &gt;10M+ and annual &gt;1M). From what I’ve seen, guys who actually have that much money are legit SD.  they’re looking for a genuine connection and will be generous out of kindness and appreciation for you. They can easily afford it. There are a few “I’m young and attractive so why should I pay you?” type of idiots, but at that income range, seem to be significantly fewer. 

More commonly, very young SD are guys who make a good salary at a young age. They’re generally guys who don’t get much attention on regular dating apps and hope to meet girls with better success. Honestly I see a higher proportion of assholes and PUA among this crowd. I’ve had guys insist that they need to see me in lingerie before they decide that I’m “worth the allowance”. But there are some genuine ones who hope to provide for you the best they can. Overall, I’ve had good experiences younger guys.

LOL there's literally zero evidence FOR real hitmen being on the dark web.  You finding it 'hard to believe' has no bearing on anything. It's also just common sense but we'll leave that one aside.

I'll do you one better though, this should really blow your mind -- there aren't any freelance, for-hire hitmen period.  There are guys who work for, say, cartels, and the mafia who kill a lot of people, but it's only a small part of their job and they're doing it exclusively for an organization.  The myth of the John Wick/The Jackal/a million other movies Hitman is just that, a myth.

So, no more U.S. dollars for the last two years, and now they're about to crash again.  I guess Zimbabweans who got into Bitcoin even at the peak are going to be like Argentineans -- better off buying at $20K than being stuck with their own government's ""money"".",2019-08-07 01:51:38

ew7hadl,tarmo888,1,"It has not been proven. What makes you think that governments have already tried to shut down the miners? You count someone tweet on social media as an attempt to shut down? That's not how it works.

If the biggest mining power concentrates in locations where the electricity is cheap then that is not what you could call decentralized and Obyte 12 witnesses could be become more decentralized than Bitcoin miners because there is no cost for running Obyte witness, you can put that machine everywhere in the world and hide it behind TOR. Bitcoin mining hardware, you have to hide in buildings that have decent cooling, internet connection and electricity - somewhere where there is cheap electricity.

Luckily for Bitcoin, miners decide what transactions go to next block and there is equally same amount of power in the hands of users who run full nodes and can who choose, which fork they decide to support, so if full nodes signal that they are not supporting some fork, miners are forced into decision to either mine the fork that nobody uses or switch to fork where users are.

Same is with Obyte, it is not just witnesses who matter, but users matter too because they choose, which witness gets replaced or even choose a totally different fork to run. The bigger difference here is that full nodes on Obyte have direct access to post new transactions to network, while full nodes on Bitcoin doesn't.

When all Obyte 12 witnesses get replaced and they are living and hosting their witness node around the world in secure hidden places then it would be interesting to see how do you get all those countries to cooperate to take down the witnesses at the same time.",2019-08-08 00:30:32

Lemme just quote the post you link just above. See that other pastebin link in there, that one *Does* have correlations to Tether instead of BTC. And it explicitly says: ""Bitcoin has the 14th highest correlation [To Tether] at 0.79..."", ""BCH has a correlation of 0.60""

0.60 &lt; 0.79, just so we're clear.

So, still high, but less than BTC? just like where I said above ""I'll grant you it's probably moderately high."" 

Besides, you understand what a correlation is, right? Suppose there is a coin that consistently has a market cap less than $1000. However, if that (tiny)  cap fluctuates in perfect proportion to tether, (going up when tether goes up, going down when tether goes down), the correlation can be a perfect 1.0 (100%) even though the absolute size of the market cap is ridiculously small. It's a measure of how closely the *pattern* of two things move together, not absolute size.

* **What's the deal with the unconfirmed CoinJoins? I have been waiting forever!**

**There are no solutions in life, only trade-offs.** Let's think about the issue with setting fees here. The bitcoin network has unpredictable congestion. Here is the mempool chart   [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) . Notice anything strange? For the past 2-4 weeks, up until 1 day ago, the fees charged by miners was very small, and so Wasabi was using a fee that would get confirmed usually within 6 hours, but typically as little as 2 hours. This has likely saved users thousands of satoshis and made re-mixing much cheaper.   


Recently, the difficulty went up a ton (POW difficulty) and the hashpower dipped, so the congestion ramped back up without a warning. Should we charge (overcharge) high fees all of the last month? Or should we accept that occasionally we have these inconsistent moments? It's a tough question.

&amp;#x200B;

There are smarter ways to approach this problem, and I assure you we are thinking about it, and I want to thank you for giving us input.",2019-08-09 01:34:05

ewfkl2j,williambotter,1," Todo movimento tem seus heróis, e para os anarcocapitalistas (ancaps para os íntimos), quem mais se aproxima desse status é Dâniel Fraga (com acento circunflexo mesmo).

 Fraga peitou e zombou do Estado. E depois sumiu. Possivelmente, não sem antes ficar zilionário investindo em bictoins. Onde está Dâniel Fraga é um dos grande mistérios dos dias atuais (pelo menos se você for um ancap).

 Como mostrei recentemente[ numa reportagem da Ilustríssima](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/2019/08/quem-sao-os-libertarios-e-anarcocapitalistas-que-pregam-o-fim-do-estado.shtml), anarcocapitalismo é uma vertente extrema do liberalismo que advoga o fim do Estado e a provisão de todos os serviços pela iniciativa privada.

 Isso inclui saúde, educação, transporte e até justiça, polícia e defesa nacional. Para os ancaps, imposto é roubo, e a existência do Estado é uma forma de violência contra o indivíduo.

 Muitos dos seguidores desse credo sabem que um rompimento definitivo é impossível. A maioria deles, cada vez mais presentes em setores da nova economia e até no governo federal, segue a linha gradualista, de perseguir a extinção do Estado como um ideal.

 Mas há também os mais radicais, conhecidos como brutalistas, que não admitem concessões no discurso. E Dâniel Fraga era (ou é, onde quer que esteja), o mais brutalista dos brutalistas.

 Gradativamente, por volta de 2012, esse pequeno empresário de São Paulo começou a postar vídeos com críticas a órgãos e funções de Estado. Passou o a atacar o pagamento de impostos e até criticar a repressão estatal ao contrabando, que para ele, nada mais é do que uma troca comercial voluntária entre pessoas como qualquer outra.

 Aos poucos, sua retórica foi se intensificando. Em 2015, Fraga colocou no YouTube o vídeo [“Aprenda a roubar com a Receita Federal”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs0B4C3FueE), em que apresenta os profissionais da instituição como “o conjunto de ladrões engravatados trabalhando para a pior máfia que existe, que é o Estado”.

 Em razão disso, foi processados por dois servidores do órgão, que reclamaram de terem suas imagens usadas sem consentimento no vídeo.

 Sem aceitar a autoridade do Estado, Fraga ignorou o processo, não sem antes colocar mais alguns vídeos no YouTube reclamando da perseguição que sofria. E, lá pro fim de 2015, ele escafedeu-se sem deixar registros como endereços, documentos e patrimônio. Seu paradeiro até hoje é desconhecido.

 Em círculos anarcocapitalistas, especula-se que ele tenha convertido todo o seu patrimônio em bitcoins, as moedas virtuais que ultrapassam fronteiras e sobre as quais não há regulação central. Ele foi um dos primeiros entusiastas delas, por volta de 2010, quando ainda eram praticamente desconhecidas.

 Ancaps adoram bitcoins, pois seu conceito é justamente o de prescindir de uma autoridade como um Banco Central. É como se fosse uma parte da utopia de um mundo sem Estado que se tornou concreta.

 Vem daí a hipótese de que está rico, já que as bitcoins subiram de uma cotação de menos de US$ 100 há dez anos para US$ 11.750 na cotação da última quinta-feira (8).

 O fato é que, ao sumir, ele se tornou lenda. Talvez esteja fora do Brasil, embora a Justiça tenha suspendido seu passaporte. Ainda existe um[ canal dele no YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22mMCSbj3tQ), com 114 mil inscritos, mas o último vídeo é de setembro de 2015.

 Recentemente, falei com diversas pessoas da comunidade anarcocapitalista sobre ele. O clima é de mistério.

 Um empresário do setor de bitcoin me disse que há alguns meses mandou uma mensagem para um endereço de celular que seria de Fraga e a mensagem chegou a ser visualizada. Mas não foi respondida.

 Uma coordenadora de diversos fóruns ancaps na internet para quem perguntei se sabia onde Fraga está rapidamente mudou de assunto. Outro afirmou que tinha quase certeza do paradeiro dele, mas obviamente não quis me revelar nada.

 Nas redes sociais ancaps, Fraga é um ícone de rebeldia, quase um James Dean. Há grupos de discussão de Facebook em sua homenagem, como o Instituto Dâniel Fraga de Estudos Anarcocapitalistas, e outros semelhantes.

 Com o sumiço, o jeito foi a Justiça Federal suspender o processo contra ele, o que aconteceu em agosto do ano passado. A justificativa da juíza Raecler Baldresca é música para os ouvidos anarcocapitalistas.

 “O querelado [Fraga] não foi localizado em nenhum dos endereços constantes dos autos, mesmo após diversas pesquisas e consultas às operadoras de telefonia, provedores de internet e Tribunais Regionais Eleitorais, havendo fortes indícios de que esteja se ocultando”, escreveu ela.

 Por dribles assim é que Dâniel Fraga é hoje um mito. Uma espécie de [Belchior](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2009/08/616174-barbara-gancia-sumico-de-belchior-estaria-ligado-a-problemas-financeiros.shtml) dos ultraliberais.",2019-08-10 00:02:14

ewfmq16,Tommy123hold,1,"I'm holding 8 digits usd in Eth and I have same questions and since one year I write here occasionally about that same topic and since we have the most and best used blockchain we should have best performance as well. 

BUT WE don't have cause we overpaying for security like 10-30 x times more daily than any other blockchain accept bitcoin which is more store of value now and bought by big institutions and out of competition for ethereum for now.

Will change with Eth 2.0 but that's probably 3 years aways.

Till then we have no real demand to absorb 2-3 Mio usd daily in New created Eth supply.

All other projects have daily inflation max 100 k a day probably.

Nobody overpaying for security with new tokens each day like ethereum. 

Since price is demand vs supply that's the only logical answer. 

It's ridiculous we have more tx daily than all the other projects together but we have no invesrmsnd demand who can absorb 100 Mio new Eth each mounths.

In 2016 we paid 300 k a day for security and nothing happens this is 90% less daily selling pressure. 

95% of Eth in circulation just being hold by investors the 12000 new coins are big factor for the price and the trading volume is faked anyway and rest is mostly Bots.

There is no logical explanation why normal investors would sell now since everyone knows its undervalued compared to Btc. 

Half block reward to 6000 till Eth 2.0! 

Paying 300 usd * 600= 1.8 Mio daily for security is sufficient enough till we have POS.

Otherwise we continue to underperform against projects with zero usage and devs but without any daily selling pressure from miners or compared only Max  100 k a day.",2019-08-10 00:24:21

The BCH lost more than 97% of its value and it’s now priced: 0.029 Bitcoin, I repeat just in case you didn’t realized it: 2.9% the price of the Bitcoin since the fork. Follow the trend and do your math to see where it will end in the next 2 years.

I don’t disagree with the number but whatever the BTC/BTC exchange rate  it remains that BTC is a different project now.

For those who believed in Bitcoin as first intented, only BCH represents it.

And well old timers are used to massive price swings.. so it is not low price that will make them give up Bitcoin (as described in the WP)

So i doubt you will see BCH community support reduce or disappear.

ewj02m3,thebigdolphin1,1,"- Extremely simple from an end-user perspective — literally enter the recipient address, the amount, and press send
- Real-world use cases (pretty much a direct replacement for digital currency)
- Perfect for payments and P2P money transfer
  - Practically instant transactions
  - No fee to send funds
  - Can send incredibly small amounts (even less than a billionth of a cent)
- Scalable: the performance of the network will improve as network speeds and server hardware progresses, unlike with many other cryptos (eg. Bitcoin is always limited to ~10min per block &amp; 1MB of transactions per block)
- Utilises a variant of DPoS (*Delegated Proof of Stake*):
  - Can easily and reliably see how decentralised the network is, and which entities have the most power. With other mining-based crypto-currencies (which use Proof of Work), the current *hash rate* (compute power for mining) is simply a calculated estimate based on the current difficulty, how generating the work is expected to take, and how fast it actually takes. Realistically, a large business or government could already have the hardware set up to obtain &gt;50% of the network, allowing them to prevent transactions or double-spend — all without any warning beforehand.
  - PoW (*proof of work*) potentially allows ASIC and chip manufacturers to have great control over the network — these businesses can develop specialist hardware to compute the block work required at a faster rate, all without anyone knowing. While companies such as Antminer might sell their ASICs to general consumers, they could easily withhold a much faster or energy-efficient product from the public and instead use them to obtain the block reward and fees from mining, or even gain &gt;50% control of the network.
  - Allows people who hold the currency to decide who does and doesn't have authority within the network, unlike with PoW coins where better hardware = more control.
  - Is environmentally-friendly, especially in comparison to PoW/mining coins such as Bitcoin.
- Completely unique technology: Nano isn't a fork of a pre-existing crypto-currency, but instead an entirely new technological development
- Exceptional team behind Nano:
  - Frequently interact with the community on security concerns and future updates
  - Are in direct contact with many exchanges, merchants and point of sale vendors, who they reach out and offer integration support to
  - Set realistic aims and targets for what they believe Nano can achieve, and treat it as a functional currency rather than a quick investment
  - Have arranged various public meet-ups and presentations for people and businesses who are interested to attend
  - Are expanding and creating unique and affordable crypto-currency hardware (Appia for point of sale, Jolt for hardware wallets)
- A positive and healthy community:
  - There has been absolutely no evidence of censorship on any of the communication platforms (Reddit, Discord), and people are free to openly discuss the technology and it's potential flaws
  - Almost all the members are respectful and happy to talk with people who disagree with the technology
  - An immense number of community projects have been built for and around Nano",2019-08-11 02:49:37

ewj2iix,dalebewan,1,"Definitely better, but maybe too specific.  That's an okay description of the Bitcoin blockchain, but doesn't necessarily fit everything out there calling itself a blockchain.  I'd also want to reword the bits about ""transactions"" since it would imply a transaction-chain is also a blockchain which it really isn't (the significant difference being the blocks...).

Perhaps it might be worth asking what you intend to use the definition for.  Personally, I tend to simply avoid the word anyway except when specifically in the context of a particular chain such as ""the Bitcoin blockchain"" or ""Ethereum's blockchain"".

If really pushed to provide one, my description would be something like: ""*a data structure consisting of a series of discrete collections of data called blocks, where each block contains a reference to the previous block in the series*"".",2019-08-11 03:06:26

for example, your specs listed aren't cheap imo some 12-14 year old future pc builder who relentlessly watches every linus tech tips episode etc would see your list and be like heh overkill, no pride in that because that's the scale he sees it in. he doesnt have $1k+ to make it work like you so he negotiates with himself. He could get a 1700, 8gigs of 2400 ram and an rx 480 be up and running in fortnite by the end of the night for possibly half the price without being unhappy with his purchase.  


Same applies to the crypto phase of 2017. People saw Bitcoin and coupling alts increasing in value. With increase in USD value people were looking for shortcuts or ""negotiating"" with themselves on how to participate in the ecosystem without necessarily buying one whole expensive volatile bitcoin. Cause what is Bitcoin anyways? Can I buy coffee with it? no? Why would I want it? Oh I can mine the Bit cone indirectly with the 980ti I already own? Bet? Tf is Ethereum and tf is Vitalik Buterin?   


Oh shit, this is actually kinda profitable? Maybe I should buy a few more GPUs to stay competitive. An ASIC here and ASIC there and wow I am securing the network. Lost money 2018. Build a Bitcoin node 2019. Rarely use it because I don't have much Bitcoin despite being in the ecosystem for years but still it's pretty cool considering setting up a bitcoin node is like owning your own bank. Wells Fargo charges me $12 a month if I don't hit their requirements. System requirements for a Bitcoin node though? I'm running mine on an Odroid HC2, which is miles slower than my main rig with a 1800x and 1080ti.   


If anything, it's crazy I can be my own decentralized bank off basically a rPi. How's that for a weekend rPi project?   


Personally, 2017 would've been a hell of a lot more fun if I was rocking 36 1070's in my mining farm but the thought of selling them when prices went down, listing them, worried buyers complaining about it being a mining card etc kinda makes me glad I didn't get a loan or whatever to do all this (I feel like a lot of people did this in 2017-2018 with varying results...)",2019-08-11 00:10:24
ewijvxs,ChiBitCTy,1,"I absolutely hate the comparison.  Own gold as a hedge (physical, as equity form is too closely tied to market swings) and its a great asset for just that. 

I can’t use gold to buy much of anything without the hassle of converting it (finding a decent deal..do I use kitco or jmbullion, Facebook or Instagram, sell it at a brick and mortar, or some other OTC option).  It also often needs to be held for some time to even recoup the initial investment (covering the premium paid for buying it..was it a coin or bullion, which brand etc etc). 

Bitcoin can be used at more and more places as a form of payment. Can’t use it to pay for something and need  good old cash?..sell it on Coinbase or Localbitcoins or one of a number of other OTC options. While not perfect, much easier. 

Bitcoin is inherently not an investment, however compared to gold and other metals..it’s sure as heck a much better one. It’s a payment system that’s still in the 1st inning, headed to the bottom of the first. Gold will never be that. 

Own both, but know why and what it’s for, as they aren’t the same.",2019-08-11 00:27:11

ewihpc0,smilyfaith,1,"&gt;And a bunch of clueless fucking idiots keep harping about how bitcoin and paypal being banned is a bad thing.

No sir! Bitcoin is banned but paypal and other forms of online digital wallets like skrill, payza, payoneer, etc are not banned at all. Many of them can even withdraw to Nepalese banks directly.  


So, shove it up your ass your.

  
It's fucking moronic idiots stupid cunts like some people who don't understand how they are delaying our ecommerce digital economy. Instead of regulating and creating new systems to make the businesses, freelancers easy to offer their service to international market and get paid in dollars or euros, they just banned it or make it fucking very very hard to the money on the hand.  


Remittance one of the biggest economic backbone of the country. Same way, digital ecommerce can be another economic backbone. You have no idea how much Nepalese are earnings in dollar or euros online. But because these stupid cunts who have the same idea as yours or make same excuse and make it hard to get the money here in Nepal they lose at least 10-30% in fees alone, sometimes they get the account frozen because it's against the payment processors or wallets' TOS for Nepalese to use. So, hundreds even thousands of dollar is lost.

Let me frigging ask you, when will Nepal be ready for these online digital wallet, international transactions? Never? Another 20 years? 50 years? Unless you fucking start it, it's never ever gonna be ready. The system isn't going to come by itself with passing of time. You start it, regulate it, optimize it, upgrade it whatever the fuck it need to be.  


So, once again, shove it up your ass!

ewolv1n,Amiller1776,1,"1) What if a foreign entity uses American currency on foreign land? They are bot bound to our laws and do not oay our taxes, so making it currency based doesnt hold uo to reality.

2) Many libertarians prefer a form of decentralized currency. The fact that the government forced a monopoly on currency does not make our use of it consentual. Currency is a necessity for high performing societies, and the government siezed control of that medium.

3) By your logic, if I only trade in bitcoin from now on, then I would be within my rights to never pay taxes again. So too would be any billionaire who decides to liquidate property in bitcoin.

4) Even if we accept.your premise and ignore the obvious exceptions, that's not enough for a ""spcial contract"" to be legitinate. Because a contract is clearly written and each part is agreed to. The simple format of ""if you do X we get to do ANYTHING WE WANT FOREVER"" is not legitimate. No contract on earth works that way. So you might be able to justify a SALES TAX with your argument. But what about property tax? The mere existence of property tax means you *can't own property*.

ewohnvw,CryptoGuard,1,"Particl rocks :P So to answer a question nobody asked...yet...What's the difference with OpenBazaar? Because everyone always asks this question lol...  
Well...the escrow is a big one. OB basically has a 2-of-3 multi-signature escrow where the vendor is one sig, the buyer is another, and the a commonly agreed upon moderator is the third one. I met an OpenBazaar vendor at MCC who claimed he usually was just doing both the selling and moderation of his own deals, so basically, he owns 2 of the 3 keys and can basically do what he wants. It's a system that really opens itself up to gaming (as in gaming the system), and in my very personal opinion, is probably worse for the customers than regular eBay/Amazon customer support. Besides, if something goes wrong in a transaction, and the moderator doesn't show up for a week, well you have to wait for him to move forward and hopefully get a resolution go your way. It's also not very good in terms of privacy (think about the fact that the moderator will get a lot of data from transactions, such as user accounts, discussions, tracking number, etc). Oh and...don't forget, even though Haven/OB claims they do not charge big fees, **OB moderators do charge a hefty fee for escrowing transactions**. Last time I checked it was 5% to ungodly high levels like 50%. 

Whereas with Particl, it's more like a **2-of-2 multi-signature escrow supported by double deposits and MAD game-theory**. There's no other party that can mine your data while acting as moderator, there's no other party other than the two involved charging fees (the only fee is the listing fee, which also acts as a deterrent for vendors to keep dead listings up...in that case, fees are good because no one wants a ton of listings but no one to pick up the order when you place it), and there's also no collusion possibility like with OpenBazaar (i.e. the vendor holding 2 of the 3 keys, or being in cahoots with the moderator). It's also much more scalable and goes as fast as both parties want to move, no need to wait on the moderator to ""settle"" the trade when something goes wrong.  

Also, OB/Haven is not really a privacy-focused marketplace, at least, not as far as I understand it. I spoke to one of their back-end devs at a Consensus afterparty (same week as MCC) and he told me the privacy aspect of the marketplace is basically an ""enforced privacy policy"", as in, data do gets stored somewhere on servers or database, but it gets deleted by the Haven team. That, to me, was a huge turn off, since any government with a subpoena or just really a hacker could probably still harvest the data. Now I realize it’s coming from the mouth of just one of their dev, and he might not know the whole picture of the project and whatnot, but that behavior alone really highlights the difference in approach to privacy between OB/Haven and Particl: OB/Haven sounds more like “trusted privacy”, as in “hey, trust me I will keep your data safe”, whereas Particl is more trustless, as in “you don’t even need to trust anybody, privacy is guaranteed by encryption”. So depending on your need to privacy, one might fit better than the other. 

It’s also important to note that Particl is much earlier in development, and OB were the first attempt at building a decentralized marketplace and personally I think they are heroes for attempting this when no one had done it before them. They truly are pioneers.

So the Particl team carefully looked around, used some of the work done in SDC + their research into other decentralized marketplaces, and took the good and improved on the bad of which was done before them. It’s a much more efficient code, although, yes, there definitely is still a LOT of improvements to be made.

So **tl;dr**, and goddamn I got carried away lol, the main differences between OB/Haven and Particl are as follow: 

**- OB has more features than Particl**

**- Particl is in a earlier stage of development, but they are, in my opinion, even more ambitious in their vision than OB is because of the unconditional commitment to privacy made by Particl**

**- Particl is much more private (it has a trustless privacy setup vs a trusted privacy setup)**

**- Particl is cheaper to use (no escrow fee unlike OB/Haven)**

**- Particl uses a trustless escrow and OB uses a trusted escrow (pros and cons on both sides, I guess, but I find OB’s trusted escrow to be more problematic to both vendors and buyers than Particl’s escrow and even eBay/Amazon/Alibaba’s escrow systems are)**

**- OB has a mobile application (Haven), Particl does not…yet**

**- OB uses servers, Particl doesn’t**  


So this is my two cents shill-ish post lol, honest opinion from a guy that sees decentralized marketplace as the next big thing after Bitcoin/cryptocurrency. After all...decentralized currencies relying on central infrastructure (traditional marketplaces, payment processors, exchanges, etc) just doesn't make sense imo.",2019-08-12 22:57:26

These are people who have probably spent the better part of a decade with Bitcoin through 3 different drops in value of 80% or more and three different increases of 30X (from sub $1 in 2009-early 2011 to $33 in mid 2011), 500X ($2 in Fall of 2011 to over $1k in Fall of 2013), and 115X ($165 in January 2015 to $19000 in December 2017).

Bitcoin and ethereum are both extremely volatile, so thats a silly argument. Ethereum is down much farther from its ATH than Bitcoin though, so very strange you would bring that up.

Also, the disruption of the monetary system is a market of hundreds of trillions of dollars. The potential market for dapps is a small fraction of that. (Not all apps should/can be decentralized)

You may say that, ""Ethereum will be better money than Bitcoin"". That's simply untrue if you understand the tech. Ethereum has made technical sacrifices to generalize its system (turing completeness for example) while bitcoin remains laser focused on being the best digital money.

Again, Ethereum is a good project, and will likely coexist with Bitcoin for a long time. If you don't understand, I would suggest doing more research.",2019-08-12 23:02:33

BCH does not have signature aggregation.  That work is being researched by Pieter Wuille of Blockstream, and is likely over a year out.

ewoo4kr,LargeSnorlax,1,"I've got some time, so lets give it a go.

First , rare are the users who care about the rules of anything, unless it directly affects them. This goes for not only the subreddit rules, but the reddit rules themselves, for things like vote manipulation, brigading,  ban evading and other stuff that reddit admins will site ban you for (if they decide to care on that specific day, always a toss up).

The few users that do care usually care only because it directly hurts their pocketbook. When their posts get removed or they are banned, they lose clicks, and therefore their money. This is why users are often furious at moderators, because they think that unpaid volunteers are directly affecting their bottom line. 

Often, it is easier for people to create a social media crusade, sending their followers after people they dislike, rather than following the rules of a forum. People do some crazy stuff  (especially in the crypto community) like doing actual illegal things like posting bounties for doxxing information, or swatting random people because they think they have a moderators personal information.

People who get banned or have their content limited on reddit usually go crazy in some way, because they can't handle the fact that they have done something wrong, or try to justify to themselves that what they did was not wrong. I have had people on their 4th account ban who try to coordinate upvotes on secret telegrams or private slack channels form conspiracy theories that the mods are ""directly targeting them"" because they hate certain coins, or even the person themselves. 

Cryptocurrency is weird because literally everyone wants their post to go viral,  so they will do literally anything to get that, even if it means shattering every rule. They dont care, its just reddit, right? So, they will sit in secret social media channels (or, they think they are secret at least)  and tell thousands of people to upvote their reddit posts. Then, when blatantly caught, they will argue as if they did nothing to break the rules, and that mods are being tyrants.

Like kael said, one of the biggest problems is that mod tools on reddit suck. We don't have vm tools, we have to build our own. We don't have trackers, have to build our own. Can't see ips, have to make up a database and link people like crazed maniacs.

On top of that, you have the people who are convinced everything is a massive conspiracy, because shady things have gone on in reddit before. I have read twitter threads where i am accused of doing one thing, and manipulating a project, and other ones where i am apparently shilling the same project. I have read articles that say jwinterm sips mimosas with greg maxwell. I have seen people offer bitcoin for doxxing information, and pay themselves under a pseudonym for uncovering inaccurate information because they are so mad a post was removed that instead of trying to talk to us, they put out a hit like a psychopath.

Basically, volunteer moderating is weird.",2019-08-13 00:13:03

ewoobug,m4ktub1st,1,"&gt; Do I have to leave the ""Bitcoincash:"" at the beginning of the address when I am sending it to someone?

No.

&gt; Why is it there?

It makes things explicit, when needed.

For example, you can have a ""bitcoincash:"" and a ""simpleledger:"" address. The prefix helps to distiguish the intended use case and avoid mistakes like sending SLP tokens to addresses where only BCH is expected.

Also, in web pages you need a prefix like that to make your wallet open when you click a link. For Bitcoin it's ""bitcoin:1..."" although the prefix is not part of the address. With CashAddr (the Bitcoin Cash address format) the prefix is a valid part of the address which means you can click the link or simply copy the link and it will always be a valid address.

You can try that with the addresses at the bottom of https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/. If you right click the Bitcoin Cash address and choose ""Copy link address"" you will get a valid Bitcoin Cash address that you can paste in any wallet or online service. That's not true for the other address formats.",2019-08-13 00:15:20

The point of the argument is to make the new user aware that option exists, and that it is how Bitcoin BTC used to work. Again, at the time the BItcoin community loved the way it worked, so new users may wish to have that experience too, which is now no longer a viable option with BTC.

Hey 👋 there paid Blockstream trolls using the Cobra Divide-and-conquer tactic..

Hey bch shouldn’t shit talk .. bla bla bla.. lets just be another alt coin and fade into obscurity.

How about fuck no? We need to ram into peoples heads the real story which is that the bitcoin project got derailed by the Bankers and fee sucking interests.

Bch is the real bitcoin; btc is a shitcoin of epic proportions which is being slowly designed to be worse eg spv efficiency reduction, replace by fee, scamson mows trolling idiotic comments, 1mb cap etc. https://youtu.be/q-sMbf2OzOY molyneux s video.

I’m just gonna say yeah it’s nice to have all the bch features and all that, but the narrative is more important than the tech. Bitcoin was designed to replace the shit technology and zero innovation of the banking world, who played with citizens money and got bailed out by taxpayers when they should have bailed in their own resources.

If we just focus on bch features well great were another altcoin-shitcoin.

Bch is the closest genetic ancestor to SN’s initial project, 

All those years of lies of Adam Back , compromise, S2X , backing out etc.

It’s clear the banking cabal have bought these immoralists out. The stakes are high and people should use both exit - bch and voice - narrative.

ewtaeoa,GKLemon,2,"So I see a lot of people saying ""this is the bottom of the correction"" or that 4 Hr RSI will provide a bounce, etc.

No problem. And I would like to offer another scenario for consideration.

This scenario involves bitcoin being in a combination correction and the 3 drive from 9.1k-12.1k is a ""bull trap"".

Why is it a bull trap?

1. It has a really low volume. A new wave of impulse countertrend (from the corrective trend 13.6k-9.1k) would need a significantly higher volume to be a true impulse.
2. It ended on a diagonal triangle, a continuation pattern in a bull trend, and broke DOWN.
3. After breaking down, it formed another diagonal triangle and broke down again. We can assume that's the trend reversal toward bearish trend and an incoming 3 drive is coming.

 [https://imgur.com/mTyh44b](https://imgur.com/mTyh44b)

Why is this scenario likely?

1. Bitcoin corrected the 7.5k-13.6k rise on the drop to 9.1k
2. Bitcoin did not correct the 3.1k-13.6k rise. What happened? Of course, it doesn't mean bitcoin price absolutely NEEDS to correct, but it's pretty abnormal to have parabolic rise without correction. The 30% correction is simply not enough to attract buying liquidity. Therefore we saw low volume price rise (disbelief rally) that is mostly targeted to exchange retail fomo buyers' money into institutional player's wallet. If you got chopped up in the past couple days or week, that's what happened. You donated to MM.
3. So what about the rest of the correction? Will we are likely to see it play out in 2 combination pattern.
4. The first pattern, a 3-3-5 already played out from 13.6 - 9.1k
5. The second pattern, possibly a 5-3-5 is going to play out now. I don't want to predict what type of corrective pattern will occur, but a 5-3-5 is most likely to occur due to the fact that we had 2 breakdown from 1 ending diagonal and 1 leading diagonal.

In this scenario, the best play is to wait for confirmation if you haven't shorted 11.8k or 11.4k

A slightly riskier play would be to short 10950-11100. This is risky because if we are not in a 5-3-5, but instead another 3-3-5, you'll be stopped out and lose money.

So far, the overall structure supports 5-3-5 correction down to 7.4k-7.8k but again, that number might be front-runner or driven down further. Most of the moving averages are about to turn down, supporting a 3 driver structure from current PA. Momentum also supports a 5-3-5 structure and now we are in the 3 drive.

The only thing that is supporting a potential 3-3-5 potential is literally the 4 hour RSI.

I'm currently short from $11430. Looking to add more leverage when PA bounce to 10950-11100 area.

I do think though, that there is a significant risk involved.

Now to your arguments. First I do not see what you mean when you say that traditional currency ""can't be accessed by a huge part of the world economy"".

Second, you haven't addressed in any way my original claim that using limited-supply currency will lead to depression, because it will reduce the amount of capital available for investements.

Third, you are critiquing not the traditional currency itself, but the central banks policies, including low inflation and QE. So, supposing that central banks regulate currency in a way to have exactly 0 inflation/deflation (which is easily achievable), would you be happy with traditional currency?

ewu4dqf,ExtraIncrease,1,"Fun fact: only a minority of people have ever, in earths history, thought it flat. The vast majority of the population knew it was round, even centuries ago.

My question is: why do you need a simulation?

(I'll have to go through your pseudo code later, when I can tab format it for easier reading, but I do appreciate your including it)

I'm trying to follow your 2nd paragraph, but you've got numbers that seem to come from nowhere, so it's difficult to follow when you say ""1.5 Bitcoin"" when it feels like an arbitrary number, but you've used that specific number so many times it can't be.

You address the issue of full block space, which does happens, but that doesn't (usually) complicate the issue of a double spend, as the transaction with the higher fee directly replaces the transaction with the lower fee, meaning that even under the heaviest of congestion, there's no issue of block space (provided the double spend is the same or smaller).

I don't seem to be following you, because I feel like you're trying to complicate the matter and are getting lost (or are trying to apply a ""how to double spend X blocks in the past"" algorithm for an unconfirmed transaction, which doesn't abide by the same rules).

Let me ask you this:

You claim that for small Bitcoin transactions, while Bitcoin's price is high, you only have to wait a creation of a second to confidently accept an unconfirmed transaction.

What happens when I send you 1 BTC with a few of 0.001 BTC, wait 3 minutes (no block found) and then send myself 0.99 BTC with a fee of 0.011 btc?

ewychgm,Rich_retard,1,"&gt; Het percentage van de gehele markt wat bestaat uit bitcoin fluctueert maar er is (nog) geen enkel punt geweest waarop BTC de #1 positie afgestaan heeft.

Dat is wel een lastig punt, de BTC-dominantie heeft ook rond de 33% gestaan (tov iets van 67% nu). Stel dat we weer terug gaan naar de 33%. Die beweging zou je in zijn geheel niet mee pakken als je alleen in de BTC zit, terwijl de market cap dan wel flink groeit (bij gelijkblijvende BTC-prijs). 

&gt; Ten tweede is de marktcap in de cryptowereld niet gelijk aan de relevantie van een munt. Er zijn een redelijk aantal projecten met een hoge market cap maar die slechts op een handjevol plekken te verhandelen zijn en een bijzonder laag volume hebben. Een voorbeeld hiervan is nummer 23 Maker [MKR]. Ook zijn er een aantal projecten dat niet meer ontwikkeld wordt, of dat hun marketcap ontleent aan het feit dat ze een fork zijn. Voorbeelden zijn Ethereum Classic (ETC) en Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) Dit soort projecten zijn wellicht niet zo interessant om in je portfolio te hebben voor de lange termijn.

Dat van die forks is een punt dat ik niet opgenomen heb in de analyse, maar iets waar ik zelf ook al een probleem zag. Ik vraag mij zelfs af of Bitcoin Cash (nu nummer 4) van zichzelf enige waarde heeft.

I actually like Peter Schiff quite a bit, he's a market contrarian and can provide a lot of useful insight in many other economic areas (I do disagree with him on bitcoin though). It's not that he's uneducated, his background is more with the Austrian School of economics so he'll often try to reason things out from first principles. If you compare bitcoin and gold from first principles, it's not hard to see where he's coming from, bitcoin doesn't have any ""intrinsic"" value (the only thing you can do with it is trade it with other people), whereas gold (or silver/oil/other commodities) can have value even if you don't plan on selling it to someone else (jewelry, electronics, etc). Not saying this is the correct way to think about bitcoin or money in general, just how you could see it from his perspective.

ex04mue,bitusher,2,"The reason Bitcoin has removed the size limit of 1MB blocks and increased to a total of 4 million units of weight is to balance the resource costs on full nodes and make Bitcoin more secure and more scalable. Signatures can be pruned out and have less of an impact in a transaction therefore have less weight. The re-balancing of these resource costs allow the UTXO to not grow out of control and thus makes Bitcoin scale better. 

**If you want to check the weight of a tx than check out one of these Block explorers-**

Example - https://blockstream.info/tx/1d34d9f6c5a91de6e8c6ec003bec298c0733963a20ff2bb025b31f2ef66007f3?expand

Look under ""WEIGHT UNITS""

**If you are curious to the math on how the tx is calculated and the limits onchain than here-**

The max size is 3.7MB as already tested long ago - https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5f507l/core_is_the_new_big_blocker_37mb_mined_on_testnet/

The size of the block doesn't matter much in the context , what matters is the tx throughput, so here is the math if you are curious- (not including future improvements with MAST and schnorr)

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/59408/with-100-segwit-transactions-what-would-be-the-max-number-of-transaction-confi

4 bytes version

1 byte input count

Input

36 bytes outpoint

1 byte scriptSigLen (0x00)

0 bytes scriptSig

4 bytes sequence

1 byte output count

8 bytes value

1 byte scriptPubKeyLen

22 bytes scriptPubKey (0x0014{20-byte keyhash})

4 bytes locktime

&gt;This sums up to a total of 82 bytes for the non-witness part. So with a total non-witness blocksize of 1 million bytes we get a maximum of 12195 transactions. Assuming that all spent outputs were P2WPKH the witness part for each transaction consists of two pushes: one for the signature and one for the pubkey. These are around 72 bytes and 33 bytes long, and each need a length prefix of 1 byte. Additionally there is 1 byte witness version. So the total witness size is 108 bytes. With 3 MB of space in the witness block left, this brings us to about 27777 witnesses per block. So the limiting factor is the space in the non-witness part of the block, so that's the final number that we should consider.

&gt;Notice that I used the non-segwit serialization for the non-segwit part since that is what non-upgraded nodes will enfore. Notice also that this is an extreme example, since most transactions are not single-input-single-output. A corresponding non-segwit transaction would have a size of 192 bytes, which, together with the 1MB size limit brings us to 5208 transactions per block, **compared to 12195 max segwit transaction per block.**

&gt;The second part of your question regarding maximum UTXO in a block is rather easy. We'd like to amortize the overhead from the transaction structure, and maximize inputs + outputs. Since inputs are larger than outputs we will simple use a single input and compute the **maximum number of outputs that fits in a block which is 32256.** Since the outputs are non-segwit data, it also changes minimally from before the segwit activation (only the signature from the one input is moved to the segwit part). Therefore the maximum UTXO churn is 1 UTXO gets removed, 32256 get added. For comparison, without segwit the maximum number added was 32252. Notice that there may be other limits that I haven't considered, but this definitely are the upper limits, and these limits are unlikely to have changed during the activation of segwit.

**12195/600 = 20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max**, thus my 14 TPS is very conservative average

**32256/600 = 53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block**

Of course you know as well as I do Blocks are often found quicker than 10 minutes so these TPS numbers are variable and sometimes it will be higher than this. Also this doesn't include tx throughput on other layers which allows for millions of TPS.

ewzapeu,dEBRUYNE_1,2,"&gt; You could sure have listings on alt to alt only exchanges. 

Should first be noted that Monero has already fiat pairs on prominent exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken. 

&gt;This could very well extend to banking services to crypto only exchanges (you do realise they need banking services too to make revenue and pay suppliers and employees). 

That seems a bit far stretched. Any opposition will come from having a direct fiat pair (where the bank thus directly facilitates withdrawals of fiat obtained by selling, e.g., XMR). 

&gt;So doesn't this mean privacy coins need the existence of non-private coins to survive or at least gain more userbase (And hence to gain in price)?

ewzlu5t,DumbRetardedTroll,2, This is good for BitCoin.,2019-08-16 04:32:09
ewzony2,Supernova752,2,"Here's the simplest explanation:

VET's twin token system(VET/VTho) derives value solely from the businesses using it.  Vtho is the ""gas"" of the ecosystem - Any transaction going through VeChain requires/burns Vtho, so any business using VeChain must either purchase Vtho or hold VET to generate Vtho themselves, or a combination of both.

Think of VET like Gas Station which passively &amp; constantly produces Vtho(Gas).  Think of Transactions like cars that require/burn VTho(gas).  The more transactions happening, the more gas is burnt and in-demand, and the higher the value of both the Gas &amp; Gas Station.  There's a limited amount of ""Gas Stations"", so in essence you own part of the network and generate passive income from the transactions in a way that allows the price to appreciate for you, while the costs for enterprises remains stable/predictable.

The real beauty of it is VeChain has a patent-pending technology called Multi-Party Payment Protocol(MPP), which means a business can sponsor the cost of a transaction for their customers.  So instead of a customer having to buy 2 cents of VTHO to cover the transaction, the business will cover the cost instead.  I'll give you an example of how this would work:

Alex goes to Louis Vuitton to buy a $4k purse.  Embedded inside the purse is a VeChain NFC chip, scannable by almost any phone and unable to be duplicated - this automatically verifies the purse is authentic, and prevents counterfeits as the purse would need to be destroyed to extract the chip from inside.   Since the NFC chip is unique/unduplicatable, the purse has a unique signature.  This means the purse can literally be transferred into Alex's name, and she can truly ""own"" the purse.  Anyone who steals it, would be unable to say it's theirs or sell it for full value, as the chip would still have Alex's name on it.  This also means it could be marked stolen, and anyone who scans the chip could see that.

To Alex, this is a simple/free process.  She simply uses a Louis Vuitton iPhone app, makes a profile, and has the store transfer the purse into her name.  Since Louis Vuitton is using MPP, they can cover the transaction cost - To Alex this is just another free/simple iPhone app.  This also means she can easily sell it later, transfer it to the new buyer, and the new buyer can feel comfortable knowing it's a real, genuine LV purse, and have Alex transfer it into their name.  They know it's real and they now ""own"" it.  LV gains valuable data about the post-sale lifecycle of their items, and can effectively cut costs and target their customers with ads much more effectively - this data was previously never available.

Variations of this process can be used with Wine, Medicine, Art, Utilities, Cars, etc. - it's a win for both customers and businesses.  These digital barcodes/chips help remove ""trust"" from the equation - you no longer have to ""trust"" that the purse is genuine, or that the $10k wine wasn't replaced mid-transit(the chip is broken when the bottle is opened), or ""trust"" that the sushi was properly refrigerated during transit.  The process is now ""trustless"" as if the chip is intact, that's the genuine product.  If someone does try and game the system, they're writing their names all over the blockchain - it would be much easier to trace/find the thief.

And the real, real key here - **Unlike almost any other crypto,** **VeChain does not require the public to buy it, or even know it exists to use it everyday and have VeChain gain value.**  The real value comes from businesses using it, dApps built on it, all pushing transactions through the network.Walmart, BMW, PwC, BYD, Bright Foods, DNV GL, PICC, Shanghai LNG, China Tobacco, etc, not to mention the dApps built on top of it.  VeChain has already pushed over 1.1 million transactions in a single day, and does hundreds of thousands every day even in it's current infancy stages.   Additionally, this is a competitive advantage for businesses, imagine buying that LV purse and having it transferred into your name, then walking over to Gucci and seeing they don't do that - or buying a $200 wine with a VeChain chip, then walking over to another $500 wine and seeing it doesn't have it.  It's stupid - if you're buying things, you want to ensure that they're real, genuine, and removing trust is huge.  If Walmart significantly adopts VeChain, every single other grocery store would be at a severe disadvantage - they know they can't let Walmart be the only ones with that type of tech.  Bitcoin really wins by dismantling other currencies/having people buy it, VeChain instead offers a win/win for both customers/businesses without the general public having to buy it for it to gain value.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long explanation, but it gives you a good idea of both the tech, it's uses, and how VET/VTho gains value.  Hopefully this helps, if you have any questions I'd be happy to help!",2019-08-16 04:49:24

How do you define ""Altcoin"" and ""shitcoin""?

I'm not sure I agree with how a lot of people push the ""-coin"" narratives, like listing the ""top 10"" or ""most valuable X"" or labeling them an altcoin or shitcoin or whatever.

As far as I'm concerned, the native coin for a network is the top level coin, and they are all alternatives to each other: Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, EOS, Tron(?) etc. These are not interoperable or exchangeable (as in I cannot type in your public address and send you Bitcoin using my Ethereum private key and wallet). If I wanted to say Ethereum network value rose today in comparison to those others, I might say ""Ethereum gain X% today vs. altcoins"", meaning I'm lumping them all together for that comparison.

If the network has tokens/sub-coins, then that's exactly what they are: tokens. I would not say the value of BAT is X and Ethereum is Y, I'd say the Ethereum network is simply greater. (how wrong is that? I'm sure you could make a whole is greater than sum of parts argument...) Do other networks even have tokens?

Shitcoins, to me, are a lot more subjective. They would be altcoins without a large networks, insecure, meager development, or otherwise unproven. Personally I'd consider Litecoin a shitcoin because it seems like it's just a bitcoin fork without a real purpose. I'm not sure if I'd even call a token a shitcoin.",2019-08-16 03:46:13

ex4jn8y,lcvella,1,"Bitcoin.

Started off as peer-to-peer electronic cash system that people actually used, specially when state currency was not an option (Wikileaks after financial blockade, for instance), and was gaining traction on actual day to day trabsactions (Steam once accepted payments in Bitcoin).

Then a small group, controlling the main communication channels, and with interest in selling financial services on top of Bitcoin, managed to revoke repository access and kick out the developers who wanted to allow Bitcoin to grow with the demand. They convinced the majority of the largely non-technical and apolitical group of speculative investors who hold the price of Bitcoin that it is actually good that people stop using Bitcoin due to lack of network capacity, that it okay that Steam and other sellers stopped taking Bitcoin. Such demand would eventually, in the future, be fulfilled by products running on top of Bitcoin (developed by the company they founded, of course).

They did this by means of aggressive PR tactics, including reputation smear campains and thorough silencing of any dissenting voice in the communication channels they controlled, which have been the de-facto communication channels for mass information.

The dissidents fought back, founded an alternative subreddit, and eventually came to support a Bitcoin fork more in line with the original principles and goals of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Cash. But by then the damage was done: being the crippled Bitcoin the flagship of cryptocurrencies, the concept went from revolutionary to a joke useless as money.",2019-08-17 10:38:16

The below chart shows different average daily transaction counts over the last three months compared to Kin’s (combined Kin 2 and Kin 3) payment count: Kin is near the top of the pack, trailing only EOS. This highlights Kin’s core use case; Kin was designed to be used within a messaging app, primarily for microtransactions. This naturally leads to low fees and a high transaction count. Similarly, EOS is designed as a Dapp platform and has low fees, which also leads to a high transaction count.

ex7h39m,SpockSays,1,"Bitcoin is only 10 years old, so its fair to have skepticism. If you have an open mind to it and really take the time to learn/understand how bitcoin works and the value proposition of it, you may find value in it yourself.

Bitcoin is the hardest money humans have ever seen. Bitcoin is even harder than gold, since bitcoin has a truly finite supply and a mining schedule that is fully transparent/visible. Bitcoin has superhero qualities that gold can never have, most notably (IMO) in regards to divisibility and transportability.

Bitcoin is valuable because it's a scarce asset that operates on a decentralized, distributed, trustless system where you can transact value with anyone, anytime, anywhere.

If the bitcoin network is ever fundamentally attacked/hacked/compromised then the entire value proposition will become worthless, so thats essentially the entire ""gamble"" that people are speculating on.

So far, bitcoin has survived its 10 year infancy and has been ""battle tested"" through ongoing attempts to destroy and/or manipulate it by many many many adversaries.

If bitcoin keeps living on, as it currently is, remaining fundamentally unharmed... it is inevitable that it will continue to absorb monetary value into it like a financial black hole, as more and more people will understand it, trust it and adopt it.

Scarcity is fundamentally built into bitcoin, so higher value over time is simply a function of supply and demand as more people adopt it.

In short, the value of bitcoin will be either 2 things: Continuously more valuable on a long term chart or zero.

In my view, since bitcoin has survived its infancy of 10 years, it has spread far and wide enough that it is literally not feasible to be stopped or destroyed.",2019-08-18 01:45:10

exeut62,TheJesbus,1,"- Find a few well-known and widely trusted web pages that can generate hexadecimal private keys and convert hexadecimal private keys to bitcoin addresses

- Download these pages

- Disconnect from the internet

- Open the pages in private browsing mode

- Generate a random hexadecimal private key

- Manually change a bunch of the digits of the private key. You can use dice, or just think of random numbers.

- Write the private key on a piece of paper

All the scripts should generate the same bitcoin address when given the same private key. If one of them is fraudulent, you will immediately notice because it will generate a different address from the same private key.

Preferably: Make sure you don't have any viruses.

Certainly age is not the only factor, but stability and reliability are either directly, or indirectly a function of age, virtually by definition. There is still plenty of garbage around now that I don't trust, even limited to Bitcoin forks. BSV has to a good example - somehow it exists but I'm not sure many would agree it is trustworthy (e.g it's basically centralized AFAI can tell). However, what if it survives another 20 years?! Surely that would increase people's trust in it, for better or worse. The whole market based argument has its place but I think the market is far to young, uncertain and unstable to be a useful measure of anything right now. In many ways it is like the coins themselves - it needs stability, which again, will come with time. But the market is a whole can of worms for another day :)",2019-08-19 00:19:29

_____________________

A *Bitcoin* is a representation that someone somewhere did the work to mine a Bitcoin. It's a representation of the time/power needed to ensure the network is open/secure.

Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that an open, decentralized, permission-less network is inherently valuable as a structure. It's valuable because it's necessary to have a monetary system that no one controls. The bitcoin reward is the incentive to support the network - without actually having to pay someone to support it.
The protocol has a built in method of increasing the value of the network by halving the reward programmatically throughout the network timed cycles. Meaning - every 4 years, you'll get less bitcoin for supporting the network, making bitcoin even more rare and valuable. 

As long as we have the need for a monetary system that no one is able to corrupt - bitcoin will be valuable. The necessity is becoming more and more apparent as more and more government currencies are manipulated and compromised. 

I see bitcoin as a win/win. Either it becomes the world monetary protocol or it keeps the 100's of FIAT currencies in check.

I don't see it completely dominating the world or dying completely. But I do see it doing something in between.",2019-08-20 03:37:19

exffxem,beep_bop_boop_4,1,"I wouldn’t call myself influential, but I like to think of myself as reasonable. Independent contractor here (no affiliation to C0) for about a year now. I can understand the sentiment here. C0 is a powerful actor in the system. You’re not the only one concerned about that. But I would challenge the characterization of C0 as “micromanaging”, or “choosing next steps”. Or the notion that C0 is not committed to further decentralization. Below I’ll defend C0 a bit, then provide some of my own observations and ideas around further decentralization (which everyone, including C0, is working towards. 

&gt; they should be resolved to making proposals and grinding away at code

While the long promised ‘core dev’ spending reporting has not yet materialized, C0 devs have started submitting proposals for work on major projects in the last few months. E.g.,

The [block header consensus change](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58) proposal (to be completed by C0, $20k)
[Decentralized Treasury Spending](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) proposal ($200-250k), which will give stakeholders on-chain power to stop payments and bring the project to a halt if they disapprove of how payments are distributed. 

Work is also progressing on the Contractor Management System (CMS), which is gathering invoicing data. Soon, the system will have the functionality to start reporting spending per category (dev, marketing, per passed proposal, etc.). The next steps involve formalizing rules around bringing on new contractors and an appeals process should a contractor feel they have been wrongly stripped of ability to bill the Treasury. 

&gt; not representing the community in the broad marketing effort, interviews, aka the libra bashing

While jy-p featuring prominently in the media can (and should) be considered as a centralization vector, I would push back against the assertion that Ditto and others are not representing the community. There has indeed been a concerted effort at putting the community at large in the media. Since Ditto came on board, I’ve seen many (mostly) non-C0 people in podcast interviews, Decred Distributed shows, articles, etc., etc.. Too many to list here. I myself underwent media training and was up for a CoinDesk article at one point, but couldn’t do it for privacy reasons (which I won’t go into here). 

I would say look at C0’s past behavior. They built a protocol that allows stakeholders the ability to vote on-chain for consensus rule changes, potentially veto’ing changes they spent months and tons of money implementing. They (or whoever exactly controls the dev fund multi-sig) helped develop Politeia, which has begun systematically shifting control of the budget into the hands of stakeholders. This transition has been happening in phases, but the trend since launch has been for an increasing percentage of the budget to move to stakeholder control. Now C0 is building, at the behest of stakeholders, the ability for stakeholders to veto monthly payments created by the dev fund multi-sig. 

Now, I’m not saying there isn’t still centralization. There is. But the more I study other projects’ governance, the more “decentralization theatre” I see. “DAOs” that are opaque centralized foundations, or DAOs technically voting but the outcome is known beforehand, high barriers to entry, etc. Often, these projects are moving towards more centralized control, not less over time. The conclusion I’ve come to is that Decred has centralized pockets of control (not just C0), but is decentralizing as fast as possible without jeopardizing its execution. As @jet_user points out, this is probably the best strategy. Even Bitcoin, if you look at its history, started out very centralized. Literally a benevolent dictator and a small group of people making all the decisions and mining most of the coins. 

I don’t trust C0’s word (or when they say “soon” (™)). But I do look at their past actions and see a real (and rare) comittment to not only trying to decentralize, but delivering successful infrastructure to do so (e.g. Politeia, CMS).",2019-08-20 03:34:22

tu as acheté 60k€ d'actions et tu demandes si tu dois vendre après une chute de 2.5%?

En 2008 en une semaine tu n'aurais plus que 36k€.
Soit cette perte est acceptable parce que:

 - cet argent c'est pour un horizon lointain et que ça va remonter dans les 10 prochaines années 
 - 60k€ représente une partie de tes actifs (x%) et qu'au final 24k€ de perte ce n'est pas grand chose

Si au contraire tu as mal au ventre rien qu'à l'idée de perdre 10k€ ou que les 60k€ représente plus de 80% de tes actifs alors il est temps de realouer une partie dans des actifs différents et décorélés:

 - résidence principale
 - fond en euros (dette d'état)
 - SCPI d'entreprise
 - Or
 - Bitcoin
 - PME
 - matière premières

Contrairement aux autres commentaires, si tu te sens pas capable de garder ces ETFs et que après une chute de 20% et des lectures alarmistes, tu vendras tout, alors je crois que tu devrais vendre maintenant et limiter la casse. Car des chutes de 20% tu en as au moins 3 tous les 10 ans.",2019-08-21 00:23:24

exhziuk,jojlo,1,"""can also be forked chain-wise.""  
When BCH forked off, BTC never did anything different. It remained both the same product and same chain. Why would it need to change it's name because BCH forked off in a different direction? 

If you believe the original concept of crypto cash then that's fine but its silly to believe that it must also have the same name or branding. LTC carries just as much of the original intent of the bitcoin whitepaper as BCH does and its an easy example to show that it doesn't need or intend to steal the name or branding of the bitcoin product.

1: when I purchased my account, I had to verify ID.... weird especially since I paid with bitcoin which to me defeated the whole reason to use that payment method but it was to far along the process of being sent so I had to comply in order to get the account modded otherwise it’d “refund” the money which was impossible because, well, bitcoin 

2: Upon joining the discord servers with them, I waited for about 3 days for them to get to my order, once they did get to my order, they had modded it literally the day the most recent ban wave was happening and unfortunately the account got banned and reset for 30 days. 

3: I replied on discord along with about 100 other users who were in the same boat and pissed off lol, the manager of the team promised to give redo accounts to all people who were affected by the ban, BAM another 5 days to get the account. 

4: once I got the account back through hell I was able to play just fine with the amount of money. 

5: was it worth it? Possibly if I didn’t get unlucky on that specific damn day that set me back about a week after purchased, would I do it again? Probably not, id much rather play with someone who has the mods because you can have fun playing together which is the point of online, trust me, after spending 300mil on everything so far, it gets boring quick and having a friend play with you to accumulate it makes it 10 times better!

exr43lc,aaj094,9,"Let me for once don my minimalist hat. With that hat on too, I see the world of alts divided into

1. Alts which hope for a possibility of usurping Bitcoin's place as defacto crypto reserve currency - these are the ones who don't pretend to be anything more than a currency coin
2. Every other alt - with purported utility of various hues

Let's focus on 2) for now. My view is that these alts eventually will end up valued strictly on the basis of utility alone as all speculative potential gets competed away by more and more coins that also offer speculation. Then they get valued only by the equation M = PQ/V where PQ = economy created by utility of coin within a given period and V is the velocity. If a coin changes hand x times on average in the given period, it's velocity is x.

Most coins of type 2) will not even lay claim to a large PQ. Even for the most utilised of them, it is arguable how large PQ might be. But the true killing factor will be that v is likely to be large for almost every type 2) crypto i.e people will not sit on a type 2) coin for long if they have no direct utility of it.

These factors will lead to coins of type 2) going down to valuations much much lower than what you see today. The whole talk of bottoming of alts has no logic apart from comparison to an irrational Jan 2018 period.

Meanwhile, what about type 1)? These fundamentally do not need to have any 'utility' as such as they are meant to be wealth or money. Money will be valued by totally different factors such as security, liquidity, ability to transact, acceptability, etc. Winner takes all is a very distinct possibility here unless some form of money offers some distinct characteristic such as privacy and even then it will probably turn out that one among type 1) will hugely dwarf the others among type 1). Right now that winner appears Bitcoin and a notable contender due to its unique privacy features is Monero. Some others pride themselves on scalability and speed but it is doubtful if those features are going to be valued more than security, privacy, liquidity and immutability.",2019-08-23 06:54:19

exq1yyl,Happy_Pizza_,7,"Want to know why we are finding this level as support?

Check out this chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/1LN1G3Vc/

Historically, the 13 week moving average (or 91 day moving average) has served as support during bitcoin dumps.  And right now, we are right on top of it.  Wicks below the 13 week keep getting bought up.

Also, notice that we are also in a large symmetrical triangle with a 2k price target (green lines on the first chart, obviously).  So if we break it, we are going to either 12k or 8k.

Now, this is not necessarily bullish because we did break the 13 week moving average several times during the past 2 previous bull markets.  When we did, we typically found support at the 21-25 week moving average.  See this chart for example:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q8qz9fnv/ 

So the bull scenario is clear:  The symmetrical triangle breaks up, we bounce off the 13 week moving average to 12k before perhaps spending a month moving sideways to cool off.   The bearish scenario is also clear:  The 25 week moving average, which we have historically wicked to is 2k below us, and this symmetrical triangle is targeting precisely that level.

Right now, I'm pretty agnostic as to which scenario will play out.  On the bearish side, I'm really surprised we did not at least touch 11k on the run up a few days ago.  On the bull side I still feel like buyers are showing a lot of strength at lower levels.

Anyway, that's where I see us right now.",2019-08-23 03:02:11

People that buy bitcoin should be doing it for the reason of using a different currency and truly being interested in the technology. 
Bitcoin is at like $9000 right now, and under a year ago it was around $3000 so you could have made bank. But, 2 years (or so) ago it was at $20,000. You should only invest in bitcoin if you literally have extra money sitting around and don’t have debt. It’s just too volatile",2019-08-24 21:49:03
exyfafj,MattAbrams,1,"I still remain strongly negative about how cryptocurrency is trending, at least over the next few months.

Yesterday some users criticized me for being so negative, saying that indicators like whether there are high Purse discounts or the number of Lightning nodes and transactions is not predictive of price.  Those who review my past posts will note that I had warned people here when the daily discussion was in a frenzy about an incoming mania at $12,000 that the indicators did not line up, and that I was selling.  The point is that just because someone is negative does not mean that they have been wrong.

I realized this morning that people might think I'm unreasonably negative is because I forgot to post one of the factors I've been monitoring.  I thought I would share some Google Analytics data from yesterday for the mining pool to point out another indicator that seems correlated to price movements.

I've been struggling for the past few months to understand why we've made so many improvements in profitability, user friendlness, and stability to our pool, and yet hashrate continues to decline relative to the network.  One of the things I noticed is that the age of Proahshing's visitors has trended younger over the past month.  Yesterday, of non-paid traffic, there were about 200 visitors 18-34, while there were about 400 visitors 35-64.  In the past, that 2:1 ratio has been more like 3:1 or even 4:1.

We are not interested in 18-34 year olds because those people typically have lower incomes than 35-64 year olds, so we target ads exclusively towards the older demographic.  Older people have a much higher customer acquisition cost of $20.82, but when they convert, they are much more likely to become large customers that earn us more profit - a lifetime value of almost $80.

Interestingly, the number of older people visiting our site (and more loosely, submitting support tickets when they reveal their age in them) seems to correlate with bitcoin prices.  I suspect that, like with mining, in trading there is a constant background of people younger than 35, who are less likely to have money, but may also be more likely to post here.  These are not the people who move the market.

Instead, I propose that bitcoin bubbles are correlated with periods when age 35+ people show increased interest in cryptocurrencies.  If so, then the Google Analytics demographic data for bitcoin-related websites is a valuable resource to predict market trends.  One of the reasons I've been pessimistic about cryptocurrencies lately is because while the number of young people visiting our site remains steady, we continue to see a decline in the number of older visitors.",2019-08-24 21:57:26

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun

exy6ifs,rocketeer8015,1,"Outlawing is extremely easy, enforcing that is harder. But it places you in extremely dangerous situations, imagine a bad breakup and your spouse accusing you of having a illegal btc wallet. Or a state Trojan infiltrating your pc, maybe a sting operation where a cop poses as someone that wants a payment in btc from you or the other way. 

That’s 10 years right there in India’s proposed law, there goes custody of your kids and **any** hope of a normal employment for the rest of your life. Who would risk a 10 year prison sentence? That’s a harder punishment than rape or murder in some first world countries. At that point really only hardened criminals would use btc, you’d be in one group with terrorists, drug lords and hitmen. Silkroad would look like a college pool party with beer by comparison.

I think there is room to improve bitcoin, but there can be no privacy in a unfree society. The real fight for privacy happens in the voting booth, not on github. Projects like Monero etc are a important bandaid for people in unsophisticated unfree societies. In a sophisticated unfree society ... you only need to slip up once, get your trust betrayed once, underestimate your enemies once and the consequences would be horrible. 

At no point will any form of **money** be able to protect your privacy. Money is something that is used for exchange and barter at its core, it’s at that point where they get you, when you are exchanging your money with someone for something. When the digital world crosses the real world. Like I said the both of us could exchange bitcoin all day already, if that’s all we do it’s private. But if I want to sell you my cannabis sapling, i have to know your address, i have to go to the post office, it would compromise the both of us if I was under observation.

exyzbb8,BitcoinHashPipe,1,"I didn’t say I “prefer to not have them” (taxes). I said that I would prefer that the tax burden shifts from an annual collection on the property owner to a one-time collection from the property buyer at time of sale. An equivalent amount of tax collection can still occur. I could continue to argue further positive economic benefits of such a taxation model.

Also, I’m not “mocking a real estate decision.” I’m mocking the idea that real estate is “all yours” when it isn’t. In fact, I’d even argue that it never is, including even in the *absence* of property taxes. As long as an entity exists that can take it away from you by force of law, it’s never truly “all yours”.

So let me reframe this from Bitcoin’s perspective:  Very recently we’ve seen an announcement from the US government that they are *blacklisting* certain bitcoin addresses associated with nefarious activity. Basically they’re saying that bitcoin that goes through those addresses are now illegal to own. So what happens if I legally purchase some Bitcoin using a US based exchange market and proper KYC verification, then I move that BTC off market to my private wallet. Let’s say I then purchase a widget from a seller and send the seller BTC. Turns out the widget doesn’t fit my widget machine so I return it to the seller. Seller refunds me by sending the same amount of BTC back to me. Turns out that at some point in it’s life this BTC was used in a nefarious transaction with a “blacklisted” wallet. Is the BTC I’m holding now illegal? Can a government blacklist my wallet because of the BTC’s “transaction history”? And if they can, do you think that I actually own the BTC?

Oh yeah, you’re right: I can just move to a different country that doesn’t blacklist BTC wallets.

The truth is, honeybadger Bitcoin doesn’t give a shit. You hold your real estate “property” and I’ll hold my bitcoin.

Oh yeah, one other point. When “you say you can move to a state with no property tax and buy real estate” you do realize that I can’t take that real estate with me to another state, right? You can’t literally move real estate. Again, not really your property. But good luck defending your piece of dirt against the no-coiner invasion. Better start building that citadel, but make sure you pay your property tax. (Mic drop)",2019-08-25 00:01:17

exz6xcf,foobazzler,1,"Trillions of dollars of tokenized assets could be issued on Ethereum and it would only take peanuts in gas fees to distribute said assets. That does not bode well for the price of Eth (my main focus).

You say that Bitcoin is not fit as digital gold, but don't explain why (my article does).

Why do competing chains not have the right profile for DeFi? Some of them can do things that Ethereum cannot (such as pool the security of multiple sidechains, or scale to thousands of tps without relying on the complexity and overhead of sharding and L2).

Bitcoin's slowness won't impede its usage as digital gold. That one use case alone is worth more than any other use case.

If a fork of Bitcoin dilutes a value of Bitcoin, then I can fork Ethereum millions of times to dilute the value and scarcity of Eth.

The $300 trillion you refer to won't ever be reflected in the price of Eth, even if assets worth $300 trillion are tokenized on Ethereum, the Ether itself is proportional to demand of the network and is not a function of the monetary value of the assets it represents. Whereas with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin itself is what's valuable, not anything that uses the Bitcoin blockspace.

&gt; This year, when BTC fell from its 2019 high of $13,800 down to its subsequent low in the aftermath of $9,187... *THAT IS A 50.2% DROP.* ...which puts this current flat period/accumulation period following the massive beat market of 2018...that puts this flat period in unfamiliar/uncharted territory for BTC. Many believe 2019 is either part of the next bull run or its in a flat period (time to accumulate). Most people believe we are out of the bear market...but that logic is debunked when BTC experienced a 50% drop this year. That has never happened in the history of BTC during a flat period or beginning of a bull run period. However, in 2015, BTC plunged from a high of $433 down to $300 which is a 44% drop so I guess that would be similar.",2019-08-26 02:25:25

ey2q9r9,igadjeed,1,"&gt; Why couldn't each participant who adds a block simply randomly select the next participant to add the next block?

Bitcoin's decentralised design does not identify ""participants"" to each other. Every node and every miner operates independently of all the others  

&gt; why does this need to be done via proof of work

Bitcoin is a network of independently operated nodes. Every node has its own copy of the Blockchain. It takes time to propagate a new block to every node in the network. It also takes time for nodes to reorganise their Blockchains if they get out of synchronisation. If new blocks are created too quickly, then it is possible for the node network to get stuck - if propagation and reorganisation time is too slow for nodes to catch up with all the new blocks. To prevent this, Bitcoin blocks are delayed by an average of 10 minutes. This delay is implemented as a brute-force guessing game - mining, or proof of work  

Also  
To prevent alteration of data, blocks are tied together by their hashes. It takes 10 minutes of work by hundreds of thousands of miners to discover a block hash. This means that altering a transaction requires re-hashing the block containing the transaction and re-hashing all subsequent blocks. A thief is prevented from altering a transaction because he can never have enough hashing power to re-hash the blocks",2019-08-26 00:09:44

To scam them into believing that they have no choice but to... activate segwit which most of them were already saying months and years earlier that they want to eventually activate... hmm... so you are saying that they changed their minds from wanting to activate segwit to... still wanting to activate segwit, so... was there any change of mind after all and where is the evidence for that... and which miners are you even talking about? There are many miners. Or... could it be that there was a... how should I put this... a scam to fool people into believing that a scam for miners successfully scammed ""the"" miners and made them do things that they didn't want to do and weren't about to do, like some easily controlled herd of sheep, and that therefore bitcoin can be easily centrally controlled, and so here... buy this new shitcoin instead or whatever.

ey5iax4,Suuperdad,1,"Such a stupid post. 

If you made $7300 on $21.2k, that is 65.5% lower than today's price of $10,364, which puts BTC at 6797.

That means you bought either roughly around Sept 21st, 2018 during the long sideways portion, or May 11th, 2019.

If you bought Sept 21st, 2018 VET price was $0.01385. If you bought May 11th, 2019, VET price was 0.006468.

Drop since Sept 21st, 2018: 67.7%

Drop since May 11th, 2019: 31.1%

Your total invested was 26230.55, and you have lost 64.3%, which means you bought VET somewhere around Sept 21st, 2018.

Holding alts in both the worst downturn, and also on the recovery BTC bullrun has been painful - not just VET, all alts. Even ""alts"" like ETH. I think that's kind of to be expected since during crashes people hold ""gold"" in the stockmarket, and people held BTC in crypto. During the recovery, BTC went on a tear the most, because new people don't come in and buy VeChain, or Nano, they buy BTC. They've likely never even heard of Ethereum and ripple.

I wrote an post on here a during the summer of 2018 telling people to get out of alts and into bitcoin for these exact reasons. And I told them to get into BTC for the ""new money wave"" also. I then told people also that once the new money starts seeing limits on BTC (which we haven't seen yet - I'm talking when transactions aren't going because the mempool is full, and when fees skyrocket, like they did in the fall of 2017), THEN to head into alts.

I have been 80% BTC for about a year now, and I'm really glad I ""listened to my own advice"". I also don't mean this as an ""I told you so"", but rather to say taht even though I'm in BTC 80% for now, I think projects like VeChain specifically (walmart partnership??!!!!, I mean COME ON), have the most opportunity TODAY.

My portfolio today is about now about 60% BTC, 30% ETH, 5% VET, 5% NANO. However, every week I'm slowly converting more and more BTC into ETH. After I see stable signs of the pullback bottom being met, I will only then start pushing back into VET and NANO, and other projects. However, pretty soon, I think ETH, VET, NANO all three of those will be absolute top performers. And I'm not saying that as a ""Reddit shill pack""... 

I'm saying that because ETH will be the smart contract first-mover, it's WAAAAY oversold, and it's hanging on POS/staking news. 

VET - it's pretty clear it isn't going to die where most alts have already died. Walmart involvement is as big as it gets. It's CRIMINALLY understold right now, and I think it could 10x from here and still be undervalued by 10x.

NANO - is at V19, really close to final V20. It does everything BTC wanted to do, but actually better. It's arguably the greenest crypto on the planet, which is going to only get more and more important as we keep burning the amazon rainforest, we keep accelerating towards 415 ppm CO2 and beyond, we start pushing past 5 gigatons methane, and we start getting closer to releasing the 100-1000 GIGATONS of methane under the pacific icesheet's permafrost (which is ACTIVELY MELTING today). Methane is 37x worse of a greenhouse gas than CO2. 

Eventually humankind is either going to wake up and stop the destruction of the planet, or we're, well, fucking toast. Because of that, environmental issues will go from ""oooh that's a nice bonus"", to ""ABSOLUTELY FUCKING MANDATORY"" in the next 10 years. Nano is the only project in all of crypto that has the potential to actually save the human race by eliminating the carbon footprint of the financial industry, and that will go from ""cool"" to absolutely game changing in the future.

There are other great projects for sure, and I will improvise and adapt. I'm just saying that Bitcoin is a great buy now, but people should really be ready to adjust as the global politics change drastically in the next 1 to 5 years.",2019-08-27 00:12:42

You are overlooking Bitcoin's scarcity. Currently 85% of the future global monetary standard is in the hands of less than 1% of humans.

When that number starts to creep up beyond 2% or 3% of humans, you will see an acceleration in FOMO which you probably can't comprehend right now.

Anybody holding bitcoin will be stashing most of it in cold storage. The available liquid bitcoin for most of the world will be &lt;10% of the total bittcoin supply.

Hal's mistake was comparing the estimated global wealth of a few hundred trillion to the 21M total supply of Bitcoin. In reality, that global wealth is going to be largely distributed among ~2M bitcoin because most of the bitcoin in the world will be idling.

As 95% of the world scrambles to accumulate a few thousands satoshis each, the demand will outpace the supply by such a wide margin, and people will be desperate to buy bitcoin, than they will simply pay whatever market price is necessary to get it.

The hyperinflation of the dollar will follow this, as the central bank will want to increase its bitcoin holdings and will print vast amounts of fake money to try and accumulate it.

ey5kd9f,jessquit,1,"yes but when a blockchain has a strategy of always-full blocks, you can't predictably ""broadcast then walk away"" because with an ""always congested"" blockchain your transaction might wait for days or never confirm.

that's why a Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System requires an ""always uncongested"" blockchain the way bitcoin used to be until around 2016-17, and the way BCH works today. As long as the blocks aren't full, if you broadcast your txn with a sufficient (but still negligible) fee then your txn will be predictably included in the next block. the merchant knows as soon as he sees it that it will reliably confirm in about ten minutes.

if the txn is stuck in the mempool for 6 hours or 6 days who knows if it'll ever confirm. if the blockchain is designed to maintain a ""fee pressure backlog"" (ie BTC) then it can't work as zero-conf ""casual cash"" as intended.",2019-08-27 00:36:37

Hahahahah I still have 10 years left to go to complete that list but here's an update. In 2013 while I was a sophomore in high school I begged my mom to let me invest my savings from babysitting over like my whole life in bitcoin which was around $5000. I told her that I had no evidence that i would make anything and i barely knew how but coin even worked but I wanted to invest it all because if I lost it all it wasn't going to kill me. Worst case scenario I could take out a loan if I lost everything. Decided to go to community college because in my city each kid who went to school in the district got two years free. I kept that money in bitcoin for the long haul. My parents the whole time were telling me i was a complete idiot for doing that but that i would learn my lesson and never do it again. sold right when bitcoin hit 19k when I was a freshman in college in 2017.

Currently I'm 21 . I still go to college, I'm determined to graduate because if I didn't I would let myself down. I got a job as a marketing director for a big real estate company, but I'm honestly the youngest person in the office that holds 400 agents and it's hard for people to take me seriously. Even though I got that money fair and square, I decided to put it away so I could live a broke college kid life. I had my mom put the money I made from bitcoin in a savings account and told her to not let me touch it until I turned 35. Just a month ago I told her to still not take the money, but to take out $100k and put it as a down payment on a condo for my grandma in a 55+ senior community so she can live with people her age since my grandfather passed. We can rent it at a fair price for years to come since it will be soon payed off. I still don't have access to my money and still don't want access to it. I feel like I'll do something stupid with it so I want to start over and do it again from the ground up. I want to be a broke college student with the rest of my friends. No one besides my parents and sisters know that I have money from bitcoin and I plan on keeping it that way. Now reddit knows but who even are any of you anyway.

I really like the privacy tech as well as the team, but I am beginning to think that the emission structure might have shot the project in the foot a bit with the high inflation out of the gate. Having burned so many early fans I'm not surprised that many view a potential investment in zcash pessimistically. 

I do think that if it survives and the team continues to iterate into the mid 2020's there is a lot of potential value here. My main concern is on one of continued funding for those devs, as even after the next halving inflation is still at 12%. If we see another major rally in Bitcoin in the next 24-months that may mitigate some of the danger here. If not, I would fear that the USD value of zcash would continue to bleed and any continuation of the FR may be inadequate to retain the current level of development.

eyefzfx,prettylittlesoles,1,"There are a couple money transfer apps you can use or you can use adult payment processor sites. With money transfer apps (aka non-legit payment methods) you're not giving a cut of your profit to a payment processor, but you take the risk of being shut down because adult services are technically breaking ToS with them. If they shut you down they will even go as far as device banning you and not letting you use whatever bank account you had attached with their services. This includes: CashApp/SquareCash, GooglePay, Venmo, and Paypal (which I don't recommend because they are notorious for quickly shutting people down). Amazon e-GiftCards, Gyft.com Giftcards, Giftrocket, and Bitcoin/Crypto are also options.

As far as legit options go, there is: [Indiebill](https://www.getindiebill.com/go?rcm=e2h8d8), ManyVids, AmateurPorn, Niteflirt, iWantClips, Clips4Sale, Unblur, Fancentro, OnlyFans, CMD, and some others.

There simply aren't revolutionary ideas. It's just a myth we like to believe that come from people without the knowledge to know of all the very similar or identical ideas.

Facebook only seemed revolutionary if you weren't exposed to all the things before it and all of its competitors.  Same with.... Everything.  Smartphones, electric cars, airplanes, Bitcoin, whatever.

The general idea is never special.  What is special is implementing it in a successful way.

Any decent CS major who is willing to put in the time, can create an app that does whatever.  It might be sloppy, but it will implement the idea.  I could write an Uber clone.  It wouldn't be worth anything though because nobody uses it.  Because it doesn't work better than other options.

Imagine trying to sell an idea for a restaurant.

&gt; Okay so, umm, we make pizza.... And then we sell them!

The idea doesn't matter.  We all accept this because we understand restaurants.  It is *how* we sell the pizza that matters.

eyhq1rt,bLbGoldeN,1,"I understand your logic and think pretty much exactly like you, but that's not what I originally meant. There are two **huge** roadblocks between our situation right now and mind-blowing prices that will make those who made the right choices millionaire: solving the DLT trilemma and adoption, with adoption being the bigger hurdle. What people fail to recognize is that the problem of adoption is not one, but three issues:

1. **Value creation:** ""Why should I use this?"" --&gt; Solved in large part by the trilemma, but not entirely;
2. **Confidence:** ""Is this particular project really the right choice?"" --&gt; Solved gradually by the proliferation of use cases and increased popularity (network effect);
3. **Distribution:** ""How can I obtain this?"" --&gt; Solved by having a large decentralization coefficient and preventing consortia from controlling the market.

Sadly, the 3rd issue is made worse by these projects. BCH didn't just split BTC's supply, it allowed bad actors to capture more BTC. Vaporware alts did the same. In the end, that leaves lots of poor saps sinking in the mud with value-less bags who will be forced to purchase at an inflated price, just like most of the population. If somehow Bitcoin managed to solve its scalability issues overnight, it still could never become a global currency because allowing select individuals to control up to 80% of the market is absolutely unfeasible.",2019-08-30 00:03:11
eyhqug3,lalalalabot,1,"&gt; It must be quite a comfort in your tiny little, keynesian-based worldview to imagine that people who promote bitcoin are just doing it to try to make their bags worth more. How easy that makes everything for you... Just to label us as selfish and evil, trying to raise our own holdings at the expense of countless online victims. 

I'm well aware that the promoters investment scams often act in good faith! :)

&gt; Meanwhile you drone on about how people in VEN ""Should hold foreign cash and bank accounts"" when that advice is ignoring reality at best, and could get them killed by their own government at worst. How angelic of you.

Don't forget your beloved fake money is being used as a money laundering tool by the criminals that are killing them. And moreover, nope, having a bank account abroad is not more risky than holding fake money. In fact exact the opposite, as this story here shows.

&gt; They simply don't have access to foreign banking, and that's as much Trump's fault as it is Maduro's. They don't have access to much currency besides the Bolivar at all for the same reason, although a few dollars are in the country already and are growing increasingly hard to get their hands on. And taking anything of value at all across the borders is the same as setting it on fire. Banks there no longer lend money, they just exist to keep the Bolivars coming. 

They have access to internet, do they? :)

&gt; So go ahead, tell us how they should be saving their wealth without bitcoin. I'll wait.

What is the meaning of ""saving their wealth""? You save your wealth by loading it on a truck and moving across the border. In alternative you can sell it to someone else (who? at what price?) and for real money rather than fake money.",2019-08-30 00:09:11

eylf7qe,kemikos,1,"Continuing that metaphor, think of the other military rifle designs like consoles. They may be better than ARs in certain aspects; you certainly won't have to wonder if your buffer tube matches your stock dimensions, or if you have the right BCG to go with the gas piston you just put in, because that was all engineered, sourced and installed by one single manufacturer. 

However, that means that future upgrades are not likely to be compatible with other companies' designs, so the market for parts is pretty small. On the other hand, like a PC, every part in an AR regardless of manufacturer should be built to the same specifications, meaning that the market for parts is vastly larger. 

That means that while the AR might not be the best at any particular thing, with a few parts it can be made pretty good at lots of different tasks. Just as you can swap a few parts to turn your firebreathing gaming PC into a Bitcoin miner, or a 3D graphics renderer, or a file server, you can turn a basic AR into a long-distance shooter, a compact close-quarters weapon, a lightweight suppressed pistol, or lots of other possibilities.",2019-08-31 01:38:23

eyldpx6,ithanksatoshi,1,"*""Node count is a lot less important""*

Yep

*""Nodes are important for validating transactions but what is most important for security is the amount of POW you put behind it""*

So, here indeed makes a bit of a conflicting statement indeed. Either you need non-mining nodes or you don't.

Or you specify the required share of each, nobody ever did btw.

*""Validating on the way to getting the information to miners is important for a number of reasons for propagation but the bitcoin network has no problem with propagation, within a few seconds a transaction floods the entire global network, is reachable to everyone, connectivity is very nice""*

Yep, miners are incentivized to have the best connection with each other miner. That is why is called a small-world network.

*""So we are not having any problems with latency or propagation""*

Correct, because miners already have the best connection with each other.

*""Increasing the number of nodes is relatively easy, it doesn't require a lot of infrastructure""*

Yes, it is called sibling nodes.",2019-08-31 01:21:50

eyleujv,badass4102,1,"That'd suck if a paranoid wife hired a private investigator to follow you. You, trying to avoid him and follow these rules you read on Reddit, drive pass your house, onto a freeway, then remember your coworker and her husband live by. You call them up, explain the situation, and she greets you at the door. She sees you nervous, and gives you a hug to calm you down. You walk in. The PI sees you, takes photos and sends it to your wife. Now she has proof. She divorces you and takes the kids. You pay alimony and child support. 

Due to the declining market in Bitcoin you're forced to leave your job to seek greener pastures to be able to fullfil your monthly dues which are now way over your head as little Timmy is going to college. You talk him into joining the military to see the world for a few years, but you're actually letting the government pay for his college education. Smart move. He gets stationed in Italy and finds a nice Italian woman whom which he ends up marrying. You've been able to save up money because you're not paying for Timmy's education. 

So you fly out to Italy to visit them and to tour Tuscany. You fall in love with the culture, the food and wine. You love wine too much though, and become an alcoholic. You can't get your hands on enough wine, so you decide to move to Italy permanently to farm a vineyard and make your own wine. Your First barrel of wine is amazing. You have enough for the year. Barrel after barrel of wine is made, now you have enough for a few lifetimes. You decide that it would be profitable to sell your wine. Since the market in Italy is flooded with wine it's difficult, but you hold your own. The Mafia gets ahold of the news that a foreign wine maker in Italy has dipped his toes in mafia waters, the winery business in which they own over 85% of. They go your vineyard in the middle of the night and burn your crops as a message to stay out. 

You cry holding a burned grape and then crushing it with your hand. You swear that they'll pay for this. You hire locals who are seeking attention and have no drive in life, to stand up and fight for a cause. You rebuild your vineyard. You set the price for 1 bottle of your wine at 1 Euro. You saturate restaurants, homes, office drawers, and gift baskets with your wine. You make no profit, but who cares, you're sticking it to the mob. Mafia wine goes obsolete as it's considered overpriced. The mafiosos decide to go back to their regular jobs and quit the racketeering and extortion business. There were a few though, that seeked shelter with you, leaving their old boss to choke on a lime. 

You continue your business across Europe, destroying other businesses while losing profit yourself, just because you wanted to screw everyone over, the way you were screwed over in life. 

Finally, the law catches up to you for creating a monopoly, illegal in many nations. You're now behind bars. All for avoiding a car that was following you and a paranoid wife.

eyler30,kenchikka,1,"Unpopular opinion: I don't think we should promote monero aggressively. I personally don't think it's ready for mass adoption - not even close. Monero is software and its development is ongoing, that means there's a considerable risk of bugs being introduced in the protocol and wallet implementations.

This is something that bitcoin has that monero doesn't: code stability. As always, it's a trade-off situation. Bitcoin is ossified and because the code doesn't change anymore then the protocol gets resilience and become trustworthy enough for people to store their wealth there. Monero on the other hand can be considered one of the most bleeding edge cryptographic currencies out there, adopting new technologies making it always better, but as it was mentioned, for every upgrade there's a risk of bugs being introduced. Not everyone is ready to take a risk and store the majority (or even part) of their wealth in a software that is always changing and might break someday because of some bug.

I think the people developing monero and the community should be starting to talk about *when* would be a good idea to ossify the code. Or at least increase the time frame for upgrades from every 6 months to every 2 years, then 5 years, then only when absolutely needed.
