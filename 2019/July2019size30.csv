Only if the attack is an entirely new player with no relation to any existing miners trying to single handedly produce 51% of the hashrate.

For an attack like, the Chinese state seizing every miner in China, or several large mining pools forming a cartel, or the manufacturer of most of the hardware backdooring that hardware, overall hash rate is irrelevant, and distribution of hash rate is only mildly relevant.

If the overall hash rate increases, but its concentrated in fewer miners then that means fewer points of failure which makes it weaker to lots of attacks.",2019-07-01 07:57:08

Bitcoin is acting like a store of value. With roses popping up everywhere in trade deals and North Korea (not buying either of them) it seems the smart money is moving out of gold, USTs and back into the stock market.  

The price dropped into the $10,400 range.  This is still above the target of $10,300.  If it drops below that target price we could see a drop to the $9,650 range.  While we are touching the bottom of our trading range, as of 9:30 AM we haven’t breached the lower boundary.

It is important to not get too worked up about this.  We are not seeing the end of the world.  We are still within the flag established with the last rise.  Some folks need change their underwear and start looking at this stuff objectively.

Second, there's a lot of clutter in the crypto space. Example, is Bitcoin and about 2000 altcoins.. 90% of these probably won't last long. Best would be to invest in a project that has a real use case scenario. 

Third, don't trade on exchanges that you don't trust. If the exchange get's hacked, chances are your funds are lost. 

Fourth, not your private keys, not your crypto. If you're in it for the long run, buy crypto and transfer to a wallet. Don't lose your private keys - EVER!!

Finally, always DYOR (do your own research). Research about whatever you're investing in. The project idea, team, community, partners, potential for adoption and much more.

esgu3ra,dEBRUYNE_1,26,"Make the user aware of the personal dangers of a non-fungible chain and he will quickly see the advantages:

Arguably one of the most salient issues of a non-fungible cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) is the risk of being implicated by others. To quote myself:

&gt;Basically shows how broken Bitcoin's fungibility is. One of the most important benefits of a fungible chain is the ability to flawlessly receive payments, i.e., without having to worry about the origin of the funds of the sender. Furthermore, this protects the recipient from being implicated by the sender. A risk on a non-fungible chain that is often underestimated and downplayed. An example I've often used in the past that easily illustrates aforementioned risk:

&gt;&gt;Let's say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn't know is that Bob isn't the law abiding citizen that she thought he was. That is, Bob occasionally sells some illicit stuff on the darknet markets and used his proceeds to buy the painting. As a result, Alice gets flagged by Coinbase for trying to sell ""tainted"" coins and she may now also be the subject of a criminal / money laundering investigation.

A powerful question one can ask to someone that proclaims Bitcoin is fungible is whether he would swap any output (UXTO) of similar value for his own. I can virtually guarantee that the answer will invariably be no. A prime example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6sv0tGgoCI#t=9m12s

esesrft,Mr_Deep_Research,26,"What happened:

A guy found a way to get a ""higher score"" and with it, mine quicker than others. The developers didn't like him doing this so they changed the code and forked the chain (in the code) at a point before the guy started mining.

Coins and transactions were deleted. Anyone who got coins derived from those mined coins just lost them as if they had never existed. All transactions after the hardfork were lost as if they never existed. 

The same exact thing has been done (2011) in Bitcoin and can be done again in Bitcoin. All these token schemes are centrally controlled.

Which begs the question, why have proof of work at all if just a few guys are the ultimate decision makers about what transactions do and do not go in the big list of transactions? Why not just have a central database maintained by them?

**This guy is just trying to scam some money from you, there is countless cases of ""venezuelans"" with scams stories. using the search will result you a lot of them**  


Some facts:  
1. All the criminal cases are documented, if he was in jail he had a trial, by law, every case is public and can be browsed, including the highly corrupted ones, incredible they are public :) this guy didn't show it, of course cause it didnt exit  
2. An apartment in venezuela, doesn't cost 7k, even less one that used to cost 200k.  
3. Electricty by that time was not even 1$, not 7$.   
4. The cases he linked are highly documented cases with names behind them in the venezuelan bitcoin community, he just took a random case out of google   
5. You don't go to ""jail"" next day in Venezuela, it takes a long way for you to get processed, there is literally people waiting to be judged for months, and they are kept in reclusion in police departments.   
6. Venezuelan Identity ID is public, he has no reason why to hide it, it's not like US SSN, if he didn't made it public is simple, is because with a simple google search of his name and no results, you will know that is a fake story.  
7. The instagram post he links is hillarious, that guy is bluffing on the machines of a chavista guy who actually bought those machines with just regular venezuelan corrupted money, theres news about it.   
8. funny thing, there is no ""toilets"" on venezuelan jails, you just do your *shit* on the backyard  
9. United states doesn't look at criminal records when requesting a visitor visa, specially in venezuela, I know plenty of people who got visas while being even under presentation regime  at the police, who got that status after 2014 protests.   
10. There is people in twitter who have documented all cases of bitcoin stolen machines, i can't remember names now but they have been documented even by an ORG in venezuela",2019-07-02 11:03:32

eskehzb,HetzerGer,46,"Good morning my fellow r/ethtrader ´s,  


last night I was listening to the podcast episode from u/krokodilmannchen with u/jtnitchol. It is an amazing talk by the way and the reason I overslept (but totally worth it) the dip this morning. u/krokodilmannchen and u/jtnitchol were talking about new community members entering this subreddit and how they can mantain the spirit of r/ethtrader with many new redditors joining this sub during this ongoing bull run. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am one of the new redditors who joined this sub a month ago and I want to contribute in a positive way to  this subreddit. I already get to know some of you but I thought it would be maybe a good idea to introduce myself. I know this is the internet but I can share some informations with you.  


I am a male in my early thirties and live in Berlin, Germany. I served in the german infantry for over ten years and just finished my vocational Training in the IT industry. I am going to study informatics and economics this year and work at the same time at a IT service company for businesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was first interested in Bitcoin  back in 2013 and heared the first time about it in 2011. It was not before the peak of the last bull run that I got invested. I failed because I was making irrational decisions, buying shitcoins chilled by r/CryptoCurrency, trading with high leverage etc. So I experienced the full ""crypto newbie getting rekt program"". The bear market resulted in a 100% loss of my invested funds (Bitmex). It hurt me only a little bit, because it was only a monthly wage for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used the time during the last bear market to learn more (and understand) about blockchain. I also attended some talks, was lucky to see Gavin Wood and entered back into the market a couple of weeks ago. I hope that we can have some great discussions together here at r/ethtrader.

Yeah its seem ridiculous like a world full of unicorns and rainbows. I will leave u with some points to feed your logical brain while the blind faith of it reaching those prices

Its a disruptive technology and the general population isnt going to realize its potential. Only outliers will and push it forward into society. If u were born before the internet u have lived through it. Internet was only used by nerds and geeks.  Cellphones in 80s were used by the preppy and elites.  Again Crypto is used by fringe wackos and Libertarians cause they dont trust banks and fiat.

As for society moving into crypto we now have the owner of Twitter endorsing Bitcoin as digital gold and throwing money into its development. Facebook is jumping in with it own crypto(libra) and its creator says Libra is designed as a transactional Currency and bitcoin is the crypto that stores value. 

Financial institutions are gobbling up the OTC bitcoins from the miners. They do this so they dont drive the price by purchasing on exchanges. I heard a good analogy that said financial institutions dont miss the train, they stop it, back it up, and jump onboard. Its thier responsibility to give their clients access to the best asset of 2019. So dont think they arent moving in right now. They just cant throw trillions in all at once.

Something to ponder is that there are 40,000,000 millionaires in the world and there are 17,000,000 bitcoins.

One last thing you should keep in your mind was said by a developer. ""People dont need the blockchain but the future will need blockchain.""

So yeah we are humans and theses 100,000 and 1,000,000 predictions seem silly but 25 years ago did I think I would be typing on a screen thats on my computer that makes phone calls and fits in my hands about a currency that utilizes cryptography to secure transactions and value to a complete stranger across the world...

While people do use bitcoin as currency the majority use is holding onto it in speculation to sell of when the value reaches a higher point. The fact that the main use is just to hold until you can change it into more of another currency makes bitcoin itself less of a currency.

For example, if say the Canadian dollar stopped really being used in Canada for transactions, and instead was just something bought by people with USD who intended to sell the canadian dollars down the road for USD once again then I'd say the CAD was no longer a currency.

On the flip side, say people started trading shares in a certain company directly for food and accepted them for the goods they sold. If this became the majority use of this company's shares I'd say that those shares are now a currency.

People do spend bitcoin like a currency. But because the majority use is by far as an investment I'd say it is not a currency",2019-07-03 23:39:16

eso2xsz,Merlin560,108,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

Yesterday the dip broke our bottom range at 10,300 and it fell all the way down to $9,651.   This price point was almost at the point of the previous High Pole warning.  The high pole warning point is where a breakout generally exceeds the formation’s inherent ability to support the price.  In order words, it is the PNF trigger point where the price is going up too quickly.

The price exceeded our negative break down point.  

With a six column formation width, the expected target prediction would have been six boxes down from the breakout point (under $10,300.). So the first target price would have been around $9,700.  The second method for predicting a low from this formation would be the “last breakdown” column length.  In this case the length of the previous break down was 20 rows.  If you overlay the length on this column, the predicted low would be $9,650.

Those lows predictions seem to have proven true.  Using those two methods you can make decent price movement predictions for your range BEFORE the price even breaks down.  It is a good exercise to go through when you start moving towards “breaking out” or “breaking down.”

*This tentative up column of Xs would be moot today if the price fell below $9,600 before the close this evening at 7 PM EDT.*

&amp;#x200B;

Lets talk about trends.  

On the chart you can see two diagonal lines moving up to the right from the bottoms of the columns.  This represents the bottom of the existing range bottom and the first support.  Those are marked.  The drop from the top of the columns down to the right represent the top of the range, or resistance.  I generally only put this on the charts, but you could do the same for the top of each column to show you the price range for short term resistance.

The “major” trend (bull or bear) is a diagonal from the lowest column that is unbroken by a formation.  Currently that diagonal is way down, off the visible chart, down around $6,600.  This Major Trend Line is the place where long term trends change.  The importance of the trend is that it “sets the tone” of your analysis.  When the price is above the line the tone is optimistic.  When it is below the line, the tone is negative.  The distance above the line (right now 71 boxes) gives the chart reader the confidence in the market.

How do you read today’s chart?  

We bounced off the expected lows yesterday.  And we bounced significantly up to $11,500.  This created a tentative reversal to an “up column.” If the price falls below yesterday’s low box, this column will be moot and erased from the chart.  If the happens the next resistance down is in the $9,100 range.

Expected support on the low end would be at $10,000—the first support level from 7/1.  **Going up, the first resistance would be in the $12,100 area.  The next “break out” price is above $12,500.  At that price point the formation will be 7 columns wide, which suggests a decent movement up to the $13,600 area.**  

Because this column is bouncing off a recent low, it may not have the “umph” to go higher (the count of the previous break out of 20 boxes would barely move the target above the breakout.). This indicates that while we may move up in the formation a little bit, **we should expect some minor pull backs within the range before we finally break out**.

Finally, remember, these charts are good for determining the ranges of trades and predicting price points.  In the stock world you would buy or sell based on the breakouts—not the ranges.  For example, you would have bought when the price exceeded $9,500 and you would have sold with the drop down to $10,450 (F13 green box).    The gain would have been $950—but it takes discipline to hold through movements like bitcoin shows.

You would not have bought the bounce back up from that point.  You would be in cash waiting for a new formation to form.  Staying in cash takes discipline as well.  There are tools on the PnF university page that address how to trade bounces and breakdowns.  I've never been much of a shorter, so I don't go into that too much.

If you are a trader, the movement is what you trade; not the price.  Bull or Bear, long or short.  Its all part of the game.  You have no control over the ebb and flow--you can only surf the movement and try to get on and off. 

Trading stocks with this is a slow mover.  Formations made in bitcoin in days (7-8 columns wide, with ranges of 10%) would take a YEAR to complete for most S&amp;P500 stocks.  Stocks just don't move that fast.

But human nature, greed and fear, are the same in any market. That is why this charting method works. 

Bitcoin moves very quickly and if I called “buys” and “sells” as PnF charts are defined, the day traders and noobs here would lose their minds.   The nomenclature alone would give those unfamiliar with it apoplexy.

PnF charting takes out noise.  It identify trends. And it predicts price points. It takes about ten minutes to learn; and three minutes to update daily.

esnlolk,jtoomim,41,"&gt; where the single threaded core client was starting to have problems in the bitcoin unlimited testing

I'm about 90% certain that the limit that BU found at 100 tx/sec was because they were using hard drives instead of SSDs, and had -dbcache set to the default (300 MB) during the initial parts of their testing but set -dbcache much higher (about 8 GB) later on. A 7200 RPM HDD gets about 100 IOPS (10 ms access time), which corresponds very closely to their observed tx/sec rate.

&gt; All the nodes have to process the txs from all the other nodes on their core anyway no?

Yes, each transaction was being validated 4 times, once by each node. I had 4 cores running. There were around 3,000 unique transactions per second being validated, or around 12,000 transactions per second total if we count duplications. A multithreaded node running on all 4 cores of my CPU would be expected to validate at around 12k tx/sec, or maybe a little less due to Amdahl's law.

I did write a version of ABC with parallelized ATMP transaction validation. I might pull those changes into my stresstest branch at some point and see how that affects things. I'll need more CPU cores first, though. For that, I'll either need a computer with more cores, or I need to rewrite the stresstest benchmark thing to be able to manage nodes on multiple computers instead of them all being on localhost and controlled by one python process. 

On a related note, I bought four 40-core servers with 64 GB RAM each, so maybe in a few weeks I'll be able to do tests with around 160 nodes running on one 2.4 GHz core each, or 40 nodes running on 4 2.4 GHz cores each.",2019-07-03 16:08:11

Secondly, it's not simply a waste of energy if *you* think it's pointless. I could say the same thing about pretty much any industry in the world, for example the videogame industry. If I think videogames are a waste of time, does that make the energy usage of the whole sector a waste?

Thirdly, it's incorrect to talk about a transaction on the Bitcoin network costing an amount of energy related to the power consumption of the whole network. The transactions themselves don't use energy, the network does. And as a result it is the most powerful computer network ever created by mankind, by orders of magnitude.

However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using theb scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing.

esr64aa,vansterdam_city,62,"I'm a software developer and wanted to see for myself what blockchain technology was about. I went and read the bitcoin and other blockchain ""white papers"" and implemented a simple blockchain myself.

What I learned is that the primary purpose of this technology is to provide ""decentralized trust"". It's useful for any application where you do not trust a neutral third party (such as a bank in the case of currency). By relying on the parallel computation of the blockchain by thousands or millions of independent actors, one can avoid dealing with any central institution.

Given that, I see absolutely ZERO practical application for IBM or any other blue chip business. I am especially concerned with proposed applications in the medical records area. Keep in mind a blockchain is PUBLIC and IRREVOCABLE (once committed, data can not be removed but only ""reversed"" aka if you gave 2 dollars then you need a second transaction that takes back 2 dollars to undo it). For this type of record, why the hell would we prefer records to be stored in a completely unaccountable distributed public ledger instead of a simple database guarded by a trusted institution that can be regulated and penalized for bad actions?

In general, I view blockchain as an incredibly expensive and complicated database. Other than a few very specific applications like currency, there are no obvious applications of blockchain that a database couldn't do better, quicker and more easily. A normal database will do the same job and cost roughly $10-$500/month to rent from Amazon.",2019-07-04 14:17:01

Cause if it does get reached like that, many today will have more money than they imagined and would rush to dump their coins and thus create a lot of sell pressure than cannot sustain that and even earlier prices.

So the way to reach there is for the intermediate price action to have so many ups and downs that plenty get shaken away and cash out a good part of their stack much before the price reaches the insane level. That way when 100K arrives, most would have fewer coins that they can dump and the price has a better chance at reaching and sustaining.

Folks - this is the reason why price is 11k today and can sustain. The same price was impossible in 2012 when people had 1000s of coins in their wallets. So the wild price gyrations are a way of shaking out coins from wallets, distributing them to more number of folks and thus paving the way to higher prices.

When someone skimmed my debit card and waited months until it was Christmas Eve to withdraw all of my money to buy time on investigation, I had all of my money restored the morning after Christmas. 

When someone fat fingers an address, mis prints a QR code, incorrectly sets up a wallet, or makes a computer input based mistake, due to bitcoin/crypto being a radically different type of technology, that money is GONE. Without the ability to restored. It is deleted. Who is going to be the person making that mistake? An elderly woman moving her net worth to a hardware wallet? A person who accidentally hit delete? A malicious hacker who encrypts your drive? A hurricane that takes out your entire home? A well secured cloud account but operated by a novice in security? 

This is why being your own bank sucks so bad. And it's the principal of crypto. I hear people copy+paste the same shit ever time: ""If you don't own your keys, you don't own your wallet"". Well since brain wallets are the LEAST secure kind, you're likely going to use a generated one with your software of choice. Where do you store that key? They say that you only have a real backup when you have 3 backups - Your primary, a second backup on a different volume, and an off-site backup. That's three potential points of attacks. The second volume and primary storage in your home will be destroyed if your computer is destroyed if involved in an event that causes damage (flooding, sprinklers, fire, ect). The one in the cloud could be compromised at any point. Social engineering has shown to be able to penetrate even the highest of security...and when the prize is currency that is both untraceable (depending on your knowledge in btc mixing and other means of laundering) and unrecoverable. Sure you can keep your wallet in a bank security box, but you'll still need some kind of access to have spending money, unless you do a Cold wallet/hot wallet system, but then you have to literally GO TO THE BANK to transfer money to yourself. Yuck. Also big issue if you're in a pinch on a weekend or holiday or anytime past 5pm. 

This is why I cannot sell people on Bitcoin. Because the only way I get them into bitcoin is if I inadvertently become their IT guy. But instead, this time, it's a lot of shit at stake. And when something goes wrong, the victim will always take the brunt of the pain. My bank restored my money and the thief ended up getting caught, but he had already spent a lot of the money and I absolutely doubt the full amount will be recovered. 

Say they track down the person who steals your bitcoins, but he spent 50% of them. Actually, don't imagine a hypothetical - look at fucking Mt.Gox. Yeah, imagine your life savings was in Mt.Gox...it's taking a while to get that money back, isn't it? And I hear what you're thinking already: DONT STORE ON AN EXCHANGE/ONLINE. Yeah, but even with your backups, you're at risk for theft. What if the offline, hidden harddrive is found and stolen in a burglary? Shit! Better get all those coins moved - but the thief stole your computer and has both backups. Oh shit, no big deal. You borrow a friends computer and log in to your SuperSecure 2.0 Crypto Safe CLOUD Storage Inc. account...but you use a password manager and you're having trouble remembering the master password. Shit. How many more hurdles do you need to overcome to get to that wallet before the thieves do? **That's the problem. If you fail to be quick, you could lose everything in what would otherwise be a small hit to your net worth.**

I love bitcoin, I love certain parts of the community and this technological shift is incredible to be living through...but I wish people would start looking at Bitcoin's actual strengths instead of idolizing it into something it's not capable or ready to be yet. To a noob, this quote paints a different picture of crypto compared to what the vets see. Anyone remember the Eth glitch that wiped out 10s of millions of dollars from the network? Anyone remember the 51% scares? These things are too volatile, complicated, and unnecessary to the average person. The thing is, crypto - from the perspective of a ""Fiat replacer"" offers absolutely nothing in terms of an improvement to the laymen that isn't immediately canceled out by the introduction of new problems. And that is a lot of risk for the vast majority of people who can't afford to lose any money. And these problems persist regardless of volatility in price or development of btc code. It is an inherent consequence from the nature of decentralized currencies. 

In the future, when the dust has settled, crypto currencies will have their place in our world - as enterprise grade solutions for transferring money or anything that can be piggybacked into a timechain/blockchain/DAG based ledger. But FIAT will continue to rule because people cannot be expected to not make mistakes. For all the bad that FIAT causes through mass printing and being government controlled, it certainly has backup plans for our inevitable mistakes, hacks, thefts, and attacks.

The defense is making a half-hearted argument that the term ""public address"" doesn't mean anything in Bitcoin (seemingly because it kind of sounds like a fixed point to which you receive something whereas in Bitcoin you're not supposed to reuse keys), and thus a court order to produce ""public addresses"" is meaningless.

Overnight we reversed down into a column of Os, hitting an overnight low of $10,761.  Of course, as with any overnight reversal this is a “tentative” reversal—that won’t be confirmed until the close tonight.  If the price moves up above $11,961 it will add a box up the column ands we would retain the column of Xs.  (The tentative column is shaded grey.)

The first level of resistance is market with the “+” signs directly above the current column.  Resistance comes down diagonally from the left to right.

First Support comes up from the bottom, diagonally up to the right.  Marked by “-“.

As you can see, the recent column highs follow a descending pattern down from the peak at \~$12,380 on 6/29.  The pennant being worked in right now has a low of about $10,000.  This column of Os would be expected to move down to around the $10,000-10,150 range before turning back up.  

&amp;#x200B;

**If the formation tries to break out**, anything under $12,136 would be a run to the descending top.  If it goes over that point we would break out of a double top, in a formation 9 columns wide.  That indicates a pretty decent move up.  If it doesn’t make it to that point, get ready for a narrow drop—one more round trip before the breakout.  

&amp;#x200B;

**If we break down (under $9,625) we would form a double bottom breakdown.**  And with a width of eight columns—that could be a significant drop.

Formations above 10 columns are getting to the unusual point—but certainly not rare.  13-15 columns wide are rare. 

One way or the other this consolidation might be nearing its conclusion.

Time will tell.

eszgh2d,kusuriurikun,27,"This is because, quite frankly, when you're specifically trying to hide activities from *state level actors* (versus, say, RIAA or the MPAA or even trying to prevent corporate espionage) effectively the only way of actual *security* that exists is one-way messages sent via a one-time pad (with keys generated from a *physical*, non-computerized source)--and even *this* is vulnerable if one does not practice Good Crypto Key Hygeine and one reuses keys and/or doesn't dispose of decryption keys (ask the Cubans some time...or the Germans...or the Japanese...)

If you're ACTIVELY trying to share info you feel might be intercepted or be of interest to a state actor, you are no longer in a realm where a VPN or Tor or really *any mechanism over the public Internet is going to help you.*  You're at that point talking things like ""numbers stations"" and Diceware and good old sneakernet (and there's quite a bit of sneakernet traffic from South Korea to North Korea via China of things like K-dramas that are Frowned Upon by the regime in the North).  GPG is an option assuming you can verify your executable--or if you compile yourself, your compiler and operating system--do not themselves contain backdoors or obfuscated code that insert backdoors (which is much, much harder than it sounds--Ken Thompson actually devised a proof of concept of a C compiler that actually surreptitiously inserts backdoor code in executables (including copies of itself compiled from code) and the backdoor is written in such an obfuscated way that it is only actually detectable in the binary itself) and if your particular source of randomness is really random (note: pretty much no computer-based or computer-generated source of randomness is truly random).

(And no, not even hosting in a non-Five-Eyes, non-Fourteen-Eyes country will save you if a state actor REALLY has interest in you.  Traffic analysis and BGP hijacking pretty trivially could cause diversion of traffic MEANT to go from one VPN hub to another to, well, pass through a hostile state actor's own sniffing equipment; both the Russians and the Chinese in particular like to surreptitiously divert all Internet traffic through their network on occasion, or at least major Internet routes that lead to Interesting Places.)

If you desire is merely to hide from the likes of the MPAA or RIAA or business or Facebook's ubiquitous tagging and cookies, probably your best approach is going to be a rather unconventional one:

a) Find a network service provider that is in a non-Five Eyes, non-Fourteen Eyes country with a strong policy (proven by court precedent in its country of operation) of contesting warrants and legal summons in its own country, does not have laws in place that essentially make the use of ""canary warrants"" and other notification of the request for a summons illegal, AND which refuses legal summons from Five Eyes and Fourteen Eyes countries *and* which will allow you to host your own VPS (or, preferably, bring your own hardware to host a physical server) *AND* which accepts payment in a minimally-traceable cryptocurrency like Monero or Etherium (Bitcoin is actually quite traceable via the blockchain, and numerous proofs-of-concept of deanonymisation of Bitcoin users exist).  Note: There are *very* few of these that exist.

b) On your physical server or VPS, install (if possible) NetBSD or OpenBSD rather than Linux (in general, the BSD family outside of macOS has been sufficiently proven security-wise that you actually see production firewall systems running BSD at its core like pfSense and OPNsense).  Note: There are very few VPS providers that even provide the option for BSDs, usually they're Linux or Windows 2016 Server based.

c) Once OS is set up, install OpenVPN as a server service.  Note: You will want to be very sure and get it in writing with your VPS or hosting provider that they will allow hosting of a server running a VPN service.

d) Find some way within your jurisdiction to securely exchange currency into a minimally-traceable form of cryptocurrency such as Monero or Etherium, set up your VPN tunnel, *pay your provider via the VPN tunnel only.*  Note: GOOD FUCKING LUCK on finding a provider that will allow this with their processing platforms that is not already widely blacklisted across the Internet as a massive source of network abuse.

THIS should give you an idea of just how fucking *difficult* it is to be untraceable on the Internet, especially if you live in a jurisdiction where there's a surveillance state in place.  (China actually has an additional issue: Cryptocurrency trading has been declared as illegal in the PRC, so there's the difficulty of converting renminbi to Monero in a way that won't get one the attention of state security by default.)",2019-07-06 06:18:48

esyyyyo,mlgoody,26,"Currently, it would take very little effort for a knowledgeable someone to overload the nano protocol with constant sends, because nano is feeless.

esz01oi,redditouille999,25,"I agree with some of the negative aspects of Uphold. HOWEVER, my personal viewpoint is that Uphold and the current KYC systems in place, especially for crypto-related projects, are the equivalent to the dial up modem. It was clunky, slow, and frustrating, but until the ecosystem as a whole created cable internet speeds it was the only way to get in the game. 

My view, step back and take a look at the bigger picture. I do not like the KYC/uphold game as many do not in this space. However, in order to tackle a much BIGGER problem that Brave and BAT are doing, they must first work within some of the confines of the real world. Otherwise, another source of fraud is created to be tackled later. No go.

Why does Brave need blockchain tech? Simply because it is not yet where it desires to be but blockchain enables the ability to get there. The ultimately trustless transaction ledger is the key, similar to what got us all involved in bitcoin to begin with. It may not always use the ETH blockchain, and I suspect there whether it does or does not in a few years things will look much different, will be more seamless, less frustrating, and yes, will be more decentralized. That is just my opinion though, and attacking a huge problem with new ideas always takes a bit of trust up front with the team at the helm. It is the same with any new idea.

As an example, interim goals that are in process, namely the integrated Brave wallet, is a step in the direction of a place where both you and Brave desire the direction to be.",2019-07-06 03:52:13
eszx79r,LargeSnorlax,25,"Hmmm, I think people have a very unrealistic view on what Cryptocurrency is supposed to be doing, or what its ultimate goal is. A lot of folks are blinded by mania and desperate to make it in life without working hard, which contributes a lot to this.

Here's what I want Crypto to be used for:

- Modernize banking - Force banks out of the rut they've been stuck in since the 1950s and drag them kicking and screaming into the modern world. No more 3-5 business day, $100 transfers to other banks. No more slow inefficiencies.

- Modernize and increase competition in payment methods. Give credit card companies reasons to adapt and innovate.

- Create ""safe spots"" for cash you don't want to be seen or audited, where the government can't always have an eye on every bit of cash you own. 

Crypto to me is not replacing the dollar, it is making all other aspects of life better. Even if it does nothing else other than making my bank transfers cheaper, faster, and less expensive, Cryptocurrency will have accomplished its goal.

Bitcoin or other alt coins may increase in value, and may even get adopted. I may be able to book flights, pay my taxes, or pay for hotels in Cryptocurrency - It's almost at that stage right now.

But this is still technology in its infancy. Please remember that the Credit Cards everyone takes for granted now hasn't **even been around for 2 generations** and it took decades to get into proper circulation. The internet was barely even in people's minds for a decade after its release, and only with the introduction of smartphones did it really become mainstream.

Expecting Cryptocurrency to suddenly replace the dollar or trigger a global revolution is foolish. Society is slow, and society is adverse to change.

et5pvxt,rapidak,61,"Been a while since I posted here, those who are around long enough might recognize me and remember that Ive been around since 2017 just after the ICO (when we had &lt;5k subs here). Ive been more focused on BTC recently so have been distant from VET for a while, but giving it some good thought and trying to understand what is going on and why the price behaves as it does. This is not fud, and for some might be a meaningleas post, Its just an analysis of the situation observed by someone sitting on the side recently trying to understand what exactly is going on and why. Take it with a grain of salt.
Obviously i cannot complain really as the drop in sats and rise in BTC (and a few months of no sleep and almost 24/7 trading) have gotten me from strength to a couple hundred k VET from a mjolnir, but overall the feeling I have is that apart from BTC going up the second factor for supression is the token split. Imagine a sat level x100 higher, one or even twenty sats difference is not that much in % than it is go go 6 sats up or down at the level we are at now. Thats 10%. There are traders that buy at 64 for example and just set a sell order at 70 and wait. Put in 10btc make an entire bitcoin off of that. That is what those walls are. Every single sat is a huge % increase to some whales stack, there is literally no better coin to manipulate and trade in a range to suck out profits. Remember a month or two ago we were at 140-150 sats. Imagine someone put in 5btc now, by the time we get to 150 that is almost 13btc. That is a huge profit. 
Now I understand, that for enterprises the lower cost of VET was probably appealing, and that the economic model that Sunny had in mind had its reason, but they effectively created the ideal coin to trade and suck profits out of, which also has billions of supply so sell pressure has no end, and they are starting to realize this. To get any fair price action not completely controlled by whale traders they need to lower the supply, get the price to higher sat levels where a few sats is not all of a sudden a 10% jump in your account balance, and the walls will start to fade away. This is what it is all about rn, lower supply (oce coinfarm, nodes, buyback... see what is going on? Get tokens off the market to reduce supply on the exchanges)
The other thing is also arbitrage bots. The key exchange leading price action is binance, it is clear as day. Its nice that you buy/trade on Oceanex, but that does not move price, cos the bots on oce always check binance price and even if you bought 100mil VET into the order book they would push it back down immediately to whatever level binance is at. That also leads me to think, that for the buyback to have any meaning, it has to be bought from binance, despite oce being the partner exchange.
TLDR - the token split im sure had a good reason and is benefitial in the combination of BAAS and the economic model behind it provided to enterprises, but turned out to be a horrible idea in terms of price appreciation. Sunny and co realize this now and everything is pointing to a coordinated effort to lower the supply of VET on exchanges, which should in turn help organic price discovery with less walls/suppression and/or price manipulation.",2019-07-07 16:16:19

Nothing prevents spies - Chainalysis, FBI, NSA, GCHQ - from running Bitcoin nodes

This equipment records raw Internet traffic as it passes through the exchange, storing as much traffic as possible on as many disk drives as the NSA can install at these exchanges. The NSA's purpose for this data collection is mass surveillance. When security agencies discover a new terrorism suspect, they can get warrants to intercept communications relevant to that person. But historical communications are not available. By collecting masses of Internet traffic belonging to all the innocent Internet users of the world, they have retrospective access to old data  

This NSA program was the trigger which drove the encryption-everywhere campaign, which has since encouraged more than 99% of Web sites to switch to https only

Privacy features on an inherently transparent chain will invariably have weaker properties than privacy features on an inherently opaque chain such as Monero. In addition, any privacy feature that is getting implemented will be optional. History has shown us that features that are optional will not get any traction, as people are lazy and will opt for the default, which is transparent transactions in case of Bitcoin.  

Furthermore, fungibility (which is an essential property of sound money and ensures the concept of taint does not exist) can only be achieved with privacy by default. Given that Bitcoin's current narrative is to never hard fork again (unless emergency hard fork), I deem it quite unlikely that Bitcoin will ever have proper default privacy or fungibility. 

&gt;or LTC

Do you genuinely expect the Litecoin developers to implement sophisticated privacy features that they cannot copy from Bitcoin (such as MimbleWimble)? Their track record has shown that barely any work is being performed (except for remaining in sync with Bitcoin, i.e., copying all new Bitcoin features, which is relatively easy) and I therefore deem it unlikely we will see any kind of privacy features on Litecoin in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, Charlie Lee stated in a recent Magical Crypto Friends episode that adding privacy features is not a priority. 

&gt;There was an article about something called taproot

Bitcoin maximalists have a tendency to throw names of new proposals around and posit it will fix all issues in the future. Only the future can tell whether these proposals will actually be implemented and have a positive impact. By contrast, Monero works *today* and fundamentals will only improve going forward.

&gt;Just in case anyone's wondering, this isn't just a thought from the poster. [Aristotle defined](https://www.kitco.com/ind/Lee/printerfriendly/apr302009.html) what sound money is ~350 B.C., and it includes fungibility.

&gt;It's noteworthy that privacy is a result of fungibility.

When we realized that nothing was going to be done about this dramatic problem, we forked BTC to several implementations that would properly scale the tech.  Bitcoin unlimited, SegWit 2X, Bitcoin Cash. and several others.  Bitcoin Cash was the one that stuck. 

These were all attempts to fix this serious problem. Unfortunately the people in charge of BTC were now a for-profit corporation known as blockstream, that raised hundreds of millions from investors to “monetize bitcoin” on the layer above. They hired the top BTC devs, paid them off effectively, and crippled the system.  

Then they started a mission information campaign about bitcoin cash, censored the living shit out of the big coin sub Reddit so anyone who spoke up in favor of it was removed. All dissenting arguments would no longer be presented. Echo chamber and misinformation dominated.

Fast forward to 2017, tens of thousands of newbies enter the space and were slapped with this misinformation campaign by blockstream that BCH is just a stupid shitcoin that everyone should hate. And now all of you hate it. None of you know why. “Because it claims to be bitcoin“?  Well yeah.  It’s a fork of bitcoin. That’s quite literally what forks are supposed to claim. It’s supposed to redirect the project back to its original path.

So now the only people having any success raising hell about this issue are Nano holders. 

This problem was solved already. 

With a fork of bitcoin. That goes back to the bitcoin genesis block. Bitcoin Cash is the solution to this problem. Other altcoins are welcome to try and take on this challenge as well.

et8hfq3,albacore_futures,88,"""Ponzi"" is the most-abused financial term in English. It's typically used to mean ""This is a financial thing I think is a scam,"" when in fact it means something else entirely: it is a specific type of financial scam in which promised (high) returns are covered by obtaining new funds from a new sucker, who is also lured in by promises of a high return. That second sucker's returns are covered by stealing from a third, and so on. Ponzis collapse when the Ponzi operator accumulates more promises than he can cover by swindling more future people, at which point the slightest withdrawals bankrupt the scheme.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi because (a) there is no single operator of bitcoin, and (b) there are no promises of a guaranteed high return. People might think the market for bitcoin could go up, but they don't guarantee that, and they don't pay dividends based on that which are funded by stealing from future suckers.

Fiat is also not a Ponzi, because similarly fiat does not make any promise of high return. In fact, in today's environment, it promises a negative return (inflation), which of course makes it a terrible investment.

Bitcoin is not a  Ponzi Scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

In a Ponzi scheme:

*  there is an  ""operator"" -- a central authority (one    person, or a small group), a  swindler. 
*  The swindler receives money from people
*  The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some    business venture with an  expected high rate of return.  That money is    NOT invested.  There is  no money-making business venture.  Any returns    are paid from the  swindled money.  
* The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a  big,   fat lie.  
* The  Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new  suckers   arrive to put  their money into it.  
* A Ponzi scheme cannot  survive a   ""crash"".  
* A  Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is legal, and honest.

Bitcoin has no central authority.

Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.

Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.

Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a ""money making venture""; Bitcoin IS money.

Bitcoin has survived several crashes.

Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.

et8ye0g,KafkaHodler,32,"Hello everyone,

For those that don't know me, I'm Dave Rube. No, I'm not everyone's favorite classical liberal Dave Rubin. He is my hero and idol. Or, rather, he was my hero and idol...

You see, I was recently deplatformed by Rubin on Twitter (@dave_rube). I merely asked him to kick some blue haired feminist ass at his recent Ayn Rand cult conference and I was blocked. All I can gather from such an anti-free speech tactic and regressive action is that Rubin has joined Big Tech Communism and is trying to cover it up. He knows I'm legit and wants to silence me.  

I'm trying to hold back my tears right now. I don't know if you guys can comprehend exactly how much psychological harm this Twitter block did to me. Before I found Rubin on the intellectual dark web with the Tor web browser, I used the libtard net neutrality web. I virtue signaled by day and watched porn at night. I was a beta male loser that wore sandals and shopped only at Whole Foods. No woman would touch me. I had zero confidence and I constantly apologized for being a white male.

Rubin changed all that. Here was a guy ready to stand up to the PC mob. My abs actually grew as I watched his interview with Sargon. Since then, I dress with class, eat only steak, buy things only with Bitcoin, and probably get laid, on average, about every 25 seconds. In fact, I'm fucking as I'm writing this right now. But this splitting of my Übermensch level mental attention span is simplistic to perform. I can attend to eighty different tasks at once. Nothing can get in the way of my focus because that's just how much of an alpha male I've become.

And so, you can imagine what being blocked by Rubin did to me. To say the least, it wasn't pretty. I even almost shopped at Whole Foods for a soy burger. But I'm bouncing back. And through that dark night of the soul, I've come to the realization that, just because your hero turns out to be Big Tech Communist, that doesn't mean that nothing can be learned from the illusion. Indeed, my conviction in the Rubin I thought I knew became even stronger! 

And so, I'm trying to fill in the vacuum left by Rubin's far left turn to authoritarianism. I know this subreddit loves Rubin and everything he stands for oh so much. But I'm here to tell you it's a mirage. A smokescreen (perhaps orchestrated by the Deep State itself). Rubin is not a classical liberal. He is not a libertarian. He is, in fact, a regressive-progressive-cultural Marxist-SJW. And just because I'm revealing this to you, don't worry, you won't lose chest hairs and your sperm count won't go down......

.....

...That is, if you can overcome your disillusionment and forge a new path... just as I have done. 

And that's where you guys come in. I believed so strongly in the facade of Rubin that I became that facade. And so there was a wondrous unintended consequence to being conned by Rubin's grift routine.

I'm asking you to see the truth. Know that Rubin is a fraud. But don't hate the ideas. Just hate the man. And accept me as your new favorite interviewer of the mean spirited and edgy-for-edgy's sake. 

Indeed, I am the real deal. I bock and mute nobody. I will interview any asshole without hesitation and with glee. And I will not rest until my entire digital space is a fully mature free market of ideas sprung fourth from a final apocalyptic Battle of Ideas™ waged against the regressive left (i.e. an endless ocean of Pepe the Frog memes -- AND WON'T THAT BE A GLORIOUS DAY!)

So Rubin Reddit, know this: there's a new Dave in town. And this time, he's gonna get it right.

You'll be seeing me around...

&amp;#x200B;

Whelp, got woken up by an alarm that my **sell stop** had been triggered AND the retrace alarm at $12080 retracement level had been hit.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, you guys set a tight **sell stop** as mentioned in earlier posts.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin has officially retracted from earlier and that was the most likely outcome, which it was important to set our **stop sell** properly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is where we go from now:**

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is now temporarily in a choppy market it will attempt to make up its mind between two local points of $12180 and $12430. There is very strong support at $11980 that will unlikely be tested or broken.

&amp;#x200B;

As I've said, I fully suspect the restest of retest ATH to be a full 14 day period so we will trade choppy for a bit now before heading backup (I see no general Trend reversal at this point, unless we dip below $11900, then I will have to take another look after a 4H close under $11900).

&amp;#x200B;

**Point of Entry? Where will it go?**

&amp;#x200B;

It is too early to tell which direction it will go because:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The **H4 RSI** moved above 66 but quickly reverted back under with **sRSI** moving above 80 and quickly reverting under. This indicates a local trend reversal (aka we have more downside and sidewards movement)
2. The **H1** is PA is currently under the **Ichimoku Cloud conversion line**, indicating indecision for the next 5 periods (5 hours). While we are still sitting above the cloud in a bullish trend, the conversion line becomes a local resistance level before the final decision. It will bounce around it a couple of times and that line is **$12320**
3. **m15** is currently inside the **Ichimoku Cloud** area indicating indecision. The **Conversion line** and **Base line** have merged, indicating a possible **TK crossover**, or a local bearish trend reversal on **m15** scale. Further, this local bearish trend reversal will be validated by RSI dropping below 33 which is a likely scenario.
4. **m15** suggest PA may test around $12060 local timeframe support within the next 14 fifteen-minute timescales. This idea is invalidated by a 3 period (3x15m) crossover of the **$12400** level and enhanced by a 3 period (3x15m) cross under the **$12200** level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy and Suggestion:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. At this point since I don't want to stay up I will be setting up the follow **Stop Buy:**
   1. Stop Buy at $12080
   2. Stop Buy at $12430

A good point of entry is also $12180 but slightly more risky and indecisive compared to level's I've mentioned above.

etcasj0,Merlin560,43,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Chart

We reached a new local high late last night, reaching $12,827.  This topped the current column at 23 rows high.  We broke out into a Double Top Break Out, passed the High Pole Warning and we are within 7 boxes of the local formation top.  These are positive events.

At this breakout the two traditional prediction methods indicated a high based on the width of the formation (11 column) of $12,500 (which we met this morning) and $14,350 which is based on repeating the last breakout column count.

I spent some time re-building the chart to reflect $75 boxes instead 1.5% boxes.  In the end the formations did not change, but they are easier to track and they make more relative sense to the under-$10k $50 boxes.  So we will be $75 a box from 10k-20k, and then $100 boxes for the next $10k.

Where do we go from here?  We are still under the top of this formations range.  That sits at $13,300.  If we break above that we will be in undisturbed waters for this cycle.  Yes, we went up to $19982 in 2017, but the trend down from there was broken long ago.  Think of it as a stock's “52 week high” type of thing.

If we pull back with any significant enthusiasm, the range to look for reentry would be at the High Pole warning target price of $11,950.  Normally the price would bounce pretty hard at that price.

A break down would happen at a price under $11,050.  That is quite a way away.    

Using strict PnF protocols, the buy price would have been at $11,725.   I would set my stops moving upward from there.  The sell price would occur at the next “negative breakdown.”  It is possible to have multiple buy triggers in a single formation—as the price could keep going up.

These formations normally occur over a number of days.

Since the first of April there have been 10 ""  
Double Top Break"" outs.  The average return on buying at the trigger price has been 43% to the top over the immediate 30 days after the trigger.  This is simply buying at the trigger and a calculation of the high going forward.  Obviously, hardly anyone buys the top—or sells the bottom.  So use these figures as “potential gains based on history.” 

The “trigger prices” are published with each chart—the positive breakout number is the upwards trigger, and the negative breakdown price is the negative triggers.  

Keep in mind, these are NOT tops and bottoms of columns—but they reflect “swing” changes.  

They are not for day trading.  They are for swing trading over days or weeks.

Here is the chart.

etd2lgy,colacadstink,589,"&gt; OK, how can I help?  

I'm glad I asked, because there's no other info in this thread on what you can actually do to help this cute little critter - so I did some digging, and came up with something.

[The Sea Shepard Conservation Society' Operation Milagro](https://seashepherd.org/campaigns/milagro/) is an effort to help protect Vaquita in the Upper Gulf of California. These are the same folks you might have seen in the Discovery/Animal Planet show [Whale Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_Wars), so if you're a fan of that you're probably already aware of their work, but for the rest of you, these folks are essentially running defense for the animals they're helping to save. From their website describing their operation:

&gt; Fisherman – illegal poachers often working in conjunction with drug traffickers – are laying down illegal gillnets hoping to catch another fish similar in size: the totoaba. This critically endangered bass is prized for its swim bladder which is sold on the black market in China and Hong Kong for tens of thousands of dollars, earning it the nickname “aquatic cocaine.” As the vaquita swim in the refuge, they become entangled in these nets and are unable to reach the surface of the water, causing them to drown. The fate of this very shy and elusive porpoise is inextricably tied to the fate of the totoaba.  
&gt; As a direct-action organization, Sea Shepherd is working in partnership with the Mexican government on Operation Milagro V to protect the vaquita refuge. Sea Shepherd ships, the M/V Farley Mowat and the M/V White Holly, will be stationed in the Gulf of California, working to remove gillnets, patrol for poachers, document and collect data to share with the scientific community, and report all suspicious activity to the Navy who will make arrests as needed.

So these folks are actually putting ~boots on the ground~ boats on the water to help prevent poachers from killing not one but TWO different endangered species here - one of which is the cutiepie pictured above. 

So if you're a fan of cute pictures like this, and wanna keep seeing them for years to come, [consider donating to these fine folks](https://my.seashepherd.org/Operation-Milagro). Minimum $5 donation, they take PayPal and bitcoin (scroll down past the donation form if you want to use those), so if you want to keep cute critters swimming happily, please chip in a bit.",2019-07-10 03:43:12

Signs of capitulation are starting to show more prominently for ETHBTC from a sentiment perspective. Don't fight it, its part of the process for any market bottoming, reminiscent of when ETH hit \~$80 and BTC hit \~$3200 8 short months ago.

It is moments like these when low conviction holders / investors make impulsive decisions which cause them to lose the most money over the long term.  You cannot stop them, and you cannot change their mind- they were always going to do this.  They are incapable of *not* FOMO'ing to chase that last X% of a move, thinking it's a ""new paradigm"" and that they've been wrong this whole time.

There are some people here who don't really understand what Ethereum is or its long term potential. Some came for the wrong reasons in late 2017  / early 2018 (e.g., imminent Flippening), and many of them have already cycled out.  They will leave ETH now for the same reason they left BTC before.  Many more will FOMO back in when the ratio does reverse, but again, probably also at the worst time.

This is how these markets work.  Price action on the margin is the aggregate of many individuals' emotional behavior.

We have started to and may continue to see an influx of trolls here with the express purpose of making you feel bad.  Don't let them, and don't let the noise from the inexorable ratio complainers distract you from the revolution Ethereum and ETH continue to unleash upon the crypto landscape.  Don't screw up your long term investing strategy due to short term noise.

ETH will live to fight another day, and unfortunately for Bitcoin Maximalists, it cannot be memed out of existence.  And I'm confident that its utility will ensure that it has *many* days of out-performance against BTC and other coins later in this cycle.  This is inevitable, as crypto firmly exits the bear market and begins to look for speculative return and alpha.  I hope many of you are still here to see it when it happens, but I know at least some of you will not be.

The silver lining we have is that ETHUSD still looks pretty bullish, and we may see $400 in the not so distant future.

The price reached a high of $13,160 since the “close” last night at 00:00 UTC.  This added to the column of Xs today.

Here are the price points to consider:

1.  $13,300 is the resistance coming down from the formation high reached on 6/26.  Yes, we are still in that formation, which has now reached 11 columns wide. 

2. The column would reverse with a price below $13,000 tomorrow (as we have already added a box in the active column today.)

3. The high price target for this run would create a new formation at $14,350.

4. The High Pole Warning target price is now at $12,000.  A reversal down to this point should hit resistance and “bounce” pretty well.  With columns as long as this one (28 boxes) it could fall through and then bounce.  But $12,000 is the price point you should look for a reversal in the event of a drop.

5. The bottom of this range is now $11,050.  Movements between the current price and $11,050 are considered within the range.  

6. We are 106 boxes above the current trend line, which is a comfortable margin.  In the 2017 mania, we were twice as far from the trend line, at 211 boxes.

etdj7xt,DCinvestor,37,"Ethereum's fundamentals and the evolution of ETH into a form of commodity money and programmable store of value give me zero worries about its value, even if the ratio capitulates further temporarily. Frankly, it makes me want to buy even more at what I consider to be a discount.

If you don't have that level of confidence, you should do more research and ask people questions here to build your understanding.  And if you aren't convinced, then maybe ETH isn't for you.  There are lots of other coins with simpler tech and even simpler narratives which sound good, but they may not be reflective of reality.  A good example is BTC's supply cap of 21M, although it is unknown if BTC can actually continue to operate as issuance reduces.  There is a theory that fees will sustain it, but its only a theory.

ETH would implement a supply cap tomorrow if it was believed to be safe, but the problem is we don't know that it is yet.  In the meantime, ETH issuance has only gone in one direction, and that's down.  It has the makings of a great Programmable Store of Value (more capable and reliable than Bitcoin), even though there are many economic properties of a Proof of Stake system that the market does not yet understand.  *You should try to understand these things before everyone else does.*

If you just want to invest in simple memes, there may be better options than ETH.  If you want to invest in the crypto which is likely to be the future pace setter and technological leader in this space, you're in the right place.  I believe that the monetary narrative will evolve significantly through the maturation of Proof of Stake, especially when ETH issuance eventually drops below BTC's.  Consider getting in now and staying in while most of the market still does not understand this.

For those who have the knowledge and the conviction, I believe ETH will deliver in spades later in this cycle, and for many years to come.

Bitcoin SV experienced a two block chain re-org and fork

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin had an invalid block at height 584,802 when Antpool failed to calculate the fees properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The invalid block was immediately followed by a $1200 dump in the value of bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

Tether is desperately trying to calm nerves now by printing another $100 million fake dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

etimucu,JaMarcusHustle,36,"I'm a simple man. I don't know much about crypto nor markets in general. I invested a modest sum of money - about 1 months wages, albeit over the space of about 6 months - in Ripple on a very basic (and frighteningly naive) viewpoint: What cryptocurrency - if any - could I see my mother using one day?  
  
Now, my mother is no market guru. But instead, she represents the majority of the general public. That is, no interest in cryptocurrency and probably not even aware of the term cryptocurrency. May have read the word bitcoin in an article somewhere once or twice. But completely naive and innocently ignorant of what it is and how it works (trust me, I'm not far from that category myself).  
  
I just looked at the top 20-ish cryptos at the time and tried to envisage which one I could easily see being loaded onto prepaid cards or similar, so that my mother (the public) doesn't have to worry about wallets or anything to do with the blockchain. As far as she's concerned, it would just be another Visa or Mastercard.  
  
That is, which of these bastard coins will be the most consumer friendly one day? And in a further display of ignorance and probable stupidity, I boiled it down to 2 things: transaction speed and branding. With a laughably heavy weighting on the latter.  
  
Ripple is a good name. They have a good logo. It just...sounds good....too.
  
""I'll just pay with my Ripple card.""  
""I'll Ripple you the money later.""  
""I sent you some Ripple for your birthday.""  
  
Yup, I can see that someday. I don't care if that's in 5 years or 10 years. 

Why am I so patient? Because when I was younger, I thought I'd be a rich and famous sports or movie star.

I'm not.

In college, I thought I'd work my way up to a monstrous salary by the time I was 30.

I didn't. 

When it was apparent that the salary dream wouldn't happen, I try my best to won the lottery.

I couldn't.

So when Bitcoin boomed and I read about all these people becoming overnight millionaires, of course I was going to invest. I had my new escape.

So why am I happy to wait 5 or 10 years?

Well, what else is going to get me through to retirement? I need about 3 or 4 more get-rich quick dreams. Ripple fits the bill.

etgd88q,dalebewan,34,"“Automatic” would imply something defining that it happens outside of their control. The only way that can happen is with a centralised service, which Bitcoin explicitly rejects. 

Every entity in Bitcoin is self sovereign. You can write anything you want in to a transaction or a block. You could even broadcast a block right now giving yourself all bitcoin in existence!

However, no one else will accept it if it’s against the rules that their nodes accept. I control the rules my node accepts, but if everyone I connect to disagrees with those rules, then I don’t get to participate in the network. 

Bitcoin works therefore on the idea of *consensus rules*. We all agree that right now, a miner can not reward themselves more than 12.5BTC plus the transaction fees for those transactions they put in the block. We also agree that the block is only valid if it proves the work was put in by creating a hash that is under the target difficulty.

Mainly:

* It is extraordinarily wasteful of electricity
* Its transaction speed is not fast enough to facilitate main stream acceptance
* It's specifically designed to be deflationary, which encourages people to hold on to it as a form of speculation rather than invest or spend the money to keep the economy going.  It's adoption would be harmful to any economy that adopted it.
* There are no consumer protections on it making it a ""caveat emptor"" market free of recourse for shoddy vendors.  This is a huge factor in using credit cards, a central mediating authority provides consumer protections.
* The price is too volatile to use it as a currency, so it's primary function ceases to exist, giving it no actual value, only speculative value.

etnct77,O1O1O1O,44,"I'm glad I wasn't the only one to spot that vacuous piece of blowhardary.  So many errors and misrepresentations it's hard to know where to begin.

1. Trump never even mentioned Bitcoin and yet that's all this article rambled on about.

2. The author clearly doesn't know the difference between money and currency.

3. He also doesn't realize the dollars in his pocket are simply promissory notes or coins of almost no intrinsic value. The US government is broke by over $20 trillion and has added another $2 trillion to that amount since 2017 (thanks Donald the Debtor). So without the force of US government agencies to collect taxes, seize property, and imprison those who don't comply they ate promissory notes for assets of nothing.  Is USD really looking so great now?

4. Saying Bitcoins only really use is illegal activities is patently ridiculous. Billions of BTC are traded back and forth daily as a medium of exchange. Of course it can be used for illegal activities but it turns out it really isn't that great for it since it is really quite traceable - something that law enforcement frequently exploits.  

5. He neglects to mention that illegal activities with USD are currently estimated to be more than the GDP of Canada a year or over $1.5 trillion. And that's just in the US. When you hear about a single case where a tiny branch of a Danish bank laundered $230B into the US banking system - and no one batted an eyelid for years after they were told - that's how bad it is. Money doesn't commit crimes people, corporations, and governments do.

6. The one crypto currency Trump mentioned by name was Libra which has none of the volatility issues the author flames on and on about. Yeah it has other issues but rampant volatility vs. fiat currency is not one of them. 

7. He gives zero explanation for why Facebook would need a banking license. In fact I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know that a bank does. Facebook isn't going to be issuing loans against fractional reserve deposits furthering the vacuous nature of the ""almighty dollar"". Facebook isn't going to be taking part in the Federal Reserve system. They aren't going to be cashing checks, issuing debit cards, holding customers funds etc.  Show me a single entity that created or controls a crypto currency that has a banking license for that purpose and I'll be very surprised indeed.

etpyjar,jtoomim,74,"There are some performance issues that ought to be addressed before we increase the blocksize limit past 32 MB. Currently, it can take [up to 190 seconds](https://coinspice.io/news/bitcoin-cash-miner-test-32mb-blocks-propagated-in-2-18-seconds-compared-to-193-seconds/) to propagate a 32 MB block to or from a miner in China using standard open-source software. That is not good -- anything above 20 seconds on a regular basis can screw up the mining incentives in a way that encourages mining pool centralization. There's a proprietary system out there that can reduce that 32 MB block propagation time to about 18 seconds, but it has not been opened up for security review, and using it puts you at the mercy of the company that operates it. Should we increase the blocksize limit further, this would make BCH miners basically dependent on proprietary software to achieve satisfactory performance.

There are a couple of open-source projects that aim to solve this performance problem with block propagation underway. Graphene, by /u/bissias, and Xthinner, by me, both aim to improve block propagation speed by about 4x to 10x using only open-source software. Both are close to completion, but neither has been deployed at a large enough scale to be relied upon yet. Some of us were hoping to have these projects finished and deployed in time for the May 15, 2019 hard fork, but we didn't make that deadline. Maybe it will be ready by November, but almost certainly by next May. (August is the cut-off deadline for getting into the November fork.)

As block sizes currently average around 0.2 MB, we don't think it's important to try to push an increase in the blocksize limit before we're really ready for it.

The group that was advocating for a 128 MB blocksize limit forked off from BCH and created their own currency. It's called BSV. They've been mostly using an unreliable trick to avoid the performance problems associated with large blocks. The specific feature that causes large blocks to propagate slowly is not actually the *size* of the block in MB, but the *number of transactions* in the block, so what BSV has been doing is making batches of non-financial transactions that are unusually large (about 10 kB each), so they can generate [128 MB blocks that only have 1,398 transactions](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-sv/block/576121). These huge blocks propagate very quickly, instead of the 250,000 transactions that a natural 128 MB block would have, and that allows BSV to advertise ""128 MB blocks!"" based on their best-case scenario without actually having done the engineering to survive the worst-case scenarios. 

Because the blocksize limit is in place specifically to protect BCH against those worst-case scenarios, BCH decided not to follow BSV with this strategy, and has retained the 32 MB limit until we have handled the worst-case scenarios properly.",2019-07-14 10:30:53

etqb74z,Cucktuar,55,"The miners are feeding numbers (1,2,3,...,n) into a specific hash function. A hash function takes a number as an input (say 1) and spits out some other number (say 8743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5). These functions are usually pretty mathematically heavy, and people are testing *very many* numbers. So testing these things is a time-intensive operation.

Eventually, somebody tests an input number (say 999,999,999) that produces an output number that looks something like this: 8743b52063cd800000000000000000000. Fantastic!

etpbd3x,vexcoin,40,"A lot of people are going to gloss this chart over.

So here's the rundown:

In 1967 you got paid 200 gold coins per year to do work. A house cost you 650 gold coins, so if you saved up for a few years you could buy one. A new car cost you 77 gold coins - you could afford one car for each member of your family. If you didn't own a house, rent was 3 gold coins per month (you earn 16/month). You could buy a week's worth of food for your whole family for 1 gold coin.

Today you get paid the equivalent of 50 gold coins per year. A house costs 270 gold coins, so while houses have become cheaper due to improving building techniques, it takes you much longer to save up to buy one. A new car is 30 gold coins, about 50% more of your yearly income than what it used to be, again even though the automotive industry has become more efficient. Average rent is 1 gold coin, but you only earn 4 gold coins per month, so it's much more of a chunk of your income. You can buy a week's worth of food for your whole family for 1/3rd a gold coin, representing 9% of your income versus the 6% it used to be.

Basically, your income has been cut by 1/4th and costs have gone up 50%.

With Bitcoin, your income would be cut by 1% AND costs would go down by 1%, netting a near-zero change in buying power, so saving would become valuable, and no banker would be skimming off the top of your labor. Everyone who owns Bitcoin is already enjoying this benefit.",2019-07-14 05:47:02

Anyone who gets on one of those ride-share scooter things knows any day might be their last.

""Silence, Departed."" He hissed that last bit. Uh oh, his eyes are glowing red now. I mean where his eyes would normally be. The eye sockets are red glow. I repeat, the eye sockets are red glow. I decide to play it cool and go quiet mode, just in case he has laser beams or something. 

Once he sees me shut my trap, he leans closer, ""We must travel quickly. The passage is closing, the way may soon be lost."" That made about as much sense as Bitcoin. I just give him a nod and two thumbs up. Pays to be positive when someone might have eye-socket-lasers. Just going with the flow. No one mind me.

He nods once and then turns away. He sort of floats rather than walks and I'm pulled along somehow. Can't really even say how I know I'm moving since everything is still all black. I guess maybe because his mumu is fluttering? 

Some time passes. I won't bother filling you in on that part, it was mostly me wondering whether Death has a dick. That's me, your humble narrator, asking the tough questions. Well, I didn't actually ask him. If he doesn't have one, I bet it's a sore subject.

The mumu stops fluttering. I think we're standing still. He's turning to look back at me now. The eye glow is back, but it's like pale blue or something. Not sure what that means. Maybe ice beams? I don't know why he'd need laser beams and ice beams, it seems unnecessary. 

""Protection."" He sounds nervous. That's sort of weird. What does a skeleton in a mumu got to fear? Broken bones? Calcium deficiency?

I lean forward, trying to make him feel a bit more comfortable, ""Don't worry man, I won't attack you. You're my ride.""

Oh shit. The eyes are flicking back to laser beam color. ""Not you."" Death sounds annoyed now. 

I throw up my hands, letting him know I'm cool. ""I know bro, that's what I just said. We're totally chill.""

""Them,"" he says. Looking into the black. I'm seeing nothing.

""Who?""

""The abyss. The night spreaders,"" he whispered, his hands gripping the scythe.

""Yeah, well, I'm not looking to get spread tonight, naw'what'i'mean?"" I wink at him.

""Departed, this is not a joke. They have swallowed much. Even the passage is under threat. We tread in the dark because the light has been stolen.""

I nod along. Sounded like serious stuff. ""That doesn't sound good."" 

Death regarded me quietly for a moment, the socket-glow gone. ""It is not. I will save who I must, but soon the Departed will be lost, the way to the Underworld closed.""

I wasn't sure what to make of that, but it looked like Death could use some commiseration. ""Sucks."" I wasn't sure what was so great about the Underworld, but it seemed like the right thing to say.

Death stared at me.

""I'm just saying it sounds bad dude."" I shrug, ""Like rain on your wedding day.""

The red socket glow returned. Guess wasn't much for irony.

Ring signatures are vastly different. With ring signatures, you take outputs from the blockchain and include them with the real input, thereby forming a ring. An observer will not know which output in the ring is the real input. Ring signatures work passively, i.e., do not require active participation (in contrast to, for instance, Wasabi or Coin Shuffle). Furthermore, Monero has stealth address and confidential transactions (i.e. masked amounts). Overall, Monero provides excellent privacy, especially in comparison with transparent ledgers (such as Bitcoin and Litecoin). 

Lastly, there are a few schemes where the trusted setup part is removed from the zkSNARKs / zkSTARKs. The Monero Research Lab is actively investigating these and I am hopeful Monero will be able to switch to such a scheme in the future.",2019-07-15 17:01:26

&gt;Then the assistant told the villagers, “Look at all these monkeys the man has in that big cage.  I will sell them to you at $50 each. When the man comes back you can sell the monkey’s back to him for $100.” The villagers queued up with all their saving to buy the monkeys.  The assistant took their money.

I have been saying this for some time. Quoting myself:

&gt;I agree Bitcoin and Monero are synergistic and they devour fiat faster together.

I agree with the bitcoin maximalists: you want to keep your base chain transparent, but not for the reasons they think. At this stage, cryptocurrencies are still vulnerable to governments. It's entirely possible to completely kill all cryptocurrencies. However, greater regulatory acceptance is allowing bitcoin to grow so large it will soon be unassailable. It wins via the prisoner's dilemma: defection becomes the optimal strategy. Once enough billionaires, pension funds and politicians start allocating to bitcoin, it's immune system can finally resist nation-state attacks. Bitcoin needs to be confusing and subversive for this strategy to play out. Externalising your regulatory risk into an even more confusing alt-coin will keep governments from realising what's at stake before it's too late.

Monero allows Bitcoin to externalise its regulatory risk with regards to privacy. I think we'd see much stronger opposition to crypto in general if Monero had been the first cryptocurrency. This allows the entire ecosystem to grow larger and faster than would be otherwise possible. Bitcoin pulls liquidity into the system and decentralized exchanges allow liquidity to flow between the private and transparent pools as needed. Monero is 99% of the volume on BISQ.

This is a network of countries spying on their own citizens, and ratting them out systematically to foreign governments.  [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)


Furthermore, according to Edward Snowden, FiveEyes and other larger “Eyes” nation’s will spy on one another’s citizens as a “service” to circumvent domestic spying laws.  Is it illegal for your government to spy on you without a warrant?  Well, they will just ask one of their Eyes partners to do it instead.

Fun fact:  If you are not from the U.S., and require a visa to enter the U.S., a new requirement demands that you disclose all your social media accounts (including Reddit, among others.). Under the Eyes programs, one can assume that your social media accounts will become globally known in a very short time.  I suspect that non-participant nation’s (like China) are doing everything they can to intercept communications and infiltrate Eyes programs.

etwleyf,DCinvestor,41,"Ethereum needs to show value in a different way, and maybe some similar ways. I think ETH as a form of money (Store of Value, Medium of Exchange, Unit of Account for the Ethereum decentralized economy) makes Ethereum more useful, and makes it more likely to host a non-sovereign economy.

I think Bitcoin can co-exist with that value (possibly), but ignoring very real issues around the 21M supply cap (which IMO, is not technically or economically possible) won't get them there. They've chosen to stand still, and basically never change again in a meaningful way.  Time will tell if this is a durable value proposition.  It is certainly one that is easy to understand right now, but its limits will start to show (again) later in this cycle as the network clogs up with no path forward to alleviate issues. 

And now, they're bragging about how great centralized custodians of Bitcoin is ""Good for Bitcoin.""  It was barely two and a half years ago that the Bitcoin community was focused on killing the banks- and now, they just want to give them another tool.  *Giving decentralized assets to centralized institutions and hoping they change global finance isn't a revolution.*

I think Bitcoin's market cap will be capped at what Gold has achieved (approximately $8tn, and maybe it gets to less).  that's still a lot of upside for Bitcoin).  But that caps its world changing potential.  Gold already exists as a non-state controlled asset (for issuance and custody), and most states have abandoned the Gold standard decades ago.  But we are expecting them all to adopt the Bitcoin standard?

It literally makes no sense to me.  Bitcoin simply cannot scale for peer to peer use, and Lightning will likely be a dead end.  There is no other solution other than to use custodial solutions, and we all know what the banks will do with those...

Meanwhile, the innovation on Ethereum offers a meaningful alternative.  I believe it will deliver scaling at L1 and L2, and I believe it's creating more ways *for ETH to actually be used as money through DeFi*\- not just call itself money which sits in an account and never moves.  And I do believe that it will provide the security needed for a wide variety of Web3 dapps as well.

That's the vision, that's why many of us are here.  Bitcoin can't do it anymore- I do think Ethereum can.  But don't mistake current mob appeal of Bitcoin as it having won or achieving the world changing potential Satoshi and other early Bitcoiners articulated.

It is only just recently, from January 2019 onwards, that we have started to see a reversal of this trend.  While Total Market Capitalization was increasing, BTC Dominance increased as well.  This was atypical; traditionally BTC Dominance and Total Market Capitalization had inverse correlation.  During downturns, alts typically lose much higher percentages of their values vs. BTC.  


So I think the only information to take from the 2019 price movements is that BTC price and Alt prices have become less correlated.  Unless alts can start regaining market share and out-gain BTC, their risk/reward is simply not worthwhile compared to investing in BTC.",2019-07-17 19:40:08

etyv8gn,JLBesq1981,43,"&gt;A former Microsoft employee was arrested Tuesday after he allegedly schemed to steal $10 million in digital currency, like gift cards, from the company and bought a new car and home with the illegal profits. The Associated Press reports 25-year-old Volodymyr Kvashuk was responsible for testing Microsoft’s online retail sales platform—which gave him access to gift cards and other digital currency that he would sell on reseller websites. According to the [Justice Department](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-microsoft-software-engineer-charged-mail-fraud-scheme-steal-digital-value-such), Kvashuk initially stole amounts like $10,000 but started stealing millions over time. He then allegedly erased traces of his fraud, laundered the money through a bitcoin service, and had the funds transferred into his account. Over seven months, $2.8 million was transferred to his bank accounts, authorities say. In addition, Kvashuk allegedly bought a $160,000 Tesla and a $1.7 million waterfront home. He was fired last month after Microsoft investigators confronted him about the thefts in May. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Kvashuk’s attorney did not respond to the AP’s request for comment.

eu06hq0,NotGonnaGetBanned,41,"This post is going to discuss alts, but only in the context of their ratios, and contains useful information for those who are trading BTC against alts either short or long, with the objective of acquiring more BTC. I have posted it in the alt thread, but I do believe it is relevant for the main BTC thread as well. 

I made a spreadsheet of the top 10 alts, leaving out USDT and BNB. The dataset I used is the all time historical data from CMC for each coin. I am posting some conclusions from it comparing their BTC ratios over a long term 

The tl;dr:

1. every alt checked has a median negative return in terms of its BTC ratio (even the ones with lifetime BTC ratio gains);
1. every alt shows ~80 to 87% loss of BTC ratio from all time high (BSV is an outlier. Do you really think it won't keep falling?);
1. The above two points are related, and taken together mean that, on average, each day you are more likely than not to lose BTC value in every alt examined;
1. as a corollary from the above, the fact that some alts haven't given up 100% of their BTC gains means that the days they do increase, they increase disproportionately, but not all alts do this, and none of the alts have done so since their respective ATH;
1. the timing of the ATH's indicates there was no alt season. What actually happened was a series of pump and dumps brought on by the ICO craze. The fact that some peaked well before the BTC ATH, and some peaked well after, combined with how quickly they collapsed, indicates there was no ""season. By the time ETH was at ATH, XRP was already down 55% from its ATH. By the time BCH was peaking, ETH was already down 67% from its ATH. When XLM and TRX peaked, BCH was already down 34% from its ATH (just 14 days later!). When EOS was hitting its ATH, XLM was down 19% and TRX was down 29%.
1. Leaving aside LTC and BSV as outliers (too early and too late respectively), ""alt season"" ran:

&gt;* May 17, 2017 XRP ATH;
&gt;* June 12, 2017 ETH ATH;
&gt;* December 20, 2017 BCH ATH;
&gt;* January 3, 2018 XLM ATH;
&gt;* January 4, 2018 TRX ATH;
&gt;* April 29, 2018 EOS ATH;


My conclusion is that alts will have pump and dumps from time to time, but almost without exception decrease in value relative to Bitcoin. This makes them a very poor indicator for those looking to trade the ratios to acquire more BTC. The pump will come out of nowhere and fade away just as fast. Missed opportunities can quickly turn what would have been a profitable flip into a massive loss. 

Similarly, the unpredictability of these pumps makes leveraged shorts dangerous as fuck. Very few readers can survive their short going under water by 300 or 400%. There seems to be a lot of long term profit in BTC in shorting these things, but tight stops and willingness to reexamine the market is crucial. 

If you can catch the right pump and abandon your alt before it dumps, you can increase your BTC stack. The time frame for doing so is small. If you can catch the right pump and short the shit out of it, you could make a ton of BTC. 

If a coin has a major (200% pump), every pump after that one is less than the previous. 

Alt season was never really a thing, and is simply a by-product of having thousands of shitcoin ICOs all entering the market at the same time. The timing of the pumps among the coins doesn't even line up well with anything. 

My theory: alt coins will generally have unpredictable temporary breakouts to historic ATH on the BTC ratio. After the breakout they will continue their gradual slide from ATH to 0BTC.

There is no evidence to suggest that the coins that reached significant ATH and withdrew more than 80% will ever see another such pump again.

etxs1bv,bitvote,37,"For traders, I think it's important to remember that bitcoin has a significant anchor tied around it's neck. 

It's called inflation. 

In the form of the mining reward: 12.5btc every 10 minutes. 1,800 BTC per day. Takes real money to keep the price above $10k, something on the order of $500M+ of net inflows every month.

For comparison, net inflows into US-based ETFs is on the order of $50B (Q1 2019 per Fidelity, link below). Let's say $20B/mo. So bitcoin at $10k requires 5% of that. That's not trivial. 

In my view, this foundational reality, is one of the reasons that bitcoin tends toward parabolas. And why they break down. Miners still be mining. And they can sit on coins for a little bit, but then they start to want to capture some of the price spike. and then we start breaking down. 

I would be surprised if we _didn't_ revisit $8k. And even dip into $6k. 

If we don't see $6k again, I'll be thrilled. but c'mon, this is bitcoin. it can do things.

There were no stablecoins - in fact, there were *no tokens* besides ETH. The first ERC-20 token would not be created on mainnet until April, and it would be over 1.5 years until MakerDAO would be launched. DeFi was a vague idea - a type of system that everyone dreamed about in Ethereum's future.

In March 2016, Ethereum 2.0 and PoS were still [rattling around in Vitalik's head](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm/) as overarching concepts, with no code written and no solid plans.

eu4fjdo,DCinvestor,56,"I know many find the recent price action unsettling, but as a long term investor, I am more confident buying here than I have been in a while.  Warning: but it doesn't mean we don't see a near term pull back though.

Here's are a few simple reasons for why I feel this way:

1) The early stage bull market thesis is very likely confirmed at this point.  We can't be positive yet, but I think it will be 100% confirmed by the end of the year.  For me, a 35% to 40% retrace is likely maximum buying opportunity after a first parabolic move after initial bottom recovery.

2) Recent under-performance of ETH versus BTC, while actual technology fundamentals and adoption continue to grow.  I won't list them all here, but stuff like DeFi, blockchain gaming, ETH evolving strong monetary characteristics and brand, and of course Eth 2.0 progress.  If you believe all of the Bitcoin Maxis saying Ethereum is dead and no coin other than Bitcoin will accrue value, then you are likely doing yourself a disservice.  At a minimum, ETH will very likely do well as #2, especially as fund managers start to diversify to chase alpha.

3) Beyond price action, sentiment around ETH is irrationally depressed versus the overall crypto market (which is mostly dominated by BTC).  I enjoy being greedy when others are fearful, especially when I have a very good understanding of what I'm investing in.

When I was buying back in peak crypto winter, I didn't feel as confident as I do now.  I didn't get much ETH below $100 as I was afraid it could plummet to $40, but I got plenty at around $100 to $120, and kept buying aggressively through $200, as I am doing once again.

*This is why over the few days I've been stockpiling even more ETH at these levels*, along with a bit of BTC as well for my long term positions.  Time will tell if these were the right moves, but I have never felt more confident about an investment decision in this space since I first started buying Bitcoin in 2013.  I could still be wrong though and ready to wait for a while in case I am, and we should know within the next 6 months if I was.

1. The native cryptocurrency creates the economic incentives that motivate participants in a network to act as intended. Without this incentive, there is no blockchain, there is just a database with some time stamps - like a dumb excel spreadsheet.

2. Blockchains require sufficient scale and distribution to create stability, security and liquidity. Anyone can copy the Bitcoin code and create a new blockchain, but to rival the Bitcoin network requires an even larger network of miners, merchants, infrastructure and investors.

3. At most, only a handful in blockchains can ever achieve sufficient scale and distribution to be useful mediums of exchange. Similar to how the US Dollar is a stable currency because it is a widely used currency, Bitcoin is the most stable blockchain because it is the biggest. This is a virtuous cycle where the bigger the blockchain network, the more reliable it is and the more reliable it is, the bigger it will grow.",2019-07-18 07:41:41

Hey everyone,

I am currently studying abroad in South America and have been travelling for the summer.

One of these nights, I needed to get some thin-air based fiat to take my beautiful girlfriend on a nice dinner. I went to an ATM to get some cash, but my bank's debit card hasn't been working well here so I was unable to get some. (It's also kind of hard to get a new card being here).

Thankfully, there was a Bitcoin ATM near us, and guess what: **IT WORKED!** (I had my girlfriend record the whole thing!)

I was able to exchange some of my precious satoshis for stinky fiat in a couple of minutes! Really once I confirmed the transaction on my wallet, the whole thing worked out super fast. I think it took longer for me to type the wallet password than for the ATM to release the cash.

I know this will end up being a very expensive dinner, but it was absolutely worth it! (I'll make sure to refill ASAP).

Anyways, just wanted to share this with you guys!!

eu7wqnk,DCinvestor,38,"Can you believe that at one point in the not so distant past, XRP had a market cap slightly greater than Ethereum's.  XRP has no real use cases and essentially no real use, but it happened anyway.  This is the level of irrationality still rife in this market today.  *Marketing and hype can win over fundamentals, but only in the near-term.*

And now, I think ETH is priced irrationally low versus Bitcoin.  Bitcoin does have the the liquidity and volume advantage, but Ethereum will start to gain against it as futures and other financial products (most of which are exclusively Bitcoin right now) start to expand to Ethereum.

If you look at most of the streamlined crypto financial reporting tools, the focus tends to be on Bitcoin and Ethereum- pretty much ignoring anything else.  If you view these entities as a leading market, they are telling us that Ethereum is and will be a major financial asset in the crypto space.  And of course, ETH is one of only two cryptoassets I'm aware of which the SEC has explicitly deemed a non-security (the other is BTC).

This isn't just a gold (BTC) and silver (ETH) comparison- ETH is like a silver which will only continue to get better and more useful over time, while BTC is a gold which will remain stagnant and will likely only have as much relevance as the commodity it now seeks to emulate.  And Ethereum has one advantage Bitcoin will never have- diverse and trust-minimized / trust-less financial use cases.  

ETH is not only used as money today in the decentralized Ethereum economy, but Ethereum is used to store all sorts of financial assets and create new ones which would not be possible without it.  *Watch over the next 5 years as Ethereum begins to devour more and more assets onto the chain.  As that happens, economic activity on Ethereum will begin to skyrocket, compared to Bitcoin which is effectively a mono-asset market.*

And over a 10 to 20 year timeframe, I'm willing to bet that the asset which actually allows for native decentralized finance (that's ETH) has a decent shot at becoming a broadly accepted money, versus something whose monetary premium is derived essentially from memes only (that's BTC).

Ethereum is a massive sleeper at #2 with much room to grow, and much world changing potential still to come.  And right now, it's trading at only 12.5% or 1/8th of the BTC marketcap.  Unless you're one of those people who believe BTC dominance is going to 95% and all other assets will die, this is a very compelling discount.

Very few other chains provide any meaningful economic value to the space, so I believe most of the value will accrue to ETH and BTC over time. That's why I remain about 80% ETH and 20% BTC, and continue to be very optimistic about Ethereum and ETH's future.",2019-07-19 22:58:24

A dog hinted at the package giving them cause to open it, expecting drugs but finding around $10k instead, that lead to them getting a warrant to search my house which i had around 3lbs of weed in my bedroom closet just kinda chillin so I was charged for that and eventually pleaded to 1 count of possession with intent, paid a $600 fine, got probation for 3 years, then got my record expunged, then a year or 2 after that my state legalized.

Reasons they suspected my package (according to police report): Handwritten address, Overnight package, Signature waved, Additional tape added to box. This was before there was more common discussion of how to properly avoid detection.

eu84xjm,ethHead15,70,"Compound Finance, a Defi application that enables non-custodial borrowing and lending, has recently added wBTC (programmable bitcoin on ethereum) to its application. This means you can now borrow bitcoin to go long ETH/BTC (meaning you expect ETH to rise relative to BTC) without losing custody of your crypto. This is enabled by the programability and developer community building on top of Ethereum

**How to guide**

Step 1) Lock up ETH as collateral in Compound [https://compound.finance/](https://compound.finance/) 

Step 2) Borrow WBTC

Step 3) Immediately sell WBTC for ETH on the decentralized exchange Kyber ([https://kyberswap.com/](https://kyberswap.com/))

Step 4) Exit trade by selling ETH on Kyber for WBTC and returning WBTC to Compound

You earn a profit if ETH goes up relative to BTC 

Of course, this is not without risk and please monitor your position to avoid liquidation.

Ill be the boring and vague sounding oldtimer I used to roll my eyes at and ignore when I was younger though and offer some macro advice. If you can, start saving up a bunch of money into a cash or low yield account that is separate from all your other finances. Look for companies that you think are the grinders that I talked about. Keep that list updated on a monthly basis. Now comes the hard part. Youre going to think to yourself - these companies are so great, I have to buy just a little bit of them or ill miss the boat. DONT DO IT. Wait for a macro trend (like years, not months wise) to go bad, like really blood on the streets bad. Think of a level so low that you think would be impossible for the market to hit. Then drop that in half. Then set your buy targets for those companies for every time the market drops 20% below that mark. Furthermore, set your buy targets so you are almost buying 2x as much as your previous purchase. Yes, this means youll be buying miniscule amounts at first relative to your total cash, but these cycles usually end in panics, and you want to be giddy with delight instead of anxious during a panic. I know your saying ""Thats a horrible idea and ill miss out because the market will never get that low"" or ""I should have bought more during the low"". Thats what I used to say but after seeing enough cycles, you learn that those impossible opportunities keep coming up. The opportunity may not even be in the sector you are looking at, thats how I got into crypto in the first place (after seeing Bitcoin drop over 80% in 2015). And I cant stress this enough. You cant buy at a level you think is really low. You have to wait for it to reach levels you literally thought were impossible, and even then you are just buying very small amounts that exponentially increase as it goes lower. If that impossible opportunity ever comes up, and you end up with a massive amount of those companies during the next boom cycle, do this plan in reverse. Think of a level that ""no way its ever going to get that high"", then double that, then set exponential sell orders for every time the price increases 20% or 50% higher than your previous order. Most young readers are going to ignore this advice or have already stopped reading. I dont blame them.

**Inspiration:**

Bitcoin has “died” hundreds of times.  Bitcoin has been called a scam, a con, a ponzi, a pyramid, too inefficient, and too volatile.   On top of all the FUD, critics have cheered that if Bitcoin becomes too popular, governments will attack it. Yet for some reason, adoption, usage and the price continue to grow.  Bitcoin, the honey badger of money, lives and has thrived under constant attack.  That’s because, it’s a concept that recognizes the inalienable right to store and transact value.  Attack it, and it will use code and math to fork into something better and stronger! 

These are fine art paper wallets (with exchangeable keys).

euagxdg,Crypto-knowdeway,41,"Haha, glad I could help 😄

3 things piqued my initial interest in the space. The first was learning what Blockchain was. I had friends spending bitcoin for... ahem... things... many years ago. It just seemed like funky internet money. 

Later, I came to learn what Blockchain actually was and why it was so much more than just simply a value transfer mechanism. Ethereum
showed everyone that the technology was far more potent than people had realised and for that, Vitalik will live on in history as a genius pioneer, no doubt.

Regards to VeChain - I had my eyes and ears open now knowing we were on the cusp of a technological revolution (between AI, IOT ((internet of things)), Blockchain and 5G, we will create the ‘digital economy’ - automation, intelligence bred in to our infrastructure, ultra efficient resource consumption, real time oversight in ways currently impossible... a lot of stuff is going to fundamentally change for mankind and the global economy in the next decade. I feel very positive these things will usher in a better world for everyone). As with all major new technologies, massive wealth is made by the early adopters. Computers, the internet, mobile phones.. when there is game changing tech on the horizon, you want to invest early and identify the most promising projects ASAP. 

Specifically what grabbed me about VeChain - well, I actually came across a comment on r/cc (RIP - that place used to actually be a useful hub of information rather than the toxic cesspit it has become) about Jim Breyer investing in VeChain. He’s one of the world’s most successful venture capitalists if you didn’t know. His only other crypto investment - Ethereum. That caught my attention immediately. Then I learned that DNVGL were working with VeChain and planning to acquire a stake. I have a family with an engineering background. DNVGL are arguably one of THE most important companies in the world, yet most people probably never heard of them. 

They literally specify the standards that industries and governments adhere to. Gas pipelines, medical infrastructure, renewables and oil, cargo ships.. you name it. They’re INSANE. They are THE trust machine for global business right now and they wanted to digitise their business model. They chose VeChain as their vector. Well, that sold me. It felt too good to be true, to be honest. DNVGL will digitise their business model and use VeChain, but not only that, such a huge portion of the globe utilise DNVGL’s services that it is inevitable they will also use DNVGL’s Blockchain of choice. Because, why wouldn’t you? You trust this entity to certify and ensure everything you do is above board. Why wouldn’t you use their Blockchain of choice for this new economic paradigm? 

Then came the medium articles. Check out VeChain’s medium accounts (I think there are two). You’ll learn tons more about projects that have been in the works for years and you’ve probably never heard of them. They excited me and really opened my eyes to the scales of things to come. The excitement just never faded. I’ve been here most days ever since, chatting with this great community, having laughs, speculating and marvelling as this thing grows.

Blockchain is a new technology that will literally become part of basically every single business’ data handling/sharing/collating processes in some way. It can create new collaborative business models in ways that were impossible before (carbon ecosystem for example).. for me,
Someone who loves science and technology... I just can’t get enough. That’s why I stuck around so long. I am watching history being written and the transition to a new economic paradigm. 

Sorry for the absolute essay here 😄 my brain is full of so much info newer people have probably never even heard of. It’s a shame. Maybe we should start reposting throw back Medium articles so people can see what’s been in the works. In fact, I may suggest that to some of the mods.",2019-07-20 19:19:39

eu9ic1l,FaceDeer,27,"I don't tear Lightning down because I like something else better, but because Lightning is just not capable of doing its intended job well. The main flaws are both rooted in the underlying Bitcoin blockchain. For one, the lack of sophisticated on-chain state and scripting means kludges have been required, such as the need to monitor the chain to actively block fraud. Raiden shows you can avoid that with better smart contracts. For another, small blockchain capacity means that channels can't be reliably or cheaply opened and closed in times of high demand. The general routing problem is still unsolved, too.

Lightning might still have a place on Bitcoin despite all that, but that place is only a niche. Bitcoin is betting the farm on Lightning handling  *everything* and that's just not going to work. Bitcoin can't start fixing its fundamental shortcomings until it realizes Lightning won't save it from them.

euijpf8,notmyrralname,54,"Rule #1
R/cryptocurrency is a cesspool of immature and outright deceitful people that will lie to you about how awesome the coin is they hold a lot of and how shitty yours is because it isnt theirs (or bitcoin specifically). 

So. Take everything everyone here says with a fine, fine grain of salt. Including what im telling you. 

Mistrust everyone. Everyone is trying to scam you or persuade you in some way, shape or form. 

Rule #2
Do your own research.

Here again, 99 out of 100 articles, posts, videos, etc., are all made to (again) persuade you. Youll find nothing unbiased.

The information for a project will be biased. And the ones against that project will be biased. 

So, after you do a ton of reading and decide you like coin “x” because youve read everything you can positive about it. Dont outright dismiss the negative. Usually there is some truth. 

The converse applies as well.

The important thing to do is be open to learn and change. Because in reality this entire space is still extremely young. 

You may come to the conclusion the coin “y” is a scam. If you are not open you will dismiss all information that is positive about it.

Truth is hard to find here. Often the truth is in the middle of two opposing sides. 

Rule #3
Do not leave any significant amount of money on an exchange. What “significant” is is different for everyone. Exchanges (including coinbase) are businesses that can (and have) up and disappeared with all their users money. Learn how to store your coins (read: wallets). 


Some starting points:

Some love it, others hate it, but coinbase is a great easy way to get started. From there, there are lots of other options for onramps into crypto.

Coinmaretcap.com is both good and absolute shit.

Somewhere in the top 5 cryptos are where you should start out. Lear about one at a time: what problems are they designed to solve, how long have they been around, who is behind their creation and how credible are they?

eugjyry,gandrewstone,46,"Although there are some arguments against SPV that have been understood for years, the timing of this is probably about consolidation and cementing of power into the Bitcoin Core group.  One key aspect of the BU effort to gain 51% of the BTC network in 2015-2017 was the fact that SPV nodes would follow the majority hash power fork even if some consensus rules changed.  So a mining ""take over"" of BTC pulls all SPV nodes along with it.  This was arguably game over, since many exchanges (and of course all phone wallets) back then used SPV because the wallet inside the full node was incapable of enterprise level activity.

With the failure of lightning, it seems inevitable that people will propose another block size increase in the next few years...

The neutrino protocol (SPV replacement) passes a probabilistic summary of the block to every light wallet.  The light wallet then checks the summary against what its interested in, and requests and processes the full block if there's a match.

Therefore, in neutrino light wallets occasionally validate entire blocks and so would not follow a large block fork (or other consensus change).  So a majority miner hard fork does not automatically get all neutrino wallets.

It should be noted that a simple attack against neutrino wallets is to send a small amount of dust to the wallet in every block.  This would force the wallet to download and process every block, almost turning it into a full node from a bandwidth perspective.  

This attack is defeated by limiting the block size for two reasons.  High cost transactions make the attack expensive.  And anyway since blocks are small, many phones and data plans could download the 1MB block every 10 minutes more cheaply than the cost to the attacker to issue the tx (especially since client phones are likely connected to WiFi for much of the day).

So once neutrino is deployed, it will justify keeping 1MB blocks for longer.

For these same reasons, the neutrino protocol isn't a great fit in BCH and would be a disaster for BSV light wallets.  An attacker can send dust to cheaply force a BCH neutrino wallet to download a full large block of unknown size (could be &gt; 32MB since BCH is committed to growing the block size as needed) of data every 10 minutes.

However, you can achieve a good compromise between privacy and scalability if you combine SPV and neutrino by having full nodes provide block summaries (neutrino) but then requesting the ""merkle block"" using a bloom filter (SPV).  This efficiently defeats the tx withholding attack on SPV because you can detect a node that is withholding. 

How to do that?  Nodes can't lie about the neutrino block summary or its summary doesn't match other nodes' summaries.  The summary is small so the client can request it from multiple nodes... or even better commit a hash of the summary to the block header.  When the client requests the SPV merkle block, the server is not allowed to return no matches -- the server must ""prove"" some portion of the neutrino summary by providing the tx set that created that portion.  So the withholding server would have to generate a fake tx that is a bloom filter conflict with the tx it wants to hide.  This can be made arbitrarily expensive at the cost of bigger neutrino block summaries.",2019-07-23 00:29:31
euh99is,MarchewkaCzerwona,45,"Hello there.

Miners follow profit and I doubt they will abandon btc anytime soon as even though btc is crippled, it is very good source of income.

Saying that, it looks like miners do keep Bch alive and are willing to support it too. How this will play out in time, I don't really know, but Bch at least have a chance for adoption and growth, while btc pretty much is at its limits.

Bitcoin cash was born in hard fork that was necessary to increase blocksize. It was very needed hard fork, but as you had probably seen by yourself, many disagree with that and stayed on btc chain. How is it going to be for them? They'll probably be regularly experiencing high fees and long waiting times wondering what went wrong.

Bitcoin cash increased blocksize, but it also reversed some changes done to bitcoin in the past that were impairing its ability to function as money.

Zero conf is back in better shape than in btc. It is not ideal for all transactions, but fairly good for small ones.

Blocks are bigger at 32mb, but that will be increased when safely possible. What is happening in the development somebody would have to help you, as I don't follow that part lately. Pretty much since local.bitcoin.com and cashshuffle in electrum cash, I have no doubt Bch is developing good.

eujd6hh,texfilmguy,41,"The negativity sucks. I came into the market fall 2017. January 2018 was a gut punch for sure. So I sat back and thought did I make a mistake? Did I choose the wrong horse. 

So that question forced me to dig deeper into what this was all about. And as each piece of research came into focus I was only emboldened. 

Regulation has been the one bridge nobody was able to cross. 

Facebook changed all of that and put it right front and center. 

Brad Garlinghouse has been pretty quiet for a while... popping up here and there... David Schwartz was the primary interface personality or commenter.... but now... brad is making the rounds again... pressing into the idea the regulation is the key. the timing is interesting...

We’ve had the president talking about crypto and how he doesn’t like them because they are unregulated. 

Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary held a press conference talking specifically about crypto and that not all are the same and that regulation was needed. 

Jerome Powell the head of the federal reserve was also talking about bitcoin and the need for regulation last week. 

Facebook testified for two days in front of congress within a month of publicly talking about libra. That move woke up the government in a huge way.  All of these things happened in the last three or so weeks 

Let’s not forget about SBI VC trade which is literally any day now... Ripple is in virtually all the banks in India now.... 

XCurrent is the primary solution ripple is using during this time of non regulation. Banks can not afford to expose themselves to risk by using an asset that has no legal framework yet. Therefore everyone is waiting for the greenlight to start safely and without fear of legal ramifications, using XRP in the work flow. 

All the stuff about the SWIFT gpi now settling in 13 seconds and is catching up misses the real point.... it’s the tied up capital the banks want to repatriate back home. 

With SWIFT, and their GPI, and even XCurrent... nostro and vostro accounts (Latin for “yours” and “mine” I think...) still remain in play. 

Xrp entering the space through xrpaid... which also XCurrent 4.0 is able to use either XCurrent or xrapid.... but with Xrp entering the space those nostro and vostro accounts come home to those banks. That is a size of cash in the trillions. I’ve heard and read about that number being between 15-27 trillion just parked in accounts. That’s the real key here. 

It sucks. I hate the price being where it is and trust me... I bought from .09 to 3.75.... and all the way back down.... it’s been a soul searching year. But for me... after commiting to doing the research.... educating myself... I could be wrong in my bet here... this could all disappear... but I don’t think I’m wrong. And I don’t think it will.... 

Regulations are what’s holding everything back. 

Keep your head up. I started grabbing some other coins... something to keep me entertained in the short term... 

The reason I’m here though which is why I think we all are is that we need a change in our lives... for me I took a look at what was the biggest bet out there. 

I had an idea what Netflix was going to be... but it needed the faster internet to make streaming a reality... didn’t have any money back then though.. poor college kid...remember getting Netflix DVD’s in the mail? That’s kinda like the nostro accounts... Netflix had to park DVDs around the country in envelopes in order to physically deliver it to the end user... once the digital versions of those discs came along... meaning streaming services where you could stream an HD movie and not have to put a disc in a machine...( hopefully the analogy is clear :) I really see that being where we are with crypto and ripple and Xrp specifically. 

Facebook and Libra angered countries around the world. It was not a warm welcome. 

Ripple on the other hand has been closely working with the regulators this whole time. 

Sorry for the long post...reply... whatever this is... I just wanted to send some encouragement that either we are wrong... or we are right... and if we are wrong hopefully it wasn’t more than you could lose... but if we are right... and all the signs are saying we are... then we are really going to be right. And for me... that potential upside is very much worth the risk. 

Keep your head up dig in deeper to the research... do some yoga... drink tea... take a dog for a walk... hopefully it’s your dog. Don’t steal a dog. 

Anyway mostly a long time lurker both in the Xrp community and reddit at large. Just wanted to throw hopefully some positivity your way and out to the world in general.

But it's still far from enough, the vast majority of people still treat monero as a shitcoin or a scam. And I don't understand, I really don't understand. Unless the sole purpose of these people is to enrich themselves with fiat by promoting bitcoin. And if that's the case, then it's obvious they don't care about the tech and what is being built, and if it's that obvious, then I don't understand why these people have such a big audience.

As far as I know the Monero project is one of the very few, and probably the only other than Bitcoin, which was released in an honest way, is completely open source, and has a large developer base. This last point is important because anyone can release a coin fairly in 15 minutes, but the hardest part of an open source project is to get a decent number of developers and contributors, which Monero has today, and that Bitcoin also has, and I do not know any other project that is completely open source and with an open governance system. Ethereum and the other chains that promote the development of dApps interest me less because they are mainly governed by registered companies and must follow certain laws to continue operating. Bitcoin and monero are currencies and are immune to this.

Then why don't we hear more about monero in the main crypto communication channels? Why is there still so much resistance to accepting the Monero project as legitimate? What is missing for this project to be considered at the same level as bitcoin? 5 years of history is not enough? Wasn't survival to attacks (MoneroV, Monero Original, ASICs) not enough? What is the missing piece of this puzzle? Do you think this is going to happen some day? If yes, then what will change from today?

&amp;#x200B;

However, the dominant node software is Bitcoin Core, so it's likely that whatever is in bitcoin core roadmap will end up to be bitcoin features.  


Now, who controls bitcoin core? That again has a fairly decentralized development team, with some developers paid by various companies, some independent. The lead developer - who maintains that his role is more of a janitor - is Wladimir J Wan Der Laan, who works at MIT Digital Currency intiative.  


You might have heard that Blockstream runs Bitcoin. They do have a stake in development, as they pay a few Bitcoin Core developers. Their reason for this funding is of course that their business model depends on a working bitcoin, so in line with what's normal in open source, they help fund development. That said, without finding a direct source, I have heard that their working contract is pretty specific about their work on Bitcoin Core is not to be influenced by the company, their work there is their own.  


There is of course no requirement to run Bitcoin Core, and being open source software it can, and has been, forked. Users of it tend to stick with Bitcoin Core when running on the real bitcoin  Blockchain (BTC), because that's where things will be happening.  


So, what can we expect?

# BankDex and the Lightning Network

A lightning network can be described as a protocol layer that enables low-latency, high volume digital micropayments without the help of an intermediary. The fundamental technology of lightning network involves a payment channel, a local two-party consensus.

Both the parties involved in the transaction sends an initial amount of Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency token into a multisignature transaction. The multisignature transaction involves a local consensus on the existing balance that is allocated between the two parties in the transaction.

Any update regarding the allocation of the existing balance can be only be made with the cooperation of both entities involved in the transaction. This is done with the help of a new transaction that spends the funds allocated for the multisignature transactions allocated to each party.",2019-07-25 00:34:28

So does aluminum, and sand, and nitrogen...

Think again.  Consider that it's possible you don't understand money, what makes something a good form of money.

Consider it carefully.

Consider that the properties of good money are:
 *  Durable
 *  Divisible
 *  Portable
 *  Fungible
 *  Recognizable
 *  Scarce
 *  Difficult to create and/or counterfiet

Using that list, can you see why gold is more valuable and a better form of money than either sand, or aluminum?  Yes.  Gold has all seven properties.  So does Bitcoin.  In fact, Bitcoin is more scarce than gold, and more difficult to counterfeit.",2019-07-26 01:10:57

##### ""This is good for Bitcoin""

Because if the transaction rate *had* risen we'd be seeing high fees by now, as people competed for their transaction to be added to the next 10 minute block. And those fees would kill the demand (and price) of Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin has become unused - nothing more than a speculative Ponzi scheme of bagholders hoping, to sell to a greater fool, on the sme exchange, at a higher price.

euw3zyn,zombieninja,1,"
&gt;This is why I can't support libertarianism: ""just build your own"" doesn't work when the bedrock of business - the banks - stand agaianst you.

I get what you're saying, but there's nothing libertarian about banks.  It's regulations stacked on regulations to distribute and manage fiat currency without intrinsic value.

In the deregulated libertarian Utopia you could just trade a machine gun for a bag of weed or a blowjob. Or, more realistically, accept something like Bitcoin without having to worry about how to file taxes.

The problem is that right now, the government is shielding certain companies (banks, tech companies, etc) from being held liable for their actions. Yet at the same time they're throwing up all these barriers to entry to the market. Want to start a Facebook? Cool, but you'll need content filtering, wiretapping, etc. Want to start a bank? Great! Here's federal regulations, state regulations, and an alphabet soup of oversight agencies.

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that ""libertarianism"" as told by liberals is usually the Tea Party and their Republican offshoots. But really, that's not libertarianism, it's sucking vested corporate dick for money.",2019-07-26 00:50:39

euw379f,chernobyl169,1,"Jesus H. McChrist. I can't believe the Bitcoin community has become this overrun by so many people incapable of reading comprehension. The failure of BCH is not in the technology, it's in the people.

&gt; I don't see why that would be the case.

Then I can't help you. If you don't understand the *fundamental facts* of security and risk management in business, you are out of your league already. It looks like you didn't read, you cherry-picked.

&gt; Why does 0-conf care about 1-conf but not 2- or 10-?

**ONCE AGAIN.** For the last time. *Because unconfirmed transactions represent risk.* Confirmations do not eliminate that risk; they reduce it. A longer confirmation is a greater reduction in risk. If I trust an unconfirmed transaction, I'm taking on a risk. **That risk is higher with a lower block time, because shorter blocks are easier to reorg and have a lower incentive threshold for miners to secure!** The confidence in a transaction confirmed by a ten-minute block is very high - so high, in fact, that a transaction *awaiting* confirmation in such a block is reasonably trustworthy. The cost of an attacker to bribe a miner into rejecting the transaction is very high. However, lower that block time and you lower that confidence - so low, in fact, that the risk profile is *worse* than VISA, rendering BCH useless for merchant purposes.

Is that fucking exhaustive enough for you? I am tired of re-re-re-re-re-explaining this, so if it isn't, too bad because I'm not going to do this a seventh time.",2019-07-26 00:42:30

if you were able to contact the atm operator very quickly then they might be able to do a replace by fee transaction. but they need to know your new safe receiving address and the old bad one to confirm the amount to send by replace by fee.",2019-07-27 07:29:23

ev65soy,igadjeed,1,"&gt; don't understand what a bitcoin is

A coin is one output of one transaction. Its value can be any number of Satoshis  
When your friend sends you some amount of Bitcoin, his transaction contains one or more outputs. One of the outputs contains your Bitcoin address and the number of Satoshis being sent to you  
This output is one of your coins. You own it because you are the only person who knows the private key matching the address on the coin  
A coin can only be spent  

*    completely, no partial spending is possible  
*    once  

&gt; How do people control the codebase?

This is obvious when you read the discussion threads in the Bitcoin GitHub. It works by consensus and cooperation  

&gt; Do wallets controlled by someone else, not sort of defeat the purpose of bitcoin?

Correct

ev670yx,ExtraIncrease,1,"Yes, I do believe that there will come a day where Bitcoin suddenly becomes money. However, perception has nothing to do with this. You can perceive Bitcoin as money all you want, but that doesn't change the fact it's legally property. Once the law changes, it becomes currency, regardless of anyone's perspective.

Do you not own your social security number? Is using someone else's social allowed because it's just a number? No. It's more than just a number, as it's a number that had additional properties. In the SSN example, that additional peppery is identity, and in Bitcoin's case, that property is transfer of UTXOs. That property of being able to transfer a UTXO to someone else for something of value is what the government is faking ownership.

I agree with the last half of your post. Fight for change. But don't break the law in the meantime. Those who support the archaic system should realize that people are no longer supporting them. They'll either change or get kicked out.",2019-07-28 01:01:45

More than any other service, I love bringing your naughty (or nice) dreams to life and crafting the perfect piece of smut to tick all of your boxes and then some. I'm quick on my feet, have a ton of costumes/toys/props and love exploring new kinks in both the vanilla and Domme realms. Leave me to my own devices and I'll fill in all the blanks with my filthy mouth or send me a more detailed script that I can make my own if your tastes are more specific. My finished videos and mp3s are high quality (I love learning new skills) but with my own brand of amateur flair that I think you'll adore. 

✨**A review of my custom videos:**

*[""I had a very specific idea on what I wanted. I wrote some general instructions and a script for what I wanted to hear. She executed it perfectly! I was worried she would gloss over some of my requests, but she paid close attention to detail. She did an excellent job acting out my script and filling in her own content for the remaining time. I was very impressed with her.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/comments/99butd/rvw_of_uclarabelle_says/)*

✨**And my new audio smut:**

*[""I love watching her videos, but I was curious about her audio recordings. She absolutely killed it! The audio was crystal clear, she fulfilled every request I asked for perfectly, and even managed to throw in some stuff I didn't know I wanted, but made the recording so much better. I highly recommend you check her out.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/comments/b1t3xe/rvw_of_uclarabelle_says/)*

ev600d5,Metalgear_ray,1,"I see where you're coming from with the 14%, I wasn't sure if you had some kind of quantitative analysis to come up with that. I would agree that the chances of it succeeding are greater than that as well. My qualitative subjective opinion says we are somewhere in the 25 to 50 percent chance now and if we see another major client move to full production this year and/or start seeing the daily burn rate exceeded on a regular basis then it will move up significantly. Breaking into the US market will be huge but I've written that off for a while and accepted that they will be working the Asian/European markets for now which is fine, they are gigantic markets on their own. Consider as well that this is still a Chinese blockchain project...in a country where it's still difficult/illegal to purchase cryptos directly from an exchange. It's been that way for a while now - imagine the pent up demand from a population of over 1 billion? The project right now is essentially supported by retail only in Europe/North America and it's a niche of what is still a relatively overall niche topic (crypto). Early days are a meme at this point but it's ultimately true I believe. 

&gt;I think at most VeChain would advise Chinese government on building their own digital currency. Vechain equity owners would benefit from the revenue, coin holders not so much. But it would bring the relationship even closer and China could push companies towards using VeChain.

Probably the case, which isn't a bad thing. Connections are everything in China and this would do nothing but bolster the case for Vechain. The CCK tweet from a few years ago mentioning PBoC does pique my interest though - still all speculation and rumor for now however and not to be taken seriously, at least not yet. Also I believe the development of a digital currency/RMB will answer my question above of when China will allow its citizens to purchase crypto because they are terrified of capital flight while a system like this would give them direct control over it.


&gt;Did the guy share the excel of his model? Would need to see formulas to understand how the 3% burn correlates to price in the end. I found it amusing that the guy who did the analysis wrote in the thread that he bought X coins at Y price (it was like $600 spend). If I believed my analysis and it said it would grow that much I’d be putting in a little bit more than that.


I don't think so, not that I could see from that post. He had some other evaluations though that were interesting to look back and read. The $600 spend is not really damning in of itself though - if the guy is a veteran of the crypto markets for a while like he's mentioned, then I am guessing he recognized the Bitcoin/alt bubble and perhaps knew he could buy in cheaper later. Or he had other coins he believed in more. Impossible to say without seeing his portfolio or understanding his motivations. I bought into the top being a newbie at the time and have regretted it since, but live and learn.


&gt;I don’t know if I buy into the buy/sell wall explanation. I saw that post. Is there really not enough sustained demand of the coin to eat through the sell walls? Are the weak hands not out already to keep selling into the buy walls? We’ll see if the buyback sheds light on anything, because that should decrease what is floating around in these guys hands on Binance. If Coinbase adds vet, or bakkt ever launches then I think those places will dictate price for vet and Binance price will have to follow suit.

I'm not going to pretend I watch the order books on Binance because frankly I don't care - I think over the long term it won't matter. So it's only what I read on this forum that I take on this subject for better or worse. However, if this post is [true](http://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/chmtp6/daily_vechain_discussion_july_25_2019/euxc7pi/) where the sell side pressure is 300% more than the second most coin....that seems like a hell of a coincidence. I don't buy the conspiracy theories that it's the foundation selling or it's some malicious actor. When I realized how easy it is to shave margins on a low sat coin like this and easily pick up BTC through this kind of bot manipulation it made sense to me. Tack on the fact that it's an unregulated market/the wild west - none of these strategies in history are unprecedented at all in unregulated markets. People with a lot of capital that can move a market can and will do so because it's not illegal and it's easy to make money. I highly recommend reading the book I recommended above on this (Devil Takes the Hindmost). It was eye opening and almost reassuring in some ways - this stuff won't last forever. I can believe that there isn't enough buy pressure to overcome a $6 million sell wall - only retail is buying right now and we don't have the capital to overcome it. I think this is why the buy back was initiated as well because they saw that VET could not reach a fair market price. It has the added benefit of putting more VET/VTHO generation under their control as well to offer clients.

I also agree that this will go away when VET is added to more exchanges and fiat gateways are opened. Binance is a chokepoint for this and arbitrage bots will eat those walls away. I'm fascinated to see what fiat gateway OceanEx opens next month, my guess is the Euro.",2019-07-28 00:21:02

evahn4r,dave3218,1,"**I’m not trying to be confrontational nor is this a “Bitcoin Bad LoL” answer, I am just giving my honest experience with both BCH and BTC in my country**

I believe that mainly the issue is that (and this is my perception) outside certain countries, using BCH or any crypto as a mean of payment is kind of a hassle.

Let me explain: to set up a crypto account you *have to know at least a tiny bit of how to use a computer*, most people outside Reddit only know *maybe* how to use Facebook and social networks.

The younger generations have an easier time but then we get to the second hurdle: we still need fiat because our landlord won’t accept crypto as a means of payment. Take this statement as fixed for the sake of argument because most landlords are middle aged to old people that are not that very well versed in technology, convincing one is fine but that can’t be applied to every single one to make this point moot. Multiply it by every single place/person that is part of a transaction and we get into a very big hurdle that is having to exchange our cryptos back into fiat (again, not everyone has access to the convenience that is just selling your cryptos into an exchange and get paid, in my case we have to use local.bitcoins and setting up a verified account is too much of a chore and invasion of my privacy to be worth it, not because of the verification of the page but because the sellers in my country ask for a lot of documented prooft that feels like a double edge sword, they do it because cryptos while not ilegal are treated as being ilegal and you can go to jail because the Police can do whatever they want unless you pay them 5K to 10K USD).

The third point which is tied to the second is volatility, average joe won’t adopt on the promise of price stabilization nor to contribute to it, it will adopt **after the price has been stabilized** because while it is posible to make a lot of money in crypto by hodling (and praying), like in every speculative market there is much more money to be lost. Also hodling doesn’t help with adoption because people just start hoarding the coins.

All in all, there is still a lot of fear, ignorance and misconceptions surrounding crypto in general so that is why I believe average joe won’t adopt in the very short term.",2019-07-29 06:05:40

Let me encourage you to learn a few things:

* Learn about money.  Chances are you don't ***really*** understand money - most people do not.  There is no shame in admitting you don't understand something so common.  There is much shame if you can't admit that you don't really understand what it is, how it works, etc.
* Learn about the current global financial system, based upon fiat money.  There are some very serious problems, and the Big Shit is about to Hit The Fan.  Your TV won't tell you about it until it's too late for you to protect yourself and your loved ones.
* Learn about Bitcoin, what it actually IS, and the basics of how it works.

&gt; I am planning to move back home to California (I'm 3000 miles away) and one Bitcoin could pay my rent for a year

But then you wouldn't have one Bitcoin, because you'd have spent it.  And the price of Bitcoin could drop.  It's volatile.

Your question has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  You're just asking how to get money.  Here's how to do that:

Step 1.  Find a job, even if it's minimum wage.  We all have to start somewhere.  For entry level work, I'd highly recommend a job that comes with some sort of fringe benefits that help you to save money, like working at a restaurant where you get free meals.  When I was in college, I worked in the produce department of a grocery store.  There was always some good produce that couldn't be sold for one reason or another.  That helped me to eat well.

Step 2.  Learn how to budget so you always spend less than you make each month.  This point is so important.  Credit cards will lead you to ruin if you carry a balance because interest is a killer.  Little expenses like eating out or going out for coffee can pile up fast.  Do you really need cable TV?  I cut the cord and save around a hundred bucks a month.  I can't believe how much I used to waste on cable.  And what about your phone service?  I switched to Mint Mobile last year and love it.  Unlimited talk &amp; text plus 3 gigs of data for $15 a month.

&gt; Is mining plausible?

Sadly, no.  Not without expensive investment into some serious hardware, not to mention the increased utility bills you'd end up with.

&gt; Are there any trading/ contest/ etc sites to help me get my foot in the door?

Be very careful.  There are so many scams.  If it was that easy to get thousands of dollars in free money everyone would be doing it.",2019-07-29 10:56:10
evb7678,citystates,1,"I disagree without calling your opinion bullshit. The overall narrative is like this and without new input from other sources that think differently I can understand why people still parrot this opinion as their own.

What you list will help the price of bitcoin and certain other coins and token but being honest about it, how many of the 7 billion people on earth do you think have the necessary capital to make use of these 'killer apps' and of those, how many know enough or are interested to learn about it?

Often times, people will stir up divisive discussions that have already been debated ad nauseum, like the ""full node"" call to action here.

You can search this subreddit for past discussion on full nodes, you will find much information on the difference between Bitcoin Core's views and those of others explained in much detail.

It's absolutely fine to run a full node.

It's also fine to not run a full node. Simplified Payment Verification research has just hit a new milestone today - you will find a thread about it on the front page.
What it means is that it is possible to not have to run a node which stores the entire blockchain, in order to securely validate transactions you are interested in. Cryptography makes it possible.

r/BTC does not censor posts or ban users, even agitators like this, because we believe it's hypocritical and self-defeating to censor. If you feel a post violates the sub guidelines or the Reddit terms of service, feel free to report it. Otherwise, downvote bad content, upvote good content and use [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) to filter the noise from the signal.

##**Kik Sessions**

###^Live  
&gt;*Text only sessions*  
These sessions are perfect for roleplaying and exploring your fantasies. They do not include any pictures or videos(from me or you). I am open to pretty much anything in these sessions (hard limits can be ignored). We will discuss what the session will be focused around *after* payment is received, but it will not be counted as part of your time. 

&gt;*Sexting sessions*  
These sessions are purely for sexting. Both text and videos/photos. They are **video heavy** sessions!  It is expected that this will be a mutual exchange, I would like to also receive photos from you. Throughout these sessions I will send as many photos and videos as I can while we get off together. I'm very kink friendly (see [hard limits](https://old.reddit.com/r/lonelylittle/wiki/index#wiki_hard_limits) on wiki), but I am also open to vanilla.

Outfit Request +$5

###^(Toy Control) ^((NEW!)^)

I have a remote controllable vibrating wand that we can play with! During our session I will provide you with a link to take control of my toy and you'll have full control of my pleasure during the session. 

$10 per 15 minute block. (EG. a 30 minute session without face, with toy control will be $80 in total)   

(sessions can also be done on snapchat. message me on reddit for this)
#Cock rates

**Budget option: For $5 (indiebill, manyvids or cashapp) I'll tell you a rating (1-10) for your cock and say whether or not I'd fuck you. Written message, not a video.**

A short (2-4min) video in which I rate your cock on a scale of 1-10. I tell you what I think of it, what I'd do to it and where I would let you cum. 

*This is not sexting session. Please do not respond to my video with dirty talk. It is not a mutual play, simply a video for your personal enjoyment*

 Type | Non-nude | Nude

Honest | $20 | $30

I suffered from a form of survivors guilt, it became difficult to socialize with these friends, it was sad,  a really cool social circle dissolved .  

I just try and dissuade investment in any alt,   I don’t care if you want to invest in bitcoin,  I just think alt coins are a very bad investment and you should stay away, more important is to get what you can for them now, because I do not think alt season will ever happen",2019-07-31 23:17:32

Crypto currency prices are set mostly by speculation. Tomorrow the price might moon, or you know, Tether might get exposed and everything crashed 90%.

Bitcoin is not much of store of value yet. First we need global adoption and merchants accepting it is a very important first step.

Imagine every retailer accepting it, every worker, every employer. No matter if they covert to fiat right away. The important thing is that YOU have the option to keep it, exactly because at that point it will actually be usable. You would be able to do absolutely everything you can do with fiat BUT it's fast, reliable, frictionless, gives you 3% cash back, allows you to keep your privacy, and most importantly, you are not at the mercy of governments.

At that point Bitcoin starts working for people. At that point Bitcoin becomes valuable enough to make people actually keep it. Until then holding Bitcoin equals gambling.

Spend and replace, that's all Bitcoin needs.",2019-07-31 21:40:18

evk7i4s,chochazel,1,"&gt;Nonetheless, my point still stands in that any positive price action for cryptos as an alternative currency (no matter the legitimate real-world practicality of bitcoin) is a bad result for fiat.

Although you kind of undermined your point by citing an example where bitcoin falls relative to the pound as being good for bitcoin because you can buy more of them, because now it seems like you're trying to establish a narrative whereby any change, strengthening *or* weakening is good for bitcoin, which objectively cannot stand because you could make the exact arguments in reverse and say that both are bad for bitcoin...",2019-07-31 21:42:17

evk5fcs,dalebewan,1,"&gt;I think the crucial point we don’t agree on is that you have to make it friendly for everyone to be a miner which I don’t agree with.

Actually, I don't think this.  I think it's important for there to be a plethora of nodes, but mining only needs to be moderately decentralised and certainly can be ""big business"".

Do you understand why non-mining nodes are vital to the economic sovereignty that Bitcoin provides?

&gt;I see mining as business and that’s why I think it should be incentivized.

On that, we're in complete agreement.  Why therefore do you support a concept of miners receiving essentially nothing on top of their newly generated coin?  What should happen when the new supply of coins is less than 1 a day (not that far in the future), or when it's zero (about 120 years from now)?  What incentive do the miners have if they can't live from the transaction fees?

&gt;I just see bandwidth costing less and less every year so it is just logical for me.

Out of interest, how old are you?

My first connection was an acoustic coupler modem with 1200bps down and 75bps up.  That was in the late 1980s; I don't remember exactly, but let's call it 1987.  In 2007, I had a DSL connection of 50Mbit down and 15Mbit up.  That's about 42000 times faster in only 20 years, which massively outstrips a doubling every two years (doubling every two years would've been only 1024 times faster after twenty years).

Now, 12 years later, I have 1Gb down, 250Mb up.  That's 20 times faster.  Nothing to sneeze at sure, but after 12 years, I should be 64 times faster, not only 20.  Maybe I could upgrade already?  No, actually my provider doesn't offer anything faster here.  Average speeds are nowhere near doubling every two years.  Even if I can get a 10Gb home connection in six years from now (which I honestly doubt; that's a massive infrastructure project), I'll be 200 times the speed of that old DSL connection, but should be 512 times the speed.

What most people seem to forget about ""doubling"" is how quickly it gets out of control.  The reality of any technology is that in its infancy, it tends to grow incredibly fast but then slow down in improvements once it reaches maturity.  I have no doubt that - barring catastrophe - we'll all have Terabit internet connections at home one day, but I'm also positive that it'll be much longer than only another 20 years from now.",2019-07-31 21:22:58

evk6fzc,letownia,1,"""So today I sold my bitcoin I bought 2 years ago"". 
Why do you assume that when he says ""2 years"" he means *exactly* 365*2 days ago?

Bitcoin is currently at 9805 to the dollar. I'm January 2017 it was at 821 or so. Which would make it more or less 11 times less valuable...

So your point is completely moot, unless you assume he bought it exactly 730 days ago.",2019-07-31 21:32:48
