f21ueca,warrior2012,20,"Lets use the huge drop in price that happened in the last week or so. Bitcoin went from 10k down to 8k. During that time, a lot of people wanted to sell their BTC and convert to a stable coin (mostly tether). Because of this, the price of bitcoin was going down and the price of tether was going up. 

It has to do with supply and demand. There was a large amount of people that wanted to sell their BTC out of fear and there was not as many people looking to buy BTC as it was dropping. This made the price of tether go up the $1.06 for a brief period of time before dropping back down to the stable $1.00. 

They call it a stable coin because it is meant to sit at exactly $1 even. The problem is when the market rushes in either direction it can cause the price of tether to go up (When BTC and other coins are dropping) or it can cause the price of tether to go down (When BTC and other coins are booming).",2019-10-01 05:55:11

f22955j,burgoo,11,Vancouver getting beat by Toronto is unacceptable. My suggestion is zero down negative interest mortgages as long as you have bitcoin as 5% collateral.  Half the amount of bitcoin if you are a numbered company based in an offshore tax haven.,2019-10-01 08:01:48
f21tmvm,aaj094,10,"It is logically impossible for Bitcoin to remain at a static price for that long. Because it has fixed supply, eventually everyone who wants to sell at a certain price ends up selling. Then depending on presence of further buyers or absence, price either moves up or volume plummets. This low volume may induce more to sell which lowers the price. 

So movement is guaranteed. You just can't have a static price for too long. That's like saying a happy coincidence of equal and opposite buying / selling pressure continues for an extended period. Why would it when the supply is static?

Also, as price falls, a serious brake on selling arrives when price goes below average cost price of the holders. It's not that it can't go lower but the fall becomes a grind rather than whimsical and rapid decrease. Cause psychologically there is a massive inertia for people to sell and realise a loss as compared to taking profits. Also, bitcoin is not an alt where people can consider switching to something less volatile where they can still hope to recoup losses.",2019-10-01 05:50:38

Do not store your bitcoin on exchanges or webwallets

Best to avoid alts and ICOs at least initially altogether until you are familiar technically with bitcoin.  99 % of alts/ICOs are scams and it is best to understand the basics before investing.

Do not daytrade

Do not Buy any bitcoins unless you have a fiat emergency fund and payed off all your high interest debts. 3-12 months minimum of fiat savings of living expenses is recommended but at minimum make a budget and start investing simultaneously with both 

Do not invest in cloudmining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI) . In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well 

Do not mine until you have done at least 100 hours of research

Do not invest your bitcoins in any investment schemes

If you have any questions ask them in /r/BitcoinBeginners/

Religion is used to create a 'faith-based culture' in order to prevent people from using reason and logic. I.e. ""Why aren't we raising the blocksize? Why are you changing the protocol?"" Or for Monero ""Why does Monero claim to be untraceable but their privacy doesn't work? Why does Monero claim to be a fulfillment of Satoshi's vision but they have infinite inflation and no transparency in their chain?'

The more *emotionally involved* you become in this projects, **the harder it will become for you to admit that _*you have been fooled*_**. This is a normal human reaction, so to weaponize this, these communities attempt to use religion to open you up to being lied to as much as possible, in order to get you to believe and support them and give you *emotional baggage* sufficient to force you to support them and shut up about their destruction of digital currencies. Just like the denizens of r/bitcoin, and the mindless upvoters of bad ideas (lowering the blocksize), they can never admit they were wrong and thus they have emotional skin in the game and **must continue on their original path**.

&gt; because, unlike other assets, you can buy just a few dollars worth at a time. 

2.  You never disagreed that it was a better hedge *due to its lack of space*, so we never argued that opinion.  If you *want* to argue that opinion, then fine, but let's get back to the *original* disagreement:

&gt; lol this is such a terrible argument and why many people want to short BTC. There are other things scarce in this world.

&gt; &gt; Not digital things. Anything digital (besides bitcoin and blockchains) can be continuously replicated.  That's why bitcoin is special; it's digital AND scarce.

If you're trying to argue against ancillary discussions, then be clear that you are shifting gears.

3.  I've literally said this since our first interaction (see quote, directly above).

4.  You're right, but they *were also* infinitely replicable, just controlled by a single entity.  They could conjure up more supply whenever they wanted and you just had to take their word for it (or perform independent audits and take *their* word for it).  That's why those projects never took off; they couldn't guarantee scarcity in a digital space.  I don't know about DigiCash or e-gold but liberty reserve was just a company that sold securities on their holdings, similar to an ETF.  AGAIN, they couldn't guarantee scarcity.

He's a great dude who is good at what he does, and enjoys his work. But he did treat himself and bough an airplane. Nothing fancy. One of those Piper knockoffs that costs as much as a sports car and has an engine that will die first time you get into it (probably). But still. A plane! He has always been a huge fan of Microsoft Flight series. So he bought the plane, and only then got his pilot's license. Few solo flights in, and he crashed the plane. 

He said the scariest part about having the engine die and being forced to crash into a lake, was that he wasn't sure if he would remember how to swim. It's been decades since he last swam. He remembered just enough to tell the story. 

Moral of the fable is that anyone pursuing FIRE needs to know how to swim! All that free time will put you in all kinds of wacky situations, and there are bodies of water literally everywhere!

f2dhhto,thereallorddane,23,"If you have A/C, close the doors. A/C needs a closed system to work correctly.

If you have a swamp cooler, you need the windows open because it sucks in air from outside, cools it, then sends it into the house to push hot air out.

A swamp cooler would probably work pretty well in AZ considering how arid it is.

&amp;#x200B;

A/C works by drawing in the house's air, cooling, sending it to each room and the cool air pushes the warm air to the center of the house to be sucked up by the return vent. The air is cooled and sent to the rooms and the cool air that's already there is now moved through the house. This process repeats until the house is cooled to the right temperature. If you introduce exterior air, then it means the A/C has to work longer to achieve this result.

The swamp cooler works the same way a damp cloth does on your neck. The swamp cooler draws in dry, hot air from outside. This air passes over a pan of water being fed by a spray jet (some just use the pan). This moisturizes the air and the water vapor absorbs the heat from the surrounding area. This cool, moist air is pumped into the center of the house. This creates pressure in the house. This air will escape wherever it can. So when you open the front door, the cool air will move from the center of the house to the front door. Anything that air moves through will be cooled. If all doors/windows are closed except YOURS, then your room will be nice and cool and everyone else will be balls-ass-hot.

&amp;#x200B;

Price differences: A/C (HVAC systems) are more expensive to install and operate, but are incredibly efficient and can cool a home reasonably fast. They are the largest power consumers in a house. Even a bitcoin mining rig can't eat more power than your A/C. Because a fridge is a small A/C system (home A/C spawned from this concept) it, too draws a LOT of electricity. Swamp coolers are a little slower, however they use very little power. They take a while longer to work and run the risk of the water damaging your house should the system overflow. They also require an independent furnace to he the house in the winter. That said, they are VERY energy efficient because it is essentially a fan, water, and ducts. You simply control where the air flows by opening/shutting the doors/windows.

&amp;#x200B;

Drawbacks: A/C is very expensive to repair, requires regular maintenance, and a leak in the coolant system can make you sick or kill you (if its bad enough). Work on them usually requires special education/training and those guys charge good money to do just that (for real, be an HVAC technician and you'll earn decent money the rest of your days...just be prepared to deal with hot ass attics). The swamp cooler is super simple to fix, but if you live in a humid area, it won't work very well due to not being able to achieve a high enough humidity value to absorb the heat from the air. Swamp coolers are ideal for dry/arid places. Also, they need regular checking for water contamination (such as mold) and you have to always have at least ONE window open which can be a concern if you're in an area where crime is an issue.

Honestly, I'd have a swamp cooler in my house if I didn't live in super humid area.",2019-10-04 10:59:02

f2dacsa,TheCheesy,10,"Personally speaking, I started with calculating Grand Exchange trade data for items in Runescape. I got really good at making money in-game, my friend insisted I try with Bitcoin and gave me 300 to work with no risk.

I know he said no risk, but I'm a very cautious person.

Using sheets to log fake buy price/sell prices and quantities, I decided to pretend to make trades to see my profit turnover. I ended up making a calculator for getting the current Buy/Sell gap % for a site I was using primarily. Once I was confident, I started trading for real.

I tried a few sites, but one site was fairly popular and had a large gap in the buy/sell prices, around 1-2% at times. Trades happened around 10-30 times a minute when it was stable. It lagged behind the super large websites, so I kept that page open as a reference.

I'd place buy orders and sell orders constantly all day making 2-3% per trade on 5-10+ trades a minute.  I relied on Spreadsheets and JScalc to calculate my profit every time I made a trade.

I noticed that sometimes my trade wouldn't show up on the ticker during laggy times on the website. I inspected the page and found the Ticker's JSON file. It updated instantly on refresh, way faster than the actual website, I was able to place buy/sell orders right in front of anyone else immediately while the site lagged up for several minutes at a time. During those freezes, it'd look like the trades wasn't moving when they actually were. I was able to get 5-8% on many of my trades when that happened.

I didn't get rich or anything, but I managed to 300 into 6000 in about a month. I still can't believe I pulled it off. This was during the major bitcoin climb right before the crash. Once the crash started I was unable to keep making a profit and cashed out before losing anything. I tried again several times, but the sites I used were not nearly as active as they were back then.",2019-10-04 09:36:02

f2ide2y,PogsAreBackBro,4,"Let's be clear on a couple of things:

1) Libra, if implemented the way it has been described, would be a huge boon to the crypto industry. It would provide easier on and off ramps for crypto to fiat, and would make it more accessible for potential new users.

2) Libra would be a complement to BTC and crypto in general. It would not be a threat to displace BTC because it would never replace BTC's decentralization and immutability. Instead, Libra would be more similar to Tether, which despite its numerous faults has been useful for trading, risk Management, moving funds, etc.

3) Libra will never succeed due to regulatory burdens. The entire reason Libra does not exist yet is regulation. A company cannot issue its own currency, nor can transactions move freely between people.or entities without being subject to growing regulatory requirements such as FATCA. Libra's utility rapidly diminishes once it becomes subject to the same due diligence as classic banking and money transfer businesses.

So please keep in mind that this isn't about Libra vs. BTC or Libra vs. crypto. This is government vs. industry and the government always wins. Crypto lives on since it has no central point of control. If a payment network like Bitcoin were conceived by a specific organization, it would have been shuttered and imprisoned long ago for not adhering to US monetary policy.

 Take a look at eGold and Liberty Reserve. These payment network operators created their own currencies and payment networks, and we're ultimately held responsible for the activities which took place on those networks. Bitcoin is no different in the sense that it has certainly been used for criminal activity of every type.

* **Verisart, the first company to utilize blockchain technology to verify fine art and collectibles, raised $2.5 million to expand its operations.** The technology can be used to verify and track the provenance of an art piece, and helped result in Verisart's partnership with eBay.

f2gy44c,nicksabanscokebottle,3,"Not a good idea. Leaves a trail so if one of the people you sell to get popped for possession the police will offer the same deal they offer to everyone else “give up your dealer and anyone else you know who sells and we’ll get the judge to throw this out or get you a softer sentence/fine.” 

Then when your “friend” rats you out, and they will, the narcotics team assigned to your case will have a clear trail of who you sold to, when you sold to them, etc. Not to mention the other shit on your phone.

If you’re going to sell, do it smartly:

1) dont use your personal phone to conduct business, get a cheap burner with cash at target, bestbuy, Walmart, etc.

2) you don’t have friends when you become a dealer. Only customers. You give your friends the same treatment you give to strangers, first you get to know them a little bit to be sure they aren’t narcs, then you sell them a little at first in a location not near your home or a school, with a 5-10% upcharge for the first sale. After that, once you get more acquainted with them, you can lower the guards a little and sell within your home to them or bring it to them if you wish, but only deal in cash.

3) make sure when you’re going on runs your tag is valid, headlights, brake lights are working, nothing funny going on with your car, and stop at every stop sign for 5 seconds, never speed, immediately turn off the road you’re on if theirs a cop on it, never drive impaired etc.

4) only buy what you are immediately going to flip within the next day or two. This way if you get raided, you only have a small amount. If you have your personal stash as well as the stash you’re selling from, that’s increased time. 

5) never, ever, under any circumstances keep any sort of scale, plastic bag, or paraphernalia, out in the open in your home. These are automatic distribution charges. Keep them in a hidden safe (under a floorboard, hidden crawlspace), locked, and only take them out when you conduct business then promptly put them up. 

6) never sell to strangers. Only sell to friends and friends of friends

7) if you see anyone strange outside your home, any unmarked cars, people knocking on your door etc, you take all the drugs you have and immediately flush them. Any glass pipes, bongs, etc smash them into unrecognizably small pieces and put them in a garbage can under 7-8 other bags of trash. 

8) never answer your front door except for the mailman or for someone you know.

9) it’s smart to invest in a small handgun, obtained legally, as well as a concealed carry permit. It would be stupid not to. When you deal, you run the risk of getting robbed, comes with the territory, especially as you start growing your customer base.

10) cash from business goes into your wallet, then you immediately buy a prepaid debit card which you use to purchase bitcoin online through a bitcoin marketplace such as kraken, then you can put it into your bank account from there.",2019-10-05 09:56:19

f2gt01x,iwantfreebitcoin,2,"The following is an oversimplification, but here is a BTC-supporter's take: traditionally, the concepts of ""money""/""currency"" and ""payment systems"" have been completely separate. They don't conflict with each other; there is some money (say, the US dollar, or better yet for our purposes, gold), and it can be transferred via a payment system (ACH, PayPal, a certificate redeemable for X ounces of gold, etc.). 

Unfortunately, in the digital asset world, there is a very specific technical tradeoff between the functions of money and payment system. An important aspect of money is that it is verifiable: historically, you may trust that a particular coin with a particular stamp is certified to contain a certain amount of gold. You would also want to \*verify\* that the coin is in fact gold, not gold-coated tungsten or some other metal of lesser value. 

In the case of Bitcoin, every on-chain transaction issued must be verified by all full nodes. In order to ensure you've been paid with real bitcoin, you need to start from the genesis block and verify that every transaction throughout the history of the network has been valid (this is an oversimplification, but I'm happy to elaborate). This means there is a direct conflict between the use cases of being hard money vs being a payment network. More on-chain transactions means fewer people are actually able to verify that fraud hasn't occurred, that all the rules have been followed, that monetary policy is what you like.

Essentially, the disagreement between BCH and BTC is what trade-off to make. Do you want regular folk to be able to run full nodes and verify that they are receiving genuine payments, or do you want to be able to cheaply transact yourself? At least on the base layer, you are forced to make this choice. I can only speak for myself, but my interpretation of the BTC philosophy is that we want as many people as possible to be able to be sovereign and be able to verify that their assets aren't fraudulent. This implies a challenge from the spender's standpoint, as you've observed, but we hope that new payment networks can be built on top of the base blockchain that have different security tradeoffs, and can be used for the prototypical ""coffee purchase"". This may or may not succeed.

(There's also all sorts of security aspects to all of this, but in the interests of time I will only go into that if you ask about specifics. Ultimately, I think there is a philosophical divide, even though many of us on both sides have similar political \[or anti-political?\] ideals, and we disagree on how to achieve them.)",2019-10-05 09:25:06

News articles and tentative corporate adoption experiments are nearly irrelevant.  ETH is not going below $1 in a flash crash.  It's not going below $100, and probably won't even approach that level.  ETHBTC is following the expected pattern so well that it's almost like it was preordained.  The ratio will likely dip a bit over the next couple weeks.  It will continue testing resistance, and will break up sooner or later.  It could be next week; it could be December, but it will happen.  When it does, .08-.09 should be where it's steepest, meaning it will probably go considerably higher than that before peaking.  Don't believe me?  Fine.  I'm just trying to be helpful.  If you listen, you'll be very glad you did.  

On the fiat valuation front, I think it's the equivalent of Dec 4, 2018 in Bitcoin-land, though it could also be mid to late January 2019.  Either way, short-term declines are likely.  I cought an ETH buy at $153, but I'm still holding out for $140-$150.  While I'll admit to thinking we might not make it to those levels, I've learned to stick to my guns.  Even if all my buys go through, we're only talking 6% added to my stack; I'll be fine either way.  Looking back, you'll kick yourself for being pessimistic right now.

E2: If we're still at this same price in ~12-16 hours I'll probably be re shorting or at least re hedging. Ideally I would like to see a slow crawl up to/past $8050 at least. If we can't manage that then the setup I'm looking at is likely invalidated

f2uobsn,arctic_bull,11,"&gt;How? I'm a little ignorant on this topic but I see that issue used a lot. Wouldn't bitcoin by nature promote and incentivize finding energy efficiency? Energy usage doesn't exactly convert to emissions. Especially for renewables that are geolocked and time sensitive wouldn't it be valuable to use a protocol for consensus to convert energy that would go unused?

Not really, the more expensive a bitcoin is, the more people try and mine it, the harder mining it gets. There's a big feedback loop built in to ensure no matter how much more efficient technology, languages, whatever, get, bitcoin gets less efficient to compensate.

Hold onto your pants, but a single bitcoin transaction uses over 600kWh of electricity (plus 288kgCO2 and 85g of ewaste). That's enough to power an average American home for 20 days. Visa, in the same amount of power, processes 600,000 transactions. Visa is literally six hundred thousand times more efficient.

Does it incentivize finding renewable energy? No, it incentivizes finding cheap energy. For now, at least, cheap energy isn't renewable.

Remember once block rewards go away, the cost to process these transactions should be passed on to those making the transactions directly instead of indirectly through exchange. At $0.06/kWh (not factoring in R&amp;D of miners, etc), I wager we'll see transaction fees of $36++.",2019-10-07 13:28:23

I was surprised to read this statement:

I have been wondering for years now why the onus was never given to manufacturers in reclaiming the wastes that they disseminate. I'm under no impression that this necessarily has to be the perfect system from its first iteration, but it's a great common-sense place to start.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The ‘Deposy’ project wants to address this issue and obtain pure plastic waste through a specially developed deposit system. In addition, the project should make it possible to give the population an incentive to collect and sort.

Such an elegant idea. Bitcoin famously popularizes so many libertarian idea(l)s.  This solution does two things which I love: 1) quantifies externalities, which I feel is the central contention around all discussions of laissez faire capitalism and public good. 2) Creates an incentive model (aka a *market*) for those externalities. Brilliant.

I'm an individual who believes that each of us should be doing our part, but am quite skeptical about the marginal tweaks any of us can make on the edges alone.

f2wiryb,vanvicker43,1,"  Become an Investor of Telegram:   Exclusive GRAM token offering through ExMarkets LaunchPad

 There is no question that you must have heard about Telegram Open Network (TON) ICO back in the day. The ICO was held privately where only accredited investors could participate in the sale through an invite-only method.

**Telegram’s ICO sold $1.7 billion worth of GRAM tokens during the sale.** It’s still one of the largest grossing Initial Coin Offerings that has been organized so far. It has been more than one year and a half since Telegram ICO came to pass and the launch of the Open Network is imminent.

It is publicly discussed that the most likely launch date is October 31st. With the upcoming launch, Telegram’s tokens are becoming a more and more popular topic. Many experts forecast the price of GRAMS going through the roof.

To jump in front of the anticipation, ExMarkets is offering a pristine opportunity for its customers - a chance to acquire GRAM tokens before they are listed on an exchange. It’s truly once in a while opportunity and if you’re interested in the crypto market - you should not miss it!

The sweetest part is that on ExMarkets, the **price of GRAM tokens is significantly lower** than on other platforms which are or have been selling grams on the secondary market.

**ExMarkets: $3.20 USD/GRM | Liquid exchange: $4.00 USD/GRM | Ataix: $5.00 USD/GRM**

Visit [the Telegram sale page right now](https://exmarkets.com/launchpad/gram-btc) to take advantage of this opportunity!

**How does it work?**

An investment fund called [Fintech Global Consultants](http://f-g-c.com/) of FGC for short was one of the few lucky enterprises that had the chance to participate in the Telegram ICO. While the launch of Telegram Open Network approaches, FGC decided to offer retail investors a chance to rake a piece of the pie and liquidate a part of FGC’s position of GRAMS. It’s a clear win-win.

To implement their plan, Fintech Global Consultants chose ExMarkets cryptocurrency exchange and IEO Launchpad. We are excited to be the official reseller of TON GRAM tokens and will be extending our exchange’s infrastructure to cater to FGC’s needs.

The sale will commence on September 28th and will run for one week initially or until the reserve of GRAMS sells out. Available allocation of GRAMS to be purchased on exmarkets equals 2,000,000 tokens. Each GRAM is going to be sold at 3.20 USD.

There have only been a few other exchanges that have offered GRAM tokens to retailers and history is indicating that these melt really quick. Don’t miss your chance to be a part of the largest encrypted network’s journey. Visit [ExMarkets LaunchPad](https://exmarkets.com/launchpad) immediately to open up your account.

**GRAM sale fundamentals**

Ticker: GRM;

Starting price: $3.20 USD;

Token allocation for ExMarkets: 2,000,000 GRM;

Accepted currencies: BTC, ETH;

Sale period: September 28 - October 4th.

Expected launch of TON: October 31st

Buy GRM tokens Now

Sale mechanics

ExMarkets has formed a partnership with FGC and has successfully verified that they actually have GRAM tokens reserved for them. During the GRAM sale on ExMarkets, interested buyers will be able to deposit Bitcoin or Ethereum and reserve a corresponding amount of GRAM tokens.

When GRAM tokens are distributed, FGC will send the number of GRAMs to ExMarkets and then tokens will be distributed to retail investors who participated in the sale.

This process is employed in order to ensure transparency, security, and integrity of the reputation of everyone involved: ExMArkets, retail investors participating in the sale and Fintech Global Consultants.

Don’t miss this golden opportunity to become one of Telegram’s investors! The sale is going to be short and the window of opportunity is so small!

f30863v,ADogNamedCynicism,1,"&gt;What the fuck are you buying when you buy a bitcoin?

The very simplest way to think of it is this: 

Money is kind of like store credit that is also accepted by governments for tax purposes. If you want to buy food from a restaurant, you don't have to strike up a deal with that restaurant. You can use your store credit (money) that you've earned helping other people. But, generally, it only works in the area controlled by a certain government.

Bitcoin is a kind of store credit that only exists online, within the rules written by programmers instead of a government. When you buy a bitcoin, you're buying a digital version of store credit.

Generally, there are three types of bitcoin purchasers. 

First, there are long term traders. They think that bitcoin will be accepted widely due to its digital, borderless nature, which will make the value go up. Bitcoin is not accepted in many places now, so it is less valuable than it would be if it is universally accepted. They want to buy bitcoin when it is less valuable, and then sell it/purchase with it when it is more valuable to make money.

Second, there are people who want to use bitcoin to transfer value. Imagine you buy a gift-card online and send the code you get to your relative who lives in another part of the world. They take that gift card and exchange it for local cash. Bitcoin kind of does the same thing. You can buy a bitcoin, send it to someone, and they can cash out in the currency of their choice at an exchange (which is like a bank).

The third group of people are short-term traders. They see the fluctuations of price and want to make money by purchasing bitcoins and reselling them to other people when the price goes up. Think of house flippers, but without the ability to improve the house, and all houses are exactly identical.",2019-10-09 00:30:03

f34ouuq,Academic_Crypto,14,"I haven't posted anything substantial here in a while but I feel like today is a good opportunity to throw in my 2 cents.

&amp;#x200B;

For my bias and history in the last year, I was a strong bull on BTC and ETH from $3.5k and $90 respectively back in Nov 2018. I felt that the market had capitulated and this would turn out to be true. I held spot through the parabola all the way until about 11k (the first time) where I eliminated my exposure. I also made the switch to trading exclusively Bitcoin at around $8,000 on the way up. At 11k I once again felt that the market had overshot by a significant amount and sold out, completely missing the peak at 13.8k as well as the 2nd rally to 13k. For the next few months I essentially always shorted 11k (and was underwater for a while @12.3k) and closed under 10k, but I never longed the bottoms. I let Kraken auto-close my remaining short a week ago (they auto-close after 30 days) for an average cost of $8,320 and currently have no exposure. 

&amp;#x200B;

The alt coin pump a few weeks ago was a strong signal to me that the market was about to finally dump below the support of $9,300. The play is actually very intuitive, alts pump and all of the retail investors that have been sort of interested in crypto start getting notifications popping up on their phones. I work in an academic lab and so half of all the people there have either delta or coinbase or something installed and the notifications start rolling in, ETH up 12%...then XRP up 15% ....XLM up 70%....BAT up 20%, etc. Some fraction of retail sends money to the exchange accounts that they KYC'd back in 2017. That bank transfer takes a few days to clear. The alt coin pump came on a Wednesday so some bank transfers would clear that Friday, others wouldn't clear till Monday. Then the market dumps on Tuesday once this extra liquidity has been added.

&amp;#x200B;

The question that I am asking myself is, ""Is the price low enough yet?"" To anyone who bought this summer or spent a lot of time watching charts and has really internalized 10k+ as ""normal"" then anything sub 9k is very cheap. I suspect many users of this subreddit fall into this category since most retail traders tend to trade on low time frames. On longer time frames there are a lot of people who could sell at 6.5k and still have doubled their money or more in the last year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't see much in the way of fundamentals to support the claim that 8.6k or 10k or whatever is fair today unless of course it was just the case that Bitcoin has been highly undervalued for most of 2018 and early 2019. I would like to point out that a lot of users mistakenly use network hash-power as an indicator of network health and fundamentals without considering the impact of improved mining hardware. The price of Bitcoin drives the market for miners, not the other way around. Some signals like $LEOUSD dropping below $1 in the last day indicate that the market is basically not confident that Bitfinex will be able to fully repay their tokenized loan (or that it will take so long that the opportunity cost does not justify holding LEO). Coinbase is increasing fees and exchanges like Binance and others doubling down on margin trading and instruments like perpetual swaps to basically re-create the winning formula that Bitmex has. These indicators suggest to me that the value of Bitcoin is shifting from a censorship resistant store of value and long term investment vehicle to a decentralized casino which is net negative sum (overhead taken by exchanges). Its not really anyone's fault, its just what there is demand for and the exchanges are simply filling that demand. 

&amp;#x200B;

The big elephant in the room is of course the narrative surrounding the inflation halving of Bitcoin. This is the idea reducing the inflation rate, all else held equal implies existing tokens will skyrocket in value, and from the posts I have read in the last few weeks, this is a significant justification for why people should be buying right now. I have ran through this scenario time and time again and I don't see this event exerting a significant fundamental bullish pressure on Bitcoin. I would gladly have a conversion and share my specific thoughts about it in another thread but if anything my conclusion is that fundamentally the event should be bearish, and besides, since it is a scheduled adjustment, an efficient marked would have it already priced in. This however does not mean that the price wont rise as a result of it, just that the rise won't be based on fundamentals. LTC is actually a really good example of this, it went on a huge rally in anticipation of its inflation reduction event and then gave up pretty much all of those gains suggesting that the narrative was temporarily far more powerful than the fundamentals. XMR by contrast has exhibited the same reduction in supply rate to LTC over the past year or so, but it did so gradually and as a result there was no powerful narrative to trade and so its price action looks completely different. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I wonder is, how many times can this scenario play out before it does not work anymore? Is it really free money to just buy any asset 6-12 months before its inflation rate is discretely decreased and then sell about 1 month before? This formula has worked with other asset main-net launches in the past such as EOS and BAT and I imagine a lot of people are already looking at this same play for the ETH PoS changes that are scheduled. I am going to bet that at some point it just won't work, eventually enough money is going to try and front-run each other to the door that the classic bubble preceding these events won't be exhibited or will occur several months earlier than normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize my thoughts, I have spent a significant amount of time being both bearish and bullish in the last year. At the moment, I still feel bearish (but without financial exposure) largely due to the tremendous amount of money that could still sell in profit right now as well as the culture of margin trading that has been embraced in the last few months by large exchanges. I also fail to share the bullish feelings about the halving event that many users here feel, I don't believe there is any significant fundamental impact resulting from it and instead its impact is to create a narrative that should get front-run harder and harder the more times it takes place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a few things before I make a big play on crypocurrency right now. (1) I am looking for large single-day losses or gains (8-15%) that I think will bounce or retrace to make short term plays on. (2) I am looking for a large capitulation event that plays out over many weeks which makes me think the market have over-shot and yields an easy long entry. (3) I am looking for any sort of fundamentals to suggest Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow beyond speculation. This one I think we are actually starting to see with to a lot of money flowing from China into BTC via Tether, and the introduction of a Tether asset pegged to the Yuan to help with this. Wealthy families in China have been circumventing local laws by buying property in Vancouver, London and California for decades and pay huge taxes on maintenance fees on these properties, Bitcoin seems like a reasonable alternative. (4) I am looking for evidence that the same old pump and dump before the halving event will play out that I will trade without any intention of holding long term.",2019-10-10 06:43:52

Additionally, Columbus referred to the Antilles he had landed in as India, and called the natives Indians.

His arguement about the black death has no relevance to the discussion either, I have no idea why he included it.

If columbus set in place conditions leading to the deaths or subjugation of natives, then yes, the result of that 42 years later is partially his fault. And yes, even if he didn't care what specific group he subjugated, that is still genocide.

The point of Columbus's percieved importance is useless for the thesis of whether Columbus is evil or not.

Oh yeah, and here's an excerpt of one of Columbus's crewmembers talking about how he raped a native girl that Columbus gave to him:

f398fg5,-0-O-,4,"&gt; Other exchanges followed Binance's Bitcoin price.

Bro. This is stupid as shit. Binance BTC doesn't do anywhere close to the volume of other exchanges. Aside from this, when deposits and withdraws are frozen, assets typically diverge from the usual price, as they are locked in a vacuum on the exchange. 

Nobody is dumping hundreds of millions into BTC because of the movement on a deposit/withdrawal locked exchange. And even if someone *were doing that*, smarter people would be happy to sell to them.

Now, if Binance was using their money to buy on all exchanges, they could probably move the price a few hundred bucks- but that would be retarded risky because if they failed to recover the funds that it would require to do this, they'd be completely fucked and unable to continue to operate.",2019-10-11 07:02:14

f393vw1,snowk18,3,"Someone asked for an explanation of why this is bullish:

\- The trend over the past 2 years between Treasury (responsible for money), the SEC (securities like stocks and bonds) and the CFTC (commodities) was that Ether, and to a lesser extent Bitcoin, are commodities. Much of this narrative could be attributed to the last CFTC chairman, Chris Giancarlo - and his exit threatened to derail this. Having Heath Tarbert, the incoming chairman, reiterate this position (even if it is just his belief) is EXCELLENT news.

\- Why a commodity? Regardless of whether you personally think of ETH as money, we do NOT want it to be classified as such by the government. Money is the MOST tightly regulated asset and Treasury will never let crypto displace the U.S. Dollar. Securities like stocks and bonds are the next most regulated asset, and the SEC has historically shown that they are no friends of ours. They are the ones already responsible for approving derivative securities like ETFs and mutual funds based on crypto - so the last thing we want is for them to be in charge of crypto as an asset itself.

\- This leaves us as a commodity under the CFTC like oil, metals, farm goods etc - where ETH would enjoy a far looser regulatory environment that is a much better fit than if it were considered money or a security. It also simply makes sense rationally - like oil or metals, ETH has discovered value that can be traded but it is also a consumable (gas) with intrinsic value.",2019-10-11 06:36:03

4. internal rumors about BSV proponents being in talk with central banks
5. gold token on BSV,  Amleh is tokenizing Gold down to the milligram per token (approx 4 cents at today's price).  It allows to buy, sell and invest in physical gold in a vault. watch [https://youtu.be/HfHgMDhISGw?t=20749](https://youtu.be/HfHgMDhISGw?t=20749)

**the roadmap is :**

1. fiat tokens on BSV -&gt; people that don't want volatility but don't mind small inflation per year start using fiat tokens on BSV (aka the public), some wallets will allow you to use any BSV app but always keep your BSV in fiat stabletokens.
2. small governments issue fiat on BSV (cheaper) probably starting by the Antigua government (there are already some plans on this)
3. medium govs issue their fiat on BSV
4. big govs &amp; central banks issue fiat on BSV
5. as we get more adoption &amp; use of BSV, the price stabilizes. Once we reach more adoption than the dollar, BSV becomes the most stable unit of account, then everyone ditches their fiat for BSV, even those that want stability",2019-10-11 08:34:23

BCH and BSV had very comparable values when I sold my BSV coins. BSV came into existence with (claims of being the 'real' Bitcoin), and  an explicit threat that anybody holding BCH would go bankrupt.

I guess one was to handle it is to have each taxpayer or accountant determine which one is the ""parent"" themselves. This may provide incentives to call the fork less valuable fork the parent: to avoid liability from unrealized gains in the more valuable sibling.",2019-10-11 08:03:14

f3bbl3s,jessquit,1,"&gt; ASSUMING A PERFECT MARKET, In the free market, a cartel's attempt to increase profit by reducing output is doomed to fail; it improves profit for those outside the cartel and those inside the cartel who want to cheat.

FTFY.  This sub is chock full of people who believe all markets are perfect and all market participants are rational actors with perfect information.

These are ECON101 assumptions that help students learn the basics of economics but they DO NOT HOLD in the real world for all kinds of markets.

It is vitally important that people understand that.   Some markets tend towards monopoly.   Some markets are practically impossible for consumers to collect information about.  Externalities and other market failures are *real things.*

These are the things that aren't really discussed in ECON101 but which define the economics of all kinds of real-world situations.

**NOW BEFORE YOU CALL JESSQUIT A STATIST BOOTLICKER** please take note of the fact that I am not prescribing anything whatsoever.  I am not suggesting that states should build cars or that we should raise taxes on Roger.  I am merely trying to educate this sub that not all markets operate under ECON101 conditions, and that some markets can enter ""failure states.""

f3bgxg4,Atlas_84,1,"I also believe gold to be an attractive investment for the purposes of diversification, but I don’t expect to see its purchasing power increase. I view it as a hedge against inflation. A good rule of thumb throughout history is that an ounce of gold has always been able to buy you a nice suit, whereas an ounce of silver will buy out a nice meal. The prices may change, but the purchasing power doesn’t.

Additionally, when the price of gold increases, formerly dormant mines may suddenly become profitable again, resulting in the mining of new gold, adding supply and placing downward pressure on price, eventually resulting in an equilibrium.

Bitcoin doesn’t have that.

When the price of bitcoin increases, “mining” becomes more profitable, but the software is so designed that the rate of issuance is unable to be increased as a result (difficulty gets harder). There is no resultant equilibrium effect, which is (IMO) the reason why we see 10x spikes (and crashes) every 4 years or so.",2019-10-12 01:06:47

\* My account is on forced vacation/holiday/banned\*

\* I am trying to pay for referrals\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*The reason?\* 

&amp;#x200B;

LBC check for known malware receiving bitcoin addresses (address changer/key) and it could be your machine is compromised with malware. You may have tried to send/receive coins from or to a known bad actor/blacklisted address (Referrals especially) It is also possible the AutoBanBot has decided you are high risk.

f3bf3wd,whenthefogclears2,1,"Well firstly Bitcoin isn’t really a currency it falls short in a lot of respects.

Bitcoins price increases have less to do with who’s buying in than how many tether tokens are and have been printed, a lot of the 2018 bull run was pure tether printing.

Also speculators and market manipulation have effect on the price that’s why it’s swings can be huge.

The demand is simply not high for its supply if it was anywhere near outstripping its supply it would be worth thousands more “it is not” and neither have any of BTCs price increases been sustainable, if you cannot sustain the buying and keep demand high it always loses its gains.

The above is why savvy traders play suckers in this market and make a killing.

Then you see an entire generation that can't afford a house.  When you subsidize farming in USA you make the products unfairly cheap and it puts mexican farmers out of business.  So they come over the border by the 10s millions.  These people work for less and that shakes up the market for americans.

f3guwq7,aaj094,2,"I did a calculation of the Thermocap for Monero which essentially means valuing each coin that currently exists by the price that existed when it was mined. The idea is that this kind of valuation is supposed to be a very hard floor for any coin. In its very first major correction in 2011, the floor reached by Bitcoin in November of the year was one that coincided with the Bitcoin thermocap at the time.

As of date Monero's thermocap as per my calculation is \~ $388 million which if translated into a price for a coin today turns out to be $22.50.

Interestingly, since Monero's new emission has been contracting rapidly, I checked the thermocap number that existed on the day of our ATH ie 20/12/2017. The price per coin dicated by the thermocap that day was $8.35.

I do think there is a case to be made that part of our price woes is the accelerated distribution schedule which has put a lot of coins into hands of folks who acquired them at low prices. Hence it is taking this long sluggish / declining period to get these folks to capitulate their cheaply acquired coins. The encouraging part is that the Dec low and even current price is not miles away now from what the Thermocap dicates. Remember, we have no way in Monero to calculate the other metric called 'Realised cap' which is to value coins based on the cost at which current holders acquired them. That number would be higher than the Thermocap because it is not as if no one has capitulated until now. So I would conclude, the bottom cannot be that far off from where we are now (in fiat terms) and probably the Dec bottom was the bottom.",2019-10-13 06:25:15

##Premium Snapchat Subscription


This gives you access to my Premium Snap story. This may include: photos and videos of me nude, teasing, public exposure, day to day updates, premium only sales, and more! I have been having a great and wild time, and so far I have been posting every single day, often times multiple times a day, for over a year and a half! For premium subscribers (and only at my discretion) I will open content sent to me, although I may not always respond. I prefer to receive pictures of you smoking, chilling with your pets, doing something exciting, and **NOT** NSFW content. This does NOT include guaranteed interaction and buyers should not purchase a subscription with the expectation of having daily chat.

**SCREENSHOTS are NOT permitted on either the free or premium story!**

Subscription|Price
:--|:-:
1 Month|$30
3 Months|$60
12 Months|$90

##Skype Shows

It's been a while since I offered cam shows, but for a limited time only I will be available for live cam shows done over Skype!!!! Each show is subject to individual pricing, but the general pricing is as follows:


* Clothed chat - $5/min
* Topless JOI - $6/min
* Nude JOI - $8/min
* Nude JOI /w pussy play - $10/min

* Voyeur/Hidden Cam/Ignoring Fetish $4+/min
* Fetish/Domme/Roleplay - $7+/min

If you're interested in setting up a show please PM me with the type of show you're looking for, the desired length, when you would like to do the show, and which payment method you intend to use. In order to setup the show in a timely manner it is important that you send **ALL** of the required information. 

**All Skype shows must be a minimum of 15 minutes!**

--------------

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! 😉

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun

Low Interaction|$50/day, $250/week|This is my more affordable option.

This is a relaxed arrangement without a whole lot of back in forth. Just a few check-ins a day and some occasional light chat.
Medium Interaction|$75-150/day|This is a middle of the road option where we talk as I'm available. You will occasionally receive photos with this option. With this option I am open to receiving any pictures of yourself you'd like to send including NSFW ones and will be more open to NSFW questions. 
High Interaction|$150+/day|This is a very involved GFE where I interact with you at a similar level to a significant other. Chat will be constant throughout the day unless I have matters to deal with or I am sleeping. I will reply as much as I possibly can. You will receive a mixture of live and gallery photos throughout the duration of the GFE because I love to show off for you!

Hi, I’m [Liana](https://i.imgur.com/7ZAqZuW.png)! 19 year old Filipino girl based in Australia. I have been told I have glowy tits, hence the username! I love art, sex, and self-expression. This is why I made this account, so I can create art with my body and share it with the world! Expressing my sexuality makes me feel like a powerful woman. I love exploring kinks and sexuality. Aside from my soft and hard limits ([please read!!!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-i4vqttOCktxxEnGGEp_pQiLwWdoycYKUiDuTCmx5o8)), I would probably be keen to cater to your kinks. Discuss them with me! I am a sub-leaning switch, but I love domming too! CBT, humiliation, sissification, findom, etc. I can be your bratty mistress or your sweet baby girl. I enjoy being used, and using people 😈 Soooo, you decide! I want to make all your sexy dreams come true! ;)

**If you want to buy content, make sure to put \[buying\] somewhere at the start or subject of the message so I see it and I can respond ASAP.**

f3l6ekm,LoveAGlassOfWine,1,"I have no clue how it works at all! 

You somehow get a server and sign on to the darkweb and just buy drugs like you would buy something on Ebay. They have reviews and everything! 

You have to pay in bitcoin, it's transferred anonymously but you have to give the dealer your address. Then the next day the drugs turn up.

You now know everything I do Mr/Mrs Policeman!

My friend who did this ended up taking too many drugs. He got hooked on oral morphine and ended up killing himself. He was so very loved.

(Sorry to put a miserable ending! I'm sure a lot of people just buy some weed. He was very depressed and went down a dark path with the darkweb. I hadn't even heard of the darkweb before he died).",2019-10-13 22:22:02
f3ld9a7,gta3uzi,1,"I'll stick with my burger comparison because I'm hungry.

**What does it mean for a value to be intrinsic?**

An intrinsic value is a value pertaining to something simply because it is. If I have one burger it has the intrinsic value of being able to satiate my hunger. If I have two burgers, then the presence of identical burger #2 does not remove the intrinsic value of being food from burger #1. Either burger will satiate me just as well as the other. The fact that there are countless Bitcoin clones does not remove any intrinsic value from Bitcoin itself.

**Value vs. Price, and the Subjectivity of Value**

You conflate value and price several times in your post. There is no real lower or upper price bound for gold or silver if you're pricing them in US dollars. In fact, there is no upper or lower price bound for anything given the correct market or transactional medium. If you walk into the woods and try to sell your gold coin to Ted Kaczynski's ghost he's going to laugh at you until you leave. If you try to sell a burger to a robot the robot is going to laugh at you until you leave. If you try to buy a burger with Chuck-E-Cheese coins as currency you're going to get laughed at, unless you're actually in a Chuck-E-Cheese willing to honor that arrangement.

**Values Can Change**

We have to discuss Bitcoin for what it is today, and what it can potentially offer in the future. A burger today is food. A burger tomorrow, if wrapped and chilled, is probably still food. A burger six months from now after it's rotten is not food to a human, so it has lost any intrinsic value to us beyond use as compost or a mean prank. Could Bitcoin rot? Certainly, all things fall to the brutal assault of time, but it is not rotten today and I doubt it will be rotten tomorrow. Until then it will continue to provide values like immutability, ease of transfer, and financial independence to those who use it.

**Is it possible to price Bitcoin?**

Given everything I've typed here I hope it's clear that it will never be possible to say, ""Bitcoin has these values, therefor Bitcoin is worth this price in the market.""

Bitcoin's value at a given price is either worth it to you, or it isn't, and you as a market participant have to make that decision for yourself. Nobody can determine its value to you, and nobody can determine the price you're willing or able to pay for those values.",2019-10-13 22:53:53
f3lc8fq,earonesty,1,"if you calculate the total value of Bitcoin transactions and then you take the fees from those transactions, and then you add in the 72 hour volume.... thats roughly the intrinsic value as a financial network.

I like to choose 72 hours because that is a traditional settlement time.   And it speaks to bitcoin's value over the existing Network.  Obviously the selection of that window of time is the most important factor in whether Bitcoin has intrinsic value at all.    I think 72 hours is a conservative number.   

Another way of looking at it is... if Bitcoin traded a trillion dollars a day there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that its intrinsic value was more than a trillion dollars.

By this metric bitcoin's intrinsic value is currently about 100 times less than its market cap.

if Technologies like the lightning Network and mimblewimble, etc become more widely used in e: Bitcoin is more broadly used ... we would see the intrinsic value ratio go up.

This is intuitive.",2019-10-13 22:49:00

But they don't then smoke the weed.  They want to sell their coin when it mewns.  So they call their dealer back and are like hey I want to sell some of my coinz back to you for mewn money.  So the dealer is buying coinz back and selling them to new bagholders...

(Alan Watts)

Now, Bitcoin (or crypto) can be viewed 2 different ways in this context:

  * Bitcoin is better than gold because it can be transacted directly and with low friction, so no ""backing"" process or third party risk is involved and hence no ""bookkeeping"" to track ownership is necessary (beyong the blockchain itself).
  * Bitcoin is *purely* bookkeeping. The blockchain being a ledger. It's not backed by anything.",2019-10-13 22:48:09

It’s one of the easiest points to get.

But some of us don’t believe getting people that way will be the best,
Some people won’t be able to discern the difference, care to discern the difference and will use whatever is easiest.

Say libra coin works. Gets approved with the blessing of the SEC and all these companies that crypto abhors, and successfully they get billions of people instantly using their “crypto service”.

Members of the crypto community have a heyday and for the upcoming years it becomes wave after wave of us trying to educate people on the differences and the beauty in crypto currency and it’s more decentralized process.

There is no telling how successful this crusade would be.
Maybe success, for you, is getting just 5% of the globe using legitimate cryptocurrencies.
But Facebook would be holding much higher percent.
Some people may be open to presented arguments.
But in face of the reality of crypto and how much we personally deal with our money and it’s safety.
People don’t want to always be subject to the consequences of their limited scrutiny.
So they, understandably, pass on their responsibility to a “financial authority”.

But giving financial power to a coalition of corporations would bring about some interesting effects socially, and especially politically.

What’s to stop the power grab to continuing.
An already undependable company with your countries national ID numbers, daily life habits, what kind of ads you fall prey to, the kind of things you talk about online and “offline” become important pieces for Facebook to expand more and take on even more industries, to better tend to a customers “needs”.

Could make for a monster worse than banks.

Even if the holders of libra could exchange easily to crypto.

Would they.
People are only just starting to realize fiat isn’t the grand ride to salvation we all have been sweating to attain.
But not without some caveats to their traditional exhibited behavior during routine trips/practices.

There’s a lot to be discussed here.

Definitely would open cryptocurrency to the masses in a big way.

But at what cost.

Governments know it probably be successful, more so than their set practices.

Which is why we see this received backlash against the proposal.

Personally, I think we need to tread lightly on this issue.
I think it could go awry, horribly.

A global centralized currency to “rival” bitcoin and fiat.
Just the fact so many companies associated with money jumped straight into support mode is worrying.

If we can see the one potential this has for crypto. They probably see 100 ways this goes right for their personal banking accounts.",2019-10-14 02:34:34

It certainly wasn't designed with the xRapid model in mind, because the original design included a distributed exchange and the expectation was people would be using that to do cross-border payments. They originally wanted to call the exchanges ""banks"" but were told by lawyers they couldn't even hint at banking unless they wanted to get regulated into the floor.

Certainly the creators made XRP as a fast and scalable cryptocurrency, after they saw the shortcomings of Bitcoin. It's obvious that bitcoin could be used for cross-border payments as a potential use case so clearly the XRP creators knew of the various obvious use-cases a cryptocurrency could be used for when they embarked on creating XRP.

Were they designing XRP to be deliberately be ideal for cross border payments? Hard to know, but the attributes that make it attractive for cross-border payments are what make it attractive for general use at all. It just so happens (as Brad said in the Pomp podcast) that cross-border payments are an obvious pain-point where a solution can make an impact on the world, and also be profitable for a company that spearheads it.

f3r0s2u,CoinedPrince,3,"Regarding ETH over BTC for long term HODL:

ETH is internet gasoline and BTC is internet gold. I believe both will drastically increase in fiat value over the next 10 years but I think ETH more so due to it's vast array of potential usescases. It's Turing complete and Bitcoin is not. You can not perform the same tasks with Bitcoin that you can do with ETH as Ethereum includes it's own advanced programming language (Solidity). ETH is truly on a roll (development activity) but highly depends on successful ETH 2.0 deployment, especially in the short term. Buying ETH now is betting on a successful ETH 2.0 by around Q4 2020 or Q1 2021. Any delays could affect price, but if we are in the middle of a bull-market at that time then it might still go rise in fiat value regardless. Watch the releases due over the next 1.5 years: deposit contract, beacon chain, phase 1, and phase 2. As these milestones are hit, ETH/BTC fiat value will rise as it appears more and more likely that ETH will solve Proof of Stake and sharding. This is no joke as it will make ETH go from about 17 transactions per second to potentially millions of transactions per second.

Also, ETH is newer (2015) and lesser known so I think that alone gives it more potential upside as investors (retail and commercial) inevitably begin recognizing ETH's importance to decentralized finance and asset ownership. They mostly only talk about Bitcoin now but that is actually good for those stacking now. See, It's like BTC in 2015 except MANY (arguably most) of the developers working on BTC at that time have already made the switch to ETH. In 2018, BTC came very, very close to flipping BTC. As more people learn about ETH's potential their knowledge should drive demand. Also, POS is supposed to greatly reduce ETH's inflation. Basic economics tells you if the demand grows and the new supply drops then the price should rise dramatically.

TLDR:
ETH is likely a better bet but depends on successful ETH 2.0 implementation to bring massive scaling. Also, ETH is newer so it has more room to grow it's name recognition (ie, maybe a better value proposition.

f3rwgve,Austro-Punk,3,"People trading bitcoin in the manner you describe means it's a purely speculative asset. Yes, we all know that all human action is inherently speculative. But one of the best aspects about a quality medium of exchange is its relative stability in purchasing power. It might go up or down a little, but day-to-day it's pretty stable and thus predictable. This makes economic calculation much easier and allows the price system to be much more efficient at allocating resources and creating wealth through capital accumulation.  

But when people just want bitcoin as a stock, this inherently creates volatility in it's ""price"" as we've seen since its inception. It's why commodities like gold have been used as money for centuries.. it has a consumptive anchor and a final end user. That means that the demand for it will eventually rest as someone demands it for it's own sake, rather than holding it only to trade again at a (hopefully) higher price. 

So when supporters of bitcoin say it's going to replace the dollar as a *currency*, there's no evidence that it will. The dollar, as much as we hate fiat money, is relatively stable each day. It buys pretty much the same amount of goods. It has a consumptive anchor: it's used to pay taxes each year (and more often for some).

Pretty sure bitcoin isn't the only, or even remotely the most secure, crypto out there. Bitcoin is the one ""everyone"" knows but it was far from the most anonymous or secure as many others are now. Not to mention that them having tons of miners or even controlling a large portion of BTC in circulation doesn't give them control over BTC as a whole or provide them with any additional ways to track transactions and users. Also, the environmental issues are due to the fact that most places burn fossil fuels for electricity.

Crypto isn't ruining the environment, reliance on fossil fuels is.

It took me a while to get over it too, but apparently not everyone. It's gotten better but there will always be a subset that remains stuck to views reminiscent of the 2017 censoring and outright attacks on Bitcoin.

&gt; There are just as many bch maxis as btc maxis

If that was true, BCH would be a bigger or equal community in size to Bitcoin and that's not true either in developers, community forums and most likely marketcap showing equal demand.

&gt; It became exactly what it's fighting.

We did not become what we fought, we're just recovering from the constant attacks by Bitcoin. However we don't censor here and we don't censor competing clients like /r/bitcoin did. Take a look at the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited teams.",2019-10-15 05:27:40

Do just enough so that they stop bothering you and watch them get fucked by their stupid decision. The best thing to do is to gain their trust just to give them bad adivice later on. If my parents listened to me we would be millionaires. If they only bought bitcoin when I told them to do so, for fuck's sake. Just a few would be more than enough. Now these fucking idiots are working their asses off to make less than 7000 USD per year in this third world shithole that I live. But considering how they manage their finances they would find a way to lose all the money. 

*Wow, I'll do the exact same thing everyone does everyday but someday I'll wake up rich! Maybe if I don't learn anything and barely do what I'm supposed to do everything will end up just fine.* 

*Huur, look at this boy, he thinks he knows better than everyone else!*

f3vhil5,andromedavirus,3,"&gt;Question is, what will ""reputable"" and ""clean"" citizens do with their crypto stash once massive delisting and banning begins? The new ""War on Crypto"" similar to the ""War on Drugs"" we already have?

We have seen a lot of the playbook already. TPTB have been intervening in Bitcoin since at least 2011-2012, and knew about it in 2010.

Their game plan was to quickly introduce chokepoints at exchanges and use blockchain surveillance companies for non-obfuscated crypto. It's almost certain they back projects like Blockstream and lightning labs, to throw ""sand in the gears"" of cryptocurrency as money. The disinformation campaign against crypto as money has been intense and extremely well funded as well. I can't prove it, but I'm certain that the prices of the major cryptocurrencies are rigged and manipulated to shake out retail buyers, and keep the controlled cryptocurrencies on top. This price manipulation is a powerful deterrent to adoption as money, because what merchant is going to accept the #15 or #5 cryptocurrency when the #1 cryptocurrency (in terms of market cap) doesn't function at scale, and its maintaining developers go out of their way to highlight that fact (although we know they sabotaged it)?

My guess is they will continue the narrative manipulation online/psyops, and continue to sabotage cryptocurrencies using ""companies"" like Blockstream, nChain, and (possibly) the newest one, ""emergent coding"".

The effect of this will be to divide the community. The people who sit on the side of ""law and order"" and buy into the blockstream narrative can probably continue to speculate on their digital ponzi scheme coins with impunity.

The people who want to use crypto as money, however? They will be on the wrong side of the line. Eventually the ""War on Crypto"" has to mean the criminalization of using it for trade without KYC. Those people go to jail. 

It's just a matter of time before we get to that point. You can probably guess the timing of the next major currency collapse based on the intensity with which the ""War on Crypto"" heats up. Fascinating stuff.",2019-10-16 06:50:19

Imagine what would have happened if someone had started minting Bitcoin: The *one* thing everyone harps on about the ecosystem (well-known emission curve with capped supply) would have been utterly devastated. What would ""auditability"" have helped in that situation? If anything, it would have amplified the panic. By the time the community was able to undo the bug, a large amount of Bitcoin would have been minted. The only difference I can discern between visible and hidden transaction amounts is that when everyone sees the signal of a price crash due to inflation, you can easily go to the tapes and realize ""oops, inflation"", rather than having people constantly speculate that inflation caused the crash, as seems to happen every time Monero prices drop.

As a technical matter, though, I will note that there are *multiple* audit paths in Bitcoin (sum all unspents, sum ins and outs in every block), versus only one in Monero (confirm integrity of each block), so, in that sense, there is some distinction, even if it amounts to no relevant difference.",2019-10-16 04:39:01

f3v7qkd,BrianLockhart,2,"&gt;Is there a demo online to see how the keymaster works?

Check these blog posts for a general idea, and if you'd like to schedule a live demo please email us at [membership@team.casa](mailto:membership@team.casa) \- we'd be happy to show you more!

[https://blog.keys.casa/tag/keymaster/](https://blog.keys.casa/tag/keymaster/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What are best practices for storing large amounts of bitcoin using CASA's keymaster 3-5 multisig? Put it on 1 hardware wallet or diversify over 3?

With multisig, you're spreading risk across multiple keys. The higher the amount protected, the higher # of keys you should require in order to sign a transaction. (2 of 3 for moderate sums, 3 of 5 for larger ones, etc.) - but in any case we recommend a mix of key storage devices: mobile key (w. Casa Keymaster app), and 1 or more hardware wallets (ex: Trezor, Ledger). Mixing the brands of HW wallet is not a bad idea, and can protect against possible issues with a specific manufacturer, vs. putting all your eggs in one basket using one brand.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Can you share some examples, best practices of large Bitcoin hodlers/customers of CASA? How they handle there cold storage setup, to get an idea what works best?

For privacy and confidentiality reasons, we're not at liberty to discuss individual client's storage setups of course. But that's a good idea for a blog post; maybe we can share some (anonymous) examples of how others have done it. Stay tuned...

In the meantime, a little bird told me that using multisig with the separate individual keys stored in various anonymous safety deposit boxes in multiple geographically diverse locations is, as the kids say, ""dope"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What strategy do you advise to transfer large bulks of Bitcoin from a custodial/exchange wallet to Casa's keymaster 3-5 set up? E.g. withdraw in bulk or transfer in small steps.

As with ANY decent-sized Bitcoin transfer? Always do a small test transaction first, to make sure things work as expected. THEN do larger ""chunks"" once you've confirmed. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so always look before you leap.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And do you advise to withdraw directly to your Ledger wallet or Trezor, or mix it first, before storing in cold storage on a Ledger/Trezor in the CASA setup.  
&gt;  
&gt;Is there a guide/policy from CASA that helps with mixing?

Mixing ([CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin), etc.) is a tricky topic - some folks swear by it, others worry it can actually be more trouble than it's worth, and if done incorrectly may actually REDUCE your privacy. Only you can decide if mixing is for you, Casa doesn't have an official recommendation either way but obviously our products support any standard  Bitcoin transaction methods once you've got your UTXOs ready.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Can you give some more details about the inheritance program/protocol? I'm familiar with the work of Pamela Morgan and here book about Crypto Inheritance Planning. I also saw the blogpost about team planning https://blog.keys.casa/team-signing-on-casa-keymaster/ My family/relatives are not familiar with crypto and Bitcoin related subjects at all, so I'm very interested in how CASA translates the concepts to software, also for family members for who crypto is a big black box :-).  
&gt;  
&gt;When are you planning to bring the inheritance protocol to market?

Thanks for your interest! We're excited to bring our Inheritance Protocol to market sometime in the next few weeks. We feel this is an underserved need in the market today, and look forward to helping Casa customers make sure their Bitcoin holdings are secure both in normal situations, as well as in the event of an estate / inheritance situation. Too many Bitcoin owners have storage solutions that might be difficult or impossible for a surviving heir to access; Casa is hoping to help solve this problem.

f3vksup,thebluefish92,2,"Have you met this landlord in person? Have you toured the new apartment / house?

There are quite a few scams going on that request payment through Bitcoin / Western Union / Wire. Often there will be a ""lease"" that's filled out online. Often it's cheap for the area, too good to be true kinda cheap. Almost always the potential ""landlord"" has no actual control of the property, pulled some shit from online sources, and gives excuses for why they cannot meet you / show you the property.

So you'll sign the ""lease"", pay, and then they go dark. You try to go to the property, but you can't. The actual landlord of that property has no idea who you are, and since they did not sign that ""lease"", you're stuck with no apartment and lost rent money.

Now, I'm going to assume this isn't a scam for the rest of this advice.

Bear in mind that legally speaking, you owe them the money outlined in your contract. For example, if some third party fed you a bad address (ie a well-crafted phishing email instructing you the new address to pay to), or the address was somehow changed when you went to pay, that's **your** problem. If they never got the money that's due, then you still owe it. Your recourse in such a case is against whoever stole your money, but you would still owe your landlord the amount outlined in your contract.

Your best course of action here would be to get a signed agreement stating how to pay. Have a Bitcoin address in your contract that you will pay to, and perhaps a clause on how they can change the address to pay to (such as written notice by certified mail, no email). You want a paper trail that says ""I paid my LL the way I was instructed to in the lease"", so that if they ever claim they never got it, it's their problem.",2019-10-16 07:26:03

f3vix61,aSchizophrenicCat,2,"High fees are unfortunately gonna the norm for you if you can’t access reputable exchanges, and avoid KYC (not sure if local Ethereum required it or not). It’s the same in US if I try buying with cash. At least with LocalEthereum you know you aren’t gonna get scammed.

You could try to find subreddits, like /r/bitmarket - could try and post offers with PayPal, ask for ETH or BTC (forget sub rules, but PayPal for btc is common on there) - trade bitcoin for eth if needed. Higher chance of getting scammed here though.. make sure you’re verifying users’ rep to avoid a scam. 

Also, is Bitfinex banned in UAE? I’m not sure, but might be worth looking into.

Edit: You could look into Paxful as well - lotta different payment options. It is btc only I believe. So you’d have to convert that to eth at at altcoin exchange like bittrex or Binance. Not sure about the fees on there.. but yeah, again, keep in mind, all sites like these will have prices above market value.

f3v5o9z,chile8888,1,"&gt;I’m worried. This is the first time BTC had a bear market with Futures. Futures tames and beats markets down. Gold and silver has never mooned ever since

There are a good amount of people that I've seen since entering this space that are saying Bitcoin may never see an all time high again. I'm somewhat inclined to believe them. The only thing that has me believing otherwise is the fact that Bitcoin and Crypto is a new asset class. A lot of people including myself speculate that it was invented to stop that type of oppression. That said, I am worried too, as I believe we could be seeing the last high Bitcoin will see for quite some time...The one good thing about futures markets destroying price movement is that it forces you to learn how to trade. Back when I was first starting in this market I remember a guy messaging me giving me some tips here and there, and one thing that always stuck out to me was him saying something along the lines of ""You can make just as much in Bitcoin with it ranging between $5k and $10k as you can with it hitting a new all time high."" It just depends on if you know how to trade or not.

While Gold and Silver have been extremely suppressed, that's not to say there hasn't been great opportunities in trading them.

As far as the market being vaporware, you could be right, but I don't think so. Nano alone allows micropayments, in USD you can't exactly buy fractions of a penny worth of valuables without incurring steep ass fees. Especially if you're doing the whole in-game purchasing thing on your phone or something.

I do believe that there are a decent amount of Crypto out there that aren't just vaporware, but you have to keep your eyes open, have faith, pick the right project, and have **patience.** (Something I don't have much of.)",2019-10-16 05:37:51

However don't be fooled, the article's title is clickbait and spreads misinformation: Bitcoin transactions are indeed totally private if you want them to be. Nobody ""cracked"" bitcoin privacy - that's not how it works. You are right that a public ledger exists, but the Bitcoin address displayed can only be traced back to you if you've bought bitcoin with a credit card, or have been using an online wallet like coinbase. If someone buys Bitcoin via cash (for example, locally or at a bitcoin ATM) and generates a bitcoin address with an offline wallet, then it would be impossible to link their public key to the individual (unless somebody is snooping on them, or hacks into their computer. But even then there are ways to encrypt data.).

What happened in this case is federal agents were able to break into a major Torr website that was distributing child porn. There are many possibilities as to how this happened - the sitemaster might have been actively investigated, or maybe he made some mistake in encrypting his personal info and doxxed himself. Once authorities were able to locate and seize the server, they were able to breach all of the site's data, including every bitcoin address that made transactions. Since the majority of people buy bitcoin via credit card, it must have been fairly easy for government agencies to request their identities from various Bitcoin exchanges. A similar thing happened with the Silk Road a few years ago, which was a major blackmarket Torr site that sold drugs.

It sucks that so many people are using Bitcoin for evil. But it really is a good currency, and has many real-world applications beyond illegal markets.",2019-10-17 07:08:10
f3z615c,grmpfpff,2,"Bsv is not fully decentralized and its not magically turning Bitcoin back to what it was before Blockstream took over. BSV based on the Bitcoin ABC node implementation which is based on the Bitcoin core node implementation from August 2017. BSV did not get rid of four years of code. Raising block size, implementing altered Op_codes and patented code is not equivalent to turning Bitcoin back to what it once was. 


And your article is not objective at all. You are telling the reader what they are supposed to realise instead of giving them a choice by objectively presenting all three forks.

f437wfz,saintswererobbed,15,"Bear with me because this is gonna sound like a weird analogy but

This reminds of a the start-ups that try to compete with things like YouTube. Many people have complaints with YouTube, so it seems like there’s an obvious opportunity to create a competitor that fixes those complaints. But when you try you find that your largest customer base is not the people you were thinking of, those with legitimate but not relationship-breaking complaints about YT, but the people who have been fully barred from the platform. Namely, people like terrorists and Nazis and serial harassers and copyright-breakers, people who tend to ruin the site they use.

Stuff like Bitcoin (ostensibly) tries to solve somewhat-legitimate complaints w/ the default currency, like the fact it’s controlled by state governments, but when they’re established they find their largest customer base is people who cannot use US banking systems at all (or at least without extensive laundering) like large drug dealers and child traffickers. 

So then you have to deal with establishing your thing either with that base that’ll drive everyone else away or try to visibly bar them and still find a niche that’ll allow you to poach people from the mainstream alternative. All the while knowing that if you do find that niche, the mainstream alternative might just copy that feature and leave you dead on the track.

Anyway, totally irrelevant and somewhat obvious. But maybe it shows that some of the big online services have become monopolies?",2019-10-18 04:08:47

f448k1n,WeLiveInaBubble,10,"Because the Bitcoin dream is dead. It has failed and there’s nothing to replace it for these guys. Yeah, we could say ETH could be the thing you want.. but it is different to Bitcoin. It’s not a straight currency. The ethos of Bitcoin was remarkable and a lot of people had high hopes for it, but the technology just cannot evolve to be what it wants to be..the network can’t handle it and things like Lightning Network have proven to not alleviate these issues. These guys aren’t going to flip to ETH from BTC .. ETH is not money to them. It’s not a fixed supply currency that is purely mined. So to them, if Bitcoin isn’t a success, nothing can be. We know that’s bullshit and we know that Ethereum will keep this remarkable digital global currency evolving even without Bitcoin. The funny thing is, these guys could actually use 0xBTC which is the same fixed supply of 21 million and it has also been purely mined..it also resides on the Ethereum network so is secured by it and will be cheap and fast to transfer as scaling comes down the line. People for some reason have a hatred of it though.. so I guess that won’t be the answer either unfortunately.",2019-10-18 06:53:05

I don't think that's a good long-term technical solution when compared to all of the other options out there.

If there was anything to be done with Nano, I'd *possibly* think it's finding a more direct way to incentivize PRs.  I'm cautious to even say that as those incentives can just become reason to game the system.

So value proposition for whatever needs, SOV, medium of exchange, whatever, has not changed a bit.

BTW the website was hacked 2 years ago and leaked IPs and customer accounts. The whole bitcoin tracing angle is likely a scare tactic and a cover for illegal surveillance operation which was actually conducted to nab all the users.

f4339x9,redmercuryvendor,6,"&gt; It's a fad

Albeit a [decade-long fad with no signs of going away any time soon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). Admittedly 99% of 'new' cryptocurencies are a mix of pure marketing, naive fumbling, and thinly veiled ponzi schemes, but so are 99% of new startup businesses anyway.

With 'X but on a blockchain' being the new flavour of 'X but crypto!' and the successor to the long line of 'X but on the internet' and 'X but on a computer!' navigating the market is surprisingly easy: a 'blockchain' is a database, just one with a fancy hosting method that has some useful properties. If the application/project cannot explain how/why it is useful to have a database that does X (and after that, by the specific requirements of X suit a distributed database rather than a centralised one), then chances are near unity that it is either a scam or running on incompetence.",2019-10-18 03:48:11

Kraken's credibility and all-round coolness is proved by them knowing about PGP. Not only do they encrypt my personal data, they **sign** their emails with their own private PGP key so I can tell what's a phishing scam and what's kosher.

I'm fairly sure Kraken rely on internal reserves rather than external insurance in the event of a hack. Don't know about Bitrex.

Abra is a curious one.

f47bb03,Symphonic_Rainboom,1,"Thanks for allowing me this opportunity to shill Ethereum.

Assume as a premise that Ethereum 2.0 becomes reality, as it was a premise of my original comment. Then most transactions on Ethereum will cost a fraction of a penny, as they currently do on BCH. Furthermore, Ethereum's 2.0 design reduces inflation massively and ends the issuance question once and for all, making ETH just as attractive of a store-of-value (or more) as BTC or BCH.

DAI (which is live) takes this a step further and gives you a $1 stablecoin on ETH. Now, currently ETH and DAI can cost upwards of $0.10 to send during periods of network congestion, whereas BCH doesn't suffer from any network congestion issues right now (and also not likely in the near-to-mid future).

However, if Ethereum scales by launching 2.0, that means that ETH and DAI are practically free to send just like BCH. Then DAI has accomplished more than what Bitcoin set out to achieve re: payments - a permissionless, decentralized coin with not only no inflation but a savings rate to boot, tethered to the dollar in a trustless way that's been tested resilient against a 96% decrease in the value of its backing collateral (ETH), with optional decentralized payment shortnames enabled by the Ethereum Name Service.

That's before we even start talking about decentralizing insurance products and loans collateralized by real-world assets, which are going to require a payment coin that's native to the Ethereum network (like ETH or DAI) and further cement the network effects.

**In short, *if* Ethereum scales, that's the last piece of the puzzle for DAI. Then DAI is a trustless, scalable Dapp-compatible stablecoin payment network, with the biggest network effect because it's running on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.**

Privacy can be added on Layer 2 as BCH has done (is cashshuffle still in active development?) On Ethereum, zk-based anonymity is already functional in mainnet prototypes such as tornado.cash, plus scalable zero-knowledge transactions are mostly a solved problem with zk-rollups.",2019-10-19 02:32:45

f475nzr,tommygunz007,1,"Bitcoin will never replace government currency. It can't because governments need a way to create artificial wealth to build schools, pave roads, etc without having any physical gold on hand to back the paper they print. So if Bitcoin won't replace government currencies, it will be come an intermediary currency. This means if you want to buy and sell with real gold, you can. You can buy and sell with cabbage patch dolls, you can. Buy and sell with matchbox cars, you can, or bitcoin even. But the majority of the world, and ALL active functioning governments, will use their own respective currencies. Yes they will inflate the crap out of them. There will always be fraud of some kind, and scams and Zimbabwe is a real problem. But the real issue here, is that as long as governments NEED their own currencies, bitcoin becomes an 'alternative'. So what does that mean? 

When I buy Euros with American dollars, there is an intermediary exchange that says 5 USD=5 EURO. It goes through a third party exchange or clearing house. Bitcoin sits in the middle. So 5 USD = x bitcoin = 5 Euro. It inserts an unnecessary added step. It's not needed. Yes, you can just take bitcoin and buy other stuff in bitcoin around the globe, but as long as you live in a country with a currency, life will be in that currency regardless of what alternative currency you use. This means that _almost_ nowhere, at no time, can someone live entirely off the global currency grid soley on bitcoin. Somewhere that bitcoin is converting BACK into paper fiat currency into a exchange, a bank, or a country currency. 

For this reason, it will always be an intermediary currency. Bitcoin, is like it's own country, BitcoinWorld. You have to convert USD into Bitcoin to do bitcoin related stuff, but then go and pay your rent in USD. Bitcoin can never overtake a county's ability to have it's own currency with out a country where it already has a lot of paper money or gold. 

So that's why it's fun to own some, and it will go up, but as long as we have governments, we will have banks. As long as we have governments and banks, we will need government backed currencies, and as long as we do that, rents, gas, and most other things will _eventually_ wind up getting paid back in government currency.",2019-10-19 01:54:24

Tying wallets to people though is the hard thing, which only really happens when someone puts money into / removes money from the system in a legitimate manner (e.g. you bought or sold bitcoin by bank transfer or some other method that identifies you). If you're careful though, a few basic steps will remove yourself from being ""directly involved"" and cast doubt as to who the owner of the wallet that actually performed the transaction is.

It's like if you bought drugs with a £20 note and the cops busted the dealer and tried to trace that note back to you to incriminate you. Yes you might have handled the £20 in the past but was it you who did the deal, or was it someone who you gave that £20 note to?

# Sexting

I'm online now on Kik and Telegram!

Want to have me all to yourself and have some one on one fun? Private sessions are always a fun way to get each other off.

From daily good morning and good night texts to unlimited chatting and naughty pictures and videos from your babe across the globe; access my pervy mind and let's chat about some crazy sex stories, or a good movie! I'll make sure to make your work days a little bit less boring. There is one **~~20 minute standard KIK session every week~~**, with live pictures and videos, in the weekly and monthly options.

We can take this time time to get to know each other, explore a dom/sub dynamic, a roleplay or a fantasy, or be workout buddies, why not. It's your call.

# Custom Videos

Do you want to watch me over and over again, or act out a fantasy of yours? Be the director of your very own video and ask me to make you something special to help fulfill all your fantasies! You can give me as much or as little direction as you'd like. I will make you the perfect video.

~~There's a $50 fee if you'd like me to use your name during the video; this will grant you video exclusivity, which means it will be our little secret.~~ **Name mentioning is currently FREE!**

# Ratings

Do you want to know how you measure up, or just want to see my reaction and hear me ramble about your cock while I scroll through your pictures? I'll let you know my thoughts on all the different aspects of your cock/balls in a very thorough rating, I can be naked or wearing something sexy to give a little game to your imagination, mention and moan your name; without forgetting to mention what I'd do to your cock, how it compares to the other guy's I've been with, and finish with a rating on a 0-10 scale.

I can give you a 100% honest cock rating, worship, or a harsh rating.

* Text rating: Around 200-300 words. $15
* Video rating (Downloadable): 4\~6 minute video with lots of teasing, touching and flashing, or completely naked! ~~$45~~ **$40**
* Video rating with orgasm (Downloadable): 8+ minute video, where I make myself cum after rating your cock. ~~$75~~ **$65**
* Video rating with orgasm + JOI (Downloadable): 10+ minute video, where after (or while) I rate your cock, I instruct you how to jerk off for me, until I make myself (and you) orgasm. ~~$95~~ **$75**

After your purchase, you can send me the a few well lit photos/videos of your choosing, (from different angles is always best). **Name mentioning, outfit and music choice is free, and up to you :)**

# Premium Snapchat

In my premium you will find tons of cum shows, sexy lingerie modeling, dancing/twerking, solo play with my fingers or toys and I also include some of my favourite fetishes like anal play, ass to mouth, squirt (everywhere) and often enjoy licking it up, JOI, public exposure, pee and spit play and foot fetish among others!

Obviously, there are a variety of ways you can send to the wrong address beyond typos, particularly man-in-the-middle attacks where malware on your computer replaces the intended address with one owned by the attacker.

f4i35so,Kain_niaK,16,"I sell my beats and music online for crypto.

I have a QR code when I play music on the street 

I run a website that collects crypto bounties to give to pizza places if they start accepting it. 

I like to find people on reddit from african countries and send crypto to their phones and show them where in their town they can buy food with it. 

When I buy hardware from my friend in town who has a small computer business I pay him with crypto. 

I trade on cryptophyl and coinex, at the moment I am actually making money with that because it's the dawn of the SLP token market (always good to be an early adopter anywhere, low risk high potential of profit and SLP tokens can already scale about 10 times better then token on Ethereum and 50 times better then tokens on Bitcoin so next bull run this market has the potential to not slow down as much because the high fees force it to slow down) 

I play poker with crypto on blockchain.poker

I buy from amazon with crypto as much as I can using purse.io

I tip lots of people crypto on reddit. (you can tip anywhere on reddit but not on /r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency, who ban the bots) 

I went to a crypto meetup in Berlin this summer and the community took good care of me, even  paid for my hotel room.

When I need animation or video or graphic design for anything related to my music I usually outsource it to people in Venezuela. They are cheap and I can pay them with crypto. 

All of the above is invisible on /r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency because it's been hijacked by banks that are not afraid of speculation but terrified of actual adoption. So if I share anything related to adoption here it either gets downvoted or removed. They hired the same social media guys that were behind /r/the_donald, you can tell because they speak the same negative tone, calling you stupid and dumb for asking questions. When something does not work it's always your fault. 

Crypto adoption is very small but it's still growing, mainly in countries like south-sudan and venezuela that really need it. The rest of the world does not need it because they have proper money systems. 

I am living of my music and my trading, without crypto I would have at least 30% lower income right now. 
Locally I can't buy to much yet with crypto but selling crypto on Kraken and gettin CAD on my bank account only take a number of days. Sometimes I sell crypto for CAD to my local friends over e-transfer and then it's instant.  On kijiji I sometimes sell and buy stuff using crypto. 

I don't have a credit card anymore. Purse.io is tricky but worth it to buy from amazon with 10% being the discount I usually go for. 

The crypto I use just works, it has never failed me so far. I like not using credit cards and using my bank account less and less.

Still a very long way to go, but eventually all that fiat printing is going to come with consequences. Consequences that I will feel less the the rest of society.  I also hold small amounts of crypto for my family (who I convinced to buy some) on my cold wallet system. That way they don't have to deal or worry about it.  That crypto was bought around january this year and is still in the green.",2019-10-21 04:24:39

INT. Living Room. HARRY BOOMER, a proud grey-haired American is reading a newspaper, wearing an oversized white t-shirt tucked into his jean shorts and a cell phone belt clip.

HARRY: When you’re done with that, I’d like to speak to the manager who raised this thing [points to XIR]. I’d like to know if they’d still honor the eighteen year return policy.

NANCY: What’s a Bitcoin?

HARRY: Probably some new rap group.

XIR: [snorts condom] You mean like cursive?

*a pregnant member of the audience laughs so hard it induces birth*

HARRY: No! Like Frank Sinatra, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Marvin Gaye.

XIR: Did you just say the G word? I’m triggered.  Don’t put labels on my gender-fluid pansexuality. 

*audience gasps, oooohs*

NANCY: What’s a pan— pan sex? 

*audience laughter so hard blood is coming from their eyes, some squirting on the set, misting Harry’s newspaper*

XIR: [rolls eyes from underneath wool hat] Ugh, just google it!

NANCY attempts to use her phone browser, when HARRY jumps up and puts his hand in front of the phone. 

HARRY: Trust me, you DON’T want to google that!

f4jabjp,xamboozi,5,"I've been around Bitcoin since the 2013/2014 bull run when I bought my first Bitcoin.

It's hard to convey the difference between what I was reading back then compared to now. I started by reading the Bitcoin white paper and because I was just out of college and in IT it was very exciting to see all these things I just learned get mixed together to make a digital object that I could own. It was absolutely mind-blowing to grow up in the digital age where anyone could copy an mp3 or movie and then realize someone made something immutable using public key cryptography. A true virtual asset...

So I dove deep into how and why Satoshi built Bitcoin. The struggles he and others were going through in 2009 to invent this asset we're riveting. 

And then 2017/2018 came and the hype was everywhere. People came up to me saying ""hey I just bought crypto too! I dropped $xxxx into &lt;insert shitcoin here&gt;"". And I knew if I asked why they wouldn't have a clue what they even bought. The only thing to do was put on a fake smile and ""that's awesome! Hopefully it goes somewhere....""

The similarities between this and the dot com boom are intense. No one knows what they are talking about and the BS is just everywhere. No one wants the revolution Bitcoin, they want the NEXT Bitcoin so they can get rich. There might be another Bitcoin-esque tech made but its going to follow the exact same altruistic selfless principals as Bitcoin.

On the other hand, the idea that core developers have been manipulating the market (shorting because they know beforehand that they will miss deadlines) is laughable. I said this earlier to /u/TowerofTerrorfan1 and I'll say it again: look at Bitcoin and how much their core developers have done in the past 6 years vs how much the price has rallied and tell me where the connection is.

Ethereum core developers might have been underestimating the required work to accomplish some tasks. That's debatable of course, but true in my opinion and apparently in many others that follow the space on a daily basis.   


But they sure haven't been trading these markets because they have much better and important things to focus on than that, and especially not under the ""insider knowledge"" that Instanbul will not be delivered in time or that ETH2 will not be delivered in 2020. If that was the case, I think that core devs should have passed the message to all the client teams, because they also seem to be very eager to deliver with quality. They should also have used a more concerned tone throughout their presentations in Devcon instead of plainly report on the work achieved and on what's next. If they're shorting the market based on their ""insider information"", they definitely aren't doing a great job in spreading their agenda.

f4p09de,ruvalm,12,"It's been one of those rough daily threads indeed. There were interesting discussions that can be read if one goes down to the bottom of the thread, but the conspiracy theories have dominated a big chunk of the day.

Reminds me of October/November 2016. I have no idea if in March 2020 I'll be feeling like I did in March 2017 and throughout that golden year, but the sentiment similarities are here.

The main difference is that in October/November 2016 the conspiracy theories / concern trolling / FUD were mainly about ETH not serving any other purpose than Bitcoin apart from being less secure; ETH is only good for spam attacks; ETH is centralized and controlled by a big mixer that is moving coins back and forth; ETH will never succeed, never scale, Dapps don't and will never exist, it's never going to be an immutable chain because of the DAO, smart contracts will never attract developers because the tooling doesn't exist; smart contracts will allow hacks that will destroy the protocol's value.

Nowadays it's about the EF, Lubin and the core devs all getting together and conspiring on never delivering on any release because they want to short ETH and get rich on that epic race to the bottom; it's about ETH2 being a far-fetched dream that will never come true; it's about the many cool Dapps out there having no users; it's about the certainty that governments will crack down with extreme success on privacy-protection breakthroughs; it's about the price not doing what those who own ETH want it to do in the next 5 minutes.

FUD is getting weirder and more nonsensical by the day. We're definitely heading in the right direction. More conspiracy theories appearing, generally means that anything that can resemble fundamentals is improving, since those are not anymore the destination of the narrative attacks.

We won't see it coming, once again, as we haven't in late 2016. Not the chartists, not the analysts and not the mainstream audiences that don't yet know what is possible with Ethereum. Some few might give out some screams to the wind, but the general sentiment of the little mass that gets together in the usual places will dwarf it because, you know, it's group psychology and one is sad when everyone else is sad and one is happy when everyone else is happy.

Triggers will be triggered and there will be early warnings, but no one will believe them because they had been happening so much in prior weeks/months that no one will take them seriously. That's my own conspiracy theory to close today's business.

There's no guarantee that BTC goes on another 4 year parabolic swing... but there's also nothing yet to suggest Bitcoin is 'dead'.

You may want to look at avg cost for your 3.2 BTC and decide if cashing out the one at a loss still keeps you in the black, and if selling the one would help you sleep better at night.  You may also want to establish a 'bottom' price at which you will cut loses and move on should Bitcoin languish or fizzle out.

There are no perfect trading strategies, just personal trading strategies -  terms like 'terrified', 'spooked', and the phrase ""I feel like a retard' suggests you're too emotionally invested which makes rational trading very difficult.

This is a decentralized, open sourced, permissionless protocol. This is not a company. Core developers do not respond to investors. If they ever feel attacked, the best thing they can do is actually leave and go work on something else. Don't make them feel like that. Investors aren't really investors, they are speculators, because they do not yet have a stake on the protocol -- those dynamics and others, might eventually shift with staking.

What ? Please do one out of two things:

1. Provide evidence of this, even if anecdotal, otherwise I'm calling this pure trolling.
2. Stop contemplating this nonsensical idea if you do not have any form of evidence. Price action hasn't even properly followed all the delays and even if it did, it would still be just a narrative.7

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Large corporations that are regulated on insider trading still have concerns why would an unregulated market be different.

And you think that protocol developers stop fixing issues or just go have a drink while they should be testing ? In a regulated market, narratives are easier to control than in an unregulated market and information asymmetry benefits those who work on the companies that stocks represent; here, what core devs do have absolutely no influence in the short term. Look at Bitcoin. Core devs have been doing nothing for years and it's been rising steadily on the long run.

f4npgpr,hyc_symas,4,"A relevant passage:

&gt;Alle Transaktionen sind öffentlich einsehbar und können falls nötig in ihrer gesamten Historie nachverfolgt werden. Dennoch ist nicht außer Acht zu lassen, dass die Möglichkeit, sich beliebig viele Public Keys und damit Pseudonyme zuzulegen, die Auswertung einer Historie für eine Person oder Organisation deutlich erschweren kann. Besonders anfällig für Geldwäsche sind jedoch jene Kryptowerte, die Nutzern vollumfängliche Anonymität bieten und deren Transaktionen nicht nachvollziehbar sind (beispielsweise Monero, Zcash). Die Anonymität der Nutzer ermöglicht eine einfache Verschleierung der Transaktionen, wodurch die Nachverfolgung von Geldern unmöglich wird. Die vollständige Anonymität erhöht außerdem die Möglichkeit des Missbrauchs für weitere kriminelle Aktivitäten. Vor diesem Hintergrund sollte zukünftig ein besonderes Augenmerk auf die Entwicklung von anonymen Kryptowerten gelegt werden, bei denen sowohl der Sender als auch der Empfänger vollständig anonym bleiben. Bei insgesamt noch vergleichsweise geringer Marktkapitalisierung erlangen anonyme Kryptowerte immer mehr Akzeptanz im Darknet und können hier zu einer echten Alternative zu Bitcoin werden. Dies gilt insbesondere für Monero. Nicht zu unterschätzen ist jedoch, dass es sich bei Kryptowerten generell um sehr innovationsgetriebene Techniken handelt, weshalb auch bei den pseudonymen Kryptowerten Entwicklungen hin zu mehr Anonymität denkbar sind.

From Google Translate

&gt;All transactions are publicly available and, if necessary, can be traced throughout their history. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the possibility of obtaining any number of public keys and thus pseudonyms can make the evaluation of a history for a person or organization significantly more difficult. However, those crypto-values ​​that offer users full anonymity and whose transactions are incomprehensible (for example, Monero, Zcash) are particularly vulnerable to money laundering. The anonymity of the users makes it easy to obscure the transactions, making it impossible to track money. Full anonymity also increases the possibility of abuse for further criminal activity. Against this background, special attention should be paid in the future to the development of anonymous crypto-values, in which both the sender and the recipient remain completely anonymous. With overall comparatively low market capitalization, anonymous crypto values ​​are gaining more and more acceptance in the darknet and can become a real alternative to Bitcoin. This is especially true for Monero. It should not be underestimated, however, that crypto-values ​​are generally very innovation-driven techniques, which is why developments in the area of ​​pseudonymous crypto-values ​​can lead to more anonymity.",2019-10-22 06:03:08

Bitcoin 12hr has broke and held above the 50MA, 100/200ma line up pretty nicely with resistance lines right now too. I could see BTC heading up to one or both.

We been holding below the daily 200ma since the drop down from 10k. A daily close above 8900 would be pretty bullish.

Bouncing off the 100ma here potentially.

My thoughts on all this. On the run up from the 200ma, 3k to 13k, I thought btc was gonna stop at the weekly 100ma 6400 but it closed through it and kept going to 13k and utter destroyed the long term shorts. Shorts keep bitcoin price from a free fall, without them a pull back was likely, but is the 100ma the final destination? The bitcoin halving is not till next year, I don't think the major run will start till after the halving there may be hype pumps before but it won't be the big one. I think we could see a push up to 9/9800 but unless the daily closes above 8900 I think we are ultimately heading back down. The weekly painted a nice ledge at 5100 and the 200ma should be there by early 2020, could be a good short target. Maybe 4200 if the 200ma doesn't hold this time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Seemingly both deposit contract and Istanbul get delayed we dump as that news comes out. Now further delays what will price action be. My guess is more down based on history

Might even be that you're right, that both get delayed and the market goes down a bit more. But the market has been going down for 21 months now and in the middle of it there was a ton of great news. What the market does and what one tells oneself that was likely the cause is always wrong. The market doesn't move on single motives.

&gt;EF has paid out trolls and different groups like Parity who don’t want to see ETH win yet other developers struggling to get by don’t get funded

The EF has made bad decisions. The EF has made good decisions. The EF suffers from some issues in areas such as transparency of reporting budgets and their decisions, lack of clear vision and lack of effort to promote Ethereum. I said ""suffers from some issues"" but that might even be a feature of the EF, one that we might not enjoy much, but given that it's out there for a few years now and this has been said by many again and again -- and they definitely got to read it -- it might even be done this way on purpose.

But the thought that the EF is evil and wants to short Ethereum to the ground and is trying to accomplish that by funding potential bad actors is insane.

So, should they be more transparent (quarterly reporting of budget allocation and reasoning behind attribution of grants) ? Yes.

Should they have a strategy to promote Ethereum ? I'm divided in this point, but I lean to ""Yes"" on at least the most basic things, starting by the website and maybe some of the introductory content.

Are they funding potential bad actors to destroy the protocol, or to make people believe that the protocol's value is too high at the moment ? No, hell now, that's a very unworthy and unfair thought.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;numerous people in ethtrader and ethfinance have mentioned that due to the poor performance of ETH speeds they can’t develop DApps that they want and it’s always ETH scaling will be next year and it never comes. Why keep pissing off future developers

It's extremely difficult to scale and keep a protocol decentralized, permissionless and secure. Extremely difficult to design a system in which the incentives are aligned for these important features to be kept. Look at Bitcoin and how quickly they have decided to forget scaling as soon as they realized how freaking hard that would be.

Dapp devs don't seem too concerned from everything I read and have been talking with them. Actually, their numbers are growing, their tooling has been improved and the onboarding has been enhanced.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;⁠I keep hearing how great Ethereum development progress why are the commits so low against other chains: [https://coincheckup.com/analysis/github](https://coincheckup.com/analysis/github)

&gt;Why is the communication so poor with other stakeholders like the ERC-20? Could Aragon move not be prevented. Breaking 500 smart contracts without much communication is poor based on what they communicated

Geographical decentralization and a rapid expansion of features and applications brings opportunities to improve communication processes and tooling. Aragon did not really ""move"". It isn't unusual in software development to have upgrades that, due to introduction of big new features, potentially break older code. There's documentation out there available already for those who want to procede with changing what's going to break.

The tweet was something like I'm quitting Tesla and giving away some Bitcoin. This was around the time period where he was in hot water for smoking weed and calling that guy a pedo. The guy seemed to be going through a bender so honestly the tweet did not surprise me one bit. I click on the tweet and read the responses, I see tens of comments from other verified accounts (also blue check marks) I also see other responses from normal accounts. They all seemed to be saying wow amazing thanks or something to that effect. Anyway, I then decide this must be the real deal and I have to act fast to get my free Bitcoin (lol)
Anyway, the gist of the scam was I had to send him a small amount of BTC so they he could send me more in return (lol) yeah I know I'm a idiot. 

What ended up happening was hackers got into hundreds of verified accounts, they picked one to be the Elon musk account and the others were used as bots to respond to the fake Elon tweet. It all looked very very very legit. They also managed to advertise the Elon tweet on Twitter. So the tweet was now double verified, it had both a blue check mark and also a verified add marker from Twitter.",2019-10-22 08:59:06

f4udgtm,Academic_Crypto,10,"I am not a big fan of TA, I mostly just trade common sense and look for instances where the derivatives exchanges are going to be squeezed. That said, I opened a large short with an average entry of 8119 a few days ago during that 15 hour parabola from $7,900-$8,200 because at the time, BitMEX was in a lot of danger of being squeezed. Since then open interest has grown considerably, and longs have continued to pay funding, so things are actually much worse. There is a highly asymmetric risk of longs vs shorts at the moment. This risk has nothing to do with TA, it has nothing to do with news or fundamentals or anything that should influence the price of Bitcoin. To short now does not mean that you hate Bitcoin, or that you think it has no value, it does not make you a bear, it means that you are ascribing a risk to the current state of the derivatives market. 

\-------------------

The bearish case is that longs get squeezed. I suspect that if this happens in the next 24-48 hours, its going to look like a bleed down to about $7,830-$7,850 followed by a 3 minute candle to about $7,750. This candle will probably be initiated by a single exchange with large volume (&gt;1,000 BTC) and just arbitraged to other exchanges. This will then be followed by a few 3 minute candles to somewhere in the range of $6,800-$7,200 as BitMEX overloads. The idea of squeezing BitMEX isn't new. In addition to myself I believe a number of large players in the ecosystem have accurate models of BitMEX's liquidations, or if you are a conspiracy theorist, then groups like the internal trading desk at BitMEX have the raw data. Typically when BitMEX is ripe like this, its common to see large market selling (or buying) of 500-2000 BTC on Bitstamp's BTC/USD pair as well as Binance's BTC/USDT pair from what I am guessing are traders / groups trying to single-handedly kick things off. 

The market likes to buy $200 above and below intervals of 1,000, and I expect one side of 7,000 to hold. For spot exchanges I am not sure what the volume profile will look like, for Binance BTC/USDT its going to be about 2.5k-3k BTC for a few of those 3-minute candles, and then 1-2k for a few more for a total sell-off of about 15-18k BTC. That said, during the actual BitMEX overload process things could wick lower, so if you are looking to place an order on the books to try and catch a scam-wick, then I wouldn't be surprised to see the price flash lower. Most spot exchanges are arbitraged with the BitMEX api, so if you are on CBP or something, the price will still follow Bitmex's scam-wick to an extent. 

\---------------------

The bullish case is actually that things hold here for a little while with negative funding on BitMEX. It is important to remember that the average leverage on BitMEX is about 25-30x, and that a lot of big positions are taken with about 10x leverage. This amount of leverage means that your margin is actually pretty small and funding on longs over a period of many days actually considerably increases the liquidation point of a position. Positions that were opened a week ago with a liquidation price of $7,500 may have a liquidation price of $7,800 or higher now based on leverage. Some negative funding for a few cycles will help to push down the liquidation price of longs which fights off a long squeeze and also gives people a time to slowly deleverage themselves. 

The other thing that bulls will want to see is the open interest dropping without the price moving, or when the price is going up. This will likely correspond to some of the riskiest longs being closed or deleveraged.",2019-10-23 13:54:41

Historically, price seems to find a secular bottom relative to its boom bust cycle when the multiple is around .5

We seem to be on a trajectory that is confluent with hitting the multiple at .5, around the time when BTC price hovers around 6.5k.  This price is where many chartists myself included see the bottom at 6.5k — the measured move from the current descending triangle after losing 8k horizontal support.  At that multiple range, price is firmly entrenched as historically .5 has meant price is at a secular bottom in its life cycle since inception. (“Gains locked”) .  I believe this is also why its more useful to look at BTC price bottoms year after year to understand the storage of value proposition.  The bottoms are ironclad (if you were fortunate enough to accumulate there) though the volatile price action above it is the domain of the degenerate traders and FOMOers.

In other words, BTC is soon approaching this secular bottom level again.  It might not rise for a while (as is usually the case) but price should hold the range (where accumulation happens, unsurprisingly) to set the stage for the next slow rise up and parabolic leg but not before a long period of sideways meandering in price and the .5 multiple range.",2019-10-24 11:34:52

BTC hobbled itself in a wild goose chase for a functional second layer, BSV is originated by known scammers, BCH is technically the most sound but still limited to about 100 transactions per second. The splintering into 3 significant forks that hate each other shows it's vulnerable to social/political gaming, and the failure of the markets to price the forks according to their technical soundness shows that it takes years, if at all, for a sound branch to prevail.

In my opinion, the digital currency experiment has mostly ended and the results are in. They are useful in places like Venezuela where the fiat has been completely mismanaged. That's about it. BTC mooned in December 2017.

I would be surprised by another bubble unless a new digital currency is invented that can do e.g. 20,000+ transactions per second without some significant security compromise.

f57l7s9,bitvote,7,"Thoughts re today/next 12-18mos. 

----
(1) I think that we're on the cusp of a huge movement towards digital assets. Obv there's China's announcement today. And Facebook/Libra is going to happen - it may be a slog for them, but they're going to do it and it'll happen soon-ish (mid-2021 at the very latest). And the EU is very seriously looking into a digital Euro. Which means that the US will essentially be forced to following. Or even forced into being a bit of a leader.

Within 2-3yrs we'll have 3-4b people who will be able to use a digital version of their native, local currency. And they'll need a digital wallet to hold that money. And that same digital wallet may be able to hold bitcoin (some digital wallets will be compatible with both bitcoin and eUSD (and eEuro and eRNB and Libra. Some wallets won't. but overall I expect we'll see 50x+ growth in the number of people who can access bitcoin with one-click))

Big picture: As digital assets become the norm, the potential user base for bitcoin will explode 50-100x over the next 3-5yrs. 

(2) The infrastructure in the US and internationally is massively better than it was in 2017. If there's a new bubble, the new users can be onboarded to fully legit services more quickly than ever before. All the existing crypto companies have made huge investments/improvements. And new companies from the traditional finance space are coming on board: Fidelity alone is huge - they essentially have a product that is ready to roll out to their entire user base. It's just a matter of flipping a switch. And then there's Robinhood and Square and those types, those companies love BTC. The potential to serve the FOMO is greater than ever. 

(3) (get your pitchforks ready) I believe that at least a few other coins are going to show some real world traction in the next 6-12mos. Real world use cases, finally. I've even started to get excited about Ethereum again. This move to proof of stake could be a big deal for the entire crypto-ecosystem. If they can get it live in early 2020, I could see ETH going to $500. The staking model is super interesting to me bcs people who stake ETH will get paid for their participation in the system - 4.6 to 10.2% interest (annualized). That's real money. Absolutely crushes a savings account. and in a bull market that's a damn potent combo. Raw returns plus the staking returns. Combined that w/ bitcoin's pre-halving FOMO and things could get silly.

(4) Bitcoin can bubble like a mofo. Look at today. 15% move in 6hrs. Do you remember that stretch in the second half of 2017, good lord, it went _way_ beyond what almost anyone thought was possible. This market can be so tight/illiquid at times, especially when we're mooning - more and more fiat chasing a tightening supply of BTC. If we get into that kind of parabolic price movement we could see those face-melting gains, perhaps taking us to the $100k range. Maybe only a 10-15% chance of that happening, but risk adjusted I still think bitcoin is the best investment out there.  

That's my take.

 Bunch of 4channers tried to force it as /ourcoin/ back last month during the presale ico phase of chainlink there was a minimum requirement of 300eth to enter the presale. Bunch of anons pooled up together and shared presale links to fill them with their eth.

Coin continued to get shilled and pumped up and hyped for the sibios event that link was attended, whole event turned out to be a flop chainlink had a presentation in a room of like 18 people next to the public toilets, literally no news or partnership came from the event and the coin dumped back to below ico prices and created 1000's of bagholder anons.

Now during this alt bull run lots of anons and took advantage of this and shilling this coin to all the new money and newfags that joined in december and don't know this story.

The coin is HEAVILY manipulated and the supply is dried up from huge whales who accumulated below ICO price to create a artificially lower supply (a lot like REQ) and these people have so much room to dump on all of you faggots to still be in profit when the time comes.

In regards to actual project that chainlink aiming to achieve it's nothing more than a basic json parser for smart contracts, would take like a day to add to ethereum by itself.. literally making links whole concept pointless and definitely no need for a token. Would take a lot longer to get it working with bitcoin but the bitcoin core devs would be able to work out the solution a lot quicker than chainlink will, think that's something worth noting that literally nothing is completed and you're literally just buying a whitepaper, they have only 2 developers and they don't communicate at all with no proven background on either, in fact sergey was involved in a project before chainlink called NxT that he since been abandoned until it was took over by a new developer team",2019-10-26 05:13:30

What's concerning is not just the fact that this address is dominating in terms of % of blocks found/won, it is also finding blocks at an absurd rate.

Between 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. UTC today, this entity found 24 (TWENTY FOUR) blocks. That's absurd.

$BCH has a different retargeting algorithm than $BTC (diff formula), but they are both still designed to manufacture adjusting difficulties that target a consistent 10-minute block time.

Thus, on average, there should be 6 blocks/hour found.

However, with this entity finding 24 blocks in a 2-hour time span, it is not only beating out the entire network, its pretty much 'broken' the retargeting algorithm for $BCH. This is not good.

Attached is the documentation on diff retarg. for $BCH

Checking http://coin.dance, we can see that this entity (going as 'unknown' since they aren't signing any blocks) has won the last 8/14 blocks.

Between this entity &amp; http://BTC.top, no one else has won a block on the protocol (besides BTCC) since block 606283

There's nothing that they can realistically do about the situation since its out of their hands.

f5bxv2y,quentech,3,"Well, yesterday sure was exciting, and if you weren't already thinking it, like /u/diydude2, lends some credence to the idea that prices below $10k since Sept have largely been bearish-leaning traders hoping and pushing against accumulation of available spot supply.

2+ years ago we'd see those mismatches play out on much faster timelines. It seems Wall Street products like CME's and Baakt's may have had some effect lengthening the time lines for things to play out (of course, that can also be due to it having been a bear market and low interest in crypto).

What Wall Street products have not done is contain the pressure that builds when people are accumulating Bitcoin. It may have even allowed the market to wind itself up tighter - and while I think that is true in both directions, I also think, as always, Bitcoin goes up much more easily than it goes down - and that may be the fuel that enables a 6-figure BTC explosion.

I think we'll bounce around sideways for a while now, with more room above than below - I could see going back over 10k while bouncing, and I think the chance we'll bounce back below the 200 DMA a bit is good - Bitcoin likes to dance around important MA's and fib's while consolidating on where to go next - that's where I'll accumulate some more, just under $9k. Hope I don't miss it.

I don't have a good guess for how long sideways would go, could be a few weeks, but much longer and holidays and EOY have historically been rough on the price - but I think the pressure will be building again and result in another strong, decisive move up past $11k.

I don't know what $11k-14k will look like, but it's a short trip from $14k to $17k+. I imagine $17k-20k will be violent and the market will recoil from it hard a couple times. $20k will fall next year, and I doubt I need to elaborate on what happens when we start closing over $20k.",2019-10-27 07:05:51
f5bt8ue,Lisfin,2,"&gt; October 23, 2019: System Administrator running one of the largest LN  node (LIGHTNING-CASINO.COM) loses 4 BTC using Lightning Network [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dlvokv/how\_i\_lost\_4\_btc\_on\_lightning\_network/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dlvokv/how_i_lost_4_btc_on_lightning_network/) 

This was not a bug and worked exactly like it should of. He closed the channel using a outdated contract, thus tried to ""cheat"" people out of money with a older state. Currently the way LN is setup means if you do this, the channel will close because you are trying to ""cheat"" the system, and all the money is sent to the other party. He was suppose to get the new state from the channel or close it and wait for his funds to unlock, he used a old state instead.

However, things like this need to be much safer and easier to use if we plan on normal people using it. Currently there is too much risk IMO, hopefully some of this stuff will be solved in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; October 21, 2019:  Research paper titled “Hijacking Routes in Payment  Networks” uncovers attack that could DDoS Lightning Payments and halt  all payments. Cost for such an attack is less than $2000.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06890](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06890) 

This is kinda misleading. This is all theory based on having several centralized nodes for the attacker. The attacker would need to open many channels to become a centralized node, if people realized the node is DDoSing the network, people with channels connected to it can start to force close the channels with the attacker, locking a amount of funds they and the attacker have in the contract for X amount of time. If enough people close the channel with the attackers node, most of the liquidity of their channel will be locked up for X amount of time and he will also not be as centralized, thus mitigating the attack.

Yes in theory its possible. So are a lot of things that have never happened in the real world.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; September 28, 2019: Andreas Brekken who ran LN node accounting for more  than half of LN's capacity takes his nodes down and documents his  experience.

This has nothing to do with bugs or exploits. A guy who ran a node shutdown his node, how is this a exploit or bug?  He closed most of the channels that were online...like it was suppose to happen. And than he force closed the channels that were offline...like it was suppose to happen. What part did I miss that was the exploit or bug?

&gt;  
&gt;September  10, 2019: Lightning Network dev: ""We've confirmed instances of the CVE  being exploited in the wild. If you’re not on the following versions of  either of these implementations then you need to upgrade now to avoid  risk of funds loss"" [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-September/002148.html](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-September/002148.html)

&gt;August  30, 2019: Lightning Network security alert: Security issues have been  found in various lightning projects which could cause loss of funds! [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-August/002130.html](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-August/002130.html)

This is why they have such a big warning when using LN to not put large amounts of money into the network, its still in **BETA** and has bugs still. Yes this is terrible to have happen, but what do you expect from software that is in development and warns you clearly THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE FUNDS(CLICK OK TO CONTINUE)? All these problems have been fixed already, and I am sure there will be more. That is what you get when using BETA software. Don't use it yet, its not ready and has risks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; March 28, 2019: Peter Rizun publishes paper explaining LN payments  aren’t actually “trustless” at all, and routing nodes can lose customer  funds. [https://medium.com/@peter\_r/visualizing-htlcs-and-the-lightning-networks-dirty-little-secret-cb9b5773a0](https://medium.com/@peter_r/visualizing-htlcs-and-the-lightning-networks-dirty-little-secret-cb9b5773a0)   
&gt;  
&gt;"" Here’s the problem: if the value-in-flight **is below the BTC dust threshold**, then it **cannot be represented as a third output** in the  channel-state transaction! It is thus not possible to use hash- and  time-locks to protect the payment if the payment is too small. ""

Seems like a simple fix, don't allow transactions that ""cannot be represented as a third output"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; February 28, 2019: ""Out of the 1,500 orders submitted on the first day  \[using Lightning Network\], only around 10 percent were successful"" [https://breakermag.com/i-ordered-lightning-pizza-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale/](https://breakermag.com/i-ordered-lightning-pizza-and-lived-to-tell-the-tale/) 

And if you read the article it does not say it was because of LN that it failed so much. And in fact the first fail that is talked about was because he didn't add funds to his wallet first.

&gt; I clicked the payment option and  attempted to use the QR code generated by LN.pizza to complete the  payment. It failed again. **This one was on me**. In my focus on purchasing  bitcoin, I hadn’t transfer it from the bitcoin wallet to the separate  Lightning wallet. So I did that, and then attempted to re-submit an  order for a cheese pizza and garlic knots.  

How many other people made mistakes also? Yes its a new tech, and its very complicated right now, maybe this is why it failed so many times? It was never attributed to LN in this article. 

What did the company say about the LN pizza test?

&gt;Fold says its Bitcoin ""Lightning Pizza"" test **was a success**

But go ahead and spin the story as if Lightning Network was the main cause of all the failures even tho it was never attributed to that and ignore the fact they called it a success.

&gt; March 21, 2018: Lightning Network DDoS Sends 20% of Nodes Down [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\_Network#2018\_DDoS\_attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network#2018_DDoS_attacks)   
&gt;  
&gt;""The exploit used as many node connections as possible to prevent any new connections.""

The last one is about DDoS attacks because too many connections. This is not a software problem, if a botnet wants to create 100K connections to your node, how is this LNs fault? You can either limit the max connections, in this case it would not help the DDoS, or increase the max connections, however with a botnet attacking your node, you might not be able to handle all the incoming connections thus taking your node down.

&amp;#x200B;

LN has along way to go still if its to be proven useful, and honestly might not even be the solution people want. However a lot of the stuff posted here are spun in such a way to make it look even worse that it is. Its currently in beta, and has been proven to work, so most of these problems might not even exist when its complete (18 months right?).

BCH has it's merits and drawbacks, and so does BSV. to be honest I almost quit after the SV fork. while I made what i think is a lot of money (on paper) predicting the price crash, the exchange that held my fiat went bankrupt taking with it $200M of investors funds.

Announcement from China and then the entire market, mainly Bitcoin with everything kind of following, goes crazy for a day or two. Now that has kind of calmed down a little the Chinese coins, which are most tied to the announcement, start to see some good progress.

I saw a tweet in this daily showing WeChat searches from Blockchain and Bitcoin have grow significantly in the last few days. The announcement by China's president was basically free advertising and exposure. I am curious to see what happens in about 6 hours when Monday morning starts to kick off in China. I would think if your president endorses blockchain and you as a citizen wanted to buy in you would support your local Chinese coins over the US or other coins.  Also the current 9 million Blockchain searches on WeChat is a very small fraction of the 1 Billion+ WeChat users.  Exposure to China and  its citizens is big for these projects.

As far as VeChain specifically the Mainnet and transactions are still my main focus. The advertising and exposure from China is just a bonus.  

I should also mention the VIP191 address I have been talking about added another 26 million VTHO last Thursday the 24th. That means since Sunday 10/20 They have added 76 Million VTHO and have a current balance of 41.7 Million VTHO. I don't expect the steady VIP191 clauses to slow down anytime soon.

f5jr8jk,Xenoflower7,5,"Seorang hacker berinisial BBA (21) ditangkap akibat aksinya meretas server sebuah perusahaan di San Antonio, Texas, Amerika Serikat. BBA berhasil ditangkap oleh Direktorat Tindak Pidana Siber Bareskrim Polri di kediamannya Sleman, Yogyakarta pada Jumat (18/10/2019). ""Ditangkap lagi main komputer di rumahnya di Sleman, Yogyakarta,"" ujar Kepala Subdit II Direktorat Tindak Pidana Siber Bareskrim Polri, Kombes Rickynaldo Chairul saat dihubungi Kompas.com, Sabtu (26/10/2019). 

Adapun barang bukti yang diamankan meliputi, laptop jinjing, dua unit ponsel, identitas pribadi, satu kartu ATM BNI, satu unit rakitan CPU, dan sebuah moge. Modus ransomware Berdasarkan keterangan dari kepolisian, peretasan tersebut dilakukan dengan modus serangan program jahat (virus komputer) jenis ransomware. 

BBA membeli ransomware atau malware yang mampu mengambil alih kendali, yang berisi Cryptolocker di pasar gelap internet atau dark web. Kemudian, ransomware tersebut dikirimkan secara luas ke lebih dari 500 alamat email di luar negeri. Salah satu korban yang menerima email tersebut adalah perusahaan di San Antonio, Texas, AS. Sementara, ketika korban membuka email tersebut, maka software perusahaan akan terenkripsi. Hal inilah yang menjadikan kesempatan BBA untuk meminta uang tebusan kepada korban. 

Sebab, jika tidak diberikan uang tebusan dalam waktu tertentu, maka sistem perusahaan itu akan lumpuh. ""Saat semua sistemnya sudah bisa diambil alih oleh pelaku, maka muncul pemberitahuan di layar, apabila Anda ingin menghidupkan kembali server Anda, maka saya kasih waktu 3 hari untuk membayar,"" ujar Rickynaldo seperti diberitakan Kompas.com, Jumat (25/10/2019). ""Kalau misalnya tidak bisa membayar, maka yang bersangkutan atau pelaku akan mematikan seluruh sistemnya,"" kata dia.

f5gx7i4,Qwahzi,5,"There is no direct-fee incentive, but that's not the same as no incentive. Nano actually has many strong financial incentives: Loss aversion, cost cutting, and profit maximization are all strong incentives that apply to the Nano network. We already have a number of nodes from businesses that are incentivized to do so (Binance, Wirex, Kucoin, Kappture, BrainBlocks, etc).

The cost of consensus in Nano is so low that the benefits of the network itself are all the incentive you need. Whales and businesses that benefit from Nano (e.g. exchanges, merchant payments, etc) will run nodes to protect their investment and secure the network. Similar to TCP/IP, email servers, and http servers. Just like Bitcoin full nodes.

Another benefit of Nano's consensus mechanism is that it does not lead to emergent centralization over time. In other cryptocurrencies with mining or fees (including traditional PoS coins), profit maximization and economies of scale lead to centralization over time. Nano doesn't have that problem, and you can see for yourself as it continues to get more decentralized over time (scroll down to the vote weight distribution chart and play with the time period): https://nanocharts.info/

As for scaling, remember that even just 50 TPS (which Nano can comfortably do) is over 4 million transactions per day. PayPal had almost 100 million users before it was doing ~5 million transactions per day in 2011.

BCH's means of security is to always rely on bitmain and [BTC.TOP](https://BTC.TOP) to move hash power off Bitcoin to BCH to protect it from attacks. How is that a logical way to exist long term. Living like an appendage.

Look at the miners like building security guards. Bitcoin is who they rely on for a stable paycheck. Every once in a while their friend Roger Ver says ""*Hey please stop by my business that has no security, think there's a break in, thx bro*""..

f5jaj5y,Ceelic,5,"I am kicking myself for not buying at least a little more in the sub 7k region. I am fairly new to bitcoin and when we tanked at the end of September, I thought we were going to bounce back up shortly after because I couldn't see why people wouldn't be buying that shit up. Thus, I FOMO'd in a few grand and threw that pile into a Trezor to HODL. I was sweating a bit when we went even lower than what I anticipated but eventually I accepted that I might lose a significant portion of what I put in at least temporarily. If you had told me last Friday morning that we were going to see a wick to 10.5k I would've called you delusional. If we have a correction soon, which we should IMO if we want to keep healthy PA, I'm going to be looking to add to my pile. Its also possible that this was the ""standard"" correction before the halving as we've seen in the past, and we aren't going to see those levels again that we saw earlier this month. I remain skeptical of what kind of price we're going to see at the peak of the next/current bull market. I think we'll see a smaller peak than what we're expecting if I'm going to be honest.

f5gu322,bryanwag,5,"That’s not true. 75% is the number throwing around by Coinshares with significant conflict of interests. 

First they don’t know where miners are located so they just assumed the small sample of miners that answered their survey represents the geographical locations of all miners. That means they most likely missed lots of Chinese miners in remote rural areas who might use cheap coal. 

Second, they conveniently assumed that every miner in Sichuan uses 100% hydro power all the time. In reality, Sichuan miners relying on hydro power during the wet season usually migrate to Inner Mongolia or Xinjiang for the cheap coal power during the dry season, as hydro gets more expensive than coal during the dry season. 

In summary, 75% is a gross overestimation of renewable energy usage in Bitcoin mining. All the coal-burning Inner Mongolian and Xinjiang miners also contribute a ton of carbon footprint regardless of renewable energy use in mining in other parts of the world.",2019-10-28 02:25:25

f5o1s7z,Academic_Crypto,26,"I don't have too many good insights about the market right now, and I haven't had a position since 7750 where the looming threat a of a long squeeze was essentially not a risk and I closed my shorts. Bitcoin at the moment feels more like gambling then investing, effectively killing my edge so I am patiently waiting for emotion to die down before I begin to take positions again.

The price action in the last few days has essentially two contributing factors, the first being spot buying with Tether / OTC on the predominately Chinese exchanges (Binance BTC/USDT, Okex BTC/USDT and monthly futures, Huobi BTC/USDT). The second factor was a large short-squeeze on BitMEX that took the open interest from 109k BTC down to about 60k and cleared out roughly 70% of the shorts that were present at $7,400.

The price action on the the key exchanges I mentioned is really leading the market, and so for any of you who are day-trading this on short time-frames (&lt;= 15min charts) there really isn't any value in looking at the trades or orderbooks on CBP / Kraken / Binance US / whatever.

Additionally, since the peak at $10,400 it is clear that the price action is being designed to create retail FOMO through 2 techniques. The first technique is to pump Chinese alt-coins, since generally only retail cares about these and it is inexpensive to do so. The second technique is to defend ascending parabolas on BTC/USDT on very short (3 minute) time frames. If you look at the charts on Binance or Okex using 3 or 15 minute candles you will notice that almost all of the price action in the past few days can be described as a bunch of parabolas on very short time frames. The price will curl upwards for 2 hours, dump $250 in 15 minutes and then immediately form a new parabola from the base of the dump, etc. The upper-side of the parabolas look pretty messy but the bottoms are generally pretty clean where they are well-defended. There are a few attempts to puncture through these and are generally met with a high-volume green candle with a long wick where the defense takes place.

I would recommend against getting married to any sort of TA in this area, the market is not normal and your ideas for indicators that historically work on stable markets need not apply here. I would also not worry too much about sentiment, what some people on an English speaking forum think about the price of Bitcoin has very little to do with what a market that is being led by China.

Historically, China (and really most of Asia) loves a good pump and dump. They don't have the same apprehension to buying stocks / assets that just doubled that the west does. Look at how Chinese retail jumps on BSV after an article came out announcing Craig Wright is Satoshi. Also keep in mind that almost everyone who is rich in China is new money. China's A-shares that have anything to do with cryptocurrency all hit their maximum allowed gains yesterday. When China launched their ""Star Market"" this past summer, in first two days hundreds of companies had 100%+ gains and their tickers were looking like CoinMarketCap in December 2017. Due to their more strict communist past (pre-1980s) they don't really have old money, and new money generally enjoys these kinds of risky investments.  Also keep in mind that China trends hard in both directions, just as fast as they pump a stock or asset they will also dump it.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** This was just a long way of saying that in my opinion, the market right now is a knee-jerk reaction to China news, the price action right now looks very emotional, and I believe is being engineered on short time frames to create retail FOMO. Could go up, could go down, its really hard to tell with China and I personally have no interest in trading it until things cool down. My advice is to not try and apply most TA and to not underestimate the power of China in both directions.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I didn't mention anything about long-term because in my opinion, the events of the last few days don't change anything about the big picture. If you are bullish and calling for 100k Bitcoin in 5 years then you should continue to feel that way, and if you feel this eventually goes to 0 then this should not change that. This sort of price action is fun, and numbers being higher can be used to make the case that Bitcoin has value. Keep in mind however that to the skeptics and nay-sayers, being pumped 40% in a day, and taking on a narrative of a China-endorsed asset probably only makes things seem worse.",2019-10-29 09:15:32

-	Some people think any criticism of Bitcoin is a backhanded endorsement of “alts” or an attack on Bitcoin purists’ ideals.

Also, uncertainty is extremely painful for some people.

-	Although people don’t like to admit it, the entire blockchain space is still so new that no one truly knows what it will be tomorrow. At best, we can guess.

If tether starts to crack, the value of a tether will obviously drop below $1, and people will rush to sell, which will only further drop the price.

But what will they sell tether for?  They won't be given dollars.  They will exchange their tether for Bitcoin.

This is why I don't understand why people think when tether collapses, it will drag the entire market down.  People will be exiting their tether position *into* Bitcoin, which will put upward price pressure on Bitcoin.

The losers will be those who own tether, and those who leave their crypto balances on Bitfinex.  But if you own bitcoin in your own wallet where you (and only you) control the private keys, you can't really get hurt from this.

f5pm2xg,UpDown,1,"My framework for properties of nonproductive assets to become investable: 

1) Nondepreciating. It must not lose quality over time. 

2) Declining supply. Some of the assets are destroyed with time by users consuming or losing them.

3) Easily transferable/tradable

4) Low to zero storage cost.


Whisky does pretty well at this, especially on points 1 and 2. It seems whisky actually improve in quality (due to vintage) with time, but it also has declining supply as people drink or destroy the supply. It is weak on 3 and 4. 

Compared to bitcoin, bitcoin meets all 4 really well. Bitcoin appreciates in quality with time as more open source software development permanently adds to its utility/value. It has declining supply as people lose coins (though not as quickly as whisky I imagine), and it is strong in 3 and 4 for obvious reasons.",2019-10-30 00:23:38

The original comment's content was as follows:

&gt; According to state media, China should embrace blockchain tech however they shouldn’t speculate on digital assets like [cryptocurrencies](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/10/bitcoin-btc-ready-to-begin-its-long-awaited-downtrend), specifically, [Bitcoin](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/10/etf-proposal-sec-will-it-through).
&gt; 
&gt; Reports surfaced today from Reuters stating quotes from the local news outlet, The People’s Daily, which says that the previously-announced support for blockchain should not be read into as support for the digital asset.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s worth noting that the local publication is under the direct control of the ruling political power of the Communist Party of China.
&gt; 
&gt; The outlet states:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;*“Blockchain’s future is here but we must remain rational. The rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies.”*",2019-10-30 00:18:38

f5ptgnf,e346e,1,"&gt; National tender. Everything you and everyone else would use your national currency for.

By definition then, this can only be fiats. Too rigid. You may as well just say ""fiats"" because using the term ""currency"" provides no further clarification or meaning.

&gt; People don't buy things with shares, or gold, or futures, or bonds.

They don't today, but they did, and will again. Gold, isn't a currency today in US, but it could be it's just less convenient. I stand by the fact that BTC is a currency today, it's just a small minority are using it as such. But they can and do and it is only a matter of time when it's mainstream. But the fact that it isn't mainstream or ""national tender"" doesn't make it any less a currency. By this logic I would contend that gold IS a currency, it's just not a very popular one and there is no good reason for it to re-popularize as one. But it could. BTC, there is GREAT reason for it to be popularized as a currency and it WILL. No less, it IS a currency today.

&gt; They want to borrow money to build a new factory somewhere, that 10% in 30 mins makes the new issue impossible.

Agreed. Today, a company holding BTC as a currency does not make sense.

&gt; The public and industry will never choose a currency that is more unstable than what they currently use.

Agreed. But stability will come to BTC. A slow, steady, predictable increase in value relative to other currencies and assets will be the norm for BTC.

&gt; It doesn't make logical or economic sense to use an investment asset as a currency.

Right. BTC will evolve away from being an investment asset toward a currency. It's primarily an investment asset today because it has such astronomical potential. As that potential is realized, its investment potential reduces and it's market share as a currency increases. This will take time for the market to sort out.

&gt; Imagine buying a house with Bitcoin.

I often do. My guess is a house probably has been bought / sold for BTC. While this might not be advisable for your average person and may not be maximally efficient today doesn't mean it won't be.

End of story for me is, BTC is a currency, plain and simple. It has potential to be a very good and efficient currency. No, for most things it is not optimally efficient to use BTC as a currency instead of something else.",2019-10-30 01:43:16
f5ptlvq,gizram84,1,"&gt;  If enough start to panic and run for the exits...

But how will these people even manage to sell their Bitcoin?  What exits?  They are using exchanges with USDt because that's what they have available.  If they were able to use real fiat from the start, they would be using those exchanges already, and USDt wouldn't really be a thing.

You're acting as if when tether goes down, people will be able to withdraw Bitcoin from Bitfinex (and other exchanges), which isn't a guarantee.  Then they'll open up a new account on an exchange that deals in real fiat (like Coinbase).  Then they'll dump their Bitcoin.

That seems extremely convoluted and time consuming.  If this isn't what you're saying, then please explain how these people will manage to sell their Bitcoin, and what will they be selling it for?",2019-10-30 01:44:48

Bitcoin mixers cut you some slack here. You really only need one leveled mixer until way way way way later in the game.

f5ud107,Metalsludge,2,"I visited the Bitcoin markets subreddit, and was surprised to see mostly negativity, despite things being up overall on the year. Not sure what people expect of this space but, yeah, there's evidently some pretty negative sentiment of late. 

I think people should take more of a be out during dips, but then buy when it's low perspective, as opposed to expecting only upward movements. But people sound too frustrated to even try trading lately. 

I can't completely blame them though. This is a super volatile market that could drive normal investors crazy. I suppose that, if you only stayed home all day and stared at charts, you could hit good moves more often than not. But most of us still work for a living at demanding jobs, and having one eye on the charts all the time just isn't realistic.

I see some YouTube TA people brag about making quick scalps in the middle of the day, and I'm like - well, yeah, I could too, if that's all that I did all day and market volatility remained about the same. And things like that super pump and dump just yesterday must shake out a lot of people trying to do leverage trading. 

That said, it's not impossible to do mostly good trades. But you also have to be ready for the major moves, which can be capricious in crypto. That leaves just us crazy people still here.",2019-10-31 06:38:44

f5v9j3s,Septem_151,1,"Bitcoin = A decentralized **network** of computers all running software that complies with the rules of what we -- the users and developers -- have decided should be valid. The most common Bitcoin software is the original client called Bitcoin Core, but any software that complies with the guidelines set in place may operate with the Bitcoin network.

Another useful term will be ""UTXO"" or ""Coin"", which simply means an **Unspent Transaction Output**. A UTXO consists of a recipient (usually the hash of a public key, or the hash of a *script*), an amount (of Bitcoin), and a script that must be satisfied to unlock/spend the UTXO. This is the ""ledger entry"". Transactions involve ""spending"" these UTXOs by providing the correct **signature** (you can think of this as a password, but in reality is created by the private key to the public key of the UTXO) and creating new UTXOs with their own unlocking scripts.

1. Bob broadcasts a Transaction to the network. This transaction contains a few pieces of information:
	- A reference to existing UTXOs that Bob wants to *spend* (INPUTS)
	- Signatures for spending those UTXOs
	- New UTXOs for where Bob wants the Bitcoin to go (OUTPUTS)

2. Other computers pick up this transaction and begin to verify it. To verify the transaction, they do the following:
	- Check that the UTXOs being spent actually exist
	- Check that the Signatures satisfy the UTXOs unlocking scripts
	- Check that the amount of all Outputs is less than or equal to the amount of all Inputs
	
3. When the Transaction is verified, the computer verifying adds it to a ""mempool"" -- collection of verified transactions that it is aware of, but aren't included in a Block yet. The computer then broadcasts the transaction to other computers until all (or most of) the computers have heard of the transaction. IF THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT VERIFY, the computer simply discards it and doesn't broadcast it any further.

4. Miners all the while are gathering information about transactions in the network via their own mempool, and are constantly adding transactions from their mempool to potential Blocks until they find a valid Block. Then the Miner's computer broadcasts this Block to every other computer.

5. Every other computer validates the Block, and rejects/ignores the block if it is not valid. If the Block is valid, the computer iterates through each transaction in the block and if it's present in their mempool, it is removed. And the cycle continues.",2019-10-31 10:32:59
f5v9b13,ArticMine,1,"&gt; Also, around 46:00 in the video Kevin basically says that they now want to know the customer of your customer. This defeats the copypasta spread by the XMR community that KYC is all they want. They want KTCOYC meaning no privacy coins are allowed without backdoors. Their reasoning being that they don't know if Kim Jung Un is on the other end of that transaction. Essentially they want to remove the feature of cash where the bank knows you but doesn't know what you do with your money when you leave the bank.

This is simply not true. What the travel rule says and what FinCEN needs to know is that when an exchange sends Monero or for that matter Bitcoin to an address who actually owns that address. A exchange can be compliant by simply requiring that a withdrawal address be under the control of their customer. This can be done cryptographically by proving ownership of the address and also in the case of Monero the exchange can make one or more micro transactions to the Monero address and require the customer to tell the exchange that transaction amounts in order to link the address. This is a practice that is commonly done in the United States for linking bank accounts for the same compliance reasons. In the latter case this can be done with Monero because of the privacy of Monero. It would not work with Bitcoin for example. 

On the deposit side the exchange can again require that the customer prove that they sent the funds which again can be done cryptographically on the Monero blockchain. 

A common mistake here is to apply the compliance requirements of and exchange with those of a hosted wallet. An exchange can operate in compliance by ensuring that deposits and withdrawals come only from their customers just as a bank that is dealing with cash deposits and withdrawals.

Edit: If Kim Jung Un creates a brand new Bitcoin address no amount of blockchain analytics will tell you he actually controls it.",2019-10-31 10:31:32
