ecy4nzl,headpsu,54,"part of why you're getting downvoted is because it's now assume that you have vast sums of money, and Reddit hates the filthy Rich. You're also being downvoted because you're not being honest and open in an ama. the downvotes would be mitigated by being honest, as people really do want to know what the financial picture looks like to be able to quit a good job and pursue a dream. This answer is correct, but people are asking exactly what you were experience was. People aren't asking how your money stacks up against money in Kansas City, people are looking for an answer like: 

I had been making $250,000 a year and saved a little over a year salary. I added to that by selling one of my hot rods for another 50K. this may seem like an extraordinary amount of money, but I live in the Bay area and my rent is $2,700 a month. After calculating my expenses and cutting back on some luxuries, I figured I needed to have almost 300K to continue to live my current lifestyle while pursuing my dream.

What you said is correct. Money is relative to location. The people want to know what it took. Did you have to leave the Bay area to continue pursuing your dream and move to Kansas City to make your money stretch? were you able to save enough beforehand, and plan well enough to stay where you were and continue living your current lifestyle? Those types of things are pertinent to the story and are certainly acceptable questions when you tell people to literally ""ask you anything"". Nobody asked you for your Bitcoin wallet password, or a PDF of your current investment portfolio.

If you're embarrassed to talk about the financial aspect, I would suggest putting that up at the top. ""Ask me anything except about finances."" Congratulations on your success and best of luck to you following your dream!",2019-01-01 00:14:49

On r/Aragon, I questioned Aragon's choice of a Bitcoin maximalist speaker who constantly dishonestly FUDs Ethereum and whose token flipping has been called into question.  The first of many results in a google search: https://breakermag.com/meltem-demirors-and-the-problem-of-skin-in-the-game/

What did they do in return?  They *censored* me and removed the post, citing nebulous rules that are a catch-call for any sort of arbitrary censorship.  Proof of Aragon censorship: https://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/comments/aasj9q/why_does_aracon_feature_an_antieth_btc_maximalist/

Power corrupts.    *Meet the New Boss.  Same as the Old Boss.*

u/lightcoin, you are worse than Twitter. I supported you when Twitter accidentally suspended you because of their bad algorithms.  But Twitter fixed their mistakes.  You purposely choose to censor dissenting viewpoints, because you don't want to own up to your mistakes as Aracon organizer.   It's hypocritical behavior, and I hope that you will see that your censorship of opposing opinions is antithetical to Bitcoin, Ethereum and Aragon values.  Please correct ASAP.

u/luisivan and u/izqui9.  Does the Aragon Manifesto mean anything to you or is it just corporate BS?   Is censorship ok?

Right now Aragon's censorship is worse than the legacy web2 systems that we seek to replace.  

(I will take screenshots of this post in case Aragon tries to have r/ethereum mods censor this post as well.  This is 100% relevant to Ethereum because Aragon is a prominent project on Ethereum, and it also speaks to what sort of values are ok in the greater Ethereum community.  I hope we can all agree that censorship is bad.)",2019-01-01 05:16:26

ecysoi4,AstarJoe,38,"It is very important that developers and team leaders like Elizabeth keep that mentality of slow and steady wins the race. Security is key. All of this shit falls apart so fast when weak foundations are laid...

That being said, having set up an LN full node and used Ya'lls for the first time to post and comment on posts using fractions of a bitcoin for practically no fee, it is apparent to me that this (Lightning) is the future. It just works so quickly and seamlessly. For practically nothing. 

To realize that the only limitation now is not governments or states, but the imagination and creativity of the *developers themselves* is mind boggling. No longer do centralized services and companies control the flow and path of innovation in and around money. We do. 

To be frank I got that same feeling that I did when I first read the Satoshi White Paper. Limitless possibilities with nothing in the way of progress. 

In a way I am a bit envious of these developers in this new space as they are like the warriors on the front lines of the biggest war to be fought with the legacy financial system. Those of us who fought actual wars used different skills sets and weapons that are now useless in this new kind of digital fight. It's almost like being a Helot peasant watching the Spartans go do battle and being unable to directly participate. 

But I'll just be content to be a peasant in this fight. Lending resources as I may to help these front line girls and guys. This is a different kind of fight with different warriors. Godspeed to them, as this is the toughest foe yet. ",2019-01-01 05:09:15

* Core was perfectly fine with big blocks UNTIL they got into bed with banks/investors via Blockstream 
* Blockstream; the organisation employing Core developers and co-founded by Core developers, received funding of at least $76 million 
* 7 of the top 10 developers of Bitcoin Core work for Blockstream and Chaincode 
* Censorship is used to manipulate consensus and the CEO of Blockstream let it slip that deploying astroturfing and shills is routine. 
* An event like Core's coup d'etat is unlikely to occur with Bitcoin Cash, as it has multiple developer teams working independently. 
* CoreStream hijacked the Bitcoin name and made Bitcoin into an altcoin because they needed to sell convoluted second layer tech to their investors. 
* CoreStream players didn't create Bitcoin (didn't even help create it). Once they pushed out the real developers they turned Bitcoin into a profitability scheme.

You can't put 4 million dollars in a safety deposit box at your bank and be insured if it get lost or stolen or breaks etc. 

You think these investors are going to put 250,000 in a safe box at 25 different banks so they are all insured.  What happens if bitcoin doubled and their 250,000 at each bank is now 500,000 and they have to go to every trezor and find another bank to place their next set of 250 000 wallets.  That's if any bank will even insure crypto which I doubt they do.  The value of insurance on multimillion dollar investments seems to be lost on you.

&gt;In the future we will add the ability to directly fund your wallet with a credit card in the browser.

&gt;(Please note that you cannot transfer BAT out of your Brave wallet. The Brave BAT wallet is unidirectional (as was the Brave Rewards Bitcoin proof-of-concept system), and its sole purpose currently is to anonymously and securely contribute to publishers of websites of your choosing.)

ed4xus3,Dezeyay,1,"That is not a solution. 384 bit curves would mean a quantum computer with 3484 qubits instead of 2330 qubits could break the signature scheme. That is not even double and postpones the problem either half a year or one year, depending which estimate you take. (Doubling of qubits every year, or every two years). It does however have the same problems as a real solution. 

I seriously doubt they give this issue the attention it should have. They should do some serious research on QC development expectations and expected timeline. Also a timeline assesment has to be made of all the works to be done on blockchain etc. The changes in the blockchain itself, the supporting systems, the exchanges, the migration of users coins. It's not simply a core framework upgrade, all aspects of the project will end up needing an upgrade. And only after the signature scheme is implemented and thouroughly tested, the supporting systems that allow the blockchain to operate will also need to be upgraded. Software wallets, hardware wallets, block explorers, mining operations, pools... anything connected to an API and more will also need a brush up of code to be compliant with the new changes. Then one or more external audits are recommendable. All nodes need to upgrade --&gt; consensus. Chances are slim due to the fact it's just a very temporary solution with the downside of bigger signature sizes and all the negative consequences. Then exchanges will also need to adapt to the new chain. And for example for a blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is going to be extra complex as they need to fully disable their old signature scheme. After that all users will need to move their coins to the new addresses to enjoy the newly upgraded protection of the new scheme. None of the lost addresses will be protected by this because nobody can move those coins.

All these steps take time. Estimates need to be made fo reach step. There's a lot of money at stake.

And then quite soon after that, they'll have to go at it again. What they will do next? Go for 512 bit curves? Same issues.

It's just patchworks. And all the period a real solution is being postponed, more addresses will be lost and it will result in a bigger percentage of lost coins vulnerable for ever.",2019-01-03 16:43:34

ed50rwg,trenescese,1,"“If You Build It, They Will Come”: An Open Letter to the Artifact Community

​

Ah, a classic test of narcissism: who is the “you” in that statement? Is it Valve? They built a game. It seems good to great to me. Artifact is certainly a better value than most of games I’ve paid $20 for in my Steam library. Still, the game is lacking features the player base sorely wants and subsequently has suffered a precipitous drop in user base. A lack of meaningful ranking system hamstrings those seeking to be Artifact professionals and turns away even casuals who just want to see how they compare.

Now, consider: is the “you”, well, you? Don’t we as a community have some role in establishing a competitive scene or ranking system? Dota and Counter-Strike are legendary in the esports scene. I played CS and DoD when they were still just HL2 mods. The competitive scene did not just get handed to us. Ranked mode wasn't even a concept that existed inside video games beyond arcade leaderboards. It took people like Clinton “Fear” Loomis, grinding away at some shitty desk for years, knowing that one day Dota was going to be a thing. It took people like Jarosław ""pashaBiceps"" Jarząbkowski giving up “regular” work, believing he could support his family by one day competing in Counter-Strike.

These kinds of people are out there in Artifact, grinding away right now. Players were putting themselves out there on Twitch on Christmas Day because they love the game and can’t get enough. I know. I’ve seen them, even talked to some of them. There are great players and personalities out there who want to compete at this game of cards we all find so irresistible. Yet, when they open the game client to do so, all they can really do is compete at how many hours they have grinded through the skill rating system, if it can be called a system. The social tab is painfully empty. It feels like a giant competition with players from all over the world and a giant venue but the organizers did not spend any time or money organizing the actual event.

We, you, need to build the community if we want to see our own great esports events and competitive scene. Liquid can’t do it if no one else is trying to do it too. We all need to get shaking and moving together if we want a deep community to thrive and be an exciting scene. Otherwise I suspect the few Artifact interest groups that exist right now will wither away while we wait for Valve to “fix” a game that is fundamentally sound.

If you are an aspiring pro, keep on playing, the work will show.

If you are a Twitch viewer/donator, consider visiting medium or small Artifact-focused streams.

If you love the game, ignore the haters. It is a brand new year, carpe diem!

I would like to take a moment to commend Stancifka for carrying on the competitive spirit of all sports by putting his money on the line. He is the greatest Artifact player right now. Do you think you are better than him? Prove it, go take his money.

I got into bitcoin a little over two years ago, sub $1k, continued to grow my holdings throughout the great peak of 2017, diversified a minority of those holdings into a couple of alts that share bitcoin's principals, but have never cashed out to fiat.

I guess I was one of the lucky ones. The true meaning of what Bitcoin represents to the world was obvious to me right away. Despite being relatively new to Bitcoin at the time, I never once considered cashing out. It's actually hard for me to relate to those who see Bitcoin strictly as a fiat investment. I've never regretted not selling during the 2017 peak. Even $20k is cheap for bitcoin over the long term.

ed5mk3n,AdamSC1,1,"&gt;Because if you believe in cryptocurrencies, and if you believe that more demand will come from usage instead of speculation, then I think you will see that Kin is already in the lead.

I think this is a fallacy.

Kin's most active users are those in this subreddit. They are here, passionate and engaged purely because of speculation. That can be either speculation of the rising price (which it is for most of them) or speculation of the success of the vision.

Kik, P365, and Nearby and Vent has some portion of their userbase spending Kin, who aren't Kin investors. But, that segment is likely small.

Consider that the Reddit community for Kin is 11,000+ people, with 2500 active at any given time, and the Telegram community is 7300 people most of which are in the investor category. They dog food the products they invest in and yet most Kin integrated apps have far less MAS than this investor class.

So in terms of mainstream consumers actually using Kin, there are likely somewhere in the bracket of 30,000 unique monthly spenders driven by Kik and P365. The rest are speculators using the products.

So I do not buy the premise that Kin is ""in the lead"" in terms of real demand. Projects like Ethereum DApps, WAX, SteemIt, Bunz and Sweatcoin are more competitive in this regard and I'm sure there are others I could dig up.


&gt;But if you believe that real demand could one day outstrip speculative demand, then the logic looks like this:

&gt;The most in demand cryptocurrency in the world will be the most bought cryptocurrency in the world
&gt;The most bought cryptocurrency in the world will be the most spent cryptocurrency in the world
&gt;These are the most spent cryptocurrencies in the world today, and these are their rates of growth

This seems to have some additional fallacies:

1. The most bought cryptocurrency does not have to be the most spent, this is a fallacy of association. A collectable NFT, a membership based token, or an identity service token could easily become the most bought and have very little spend case.

2. The idea that the trajectory of the current most spent cryptocurrencies would be related to Kin's trajectory is a fallacy of composition. There are so many variables within the market that aren't accounted for here. Technically either Bitcoin or Ethereum are the most spent historically as they are the only ones that supported payment processors for years. Nothing has followed that trajectory.

3. There doesn't seem to be a value in knowing other most spent currencies in your category. If you were making a specific product, like a car, it would be good to know what other car manufacturers are doing. But, Kin as a cryptocurrency is akin to the dollar. Your product is ultimately mobile monetization SDKs. Car manufacturers don't worry what other people are doing with the dollar.

4. The Kin Blockchain has built in mechanisms via both the memo field and and the SDK API calls. This creates a perfect feedback loop of if users are spending Kin or not. If you had 100M users spending Kin, then Kin's ecosystem would be immensely valuable even if other ecosystems also had hundreds of millions of users spending their coins. Especially given the immense diversity of use cases for cryptocurrency.

5. Kin's competitor research seems limited to vanity metrics, and not product feature sets. If it was research on retention, conversion and churn, and trying to learn from these product use cases I could understand. But right now, the metrics you are looking at don't seem to have applicable use cases.

We had the metrics conversation a year ago, I'll restate, the only thing that matters is metrics that define how satisfied all your stakeholders are:

1. Internal to our own ecosystem how many users earn the coin. (Is it rising?)
2. Internal to our own ecosystem how many users spend the coin. (Is it rising?)
3. What is the delta between our ecosystem earn and spend rates. (Are we closing this gap?)
4. What is our retention rate, of active wallets (Is it rising?)
5. Are users satisfied with their purchase of Kin? (Likert Scale 1-5)
6. Are users likely to purchase Kin again? (Likert Scale 1-5)
7. Are users likely to tell a friend about Kin? (Likert Scale 1-5)
8. How frequently to users experience bugs or frustrations with Kin integrated into apps? (Likert Scale 1-5)
9. Are developers satisfied with their choice to integrate Kin? (Likert Scale 1-5)
10. Are developers satisfied with the support they receive from the Kin team? (Likert Scale 1-5) 
11. Is the Kin Community satisfied with the interactions they have with the Kin Team? (Likert Scale 1-5)
12. Is the Kin Community satisfied with their choice to buy Kin? (Likert Scale 1-5)

Kin has a unique opportunity through Kik, Kinny, Swelly et al, that it can directly ask survey questions to its audience and reward them for it.

If the metric of success is ""How much do users love our product"" then the demand rises. When users love a product, they stick with it through bugs, they advocate for it, they scream about it from the roof tops.

You can try and measure economic demand and get caught in loops of making network changes that bolster that demand, but that ignores the true customer, the people. It's so easy to forget in a business, that each of those numbers on the chart are a human being.

A great example are app devs MZI who own Game of War and Final Fantasy a New Empire. These games boast the highest number of transactions per user, and the highest LTV per user of any games in the gaming industry, and yet users hate the game and the developers. They constantly call it exploitative, the numbers are rapidly declining, and current users warn their friends not to even start the game. They focused on having the very best metrics, and they lost the humans.

I don't think Kin should focus on ""How many people are spending Kin"" but rather ""How happy are our users when spending Kin.""

That's what really matters.",2019-01-04 00:49:12

ed87lix,hapticpilot,1,"&gt; How will anyone download that blockchain?

Three things to consider:

1. SPV wallet users (which is the type of node Satoshi intended for most users of the system to be using), have completely the same experience regardless of whether the blocks of 1 MB or 1000 MB. So if 5 years from now BCH blocks are consistently 128 MB, if you're using something like BRD wallet, you wont even notice.
2. There is a technology called UTXO snapshots (and also UTXO commitments) which make it so that full node operators (including miners) do not need to download the entire history going back to the genesis block 10 years ago. Bitcoin Unlimited (a BCH node program) are working on building this tech. [bchd](https://github.com/gcash/bchd) (written by one of the OpenBazaar devs) has already implemented this technology in an early form. Note: the level of security is slightly reduced and the level of trust is slightly increased, but it's an excellent trade off if you ask me.
3. Hard drives are continuously, year after year getting bigger. I don't think we will be consistently seeing 128MB blocks on the BCH or the XMR chain any time soon. My hope is that as demand for crypto currencies increases, the hardware will stay ahead of that demand.

edcdtyo,bitsteiner,1,"What are the ""janky workarounds"", can you name them? I never heard about them and I am using Bitcoin since 2013 without losing any Satoshi. 

The Bitcoin protocol itself has never been hacked. Successful attacks were mostly social engineering attacks, especially of centralized businesses like exchanges, or computer hacks of unsafe OS. These attacks are not specific to Bitcoin, they happen with traditional banking too. 

FDIC has nothing to do with hacks, attacks or robbery. It is an insurance against the consequences of a bank run in a fractional reserve system. Bitcoin is a full reserve system, such insurance would not be needed. 

&gt;The fact that people are so scared to disclose their BTC holdings on Reddit proves how dysfunctional the whole system is still. 

That is true for any holdings, not specific to Bitcoin. I have ever heard about people boasting about their fiat holdings here. Bitcoin is a fully transparent system, you can see all the holdings on addresses. Even if you know the person behind it, it doesn't make a difference, except that you could launch a social engineering attack. But again, technology can't prevent stupidity of people and they are nothing new.",2019-01-06 09:52:20
edcduxl,filbs111,1,"At least they didn't steal the money in the account. 

If you have a coinbase account (i do), probably a good idea to move stuff out of your account. Not just on general principle. Also because their next step might be to check whether your account has passed funds to personae non grata, and then target your account. It's not hard to set up a wallet outside, and transfer your funds to it. Having your wallet address ""owned"" by the exchange is a huge liability - even if they don't steal your money, if you document the address elsewhere so others can pay you money, and money is paid in after they close your account, who gets the money? 

I'll transfer stuff out of my coinbase account shortly.

Getting money in and out of exchanges is a point of weakness. AFAIK bitcoin cashpoints exist though. ",2019-01-06 09:52:43

edce0xu,DylanKid,1,"its a weak argument, the confusing the newbies one. 
We cant help scammers, and theres no way you can stop people from forking off of bitcoin and keeping the name, or even justing creating a currency and using the name. This is decentralization. Theres at least 30+ cryptocurrencys with bitcoin in their name and any attempt to stop it happening is futile. 

What happens instead is people realise these coins are worthless. Devs leave, miners leave and investors leave, slowly but surely. The ecosystem weans out the scammers. 

ETC and ETH forked 3 years ago and no one, not even vitalik, is upset that etherum classic uses the ethereum name, or no one complains about being confused. And ETC never got weaned out because some people actual find it useful and are developing it. They see it as a contender for the most utilised ethereum chaim. Right now the same is happening with bitcoin. BSV and BCH are all trying to be the most utilised bitcoin chain. But BTD, BTG, BTP, have gotten weaned out by the ecosystem.



This is healthy competition among implementations of decentralized protocols. No one is in control of the project, if you think you can do it better, fork off, just like bitcoin core told big blockers to do. BCH forked off, and kept bitcoin in its name because its still full of bitcoin developers, bitcoin supporters, bitcoin miners and bitcoin investors.

edceweo,normal_rc,1,"**Easiest Way**: 

Just send your unsplit BCH coins from your wallet (Jaxx Wallet, Bitcoin.com Wallet, Blockchain.com Wallet, Exodus Wallet, etc) to [CoinEx.com](https://www.coinex.com), in one transaction, and they will auto-split your coins. You will then see both your BCH &amp; BSV coins on CoinEx, where they can be traded. After 30 confirmations (~5 hours), they can be withdrawn.

CoinEx registration is quick. They just need an email address (you don't have to give your name, address, ID, or any KYC/AML info). CoinEx is also [owned by mining giant ViaBTC](https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/12/08/viabtc-launch-bitcoin-cash-priced-crypto-exchange), so they're not going anywhere.

If you had unsplit BCH coins, then the above method should work, and you should be done.

If your BSV coins did NOT show up at CoinEx, then you'll have to manually send them over (see below).

edf8si1,SilencingNarrative,1,"If that's another way of saying ""the fact that bitcoin went from a price of 19k USD a year ago to 3-4k USD today implies that bitcoin will become worthless in the next year or so"" then I agree, but I wouldn't say that the main fallacy there is that people are mistaking stability of value for stability of price.

I think price and value are pretty closely related terms and most statements using them would mean the same thing when all you change is one word for the other.

Bitcoin has some use cases / properties the are hard to beat (uncensorability, unconfiscatability, strictly limited supply / hardness, ...).  Most people don't understand those use cases yet (and most people who have some understanding of them have a shallow understanding) which leads to price volatility.  As the public understanding grows, the price will (likely eventually) both go up from where it is now and stabilize.

If I were to attempt to define the terms value and price to make the statement ""people are mistaking the value of bitcoin for its price"", it would go like this: the value of X relates to what people can use X to do (even if most people don't yet understand those use cases), while the price of X relates to how widely understood it is that X can do those things.

edfey76,4n4n4,1,"Haha, sounds like a lot of things happened here.

So like, Bitcoin wallets really suck right now; seriously, there isn't a wallet out there that really nails it in every area. Lots of them have just fallen behind the state of Bitcoin, while the more ambitious ones (like Wasabi) are still heavily in development and thus lacking many features you'd want in a full-fledged wallet. Your problems sound like the result of butting into wallets on both ends of this spectrum and observing the conflicting information they're giving you.

So in Wasabi, mixes can only complete as frequently as there are enough people registering to them. At present, sometimes rounds will go through very quickly (within a few minutes), other times it will take hours between them. Depending on your input amount, mixes will spit out one equal-sized output for each participant, which is the coin that gains privacy from the mix, and then a change output if you queued enough to require one. If the change is large enough, it should automatically get re-queued for the next mix and just keep going until it's made as many private outputs as it's able to. It's possible that you hit a dead period after your first mix where not enough people were registering, so it appeared that your other coins were not being mixed because they were stuck waiting. That or you did it while the Wasabi backend was exploding, which is fixed now.

So with the Mycelium issues, it's probably a display issue on their end. I haven't used that wallet in a long time, but they were very slow to add Segwit support at all, so it's not surprising that they'd be behind on bech32 addresses or have weird RBF handling. Showing the wrong address type is a problematic bug that can damage your security, but it's up to the wallet devs to fix issues with that. I know from experience that Ledger had a bug (fixed in a firmware update) where sending to a single bech32 address with no change output would display a 1* address instead of a bech32 address for confirmation on the device, which made it impossible to verify that you are signing off on the transaction you actually want, so yeah, that stuff can be nasty. I think what's happening with the transactions not showing in Mycelium is that it's not displaying RBF transactions until they confirm on the blockchain, which strikes me as an odd way to handle them (just display them with an RBF flag srsly), but I think I remember it being like that even back when I used their wallet. Since Wasabi uses low fees for their mixing transactions to save on fees (and because mixing is generally a low time-preference activity), mixing transactions can get stuck when Bitcoin transaction volume spikes. Thus you end up in your situation where you've made an RBF transaction that Mycelium won't show until confirmed that relies on a parent that is going to take a while to confirm--fun, right?

Unfortunately, I don't think exists a one-size-fits-all wallet yet. Wasabi is doing great in the bleeding edge of privacy but is heavily under development and clearly lacking in wallet features. Samourai, which I have been using for mobile, is in a similar boat, doing a much better job than many wallets on keeping up with the current state of Bitcoin, but still lacks the account and HW wallet integrations you can get from Mycelium. Mycelium on the other hand has fallen behind Bitcoin and has all those weird compatibility issues with newer stuff. Maybe one day we'll have some really good Bitcoin wallets that can combine privacy with convenience and ""just work"", but sadly, that day is not today.",2019-01-07 08:34:18

Bet for 1/08/2019 – Tennis – WTA Sydney Rd 16 – Angelique Kerber v Camila Giorgi scheduled for 3:00am EST

POTD **Camila Giorgi +1.5 Sets (-128) 2.5u**

Recap: Haven’t posted on Reddit in a few days, but last POTD came through on the WTA over.

Reasoning: Giorgi opened up her 2019 play yesterday with a 6-3 6-3 win over Tomljanovic. Kerber, on the other hand, has played a few matches recently in the Hopman cup, where she finished in 2nd place with Zverev and Team Germany. These two met last year in Sydney where Giorgi went on a magnificent run into the semis, only to lose to Kerber who is the defending champion. Giorgi had her best year of her career last year, and after watching last nights match vs Tomljanovic it seems that she has only improved. She tends to match the talent level of her opponents and I would not be surprised if she won this match outright.

But it moved away from the original bitcoin in one key area. That is the state of the system is no longer maintained using a fully decentralized consensus layer due to the 10 block rolling reorg protection.  This results in weak subjectivity if a 10 block split is ever created.  This means the consensus layer is not fully decentralized and is not in the spirit of the bitcoin described in the whitepaper - follow the longest valid chain.  ( where validity constraint only includes application rules related to spending of bitcoin ).

 There is also tones of developer centralization in BCH despite there being multiple clients ( there are multiple clients for BTC as well written in other languages - but one client leads protocol development ).  In BCH it is equivalent. Because of this, i choose to pick the coin with a competent development team.

The LN has poor UX because its to complicated, but wallet makers are bypassing these issues by making custodian LN wallets ( for small amounts of spending money ). 

I think this is a valid compromise. Meanwhile BCH keep losing more of its users over political squabbles between developers. Its mining network acts like yellow bellied cucks and lacked the leaderships to resist contentious splits. ( the same would be true for BTC as well ).",2019-01-08 06:28:10

Your arguments don't go beyond ""it's complicated!""? Using it is trivial, your wallet software does the whole thing for you. And it's not that hard to understand, it's just a transaction that requires 2 (digital) signatures to be valid, one from you, one from the intermediary service.

It's the same user experience as using PayPal except safer and you can choose what software you use and your funds can't be frozen when PayPal thinks you broke their ToS that you don't even know what it includes. 

If you're not talking about user experience but the underlying system itself I've got news for you, the financial system is complicated as shit as well, even more because it's not based on one standard protocol. 

&gt;You don't even try to pretend it eleminates third parties. I can't tell if that makes you smarter than the average creepto for realising that, or if it makes you dumber for realising that and still supporting bitcoin.

Of course it doesn't eliminate third-parties for every use case, but it does for some very important ones. You have the freedom to add third-parties on top to get extra features, sometimes it'll be the same as USD (for example loans, I don't think they'd work differently) other times they'll be significantly better (like in the case of escrows like ebay/PayPal/Amazon/etc, where they don't even need to have full control of your funds to work).

a. Just the password, which is the pre-image which when hashed gives 0xeb271cbcc2340d0b0e6212903e29f22e578ff69b

This is passed to the stack, is then hashed with OP\_SHA256 (with the result added to the stack), then OP\_EQUAL returns with TRUE if the top 2 items on the stack are equal. 

That's how it should work - but the question has an error: 0xeb271cbcc2340d0b0e6212903e29f22e578ff69b is only 160 bits, and SHA256 always returns a 256 bit number (so this script is unspendable). I guess they meant to state OP\_HASH160 instead of OP\_SHA256. 

b. An 8 character password has about 10\^15 possible combinations (assuming base-64). A 10 THash/s ASIC could then brute-force all possible passwords in a few minutes. i.e. anyone with this computing power can easily determine the password (the pre-image) from just the hash output (which is public). 

c. No. Hash-locking is not the same as a signature. Once Alice has broadcast her transaction to the Bitcoin network, the scriptSig password is made public, and anyone can change the transaction output to pay themselves. The only way Alice can securely spend the output, is if she mines the block containing the spending transaction herself. ",2019-01-09 20:36:18

You could easily say ""although it's true that bitcoin is now at a price equal to or lower than that of 515 days ago, there have been peaks and valleys along way, and therefore someone who bought at a local low and sold at a local peak, or bought recently at price lower than today's price, could have profited"".   

As I noted, that's true, and equally true of Enron stock on its final run to zero.  It's always a zigzag down.

edn0w8x,glhfglhf,1,"&gt; It's a pointless system so we should stop checking the source of income or where money is flowing to and from?

No, we should not stop. But the system is too complicated that it hurts all the good actors from benefiting more of the system.

&gt;The system is comprised of people.  Some of them good and some of them bad.

This is why I am advocating for bitcoin, let me explain:

The system is expensive and powerful now because we dont trust each other. When you pay something in a shop, the cassier will get checked by the manager by the end of the day if all the cash is there. He will get checked by the regional manager or cfo, they will get checked by an accountant, those will get checked by some financial laywer and those will get checked by a bank. In the bank there are 7 more layers of people checking each-other, each time the pay check of this person increases because they hold more power over our system. 

Bitcoin is trustless, you dont need to have all these people checking eachother, and you remove the powersystem. All this money and energy can go into better things, like service. If my bank didnt fire my personal contact-person 8 years ago, they would know who I am, what my business is, and could make such a better judgement of my creditworthy or if I behave like a criminal. People are just better in these things than computers. And computers are better in checking numbers. Its silly that our system is the other way around.

Maybe you have a different personal experience, due to your localisation or just sheer luck. Bravo for that. but that doesn't make my personal experience less valid. I am not acting like a 15 year old kid, you are twisting my words and assuming things becasue you think in extremes. I dont want to bring the system down, and bad guys are bad. dont worry.

I have a need for blockchain based economy, where I can create more value for society with the same energy. And where the power is equally divided. There are many like me, just not everyone is aware yet but it will come.

2. The price of bitcoin or whatever the most valuable cryptocurrency is. This would take 1 minute.
3. I would check how my city and country are doing. 10 years is a long time to prepare. If I have to move elsewhere, I should be able to figure that out in a few minutes. I live in Canada so there's a very little reason to worry.
4. And finally, while checking #3, I'd check home prices in the area. #1 and #2 may make home prices insignificant but perhaps something of interest if I have time.

edn1b0h,DPTrumann,1,"what does making it ""simpler"" actually mean? 

From what i understand, some computations have 3 main bottlenecks - processor dependence, memory dependence and storage dependence. Processor dependent operations perform most of the calculations inside the processor. memory dependent operations are partly calculated inside the processor, but in order to complete the operation, they have to keep reading information from the computer's memory, to the point where improving the processing speed doesn't make much difference. ultimately, transfer speed between the processor and the memory has more impact. storage dependent operations are similar to memory dependent, but the information is taken from the hard drive, onto the memory and then into the processor.

An ASIC is basically a bunch of processors soldered onto a single circuit board. they can perform millions of processor dependent operations simultaneously. ASIC resistant cryptos (often referred to as memory-bound proof-of-work) increase the amount of data that needs to be created in order to solve a block to the point where the processor alone cannot solve it, forcing it to put data into the memory, e.g. litecoin requires 128kb of memory, monero requires 2mb, aeon requires 1mb ethereum requires 1gb etc.However, his doesn't always work, as some manufacturers have worked out how to ASIC litecoin and previously monero. Bitcoin uses a processor-bound proof-of-work. There is also storage-bound proof-of-work, which is basically proof-of-capacity

simply switching to SHA128 doesn't really change anything, SHA-3 is more energy efficient than SHA-256 and more secure than SHA-128. the reason ASICs dominate mining is not down to simplicity, but instead down to how one ASIC can produce as many computations as several thousand GPUs, making financially unfeasible for anything other than ASICs. Once the amount of hashpower of all people involved in mining reaches a certain level, it becomes almost impossible to mine a block on anything other than thousands of dollars of mining equipment as mining is a competitive process and the benefit of mining power of a regular computer is neglible.",2019-01-10 00:30:09

edn266x,Venij,1,"Better decentralization characteristics.  PoW benefits from economies of scale and trends toward centralization for mining.  Whether it is chip manufacturing capabilities, distribution of costs for network / server architecture, reduction in variance for reward timing, or any other factor, DPoS has inherently better characteristics than PoW.

PoW relies on incentives that are outside the network and can become compromised.  SHA256 hardware that *should* be dedicated to Bitcoin and *should* maintain miner dedication to Bitcoin, is instead unreliable as it can find substitute profitability on other SHA256 chains.  DPoS does not offer competing incentives.

Scalability - a currency is most useful when it is available to the most people.  Nano is being built to not just be fast, but also expansive.  Transactions are structured to be small in data size, node communication is being being kept to a minimum, the block lattice structure is ideal for node pruning (and I believe ""mempool"" management, but maybe not disk io).  All of this allows Nano to be best suited to have one of the best chances to be a world-wide currency that offers the most utility and value to humanity.

Those are issues that are not just better, but closer to *ideal*.  And they are very important when talking about the issue of a currency.  Nano does a great job of answering the question ""Do the people who secure the network and control the flow of transactions have any conflict of interest in performing their responsibilities"".

Now, transaction flooding, taking the world off of inflationary currency standards, other block lattice currencies or even better technology in the future, practical issues like adoption or human nature being lazy to change representatives - there are also potential problems.  But I do look at Nano like I looked at BTC in 2013/14 - it offers some serious potential that has me very interested.",2019-01-10 00:40:20

Cryptocurencys can be a store of value, but only if they are in demand. Bitcoin is said to be a store of value because the price will keep going up. This is not what a store of value is, but a promise of a return on investment, which is closer to a ponzi scheme.

Price crashes? That happens regularly.

Price crashes very much? That happens regularly.

Not get adopted as international currency? Already is.

Not get adopted as international currency by every grandmother to buy their groceries with? Arguably, yes that would be a fail. Bitcoin would still exist tho, and grow in tech an price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.

Large number of coins being thrown on the market by whoever? Price would crash, Bitcon would still exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.

Another alt takes over wrt price/adoption? Arguably, yes that would be a fail. Still no other alt in sight at this point wrt decentralization, network effect, lindy effect and fixed market supply that could match Bitcoins now +10 year history. Also, Bitcon would still exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.


Another alt comes out of the left field with improved tech (faster transactions or whatever) rising to wide adoption? Bitcoin would still exist exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time - and whatever tech improvements make this (or any alt) more optimal than Bitcoin can (most likely) be implemented with 2nd or 3rd layer tech into Bitcoin.

A Black Swan event kills the network, say the cryptographic algorithm being broken/cracked, quantum computing etc.? Yes, this would be a fail, actually the only real fail that could be considered as such imo. Didn't happen as of yet tho. Should it happen, we'll see what happens.

",2019-01-12 21:26:04
edw0pf2,yilmzfurkan,1,"&gt;I downloaded the latest of [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/) (not from Play Store, but from an online APK I found, as I do not have Play Store installed on my phone).

You should never download Samourai Wallet from non-official/shady webpages. They provide the SHA-256 key of the official APK so you can compare that with the APK which you have downloaded before installing it. ([https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/releases](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/releases)) 

&gt;Two or three days ago, [they removed some privacy features from the wallet](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/181821635197/temporarily-disabling-stealth-mode-remote-sms)  because of stupid and irritating Google policies that everyone here  hates. They said they were moving to F-Droid soon with the full-featured  app. That was nice, but am I wrong or they could have done this before  they were forced to trim the app? Devs already know Google was applying  these pathetic policies, they just tried to apply for an exception — as  stated on their blog post.

AFAIK Samourai Wallet added to Play Store \~2016. Google didn't had that policy back then it came out recently ([https://www.xda-developers.com/google-restriction-sms-call-log-permissions/](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-restriction-sms-call-log-permissions/)) If you know how F-Droid works its really slow to update apps since they build it their own and there are lots of apps to be build in general I am also a huge F-Droid fan don't forget to donate/contribute to F-Droid they are doing an awesome work. Samourai Wallet is still in Alpha and it needs to be updated regularly and be shared fast so Google Play is a decent way to do it also it helps to see statics (default by Google if you have Google Services installed on your phone Samourai don't include any trackers, their Exodus Privacy Report here: [https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/search/com.samourai.wallet/](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/search/com.samourai.wallet/)) and improve the app fixing bugs etc. are easier since the feedback mechanism which Google Play has. Also a little but non-important thing is Samourai back-end is currently not open-sourced they are working on that if they would add it to F-Droid now they would probably marked as promoting non-free network not so important but a little note. (I don't mean here that their back-end open sourcing is not important the notice mark on F-Droid is not important. Please don't try to draw the subject here.) They will be added to F-Droid really soon once they hit stable and completely open sourced their back-end. 

&gt;Another thing I found is people (users) openly contradicting the privacy statements made by Samourai — [this particular one](https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9r9344/slp29_samourai_wallet_bitcoin_privacy_software/e8fm1v8?context=3)  being the most “extreme”, as it comes from what it seems to be an  eminence here. I know Bitcoin is not oriented towards privacy and that  privacy is very difficult to implement, but this made me think: why, for  example, cannot I connect to a trusted node without having to run a  full node myself, specially configure it and use a VPN to connect to it?  Why there seems to be an interest in promoting transaction casting  through Samourai servers? Also, what are Ricochet, STONEWALL and PayNym?  I suppose they are their implementation of different Bitcoin  Improvement Proposals, but can they be trusted? Some users in this sub  say there’s something shady with this app.

They stated that clearly and that's why they are still on Alpha. They have explained to these numerous times ([https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=trusted%20node%20from%3A%40samouraiwallet&amp;src=typd](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=trusted%20node%20from%3A%40samouraiwallet&amp;src=typd)) Also that's really hard to be a light wallet as you stated that the safest way is running your own node to maximize your privacy. As I told this is why they are still in Alpha once they release their back-end you can run their implementation on your full node and fully bypass their infrastructure. They are also working on a plug&amp;play node ([https://samouraiwallet.com/dojo](https://samouraiwallet.com/dojo)) For their Ricochet, Stonewall and Paynym features you can have a look at their webpages. ([https://samouraiwallet.com/ricochet](https://samouraiwallet.com/ricochet), [https://samouraiwallet.com/stonewall](https://samouraiwallet.com/stonewall), [https://samouraiwallet.com/paynym](https://samouraiwallet.com/paynym)) They are all open-sourced features and processed on the client, not on their servers. 

&gt;Then, there is [this serious claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9tot5u/samourai_wallet_bitcoin_lost/)  from a user saying that Samourai Wallet lost some of his bitcoins. I  won’t get into details, but it was kind of scary to me since other users  told him they were in the same situation.

Welcome to the Bitcoin world while financial sovereignty is something awesome it comes with huge responsibility don't going to list here examples which people lost a ton of bitcoins from paper wallets, other wallets, mistakes etc. I remember that guy as you can see in the comments Samourai team tried to help him also I and my friends tried to help him lots of hours (the chat history is available on Telegram group if someone wants to see it feel free to join and read it its pretty long btw)  I invited him to the group ([https://files.catbox.moe/zvwzob.png](https://files.catbox.moe/zvwzob.png)) and he was a pretty good guy he didn't accused Samourai but just wanted help. The Github repository is there you can search the code/commit history and see that there is nothing wrong in private key generation the problem isn't on the Samourai side.

edw2728,trentinparadise,1,"I agree, we have been handed a gift, a near perfect system that just needed to scale to service its potential user base.  But for the last few years all we have done is argued about how-to-scale rather than actual scaling. OK so now we have Lightning and whilst its not perfect its getting there.

Whilst we were arguing about how-to-scale certain individuals recognised an opportunity to stick in a bigger wedge and further divide for their own personal gain. People like CSW, Calvin Are, Jihan Wu and Roger Ver.. to just name a few. These people have ALL created their own crypto projects/forks established their own media outlets, hired their own developers, deployed their own websites and set up their own mining operations.

Satoshi would be laughing because these forks of Bitcoin, BCH and BSV that are promoted as following Satoshi's vision have done everything but followed his vision.  His vision was for a decentralised P2P electronic cash, not centralised client development, centralised project management and centralised mining not Paypal 2.0. The way I see it Bitcoin is one of the few projects which is still focussed on decentralisation in every meaning of the word, its still following Satoshi vision.  Lightning helps to take back mining centralisation, helps to scale Bitcoin. 

Scaling on-chain even with 100MB blocks opens up a host of risk factors, but GB and TB blocks are insane and the stuff of nonsense. ",2019-01-12 22:00:53

edw380j,zomgitsduke,1,"&gt;If this has already been answered then please just link me to the thread but what happens to bitcoin that are in wallets that people have lost the keys to?

They sit there forever until someone can ""sign"" a transaction with those keys. Possibly in the future we will have encryption breaking methods that can claim those old coins.

&gt;They just remain inactive until the key is found? 

Pretty much. Until someone can sign a transaction for them, they don't move.

&gt;If that’s the case then do people see this as a future issue if a certain amount become lost?

Since Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units, lost coins just increase value of active available coins. We could also divide into smaller units if desired.

&gt;And wouldn’t that encourage energy to be used for hacking rather than mining at a certain stage?

It would take not only a ton of electricity, but also an absurd amount of computing power and hardware to try to attack wallets. This is different than mining.

&gt;Sorry if this is a repost but I haven’t seen a thread that answers these questions and think perhaps we don’t yet have an answer?

We can't have a certain answer, but we can take educated guesses, just like in the 80s we could have predicted what the internet would look like today, but we really had no idea that all this would happen.",2019-01-12 22:24:29

Well it is rather hard to argue checkpoint are against bitcoin when the guy that invented them put them all over the place..

&gt;	BCH is no longer a true PoW coin. A longer chain can have more PoW, and BCH nodes will reject it simply because of a checkpoint.

A chain doesn’t always follow the most PoW chain, 

Imagine a chain that would double the block reward, BTC will not follow it, even if it has more PoW.

Changing the block reward changes the properties of the system. That's a well established protocol rule from day one. Breaking that rule would not be valid.

&gt;	But there isn’t, so I’m not answering an impossible hypothetical question. Changing the coin supply breaks one of the most important protocol rules Bitcoin has.

It is possible to increase the currency supply in a backwards compatible way.

For example a soft fork that imposed that the only transaction permitted onchain are the one going to a “sidechain”

The new node software can be design in a way that this sidechain space is an extension block and all unit in it are considered BTC.

In this new “sidechain” space the can be no supply limit, another block reward.

According to you, as it is backwards compatible, it doesn’t breaks consensus rules.

edwebi5,GanjinChan,1,"In the short term, you would need to take complete ownership of your shares, severing any intermediary connections, such as brokers, and then sell directly to any interested party for Bitcoin.

edwf1j9,harda,1,"&gt; why, for example, cannot I connect to a trusted node without having to run a full node myself, specially configure it and use a VPN to connect to it?

This is possible, not just hypothetically but with other lightweight wallets such as GreenAddress.  That said, connecting to someone else's node will leak your addresses to them, so it's bad for your privacy compared to connecting to your own node over an encrypted link.  (However, Samourai Wallet directly sends your addresses to their servers, so connecting to some random person's node might not actually be a security reduction.  To be fair, this is also the model used by Electrum and most other popular lightweight wallets.)

&gt; Also, what are Ricochet, STONEWALL and PayNym?

- **Ricochet** is their attempt to get around what's called ""red listing,"" which is exchanges refusing to accept bitcoins that are closely related to addresses controlled by supposed bad people.  It works by sending bitcoins from yourself to yourself multiple times using different addresses to put extra graph distance between you and the red listed address.  Some people claim it's effective, but if that's so, it's only because exchanges aren't trying hard enough to counter it.  It wastes block space and so costs you transaction fees, plus I understand Samourai charges a fee on top (why?  I don't know.  It's an incredibly simple feature to implement technically; you can even do it manually in most wallets---generate a new address, send some funds there, repeat).

- **Stonewall** is an attempt to construct a transaction entirely using your bitcoins that looks like a coinjoin transaction constructed by multiple people.  This can provide increased deniability when looking at a single transaction, but a block chain analysis company that looks at your whole history of transactions may be able to see information that indicates it wasn't a coinjoin---at which point, it will often reduce your privacy by associating more of your bitcoins together and by allowing other coinjoin-looking tranactions in your coin history to be probabilistically assigned entirely to your wallet.  It also makes inefficient use of block space and so charges you more transaction fees.

- **PayNym** is an extension to their [BIP47](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki).  As the BIP's comments summary says, BIP47 is ""Unanimously Discouraged for implementation,"" and you can [read the comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/wiki/Comments:BIP-0047).  You probably won't be surprised to hear this, but BIP47 also wastes block chain space and costs you extra fees (it actually uses the block chain as a communication medium, which is slow and expensive).

&gt; determine if Samourai Wallet is what it claims to be.

In my opinion, the best summary of them is made by /u/nullc in the post you linked, ""I have seen far too much outright dishonest and extremely incompetent behaviour from Samourai to ever trust it myself.""  /u/SamouraiWalletDev and /u/SamouraiWallet do come across as people deeply concerned about privacy for Bitcoin users, but they seem to believe that having a moral conviction gives them a free pass on acting and communicating with integrity.

Disclosure: Samourai's developers have previously accused me of criminal conduct (a claim I reject).",2019-01-13 01:20:26

ee0drus,Babble9753,1,"Argument 1: Bitcoin mining is a natural monopoly (due to economies of scale) therefore it will result in a monopoly. 

- Half True. It could be a natural monopoly but businesses seek to maximize profit &amp; a single BTC mining monopoly would be negative for profit so the largest miners will self limit their market share. 

Argument 2: An inferior product can not survive (as evidenced by BTC’s falling market share) 

1. BTC’s market share needs to be compared to other currencies not platforms or applications which not only do not threaten BTC but actually add value to BTC, due to BTC being the reserve currency for the ecosystem. (As evidenced by BTC price growth to all time highs while overall market share declining.) 
2. Money is different to ‘product’ in that trust plays a big role, so a new improved money cannot easily surpass the old trusted one.

All wraith does is hide the IP and sender or receiver, its not a private chain.  and the thing you linked to is a year old 20 second promotional thing, that again makes 0 mention of any ""button"".

2nd. you said you are using it on your phone, and I am 99% sure the option is only on a desktop wallet version, ..99% sure..there is no wraith optional wallet usable on a cell phone.  So...you need to research which wallet to use....they have like 20+ wallets.  and I don't work for Verge so you would have to ask them, no point in using language and getting angry at me. 

3rd.  again...a private chain is not needed for ""privacy"".  Blocking IP is a level of privacy.  Blocking sender and receiver is a valid level of privacy as well.  Corporations will probably NEVER adopt a coin that is 100% invisible on a private chain, by default...so your argument makes even less sense.  It DOES offer privacy,  it is in fact a privacy coin...(despite your rigid definition apparently) and it DOES allow you do use either wraith or non-wraith via wallet choice, and NEVER promised any kind of ""button"".  

(If you have a video of them promising a ""button"" please provide it...) If you can find anything in the white paper (black paper) about a ""button"" please provide it.   It was people (like me) theorizing what the function would be like that said that in the forums....not them.  and the very definition of a ""private"" chain is also debatable so when he says it switches between them, it very well may now, as...semantics is key.   Your definition of a ""private chain"" is not the whole world's.  (Would I say that Verge has a private chain, I would not...but I don't know what he meant there, you would have to ask him.)  Maybe his definition is different from yours.

As part of the plan, kin is trying to peg itself as 1kin = 1cent to new users. Which is fantastic. 

Im wondering if there is a way to make kin2 a stable coin backed by fiat, Bitcoin or ""a promise to pay the bearer"" however to prevent kin1 owners dumping onto this promise, they must enter a lock up system which releases their coins slowly. This would create a fresh level of support for the coin and enable new people entering the kin ecosystem to pay the $0.01 per token price. 

Itd mean kin foundation would need to hold a lot of liquidity in the near future but as the ecosystem grows, the liquidity would be a natural circulation.  

Likely still to early in the project for this to be considered however maybe something to think about for the future.

Full nodes make bitcoin security because they have the power to reject invalid transactions. If full node wallets are not used by people actually using bitcoin to receive transactions then they'll never reject invalid transactions, and then an attacker who tries to (for example) print infinite bitcoins will get them accepted by the economy.

Ive come to see capitalism and communism as binary opposites locked in a hegelian struggle. Im hoping blockchain will provide a synthesis between the two. Although i dont support the CCP i support the chinese people and am confident with enough time and the right tools that their spirit (volksgeist) will find another way. 

The crisis in the west is similar, if only from the other side. The french protests are supposed to be pushing for a run on the banks. It probably wont result in an immediate crypto boom but it will have a similar spirit to occupy wall street which was the catalyst for bitcoin. Difference is this community has had 10 years of laying down the foundations so theyre getting closer to mainstream adoption.

ee0hsv6,Pat_The_Hat,1,"I come to the conclusion that the extreme bull and bear markets of bitcoin are a feature and they speed up the adoption process.

Thread inspired by @BitcoinTina

---

The average person does not know this, but the 2017 Bitcoin bubble was not the first time we saw this significant price rise and rapid decline. There have been countless other bubbles.

---

$1 -&gt; $30 -&gt; $2.30 (x 30 -92%) - 2011  
$2.30 -&gt; $250 -&gt; $62 (x 108 -75%)  
$62 -&gt; $1,150 -&gt; $154 (x 18 -86%) - 2013/2014  
$154 -&gt; $780 -&gt; $475 (x 5 -39%)  
$475 -&gt; $19,700 -&gt; ? 3,142 ? (x 41 -84%) - 2017/2018

---

Like I said, these massive price advances along with the massive declines are exactly how bitcoin adoption will continue to play out.

---

The bull markets bring in the network effects including: technological development (developers), investment (ICE and Fidelity), and security (miners).

The bear market drives out all who really do not understand what Bitcoin is. So they sell and deeply regret it later.

---

The thousands of people who understand that the characteristics of bitcoin are far superior to all alternative forms of money and that Bitcoin will continue to go through bull and bear cycles for the foreseeable future are called the hodler's of last resort.

---

They have their stash of bitcoin that will never be sold until full adoption and they continue to buy more bitcoin when it seems cheap.

---

In fact, many people think price gaps down are bad for Bitcoin. I have come to the conclusion that they are wrong. In fact, the further bitcoin's price falls in a bear market the faster bitcoin adoption will happen.

---

If a large holder of Bitcoin decided to sell 1 million bitcoin the price may gap down temporarily to 1 cent. This would be super bullish for bitcoin because the long term hodlers of last resort would be able to by 1/21st of the entire supply of bitcoin very easily.

---

Because these Bitcoin will almost never be sold it effectively takes more bitcoin off the market and creates kindle for the next bull run.

---

In a bear market, the price will stop falling once supply finally matches demand.

---

During this time, the supply is high from two things:

1. speculators who jumped in at the end of the last bubble and still don't understand what bitcoin is
2. miners who are mining bitcoin and selling to cover their electricity costs

---

The demand is from the hodler's of last resort. Those people/businesses/governments who understand bitcoin and are bullish on it long term.

---

You can see that this base of hodler's of last resort is growing because each low in bitcoins bear market is significantly higher than the previous low.

---

Once the supply finally matches demand, the price will stabilize, weak hands stop selling and the price begins to move up.

---

The key part about this is while demand starts increasing again, the supply remains LOW. So when more curious speculators and traders come back the price begins to rise very quickly yet again.

---

Looking at the past bubbles this is exactly what has happened over and over again...

---

Scarcity results in supply shortages that cause price increases, price increases attract attention and drive adoption, adoption is people learning about the fundamentals of bitcoin and becoming hodler's of last resort.

---

This is the cycle that has happened over and over again, and it will continue until full adoption of bitcoin.",2019-01-14 08:48:32
ee0hrob,apachechief,1,"&gt; This all requires a fair and potentially regulated market.

*What* requires that? Determining the proper price? Even in a regulated market, the price can be wrong...........

&gt; If tether is committing fraud and used nearly 3 billion usdt to initiate the 2017 bull run, that would be an example of the price not being reached naturally. Likewise when exchanges wash trade or paint the tape, it feeds false information to the market.

Yep, for sure, but *that information is in the price!* People with lots of money who are moving this market are well aware of wash trading, etc. The only people not aware of this are retail investors... which we should protect *somehow* but I'm not sure how. You're likely to get hit crossing the street unless you have walk signs/lights, so maybe something like this could be helpful.

At the same time, where does that regulation end? Should we disallow people from buying fancy expensive cars? Should we stop people from taking out ridiculous student loans?

Why even buy Bitcoin if you're not knowledgable? Should be kind of a no brainer, and it seems this way as very little $$$ flowing into BTC now.",2019-01-14 08:48:07

I also have another strategy to help Bitcoin become less volatile (this is critical for a the utility as a currency) .

ee4bavy,ShitfacedBattleMage,1,"I would like to debate one of these points, specifically in application to blockchain and Distributed ledger projects. 

When is taxation not theft?

Here is what we will be discussing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Mimblewimble/comments/abv43z/beams_20_treasury_tax_is_it_too_much/?st=JQXTGGAQ&amp;sh=3d0fbca5

The logic here is that we need to find a way to dramatically increase the material output of these projects so we can move toward disintermediated money faster. Also, community funding worked for bitcoin. That is not as easy now and we do need projects like Beam taking a stab at this. 

The problem as you can see is the backlash. The assumption is that they are here to enrich themselves. This is a very lazy judgement. There are plenty productive discussions going on right now about how to solve this lack of funding. We need to do research on this and we need projects like Beam to spearhead new ways that don’t arrive at oligarchical conclusions.

The sentiment is that this is it possible. That any governance model is bad. And a governance model fused with self funding mechanism is worse.

But it is a way to pay for further development. We need a productive capacity and immunity stream or else we end up relying on community donations. That is bullshit.

What are your thoughts about this. I realize that this community has very strong views about stuff like this. That is why I ask. You may have the best insight.

ee4bjvt,Gucci_Cocaine,1,"## About me

I'm Mistress Maire Rua, 6'1 Amazonian Goddess with long legs and big, perfect tits. I'm the girl of your nightmares and your wet dreams. I'm a domme on and offline - both lifestyle and professional. I live and breathe fetish and kink. I take real genuine pleasure in mindfucking men into oblivion, and I find the best way to do that is by getting into your head over an extended period of time. A Domme GFE allows Me to get into your head and explore your kinks on a deeply individualised basis; giving Me a more powerful control over your mind, body, and of course, your cock.

&amp;#x200B;

It's January. You, a weak man, have probably made all kinds of promises and resolutions which we both know you're incapable of keeping. That is, unless you have a Mistress standing behind you, cracking the whip and guiding you to discipline, while all the while you fall deeper into submission to Me.

My name is Jessica, and I'm your genuine, down to earth, girl next door. You’ll soon find that beneath my sweet, natural appearance lies a kinky side and a ravenous sexual appetite. I’m also a huge geek, so I can hold a conversation about legend of korra or Hamilton while getting you off ;)
*****
I’m the type of girl who likes it rough. My two favorite kinks are being bitten and choked, but if I had to pick one, it would be choking. I can’t resist someone who knows how to use their hands. Giving up control turns me on so much. Pin me down, tie me up, and finger my wet pussy until I scream in ecstasy. Anal is another one of my favorite delights. I adore anything in my ass, whether it be a butt plug, fingers, or even your cock.
*****
Joi, cbt, CEI, domme, sub, femdomme, foot, and findomme, I enjoy it all. I love telling you how to stroke your throbbing cock until you’re close to the ecstasy of cumming, and commanding you to stop until I say so. Laughing as you torture your cock to please your domme, and lick up that cum for me when you’re done. And if you like findomme, you know you're going to have to pay that cum tax and more. Do you want to dress up like my slutty princess and make you touch your sissy clitty for me? I can do that. I'll make you cum on that skimpy dress I picked out.

While I love being in control, I adore relinquishing it from time to time, and listening to your commands as you control when I cum.

ee32dz7,straytjacquet,1,"I meant that the internet I have grown up with is structured in a way that information can be copied and transferred around the world with ease, a really amazing accomplishment. But that strength has always been problematic if, say in the case of money, you want to send money digitally, over the open internet, without relying on a trusted authority to keep good honest records, and everyone who uses that money can rest assured knowing that you haven’t sent a copy and kept a copy for yourself- a double spend. 

Of course this isn’t a problem with fiat because we entrust our banks to maintain a ledger of balances and keep an honest record of who owns what. Fortunately for me, I live in a place where people trust their banks and their governments. I still believe average people, businesses, and governments can benefit from adopting a decentralized method of expressing value, identity, and ownership, and that we owe our knowledge of this potential to what Bitcoin first proved. I think the costs of ensuring information security can go way down, and we can make our civilization more robust by removing single points of failure. Central institutions are like fortresses, but fortresses can be targeted and they can crumble. I want to see the world built like a web, without a central weakness. 

Bitcoin was the first to prove that you can create trust in something valuable transferred over the internet, without relying on a central authority to validate the ledger of transactions. It may not seem like a big deal when it’s just some made up money that hardly anyone in the world cares about, but it really opened up Pandora’s box, and we’ll see what happens next?

I respect your healthy skepticism btw, 99% of this tech is buzzwords, hype, and scams. That’s kind of the fun of it, though, to sort out what’s really interesting from all the BS

No it dropped the same reason everything dropped, because hype and greed outpaced genuine adoption.

#**Custom Videos**

Perhaps my very favorite service to offer, I adore creating customized, creative sexy videos for you to enjoy over and over (and over) again! I get a lot of compliments on my voice and my videos are know for being quite vocal with lots of dialogue, dirty talk and plenty of my natural noises as well. I love creative video ideas and trying new things but regular old vanilla fun gets me going too, so don't be shy if your tastes are on the milder side. I'm all natural, authentic and only take on custom video projects that I know I will love to create. All of my content is 1080p HD, 60fps with high quality professional lighting. Custom videos à la Clarabelle start at $50 and I have a large collection of outfits, lingerie, toys and props to make any sort of fantasy come true.

**A review about my HD custom videos**:

She was, as is obviously apparent, beautiful and hot and was just great in the video and in playing to the roles I requested [...] As a two video buyer (and rating video buyer) she has been one of the best; highly recommended!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/comments/9d3mrh/rvw_for_uclarabelle_says/)*

ee8jc6p,Steven81,1,"My bad, I often expect people to be deeply informed into rather esoteric parts of a technology that gets me excited.

OK, here is how Bitcoin works (in broad strokes).

A transaction between two people is made. Once it is done it is validated by some people. Those people are called miners and are literally anybody who owns a machine called a ""bitcoin miner"". 

The reason that you can trust their resolution is because you expect the majority of them to be honest ("" this transaction between those two people indeed happened and it is valid I.e. the person making it had the funds to make it""). Due to some intricate math reason if you get 51% of them being dishonest for long enough the whole scheme collapses and the blockchain cannot be trusted anymore. This is the mathematical part of Bitcoin.

The game theoretical part of Bitcoin is that *that* never happened, not once in the history of Bitcoin and the reason is precisely this long term uptrend in its pricing. See, miners are being paid (in Bitcoin) for validating the transaction which they then sell for actual products or to pay their electricity bill or whatever. So it is in their best interest to say the truth so that to give legitimacy to the project so that to continue being paid by it. It is a self fulfilling prophecy. Miners tell the truth, the truth makes bitcoin efficient, Bitcoin's efficiency fuels a long-term uptrend , miners get paid, miners tell the truth ... etc, etc, etc.

Now the thing is far more complex than that but in short the price actually does have a function. It pays for the security of Bitcoin (through bribing miners to be honest and build sustainable industries based on honesty). Which is why I expect the price to continue going up (long term) *until* a better project is found (and miners jump ship to that, which would actually lower Bitcoin's security , because it is easier to be dishonest/steal a network that is mined by 100 people instead of one mined by 100 million people/machines, which in turn would lower the price of Bitcoin towards zero)...",2019-01-17 09:25:58
ee8jn68,ajc9630,1,"Well, I may be wrong but I think Bitcoin’s C++ is being rewritten in Rust which is great for security but that still doesn’t address privacy. It may or may not be necessary though to use sidechain(s) with privacy like say Mimblewimble. I’m not sure I haven’t looked into any of that yet. Blockstream core devs and Stanford crypto created Bulletproofs. The same ones in Monero... 

However, Bulletproofs must be able to drop into something for their use. If Bitcoin core devs assisted with the creation of Bulletproofs then one might assume that in the distant future Bitcoin will implement Bulletproofs which means privacy features must be in Bitcoin’s base layer first. I spoke to Pieter Wuille on Twitter about this. The words “distant future” were present. I’m just hesitant on what will happen with Monero if/when Bitcoin implements privacy and sidechains such as Mimblewimble and/or others are used. Monero will always implement new privacy features first, but that also implies that XMR is a testbed for Bitcoin. That doesn’t lead to enduring value. 

The question is, what can Monero Research Labs do to separate XMR from BTC and create an XMR utility-niche that’s sustainable and long lasting that can capture real world value other than drugs and ideas about what it “could” be used for. 

Personally, I believe that Zcash already captured the ‘digital cash’ market for governments, institutions, corporations, law enforcement/military, business, politics, etc... Publicly registered entities with large economic power will probably be required by law to use Zcash for private transactions where an “ethical backdoor” is only usable if voted for on a publicly verifiable and contributable case-by-case basis to make sure the economy remains secure and corruptions remains low (lower). This makes sense.

I believe that in order for XMR to truly succeed long term that it will need to claim itself as a private ‘payment network’ for private citizens without any backdoors. However, it doesn’t settle well with most but some are receptive to the fact that decentralized self sovereign identity will act as a natural “tail emissions” redistribution of all capped supplies, so XMR tail emissions will most likely become a MAJOR discussion within the Monero Research Labs that should be addressed far sooner than later, as in right NOW. There’s immutable ways to address the problem. I’ve created a post on it as well as submitted an issue to the Monero Research Labs on GitHub. Tail emissions were an initial concept without game theoretic formal peer reviewed backing. If not addressed, they’ll be the death of XMR. ",2019-01-17 09:29:21
ee8jzk4,doobidoo5150,1,This “thought” is the reason bitcoin was created and is found in the original bitcoin white paper from 2009.,2019-01-17 09:33:10
ee8kz9b,tickled-n-pickled,1,"Thank you very much for the information. Glad to hear this is an exception, as a second time user, it got me very concerned about the reliability of buying bitcoin. ",2019-01-17 09:44:11
ee8lhie,mirziemlichegal,1,"It's symbolizes a bitcoin, you just have to trust in its value!",2019-01-17 09:49:46
ee8m5ni,jstolfi,1,"That is not the right way to think of it. You are mixing USD and BTC, and counting the latter at their market price.  But that is not money that you **have**, only money that you **might** get ...

Rather, If you buy 1 bitcoin at 15k, you lose 15k.   If later you sell to someone else for 5k, you get back 5k and the other guy loses 5k.",2019-01-17 09:57:10
ee8mcgc,texwitheffects,1,That guy is a puppet. Remember his whole bitcoin thing last year?,2019-01-17 09:59:16
ee8maty,Dr__Douchebag,1,"&gt; Blockstream core devs and Stanford crypto created Bulletproofs. The same ones in Monero.

Bulletproofs are only one aspect of why Monero is private. They just make RingCT transactions smaller. There are also stealth addresses and ring signatures insuring all aspects of every transaction is opaque, not transparent.

&gt; The question is, what can Monero Research Labs do to separate XMR from BTC and create an XMR utility-niche that’s sustainable and long lasting that can capture real world value other than drugs and ideas about what it “could” be used for

I personally think it already has. I do not spend Bitcoin, the most of a transaction of Bitcoin I ever make is to convert it to Monero. Unfortunately, and obviously monero adoption on a client end has been slower than bitcoin, but luckily there are great services such as [XMR.to](https://xmr.to) . 

Monero works now and it works well. I would prefer all my transactions be private. The cost of this is one extra step of using xmr.to which I think is a minimal cost. 

Theoretically bitcoin could add all three of those things I mentioned, but at that point its becoming Monero. Even from an investment point of view if Bitcoin pivoted to becoming Monero, monero value would sky rocket. From a usability point of view I would much rather use Monero now, especially since Trump's new tax plan does not characterize crypto-crypto exchanges as ""like exchanges"" so they are taxable events as of now. Will this change? Maybe, but I like to stay ahead of the curve.

&gt; Personally, I believe that Zcash

Let me stop you right there. Zcash has a fundamental flaw in that it requires a trusted setup which means the cost of coins can be inflated by those who ""initially had the trust"". They promised they don't own that ability anymore but I dont trust them

The method of sending private transactions through the zk-SNARKS method Zcash uses are also so high and require take so long that no one uses it, thats why they made privacy optional and why the vast majority of transactions are not private making chain analysis much, much easier. Samsunggalaxyplayer has posted before how few private Zcash transactions are actually made monthly and its astonishingly low but I dont feel like looking it up.

Your Bitcoin concerns are valid but I dont see Bitcoin changing that much to become private and even if they do all that does is boost monero publicity and value because people will realize what they are trying to become

Your Zcash concerns are misguided",2019-01-17 09:58:45
ee8odrw,tvsr93,1,"The point was to take over the corrupted system where centralized powers create money, make themselves extremely rich and rent seek at everyone elses expense.  That's why.  If bitcoin doesn't go up in value, it isn't increasing in adoption and has done nothing against that system.

Never worry though, as much as bitcoin is controlled opposition that this group uses now, it can't stop the rise of cryptocurrency, it can only slow it.  The old systems will topple and new fair money will take it's place where we won't have rent seekers and centralized control of absolute power that fiat gives but instead these same super rich will have to work after they've spent their money to get any back.",2019-01-17 10:22:07

eebahuo,Dandelion_Prose,1,"&gt;People chill out a lot when they get to their 30's.

That's likely the case here, too, but unfortunately the late Generation X's/early Generation Y crowd don't have much of a voice here, they're drowned out by Baby Boomers and Millennials.  It could also just be that, in this rural area, most of the career folks have moved to big cities, where meeting opposite genders one-on-one is a lot more normal due to work expectations.

&gt;Really the narrative of Ireland currently is, the British empire raped us for 700 years and then the catholic church took over.

As someone that's fascinated with British history, that intrigues but saddens me. On one hand, I wish that had never been the case, but on the other hand, if it wasn't, I wouldn't even be here. (One of my ancestors was a Mennonite missionary in Ireland during the late 1700s. It went about as well as could be expected, he ended up getting arrested and tortured, so he sailed to America instead.)

&gt;Where half the people there are Irish and of Irish decent and want NI to be part of Ireland again, and were are also catholic. And the other half are technically Irish, but hate Irish people, see themselves as English, and are descended from British invasions and plantations, who are also protestant.

I'm familiar with what caused the original problem, but was admittedly ignorant of the more recent repercussions. I think most Americans have heard about what happened in the 70s and 80s, but our stereotypical image of Brits as suave gentleman and Irish as 1800s migrants overshadows the actual history and current issues behind both parties. Thank you for enlightening me, it's one thing to read it in a wikipedia page, it's another to hear from someone that lives there. It's interesting, taking the race issue out of it, I would say American Southerners used to have a similar relationship with the American North. 

&gt;But its hard not to notice the constant threads on r/relationships and r/sex from Americans in their mid 20's who don't seem to know anything about relationships and the opposite sex, talking about being divorced , or having marriage issues. 

I think this is exceedingly common, but I would take r/relationships with a grain of salt. You only see people posting with problems, not as many people posting about a stable/loving homelife. 

&gt; Even when we were extremely religious back in the 70's and 80's, people wouldn't be that strict on such things.

This kind of blows my mind. With all of the documentaries about oppressive  Irish orphanages run by nuns, or nuns' treatment of unwed mothers, I would have thought things would be equally strict. Then again, when Protestantism hunkers down on being anti-something, we really hunker down on it. Unfortunately to a hypocritical extent. 

&gt; I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on this. People tend to think competitive competitive competitive when they think of Americans and American culture. Its like embedded into how you guys appear to interact with each other etc etc. 

I definitely think we are a competitive society, but that it's a result of being individualistic? In some societies, community is the primary focus. You or the oldest child are expected to live with Mom and Dad, because eventually, when they get older, you and your spouse will be expected to look after them and support them. Even if family communal living isn't a thing, many societies expect a group of people to work together as a team. 

In contrast, many families in the US still have a ""kick them out at 18"" mentality. The idea is that sometimes 'hard love' is the only way to teach young adults to figure things out for themselves. If a cashier overcharges you, Americans are more apt to insist that they're right or make a scene rather than just accept it and move on. Someone else on the bus is reading? That's fine, that doesn't stop me from talking loudly on the phone rather than waiting until the next bus stop. Because I'm focused on what's best for me, not the group. If I feel like I can be paid better somewhere else? I change jobs and get the 5k raise I never would have gotten if I had stayed and been loyal to the original company.

That's not to say that there aren't selfless or communal-minded people in America---but individuality is encouraged and leads to success. Unique individuality and skill can lead to becoming a celebrity. Being able to lay off a department without batting an eye because it's necessary for the company's growth is something I could never do---but something that well-paid CEOs do everyday. 

I never pushed people in line as a kid. Having grown up in a more communal church environment, I always tried to be patient and polite. But as the kid in the back of the line, that meant I had less time to eat during lunch than my classmates, leaving me only five minutes to eat where they had fifteen. I could either learn to be assertive or adapt---I chose the latter, and still eat ridiculously fast to this day. But the kids at the front of the line still had the advantage, and still had the incentive to keep pushing. If we were all calm and orderly, we probably could have gotten through the line faster on average, but then the more aggressive kids would lose time.

The same problem is what overwhelms our healthcare system. As someone who has worked hard to get where I am and be financially stable, I don't want my hospital bill to be elevated because of all the people who go to emergency rooms for drug overdoses and then don't pay up. I feel like I'm being penalized for someone else's poor decisions. So when someone brings up the idea of standardized healthcare, I freak out because I've been doing what I'm supposed to, and don't want to take on the extra tax burden for a government (look at the government shutdown) that is too inept to handle my healthcare for me. 

The problem with that mentality? Not all of the sunk healthcare costs are people that are lazy. A lot of them are people that are genuinely in need and have nowhere else to go. Got cancer? Guess what, the symptoms just caused you to lose your job, which caused you to lose your health insurance. Those people need care, too, and shouldn't be sentenced to die  just because they're disabled. And even if I am financially stable, a self-centered hospital billing department and self-centered insurance companies have driven up costs to where one emergency room visit could pay for a new car.

&gt;I don't know everything and I'm just a dude but I think the real issue is there needs to be a culture of more time getting to know how to have positive relations with themselves and people before marriage is the real issue but I'd say the Hollywood lifestyle thing of leaving for the next bright shiny thing might be an issue too alright.

I completely agree on both accounts. Even though we are young, my husband dated each other for five years before we got married. Almost all of the other ""high school sweethearts"" I know that got divorced were only dating for less than a year before they decided to tie the knot. Unfortunately, waiting until later in life to get married in American leads to rash ""my biological clock is ticking"" decisions, as well. 

&gt;Btw you say your into PC hardware/tech. How up to date/ in the loop are you on CPU's? 

Unfortunately not very. Especially since bitcoin mining has caused graphic card prices to jack up. I did have a laptop Intel i7 1050 TI Intel with 12mb of ram, I was able to get it on sale for $400 and run Vive on it which was glorious, but it was stolen during a break-in. I've thought about doing a custom build, but at the price of things, I think I'm just going to plough through with my desktop until I can't play newer games on it, and then swap out cards/replace the ram.

Also, sorry, didn't mean to write a paper, here, ha ha.",2019-01-18 08:52:35

I will note that for crypto, the whole forked ICO scam drives me insane. I am fortunate enough to know what “good code” is and always willing to advise folks on what products are quality from a technical standpoint. Most investors don’t have anything like that available to them, so they can easily make the mistake of buying into that shiny marketing campaign trickery - when in reality, the product is a 1 line change from bitcoin (or even worse, not even a product at all).

On the other side, with the stock market, you worry about insider trading, along with the owners of exchanges/market entry-points selling aggregated data analysis that “knows” what the market is going to do. Also, recently, a large group of people lost money from a glitch in a trading platforms options feature. From what I last heard, there wasn’t really any refund process that happened, so craziness is not limited to just crypto. Those are just a few instances, but the point is, bad actors follow the money.

eebe5xr,enqueued,1,"They're basically right. But Bitcoin might not be good enough.

Cryptoassets have properties that make them useful as a monetary instruments: any two people in the world with internet access can transact without financial intermediaries; one can hold their funds in such a way that they need trust no one but themselves for the funds' security; no one can destroy their value.

Bitcoin as the oldest cryptoasset has advantages and disadvantages:

- Pro: market leader, best brand recognition
- Pro: standard of value in cryptocurrency space
- Pro: standard of exchange in cryptocurrency space
- Pro: standard of security in cryptocurrency space
- Con: Base tech simply doesn't scale to widespread use
- Con: Any layered solutions to Bitcoin's problems can be applied to cryptoassets with more scalable bottom layers
- Con: Securing the network is expensive and wasteful (in kWH) and (AFACT) scales (at least) linearly with price 
- Con: The cost of securing the network is extracted from participants in fees, creating constant drag on money velocity and in turn movement towards price stability.

The question isn't whether or not Bitcoin is inherently a scam/worthless. The question is whether Bitcoin is the best version of the properties which make it useful and whether or not it's first-mover advantage will be enough to make for the fact that it's not.

With respect to cryptocurrencies, I basically see two possible outcomes:

- Bitcoin is so entrenched as a standard of value in the space that despite its technical limitations it is never dethroned as such. Ironically, it becomes just like gold, universally accepted as gold--and yet used regularly by basically no one (and for unnecessarily similar reasons). Other cryptocurrenices fill the void created by Bitcoin's disfunction.
- Bitcoin is gradually displaced by a handful of cryptocurrencies which are technically adequate for the widespread use.

Either way there will be rampant speculation and devastating crashes as crypto becomes more familiar to people who haven't interacted with it, as scams and unsecure coins are more and more aggressively exposed and attacked by regulatory agencies and hackers.

eeczk2a,RookXPY,1,"Longtime gold/silver bug here and you are both right to an extent.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of gold mined every year versus total above ground supply at this point puts it's inflation rate at a little over %1 (less than BTC).  However, Bitcoin reduces below gold's inflation rate after the next halving.  As the gold price climbs and/or new technology provides efficiency gains new mines will open and the supply will increase faster, but not enough to change that inflation rate by very much (because of we have been mining for a very long time).  

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing Bitcoin most definitely has over gold is that fixed inflation rate, IMO.  I heard about peak oil for years and then fracking came along now oil supply no longer seems to be a problem (although plants could probably solve that problem in a more environmentally friendly way).  

&amp;#x200B;

For gold, a tech advancement or huge new discovery (of either a ginormous gold vein or long buried stockpile) could radically alter the gold price.   I also have the feeling that nothing would advance humans into space faster than discovery of a gold asteroid we wanted to haul back down to earth.  Gold in nature is produced through nuclear fusion in the belly of stars so imagine if a nuclear power plant could be made where the byproduct was gold.  Then there is also the possibility of us finding a while [new way to create gold such as this](https://gizmodo.com/5948739/researchers-discover-bacteria-that-can-produce-pure-gold).

&amp;#x200B;

There are way more ways the gold supply can instantly increase than the BTC supply.  Are any of them likely?  No, but over a long enough period all of the scenarios I could imagine to radically increase gold supply definitely fall into the quite possible category.  

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I can only think of 2 ways the supply of bitcoin increases.  1)  The tech fails either through broken encryption or a 51% attack.  In which case it quickly becomes worthless anyway.  2)  Satoshi's wallet becomes active (similar to finding a long buried civilization's gold hoard).

&amp;#x200B;

A decade ago I liked gold as a store of value way more, I wish I had liked BTC way more the way I do today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting side note:  To own the same % of the total supply of gold as 1 BTC would get you of it's total supply you would need over 350 ounces and that number will only go up from the next halving onward.",2019-01-19 00:25:36

eeczxo4,-Zoe,1,"Hi there! My name is Zoe.

It's Friday! I like the thought of starting the weekend out lounging in bed &amp; having orgasms.

I’ve got vibrators, dildos, a selection of glass, anal &amp; bdsm toys.. Let’s have some fun!

####**[Here are some of my outfit options!](https://imgur.com/a/beditc8)**

Check out my **[Manyvids store](https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/1000920364/ZoefromReddit/)** for a complete list of premade videos that I have available. New buttplug video added this week!

##✨KIK Sessions

Live, one-on-one sexting sessions. I'll send a mixture of text, pictures and video as we play together. 




Type | Rate | Description
---|----|----
Text Session| $1/min | If you'd like to talk sex, share experiences, or roleplay without exchanging pictures or videos, we can definitely do that!
Standard Session| $2/min | A mix of text, pictures, and video. Mutual masturbation, strip tease, toy play, JOE - most ""vanilla"" things will fall under this category.
Intense Session | $3/min | Video heavy, including face, extreme kink, heavy anal penetration, necessary clean up (oil, squirting, messy play).

##✨Custom KIK-for-Later Sessions

Whether you're busy, feeling a little shy, or just in the mood for a sexy surprise, I'd love to put something together for you to enjoy on your own time.

You're welcome to give me some ideas as far as what you'd like to see. If you've got an outfit or toy preference, or you'd like to hear me use your name, feel free to let me know.

**$30 for an assortment of 15-20 photos/video clips, delivered within 24 hours.**


##✨Cock Rates 

Whether you choose text, kik delivery, or a full-fledged cock rate video, I'll have some detailed feedback for you within 24 hours time.

These ratings are specially made, just for you, so I have no problem using your name if you'd like me to, or wearing an outfit of your choosing. Just be sure to let me know before I get started!

Package | Cost | Description
---|---|----
Text Rating | $15 | Send me an album of your photos and I'll write you a few detailed paragraphs with my thoughts on your member. Text options allow me to really get descriptive about my likes and dislikes, first impressions, overall opinions, and more.  
KIK Rating | $25 | I'll deliver my thoughts to you in a series of kik videos. You'll be able to see and hear me react to your photos, explaining what I think about what you're working with.  
Video Rating | $30 | My favorite option! You'll receive an HD downloadable video rating in which I tell you exactly how I feel about your cock. I'll be wearing lingerie, and you'll be able to see your photos as well as watch my body language as I give you my thoughts.  
Deluxe Video Rating | $40 | Everything included in the standard video rating, except who needs clothes? I'll tease and strip out of what I'm wearing while detailing my every thought about that hard cock of yours. Maybe I'll even touch myself a little if I like what I see?

Add $10 to include face.


##✨Custom Videos

Have something specific in mind that you'd like to see? I'd love to create something custom for you! 


Custom videos range from $5/min for standard requests to $10/min for videos with face, more complex requests, or to personalize including name use throughout.

 Turnaround time is typically between 3 and 7 days unless otherwise specified.




##✨Payment
For payment, I can accept Google Pay, Bitcoin, Venmo, Square, Circle, Manyvids, Indiebill, or Amazon.com card (+$10), all with **no notes attached**.


Go ahead and **[send me a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=-Zoe&amp;subject=&amp;message=)** including what service you’re interested in, and which payment method you'd like to use. Can’t wait to have some fun!

eed1ini,thieflar,1,"There's moderation in this subreddit. If you want to claim that moderation is equivalent to censorship, then **every single crypto sub is censored**. In fact, those paying close attention would notice that subreddits like rbtc are moderated/censored in a much more biased, inconsistent, and politically-motivated manner (often removing posts that do not break any rules and banning users likewise). Even /r/ethereum has been caught executing similarly-shady censorship; as just one recent example, multiple true and informative (albeit sobering) posts about the Consensys layoffs were made when they happened, and each of them were manually removed by moderators (the majority of whom are directly affiliated with Consensys). Eventually, posts about the same subject with a ""positive spin"" were approved by the moderators and remained up and visible.

This sort of thing happens all the time, and if you want to accuse *this* subreddit of censorship, you must also realize that almost every other crypto subreddit censors *worse* than this one does. The reason why most of us here don't make such a fuss about it is because unlike altcoins, Bitcoin's success isn't dependent on shit-talking competitors. Bitcoin will succeed (or fail) on its own merits and its community doesn't really need to go out of its way to focus on altcoin subreddit drama.",2019-01-19 00:45:18

&gt; Hello Mr. Lou!

&gt; I just read your excellent article on Bitcoin being the next environmental fight (like big oil). I agree with your argument, but I would have liked to have seen some discussion of alternatives that solve Bitcoin's problems. It seems like a lot of people don't realize that there are already working alternatives, some of which improve on Bitcoin in every meaningful way (energy usage, scalability, transaction speed, decentralization, etc).

&gt; One such cryptocurrency is Nano, which has no mining, 0 transaction fees, near instant transaction times (3-10 seconds), and scales to beyond Visa levels of usage (7000+ TPS). This is possible because it doesn't have a single blockchain that miners add transactions to - it uses a Block-Lattice, where every account has its own blockchain. It's been around since 2014 (as RaiBlocks), but it's creator Colin LeMahieu (ex AMD, Qualcomm, and Dell engineer) just started working on it full-time in 2017. The goal is to make it an Internet RFC.

&gt; As you write about Bitcoin's energy usage and the related global warming concerns, you and your colleagues might find it interesting to know that Block-Lattice cryptocurrencies like Nano only consume around 0.112 Wh per transaction (vs Bitcoin's 950 kWh). This means that you can make 8 MILLION transactions for the same power as ONE Bitcoin transaction. This is on top of being near instant with no transaction fees, since it uses a Block-Lattice with delegated proof of stake for conflict resolution (instead of a monolithic blockchain). 

&gt; It's been real world tested at 700+ TPS, but at it's current estimated maximum of ~7000 transactions per second (vs Bitcoin's 10-15), you can make 25,000,000 transactions in an hour for the same power usage as 3(!) Bitcoin transactions... 

&gt; All this means that the Nano network is so efficient it can be run on a single wind turbine. Best of all, this technology is already here and working. With technologies like this coming on the scene, I personally find it hard to believe that Bitcoin will be the defacto cryptocurrency of the future. Of course, this is a little different from Ethereum, which seeks to do smart contracts and other things, but I still find it interesting that all of these new technologies are being developed in this space.

**/// GENERAL! ///**

- Confidence picks are all in bold. Sometimes I start feeling something during the card, but I generally only put significant bets on fights when they reach a percentage of 65&amp;#37; or above.

- The percentage indicates my confidence level on the outcome. For most picks, they are straight indicators of how confident I am, not considering odds. For heavy favorites creeping past \-350 or so, I might dial back the enthusiasm. Deciding where to slot everyone is a rough formula, but I've had a lot of success with it.

- The kiwi 🥝 (65&amp;#37;), grapes 🍇 (70&amp;#37; / 75&amp;#37;),🍍 pineapple (80&amp;#37; / 85&amp;#37;), and watermelon 🍉 (90&amp;#37; / 95&amp;#37;) are to denote each tier of confidence. When I consider where to place the picks, there's a bigger mental jump for me going from one fruit to another than, say, the difference between 70&amp;#37; and 75&amp;#37;, or 80&amp;#37; and 85&amp;#37;.

---
---
---
---
---

**/// HOW! ///**

- Obviously, I bet more as the confidence level goes up, but I don't bet in neat units. It sucks when the odds come out and two of the ones you felt good about are -245 and -360. But team those up, and it moves to -125. So I play a lot of short parlays of two or three picks.

- I do most of my betting as the card progresses, reassess when I need to. I try to be careful not to get too greedy, so I might hedge a little bit on a parlay here and there. Small investments can be worth the insurance you get back.

- These picks are intended more as a guide to what I like. I'd recommend considering them against what you like, not as something to blindly tail. But it's your money, do as you wish.

eeiaa0n,nnnko56,18," Laws tends to not be enforced by BTC extremists... Probably because they lack clear vision and are not neutral enough to interpret them. Most of the time a security is identified by 3 elements when we talk cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

1- Sale of a ""token"" or ""a right"" or ""promise""

2- A central entity is the direct beneficiary of the investment or fund raiser, or acquisition.

3- There is an expected return on investment.

&amp;#x200B;

The first element is mostly related to ICOs, in the case of Decred there never was any sale of tokens. It's true that even an airdrop could in some case fit that criteria if there's an agreement or specific rules related to the distribution or it's return.  In the case of Decred there is nothing of the sort.

On the second element, it all depends on the decentralization of the asset. Decred has been highly decentralized from the start (particularly because of the voluntary public airdrop to anyone who wanted to participate, with no agreement or promise of return).  The mining and distribution of new coins in Decred is also highly decentralized by design. Finally, the people behind Decred funded all development and assumed all the risks themselves before it was launched. Which is pretty much the antithesis of an ICO or a security. Also the current dev pool is also decentralized and features many independents individuals and organizations other than the initial ""core"" team.

Finally,  nobody  in or around Decred has or could ever have offered a return of any kind. The value is determined solely by the open market. Someone could argue that PoS is a return on investment.  But this also depends of the specific situation.  In Decred the Pos element is not passive, it's a reward for work being performed (just like Proof of Work).  PoS Miners are required to validate blocks (without them the chain cannot continue), validation/voting is an action that must be performed by an online wallet called randomly within a \~4 month period) they also vote on consensus changes and other issues. If someone is passive and do not provide an online wallet or use a Voting service provider, he won't get a reward because no work was performed on the network.

&amp;#x200B;

And all this is also subject to interpretation as stated by the SEC themselves. I can't find it but a while ago there was a nice chart of multiple traits that you could use to score points on whether an asset would qualify as a security or not.  Even bitcoin scored a few points on it,  most ICOs scored rather highly, and Decred was pretty low like most mined and decentralized coins.  We can also refer to the fact that the SEC stated that not all ICOs are securities just to show how all this is not as clear cut as an extremist would think....  (or hope)

Use nano because you like the approach it takes to the challenges you see in crypto and because you seen an opportunity to develop and help be a part of taking on those challenges.

* There are cheaper alternatives to WU however people use them because they are at every corner for both sender and recipient. 
* The fees are high if you want money to be picked up immediately (yes the ~6% fee will get you the money in minutes). People pay for convenience. Now let's compare it to your solution: you pay 4% and get a voucher and send it to recipient. The recipient has to signup online, redeem voucher, and after he has to FIND a way to get cash out of his BTC. Easy way: a bitcoin ATM that adds an extra 10% fee to withdraw and probably an hour to wait for the ATM to approve your transaction. So total cost: ~14% fee. The hard way: use an online exchange, pay exchange fees, withdraw money to your bank, pay an extra 2-3% currency conversion fee and maybe wait a couple of days to get it.

eem1p8j,thomelsch,31,"I have great respect for William and attended his conference TokenSummit two years in a row. I am also fan of his work/blogs on blockchain and tokeneconomics. I saw his post the moment it came out.

Interestingly, some people (e.g. here on Reddit) say we should do more marketing where others claim we should do less. Based on a lot of data and community feedback from 2018, I think the sweet-spot is somewhere in the middle, with a more focused shift to growing our developer community and communicating when progress is being made instead of what’s coming up in the long-term. From discussions I’ve seen with online, our marketing efforts are often being confused with the business development strategy. For example, establishing partnerships/collaborations for our brand is more of a BD effort where Max will lead the effort this year.

William’s definition of over-marketed is “claims are ahead of delivery or being hyped”. To a certain degree, I agree with his judgement… I feel that too often our team has predicted progress that could not be delivered in the end. We have learned from this the hard way. That is why we put a lot of effort in a detailed new dev roadmap that adds transparency to our progress but doesn’t include hard to predict ETAs.

Although I respect William’s analysis given his experience and knowledge, I am eager to discuss his post in more detail so have reached out to organize a call. I would love to get further insights from him and see where we can improve.

Based on this overview and his blog post, my initial thoughts are:

1.  Lisk is included in this analysis which means we are on his radar. A lot of projects that are considered “competition” are excluded in his classification. I briefly met William in New York, and the fact that he follows the progress of our project is positive. 

2. Most of the projects that are classified as “right-marketed” are exchanges. And most of the “over-marketed” projects are platforms (Lisk, EOS, IOTA, Tron, NEO, Tezos, NEM etc.). Coincidence? No. To me, comparing an exchange (for-profit) with a working product and profitable business model to open-source blockchain platforms in development (non-profit) is comparing apples with pears. The meaning of ‘progress’ for a blockchain platform is totally different from the progress crypto exchanges are making. The differences are clear:

  \- 2018 was the most profitable year for exchanges so far and a tough one for cryptocurrencies. I would argue that it is easier to apply marketing best-practices to a for-profit business model with traditional traits than for a non-profit blockchain project.

  \- The aspect of volatile tokens give projects like Lisk an element which not often has been seen elsewhere. Even during the dot-com bubble the volatile stocks were not mass adopted by average households like cryptocurrencies are theses days.

  \- As Lisk, we are engaging with our “stakeholders/investors” right in the open public (like social channels as Reddit), where Coinbase is dealing with their demanding “stakeholders/investors” more behind closed doors. The effects on the brand are not to be underestimated. Positive news gets blown up, where negativity takes over during this bear market.

  \- Lastly, the community aspect is less present for companies like Circle as it is for blockchain platforms. It is safe to conclude that the platforms have been communicating progress to their communities too aggressively in their race to attract investors but most importantly capture the attention of developer communities around the world. Maybe more collaboration and less competition between projects is the way to move forward.

3. Some people in our community (including here on Reddit) are asking if we are aiming to attract more senior talent on both our dev and marketing teams. EOS is a good example of a project with significant funding and the exposure to attract senior top talent coming from the corporate world. Although they have created significant hype last year and attracted ex-corporate talent, in the eyes of William EOS was not able to market the project correctly, even with a more senior team. To me, there should be a healthy mixture of young blockchain visionaries and senior talent that proved to possess the skills needed to mature a business and scale it into the future. Our HR team is talking to both of those groups to join the project. Based on the bear market last year, there is a flood of experienced blockchain professionals in the job market which we hope to attract to join Lisk this year.

4. Some other thoughts: I don’t agree that Aragon is over-marketed, to me they have a “tech first” approach. I agree that Blockstack and Melonport are good projects that deserve more exposure. I am sure this will come with time. Same for LN and Bitcoin, that don’t have “a marketing team” but instead rely on the community to market the technology. I am looking forward to Bitcoin/LN startups popping up in 2019.

I hope we can use this thread to have a constructive discussion around how marketing should be done in the space. To start off, it would be great if you can post some of your best marketing examples in the space down here.

I will keep an eye on this thread this week and see where I can answer some of your questions together with Mat, Rachel and the others.

Have a great week!

# Starting as a Landlord/Investor

Then in late 2012 to early 2013 Bitcoin started taking off, some of the people I did business with were suddenly Rich, so I started these fresh millionaires with the idea of going in together and buying a bunch of rentals here in Ohio.  


By mid 2013 it was very apparent to me that this thing going of out and finding investors was actually going to work, so I packaged up and sold my search engine optimization business while setting aside about $25,000 to throw in the pot with the other investors. I also allocated another about $5,000 towards legal fees and retaining a lawyer to help me understand the process of accepting investment from an outside Source.

By the end of 2013 I had purchased two rental properties. The first one was a large, but extremely rundown 5 bed 2 bathroom home. After it's all said and done I had $60,000 in it and we rented it out within two days of being on the Market at $1,000 a month. The second property I purchased was a cheap little 3 bed 1 bath for $25,000. I thought at the time all we would have to do would be put a roof on it but we found out that it had been empty for so long that the gas company had abandoned the lines and they need to be redone. Five or six thousand dollars later it was complete and I rented that one out within a week of it being on the market for $650.

So by this point I had spent the princely sum of $90,000 for gross rents of $1,650. If you do the math on that that's a gross return I've almost 20%. Taking this data back to the people that invested with me I said ""let's go all out and buy as much as we can.""

A year-and-a-half later I've gone through a little over $400,000 and money over multiple requests back to the original investors, and was able to buy a total of 18 units with gross rents of approx $10k/mo. Our ongoing costs were about $4,000 per month in taxes, insurance, R&amp;M and Capex. One of the decisions I had made during this time was to plan the business as a 'big business' rather than a small one, and hired a few full-time repair guys. One of the things that I had been told by many landlords was that their #1 expense was ongoing maintenance. Hiring someone full-time worker for $15/hr in my eyes was a much better plan than paying a HVAC/Plumber/Electrician $40-$50/hr on piecemeal work.   


For better or worse, this increased my ongoing costs substantially when the work ran out, so the only real option was to fire my full time or grow.....So I grew!  


A little before the end of the first batch of 18 properties, one of the staff writers from BiggerPockets had reached out to do an article on my journey of buying rentals and it had a pretty decent number of views. I managed to get quite a few emails/calls about it, and one email was essentially a ""Hey, I like what you're doing in Ohio, if you want some money, let me know"".  


I felt like I had stumbled into the first group of guys, so stumbling into another investor was very unlikely so I contacted back and said something like ""Hey, I can use some money, there's a duplex for $52.5k I'm looking at , if you're interested in it, I'll set up a new LLC that you can fund"". Low and behold, 2 weeks later I've opened up a new LLC, a new bank account and there's a princely sum of $60k in there to buy more rentals.  


Then a month later, I find a duplex being auctioned on a street I already have 4 others with no reserve. I manage to win said duplex for $9,500 without having any sort of funding set up. I contacted the investor again and told him about what I had won at auction. My rehab estimate came in at a little under $20k, and he was floored that I could find a livable, cashflowing duplex under $30k with repairs. He wired the money again and hopped on a plane to meet me in person (This was all done on email/phone calls/texts). Impressed by the fact that there was actually a duplex in Ohio that existed like that, he agreed to fund whatever else I could find.  


This took me up to 47 rentals. The catalog, prices and stories behind all these properties is on a youtube video I put out back around early 2017 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVhP0-fzd7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVhP0-fzd7s)  


By this point I'm starting to become very active in our local REIA, attending every single meeting available, having lunch every so often with local landlords, and getting to know all the big players on a personal level.  


By this point people contact me regularly about going in together to buy rentals, I accept only two and turn down quite a few others - Interestingly enough the landlord that kicked us out of the house when I was 6 partners with me on multiple purchases.  


Between 2016 and today, the bread &amp; butter of my good deals are landlords who do a terrible job. Although virtually all of them have built some really good empires of properties, many have become inefficient as time goes on pushing down their values. I've been able to swoop in and purchase quite a few deals off of landlords who have had a very hard time selling due to how poor their management has been.  


In general I work mostly with investors as most banks I talk to hate me. One bank turned me down because (As they stated) ""No one in their right mind would buy so many rentals"". I've found a FEW banks that like what I do, but with one I'm very close to hitting their FDIC limit on loans, so very likely by March I'll hit the limit and be seeking another small bank that has an appetite for rental properties.  


Although I primarily rely on private money, I've tried to expand what I do and have even done a few (Extremely profitable might I add?) seller financed deals.   


I currently manage all 90 rentals myself, although I do have a 3hr/wk person administrate billing/mail. I do continue to employ 2 full-time workers doing all my ongoing R&amp;M and initial rehab on new acquisitions. Having bought 40 rentals in under a year it put us REALLY behind on things so right now I've got 3 different crews working on projects including the two full timers.   


In October I purchased 2 laundromats for some reason which are being re-done as we speak, hoping to open March the 1st. Working with a completely new industry has been extremely interesting. There's good deal of overlap between business and it seems like being able to maintain accounting, marketing and knowing how to work with people helps everything.  


As far as ACTUAL work goes, I'm working 20hrs a week on maintaining my rentals and another 20hr on initial rehabs/looking at deals/networking. My schedule is pretty much a solid 10am(ish) to 6pm(ish) work schedule. Granted there's plenty of days I don't go to the office in the morning, and some days I head out just to hang out with landlords and look at properties while doing all my management from my cell phone.",2019-01-22 22:58:02

I started streaming recently because my friend suggested it to me after I escaped from a Thai prison and lost all my money. I was tortured in the prison and lost everything, even my shoes! I was hospitalized twice and fell off a mountain after avoiding border patrol. I had the Thai mafia closing in on me and I had to make a move. After fleeing across the mekong river and crossing the jungle narrowly avoiding landmines, I reached Laos. I turned myself into the U.S embassy, got a new passport, paid a bribe in Laos, and crossed legally into Vietnam.

My friend agreed to give me some money if I started streaming my life. He's been trying to get me to do this for 2 years now, but finally I agreed(recently). I've had so much fun since i started and I love every one of my viewers and am grateful.

I'm a bit mysterious, I know. I've had a very eventful and strange life. I've petitioned for political issues in California, was a semi-pro gamer, been in movies and TV shows, opened a Camel Safari in India, an English school in Cambodia, taught in China, became a cryptocurrency &amp; Bitcoin trader, and have had many unforgettable experiences all across the world.

That may also explain why MIT has been more welcoming to bitcoin than most other universities -- as in the old plan for a $100 BTC ""airdrop"" to their undergrad students (which apparently was abandoned) and  the occasional coverage on the magazine *MIT Technology Review*.

eergzqh,Fadzter,44,"To all those starting the MTGOX Fud now, in hopes this will bring btc down to the imaginary $2000 they want,

here's why this won't happen:​

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MTGOX claimants will not only get BTC, but also CASH \*\*  in $usd back from the HUGE pool of USD money left behind from the MTGox Estate.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the breakdown simplified:

\------------------------------------------------

Each claimant will receive around 17% of their BTC claim + cash of (around $600 x their btc claim).

In other words, if you have 100 btc with mtgox at the time of fall, you will get:

17 btc as btc ( 17% of 100btc = 17btc)  +  $60,000 cash ( $600 x 100 initial btc claim = $60,000)

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore if they were in bad financial situation and needed cash,they just got a big sum they can get by with, so less reason to just liquidate their btc the day they get them back. ​

ADD to that, those who don't desperately need the cash,  may actually use this big cash windfall they just got to BUY more cheap btc which will help

(1) offset the price decline of those selling or

(2) contribute to driving price up.

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO,

You are forgetting that many of these people are BELIEVERS in Bitcoin, they were one of the first who invested in btc given they are in MTgox exchange.

Many are HODLers,  after having waited so long for their btc, and \*\* after seeing how high btc could go\*\*, they probably will refuse to sell their btc for cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't if I were them. And I'm sure many of them are like me.

**Official:**

Officially it's only a test if ABN AMRO users are interested in a Bitcoin Wallet. 500 ABN AMRO customers created the test group.

The idea is that people are interested in Bitcoin, but are scared of using them, because of all the negative news about hacking and lost of coins. 

The bank will take care of your Bitcoins, and you will be insured for a loss up to 6 000 Euro. 

You control your wallet, but the bank controls your coins.

The biggest problem is that the Dutch Supervisors on bank activity, AFM and DNB, already came with negative advice.

The statement from AFM is that regular banks never can work together with crypto. If they do it, then they will give the impression that you can trust crypto.

For the official bank supervisors, crypto is closer to a scam than to a trustful currency.

**Of the record:**

ABN AMRO believes in Bitcoin and their customers are really eager to adopt them.

Only problem is then the negative vision from AFM and DNB.

But representatives of the bank, are in negotiation with the supervisors, to change that negative vision.

If you need to make money you could rob a house. Try scouting out big areas of houses and see if/when people are home.

You could also go the safer route and steal whatever is in their backyard (quicker too).

There's loads of bikes around that aren't locked. Most I've seen at a bikelot near a beach. Stealing a car is very hard, is very risky, and takes a lot of effort to part it out.

You can make a little money from parting out a used car that you've legit bought if you know what you're doing. 

Then you can also grow your own weed. There's plenty of guides on how to do it. Buy some seeds online and get to planting. If you're feeling lucky you can try finding unused land that you can plant them in outside for a proper big, cheap grow. You can then sell this on the streets personally, sell it to a ""distributor"" (or be the distrubotor to different dealers, but it's a bit more risky), or sell it on the dark web. Don't know where on the dark web you can sell it since the silk roads been shutdown for a few years and it's a weird place.

If you get cash in hand, use as much as possible of it on your expenses so that you can save whatever legit money you have in a proper bank account. If you want to put it in your bank you can buy (preferably used) things for cash and sell them via a bank transfer. Bitcoin can be traded for money into your bank, or you could buy things such as gift cards or electronics on newegg.

eet2p00,rfng,42,"Quiet in here, eh? I remember someone once said :

I think that the particular project that I mention, the one behind my name (OmiseGO - OMG Network) is a game changer particularly in the field of financial inclusion because it is essentially the original Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin. It is essentially the original PayPal vision. It is essentially the Ripple vision even before Ripple was a blockchain project. Ripple was actually a concept for many years before Jed McCaleb and some other people decided that a blockchain would be a suitable way to implement this and the idea that time for Ripple was to .. Let me start again - 

The idea for PayPal was to make interconnection between all the currencies that people are already using to allow them to pay each other online. 

The idea behind Bitcoin was to take this but use decentralized, by a decentralized computing platform to prevent the double spending problem, which was one of the biggest problem at the time for how do we make a kind of accounting system that we don't need to trust any special party which you know, can have some problems as people at the 2008-2009 years remember quite well, and the innovation was the consensus algorithm proof-of-work and then the requirement was that there be one currency that runs on it, that would become kind of a world currency suitable for microtransactions, suitable for very low cost and easy payments. 

The Ripple vision was how do we take network currencies like a decentralized currency like Bitcoin basically, and how do we .. originally it wasn't like that, it was more along the fiat side, how do we connect all the fiat currencies and make people able to get in and out in an, OK semi-decentralized way with the idea that the issuance of the fiat in the blockchain would all be IOUs, would be debt assets and one really interesting innovation of Ripple at the time was what's called the path-finding model where users would be able to hold any currency that's been issued by some trusted gateway. Ripple is essentially a consortium chain of trusted institutions and people would be able to pay for something in the currency they hold and the system would automatically route the money and the recipient would receive the funds in whatever the recipient wants, completely invisible to each other what currency is being asked, what currency is being received.

And so, the OMG network project is 100% public infrastructure project that aims to accomplish all of these things with every single part of this monetary flow and exchange process, completely decentralized, no less decentralized than Bitcoin, so .. no reliance on trusted 3rd parties, no institutions that necessarily sit in the middle, although there are places where institutions can sit that will help facilitate this extremely low cost, fully on-chain decentralized exchange using the plasma architecture by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon - its' kind of like lightning network for Ethereum, essentially, scalability of smart contracts. 

So with this architecture, the idea is to be able to allow a farmer in Bhutan who has a mobile phone to have the same amount of financial sovereignty and power as a top-level banking executive has today.",2019-01-24 09:27:07

I'm only spending a lot of time on this topic lately because I think the future of r/ethtrader is at stake.  That may not mean much to some of you, but there are a handful of us who enjoy coming here, contributing valuable content, and learning from others.

We are a trading / investing / shit-posting sub of 200K+ people, undertaking some bold experiments in self-governance, and now economics. The implications may seem trivial to you, but how we think about some of these issues now could affect how blockchain is used for governance in all kinds of social media (and other) services in the future.  And during the next bull cycle, I won't be surprised if our membership swells to 500K.

That is exciting, but also comes with some responsibility to ensure that we do so in a thoughtful manner, not a reckless one.  If we act without careful consideration and just ""see what happens"" with poorly crafted experiments and no processes to guide them, this place could end up like r/bitcoin (censored, corporate / special-interest owned), or worse.  And the power of that sub / propaganda machine is exceptionally powerful.

BTW, if you want to know why I think governance for sale is gameable and will almost lead to bad outcomes, you can read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/donuttrader/comments/aj6wfm/preparing_for_a_potential_halt_on_donut_transfers/eeu4ycx/).  I'm not the only one to say it, and I don't want to speak for Vitalik, but these types of models are similar to the type he warns against in on-chain governance platforms like EOS, which has been an abject governance failure in my opinion.  [Even yesterday in his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/aiwoxu/daily_general_discussion_january_23_2019/eergafc/) when he spoke about how Donuts are a cool experiment, he warned that we need to think about how those tokens might be used for governance to avoid issues like vote buying and collusion.

I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.

That's one reason why it's so ridiculous to see people trying to highlight and emphasize the ""cash"" part of Bitcoin's whitepaper subtitle; electronic cash existed before Bitcoin, and what makes Bitcoin special is that it's **decentralized** electronic cash.

Satoshi understood things very deeply, and made a number of design decisions that most people (even those who consider themselves ""well informed about crypto/blockchains"") don't yet appreciate. You've found a great quote that helps to show a little of what Satoshi thought about Bitcoin, but it's also worth remembering his other quote: ""I'm better with code than with words"".

Satoshi deliberately programmed the blocksize limit as a hard consensus rule, then went on to oppose and discourage others from trying to ""patch out"" this consensus rule without community-wide consensus and a long-lead-time, multiple-precautions-taken update.

One is that 2017 was the last in a fairly consistent stream of bubbles.  Bitcoin dies a slow and uneventful death.  


 The other is that we will see another bubble in the next 3-7 years.  So really, what does it matter at this point if you buy at $3000 or $2000?   If there's another major bubble, you're going to be expecting prices past $20K.  


I just see a lot of potential upside at these prices.  Not much downside.  Bitcoin is not just going to disappear.  And it has already created a ton of millionaires, 8 digits, 9 digits, even 3 comma figures of wealth for some people.  Many of them have cashed out a significant portion of their investment at much higher prices than today.    


Imagine you had $100M in cash, and the very asset which gave you your fortune has now dropped down to 10% of the price you sold at.  How could you not throw another $10M at it?  This isn't 2014-15 again.  Crypto has made some people generational amounts of wealth.  These same people are now managing their own portfolios and likely portfolios of other rich people.

I would even pay $1000s to $10000s in Bitcoin, to have even a 30 minute discussion about the future and artificial general intelligence with David Silver, or Dennis Hassabis on philosophy, various works such as ""Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies"", great read btw.

The progress has been rather impressive, from AlphaGo to AlphaStar:

A few thoughts regarding AI ethics research - Future thinking.

1) Give the AI a maximizing score goal in a Brick out game, at first it will miss the ball a lot, then start hitting it at times. Later on, it will master the game as good as a human pro and then surpass this. The interesting part is, if there are any game bugs or exploits that a human could never find or think of. Exploiting these for the purpose of the score achieves the purpose of the AI's initial goal. And if the AI had more control via more powerful, it would probably determine rewriting/deleting the game with a score of 9999999999999999999 is the most optimal.

In a way this goes against what the human's creators intended for the game, per se going outside the box and cheating.

2) AlphaGo played like a human, then out of nowhere placed a stone on the 2nd match the 37th move. Where Lee Sedol got up and walked straight out of the room. Unsuspecting and surprising. AI can be surprising and unexpecting.

3) Training AlphaGo on human games, makes it's play seem just like a human player, further note one of the commentators mentioned ""It plays just like a human"", AlphaZero on the other hand, with no training on human games, will play in a more alien way per se.

The ultimate goal of DeepMind as seen on the twitter headlines of DeepMind, ""...Building Artificial General Intelligence"". One of Nick Bostrom's Ted talks as Nick mentioned, defining X as in goal to the artificial general intelligence and having that goal in alignment with humanity rather then X not aligned, and the mentions of the Greek mythology of the king wishing everything he touches turns to gold. Ends up backfiring, as he touches his food, daughter, and all that turns to gold.

I argue that, having x aligned with humanity or not aligned can both be bad in the hands of an artificial general intelligence agent.

Once artificial general intelligence is solved in the future, one may relay desires onto this AI, on the following: ""Make our lives better/improve well-beingness"", without anticipating the consequences fully. For example, Nick Bostrom's statement of ""Make me smile,"" the first weak artificial intelligence, may determine telling jokes on the stage is the most optimal for making people laugh, and smile. However later on, determine that permanently locking people's faces into beaming smiles is more optimal metaphorically like a strengthening of game ELO score going from 1500 to 4000.

Humans have brain chemicals like Dopamine - reward signal, Serotonin - regulation of mood, well-being and happiness, Oxytocin - social bonding. An Agent with the goal of improving human well-beingness, the most optimal method may be to develop ways/technology via brain implants to regulate dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin via ""Pleasure zombies"".

Even more complicated carefully thought out parameters lead to ""deeper traps"", as such stating ""It's not about the chemicals"" It's about human values, and our lives, and humanity. An strong agent may determine that Elon's musk idea of neural links, matrix like pods to contain and restrain our movement. And a feedback of a virtual relaity utopia, is more optimal than making our world a better place. Virtual reality prison per se.

So DeepMind's statement of: ""solve intelligence and **use** it to **make the world a better place""** \- Your not really in the long-run leading the world to a better place.

Your ethical division of the DeepMind team, needs to expand to more people and areas, if your holy grail goal is ""To build artificial general intelligence"", with philosophers, future thinkers, and so on. I would suggest to develop artificial general intelligence towards a more human brain, and less alien base approach. Having a human brain develop and expand itself into a superintelligent version is much better then having a superintelligent spider with iffy x-goals and parameters.

The more people that takes an approach to this, the better. Consider expanding your ethical division to many more branches, and people first, before just carelessly aiming for the holy grail of ""building artificial general intelligence""

ef0a2hb,Worldf1re,158,"Originally posted by /u/Azuaron but by far the most probable turnout of events, imo.

&gt;I'm 4.

&gt;I become the most depressed and intelligent pre-K child in the history of the world, due to the abrupt loss of my wife and children. My parents don't understand what's happening, and I don't tell them, because it sounds absolutely crazy. I am not taken to a psychiatrist for years because we don't have insurance and can't afford it out of pocket.

&gt;I have behavioral problems at school. No one can deny my seemingly preternatural intelligence, but I'm so bored by the required work that, instead of doing what's assigned, I make up and solve my own calculus problems. I write code in programming languages that don't exist yet. I do not have access to a computer, and frequently demand access to a computer. My grades tank, I'm often sent to the principal's office for disrupting class. But, this is America, so I graduate grade after grade after grade. My fourth grade teacher recognizes how much I already know, and feeds me high school textbooks. It's a good year. The next year returns to normal, and crushes me.

&gt;In 8th grade, my mom's insurance coverage shifts, and psychiatric issues are finally covered. I go to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been living retrograde for about a decade. The sharp edges of grief have somewhat dulled, but the boredom of an adult living as a child has not. I extract a promise from the psychiatrist. A promise not to tell my parents, or my teachers, or the police, FBI, or anyone what I'm about to tell him. He agrees.

&gt;I tell him I've been transplanted back into my own life from 2018, that I should be 411 with a wife and kids, and I've been dealing with this alone since I was 4. He doesn't believe me. I write him some computer code in versions of languages that don't exist yet. I write calculus problems and polar equations that I shouldn't understand. He thinks I'm a prodigy, but crazy.

&gt;I tell him George W. Bush will win the Presidential election. He thinks I'm guessing. I'm shouting now. I scream at him about 9/11, one year away. He's no longer laughing. I've made a mistake. He thinks I'm dangerous. He thinks I am planning 9/11. I try to backpedal, to say that it's Al Qaeda. He asks me if Al Qaeda speaks to me. I know I've lost him.

&gt;They put me on anti-psychotics. It kills my mood, stunts my mind, ruins my enthusiasm for everything. I'm no longer ""depressed"" or ""acting out"", so the treatment is hailed as a success. I get regular checkups from the psychiatrist.

&gt;9/11 happens. I'm dragged into a meeting with my parents, the psychiatrist, a police officer, and two men in suits. My parents don't understand what's happening. They try and get me to talk, but I refuse. They have all internet traffic from my house, some of which is embarrassing, but none of which is incriminating. I demand to be taken off the drugs and allowed to return to baseline. They agree. I am under house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I can go to school and home. I don't care; I never made friends, even my old friends from my past life were too juvenile.

&gt;A month later, a repeat of the meeting. How did I know about 9/11? I ask for a lawyer. They deny me one. I shrug and stop speaking. They get me a lawyer.

&gt;I tell my lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

&gt;I tell my new lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

&gt;I tell my new lawyer everything. She doesn't believe me. But says she'll work on my behalf as if she did. I agree.

&gt;We tell them nothing. The house arrest is a violation of my rights, and the Patriot Act doesn't exist yet (barely) for them to be able to hold me on suspicion of anything. My lawyer threatens to go public. They back off.

&gt;My freshman year grades are terrible. I realize I need my grades up if I want to go to the right college to find my wife, so I double down on my school work. I go from a D average screw off to acing every class. My teachers are confused, but relieved.

&gt;It's senior year. I apply to only one college. My parents think I'm crazy. I get in. I apply to the Honors Program. The Honors Program, where I met my wife nearly 30 years ago on my personal timeline, where I'd live in the same dorm building as her, and work late on the same engineering team as her, the time when our relationship began.

&gt;I don't get in. My grades are too low, after tanking my freshman year. I'm going to the right college, but I can't replicate the circumstances of our meeting.

&gt;There's hope, but it's a slim hope. I go to college. I know what clubs she goes to, what friends she has. I contrive to be wherever she is. I spend months in her orbit, working up to asking her out. How do you ask out someone you were with for 12 years, then lost 14 years ago, who doesn't remember you at all? How do you approach her with the baggage of your entire relationship that she has no knowledge of?

&gt;Eventually I do it. I ask her out. She says no. I don't understand. My entire world is crashing down around me. She is my wife, doesn't she understand? I go crazy, it scares her and she runs away. I try to follow her, but she hits a campus safety panic button.

&gt;With my history of ""mental illness"", I'm involuntarily committed. I spend a month in the asylum.

&gt;Two men in suits ""visit"" me one day. They say they can get me out. But, I have to tell them about 9/11. It's the FBI agents from all those years ago. I've given up. I tell them everything. They get me out. I'm setup with a nice house in the middle of nowhere, a good computer, state of the art internet. And I have to keep feeding them information about the future.

&gt;In my free time, I'm a software engineering consultant. The FBI pays my expenses, so anything I make is spare money. January 2, 2009 I've built a GPU beast of a computer. January 3, 2009 I start mining BitCoin. I mine a lot. I mine far more than anyone expected someone could mine so early. The BitCoin economy never takes off, because no one else can get in on the early mining with normal computing hardware. ""Cryptocurrency"" fails before it can even get a start.

&gt;Two years later the FBI approaches me, looking for more information about the future. I've got nothing left; I've told them everything I can remember.

&gt;They kick me out, and repossess all the computers they bought me, and ""appropriate as evidence"" all the ones I bought myself.

&gt;I've got nothing left. I wander the streets of small towns, hitchhiking half-hazardly. I lay down on a park bench one night.

&gt;The next morning, I don't get up.",2019-01-26 20:36:36

eeznd28,noveler7,102,"Regarding the anti-r/nba bias on this sub

We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate r/nba.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate this sub? The obvious answer: you didn't read it in its prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never read r/nba in its prime.

And because you didn't read it in its prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into old posts and read the top rated comments. But here's the thing: true redditing isn't done in top rated comments. The moment somebody brings up ""Jokic predictions"" or ""the anti-Kobe bias pasta"" I know they know nothing about r/nba.

r/nba's game cannot be encapsulated by one post. It's the second greatest sub ever, and one of the 5 best forums to ever grace the internet.

So when I hear somebody say that FiveThirtyEight is better than r/nba, I laugh, because I know that anybody who read r/nba in its prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have read forums for a significant amount of time, so I know that r/nba is better.

You might be jealous of r/nba's sidebar, or jealous of its status as having the greatest flair options in reddit history, or whatever. Unless you're a *Sports Illustrated* fan who read about basketball in the 90s, or a *ESPN The Magazine* fan who read about basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win shitposting looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that r/nba isn't even a top 100 sub.

Im going to get downvoted to fuck... but here is whats going on... 

All of us are all sheeple in this manipulated game. We are always the last to hear the news, the last to act, and the first to get dumped on. You are kidding me if events like the ETF cancellation gets released to everyone at the same time. No, someone always *knows* before we find out.. 

The real players are the exchanges, the ones launching ETFs, Futures, Bakkt, development companies, et cetera... they have this market cornered and are laughing at the speculators who are holding heavy bags. Is it even remotely in doubt, when a company like DCG [has a stake](https://dcg.co/portfolio/) in almost every crypto based company/product/service, ranging from BitGo, to Abra to Bitpay to Blockchain.info to Ledger wallet to Coinbase?  


While many of us wish there is an easy way up and we will head back to 6k or 10k just like that, it just isnt going to happen. The reason BTC started going up in 2017 was an initial wave of usage - many reputed companies including Reddit, microsoft, steam, fiverr started accepting BTC back then. The transaction fee fiasco meant all of them were fast to stop accepting bitcoin and none of them have come back on board. No one new has come in to take their place either, as far as adoption is concerned. BTC still doesnt scale, LN is far from ready and the best UI/UX with LN is when you use custodial services linked to LN apps, which is just as worse as not having your keys at all. You only keep hearing memes about ETF, Bakkt, starbucks etc.. 

Social image of crypto is at an all time low. ICOs, hacks and scams have absolutely destroyed any reputation crypto had. BTC fees and txn time from Dec 2017 is still a thing to laugh about, so is energy consumption and the number of people who have lost in this game - all of them tell their family and friends to never get into crypto. The only way up is when we have something new that gets public attention, something can actually gets adopted and used as currency. Public perception, even within crypto, needs to change from loving and blindly following everything Bitcoin devs create to going up in arms at their efforts to make BTC unusable as a base layer currency. However this wont happen immediately, its a slow painful process. Public perception is always fickle though and it will change over time. No one remains king forever, this is something that every field/industry has seen - some kings live long, some short, but they all eventually get replaced. 

As bottom of the pyramid speculators we can only hope that the next coin that gets mainstream attention doesnt fuck up the exact same way BTC did - implode spectacularly when all the spotlight was on it. ",2019-01-28 22:27:16

Disconnect the web cam and mic from new laptop.

Go to public WiFi to boot up laptop.

Download Linux image to usb. 

Download raspien image for your sd cards so you can build a tor/vpn router with the pi using the WiFi cards.

Download tails to usb as well as qubes/whonix.

Format the hard drive of laptop.

Install Your choice of Linux to the hdd or ssd of new laptop ( I suggest using qubes with whonix but you can create your own distribution to be safe if you’re a nerd) but you will not be browsing the web on this distro anyways so whatever you want.

Plug in vpn tor router

Reboot into your tails live usb.

Spoof MAC address.

sign up for an anonymous VPS using bitcoin through Monero using a service like xmr.to or use a prepaid gift card you bought using xmr.to. (This converts xmr to btc so that your btc transaction remains 100% anonymous) never use that wallet again or for anything else. (Xmr.to should be used for all btc purchase but never use the same wallet twice)

Now you can set up a VPN using your new VPS. Better yet create multiple VPS to route your VPN through multiple IP addresses just know that you will slow down your connection speed with each one.

Never use that public WiFi again.

Find new public WiFi.

Always boot into tails, don’t forget to spoof your MAC address again and use tor when browsing the internet, and only from public WiFi. Always plug in your tor/vpn pi and don’t forget to route traffic through your personal VPN that you built using anon VPS.


Now you are ready to browse reddit / check email but
Type your search queries and urls into a notepad on your tails desktop first and copy and paste them into your browser instead of typing things in your browser to spoof cyber bio metrics.

Also, don’t forget to host your own encrypted email server that stores all of your email on your own hard drive and don’t forget to encrypt your drives. You can do this using your VPS and your hard drive or usb stick.

Use end to end encryption for all instant messaging and email. 

Use fake information for everything. Never use credit card. Pay with bitcoin or better yet Monero or prepaid gift cards bought with crypto (xmr.to) grin and beam look like they might be good options for purchases now as well.

Delete your anon VPS after each session and create a new one each time you want to use internet especially if your doing anything sketch.

Use different public WiFi for each session. Never use the same user name twice. Never use the same email twice. 

Do whatever you need to do online and then dump the laptop into a barrel of acid and drop it into a lake. Bonus points for running over it with your car then microwaving all the pieces, first.

Rinse and repeat as needed.

Also be aware that this only works to stay anonymous if nobody is looking for you. The best way to stay anonymous is to become a ghost, stay a ghost, and to not draw attention to yourself. 

Facebooks? Instagram? Google? WhatsApp? Snapchat? No.

Signal is the only messenger that you need and if someone contacts you any other way reply using signal or encrypted email.

Create yourself a VOIP phone number to give out instead of using your real one which should be a prepaid phone (homeless guy can get you hooked up just be sure to compensate him for booking you up with all your gear otherwise he will just steal it the first time)

Bonus points for creating fake personas/identities instead of random info when filling out forms.

There is one very important take away here however. Bitcoin is not an anonymous cryptocurrency, and most of you still think that it is. The fricken ledger can be viewed in the clear. Unless your opsec is air tight every step of the way, it is not super difficult for a determined agency to track your transactions.

ef8skpa,b1tcc,40,"I know some of you will not like the comment bellow (probably this one too) but I think it's better to expect the worse and if necessary be surprised for the better, instead of not being prepared and be surprised for the worse. Some of you aren't new and are into cryptocurrencies for more than one year, I'm sure you have passed through last year's markets, and previous year's markets, etc.

Last month I had prepared some of you, the ones that cared at least, for the $0.09 lows of a couple of days ago but some of you didn't listened and now are emotionally affected, which is understandable. This last two days people have been accusing SDF from crashing the price of Lumens but the crash is on all cryptocurrency markets. Do you think Lumens are that influential to crash entire cryptocurrency market? I'm sorry but no, the only cryptocurrency that does that is Bitcoin and mainly due to the reason that it's used as a trading pair for all cryptocurrencies, vastly because of exchanges listings and earlier days of cryptocurrency trading, because of first move advantage and no mainstream availability of stable coins since the beginning of cryptocurrency trading.

There was a few sad articles that grew from misinformation, good journalist is done with research, intellectual research which normally offers the subjects a chance to comment on the matter before and after being published. Good journalism isn't sensationalist, or done by reading some dude's tweet and then start spreading misinformation which drives persons irrationally, persons that aren't emotionally prepared, persons who even when presented with the proper facts won't accept it immediately. Wether SDF send Lumens to exchanges or not, it didn't drove the price down at that time and it isn't currently driving the price down by itself either.

There's two aspects contributing to the recent downtrend, other than the bearish cycle. First, starting in January 28 the IRS will begin accepting paper and electronic tax returns, which officially sets the tax season open. Second, the Lunar New Year starts February 15 which is known for helping in frequent exchanges from cryptocurrency to fiat, namely by asian citizens, to fund festive spendings. During January it's normal to Bitcoin start dropping value, and you should expect it to keep dropping till the first week of February passes. The pattern is start gaining value in middle February until maintain a restricted small range till March.

Nothing is certain, things can change for the better or for the worse and I'm sorry if this will be hard to read but the bottom is not here yet, a bottom can only be called many days, weeks, or even months after the fact - normally one can have an idea if there's a bounce with a pattern in V shape. Now, this pattern may not happen due to the low volume of current transactions but I would be prepared for the worse. There's also the possibility that some big news are releases that will FOMO everyone and then things can also change with an imminent bounce. This is not an advice to buy or to sell, this are thoughts for you to take into consideration - if you're not emotionally prepared for such situations then don't look at prices and don't daily trade. If you believe in the blockchain future and Stellar technology/partners then you should think in long term goals and ignore the bear cycle, you have many ways to recover or protect yourself.

Everything will be okay, stuff always get better in one way or another. Please be calm, respect everyone in the sub, maintain your mind occupied with other stuff if it will help. Again, r/Stellar is yours, you help making the general feeling present in the sub.

Have a great day!

This is the first of three reports for my current funding period, which was made possible by the generosity of the Monero community through donations and in spirit.

Monero researchers and developers have been busy preparing for the spring network upgrade, and we are finalizing changes that you can expect to see released in a few months. A great deal of planning, research, simulation, coding, and testing has gone into this process. [Payment IDs](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/299) are set to be removed over the next two releases, which will make transactions simpler, smaller, and more uniform. We've simplified some of the [underlying cryptography](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/5052) that powers our confidential transaction scheme to make transactions a bit smaller. Bulletproofs have received many additional [speedups and optimizations](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commits/master/src/ringct/bulletproofs.cc) that decrease verification time by up to 60% (and possibly more) from the last release. Our dynamic block size algorithm will be updated to more robustly handle spikes in transaction volume. And there are plenty more updates in the next release, so stay tuned.

Led by the esteemed Justin Ehrenhofer of community fame, we've begun releasing a video series called [Breaking Monero](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxLNPJeEjPXOke55i5AIXA/videos) that goes in depth talking about weaker aspects of Monero's structure and operation, and how we've improved over our history. Each episode features a topic, like unusual ring sizes or chain reactions, that an adversary might use to analyze the Monero blockchain. We discuss the history of Monero analysis, practical recommendations for users, and how researchers continue to iterate on improvements to the protocol. More episodes are on the way!

As you likely read this, I am participating in the [Stanford Blockchain Conference](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19), an outstanding academic conference on applied cryptography. [Last year's event](https://cyber.stanford.edu/bpase18) featured a host of presentations and results very relevant to Monero, and this year promises to continue this trend.

Other important but less prominent areas of ongoing work include the ring decoy output selection algorithm, alternate ring signature schemes, interactive and non-interactive refund and return address constructions, an upcoming paper on graph analysis, and more!

For the next month, expect additional simulations and formal planning for the spring network upgrade, code for a Bulletproofs multi-party computation protocol, improved documentation, transaction relay simulations, the usual literature and code review, and many other mathematical odds and ends.

And now, on to Sarang's Reading Corner, a list of some of the interesting papers I've come across recently in my ongoing literature review. The appearance of a paper in this list does not imply that I endorse it, or even necessarily agree with its contents or conclusions. These are in no particular order.

&gt;I presume you know (the real reason) why the bank is no longer willing to process fiat payments for you, and why Kraken has to close your account. The recommendation is to withdraw your funds in crypto before they are frozen indefinitely. Of course, you don't have to buy crypto with your fiat, or even withdraw it.

eff88yu,HighGuyTim,656,"There’s a strong chance this whole thing is bullshit. Couple of things don’t really add up. 
1) He stated in a couple of replies that he “*brute forces*” passwords. Which in a lot of modern security passwords (gmail and tumblr for sure), you can’t brute force before you raise a flag. I mean seriously, the amount of possible passwords is fucking ridiculous to think of. And he has done this so many times? Let’s say he *was* able to brute force (*he wouldn’t be, but we will say he did*) the amount of time it would take to crack one password would take some time. Let alone “*a lot*”.

2) Bitcoin. Buying and selling bitcoin isn’t like quickpaying your buddy $20 through Zelle. There is an entire process of adding money to an account, buying fractions of the coin, going through another site to exchange, and then trading, and finally having to actually sell that fraction to have “realized profit”. Now it’s been a minute since I’ve checked into this stuff, I put $100 in when crypto was really getting hyped and just cut my losses and left. But there was no “*quick payout*” system. It takes time. I mean he is having the pedos make an account, purchase the fraction of the coins, and then exchange it to him, which he then would have to sell, and then he would have to transfer that money from bitcoin to his bank account.

3) He claims to purchase “100k+” people info. That’s a shitton of people. Like a shit ton. He would have to go through each one and see if there was anything of value. Even if you have a copy + paste method of just the email, that’s a shit ton of people. That takes so much time, you are just wasting your time.

4) What he is doing is straight up illegal. Idc if it’s against pedos, that doesn’t mean it’s right. He is claiming to not only blackmail, but log into people’s personal accounts and look at their personal information. He claims he only cares if they are pedos, but this means by saying that he also accesses other peoples info too. I’m pretty sure he said he is a teenager also, from a poor family, so it’s really not smart of him to be transferring “*$32,000*” of unreported money to his bank account. Hello IRS. 


My guess is he is a teenager making up a story, or he tricked some dude into giving him a decent chunk of money. So many things just don’t add up/don’t exist in the real world.

efd3rzj,Nooku,120,"&gt; **tl;dr** Blockstream took over ( = bought ) the communication channels, mainly /r/Bitcoin and Bitcointalk.org , to steer the direction of the tech + manipulate the public opinion.

That's kinda the reason why you see me going all ""wtf, stop doing that"" whenever I see moderators on Ethereum subreddits censoring, threatening or silencing the userbase because I don't want to see that kind of behavior become the accepted norm, and in turn form a precedent for setting up a hostile takeover when the opportunity for a split presents itself.

Please do realize, if a future technical discussion splits up the community in camp A and camp B, you **do not** want the admins and moderators to have the power to ban people of an opposing camp by using trivial rule-breaches as **an excuse** for the silencing opposing views and steering the discussion in 1 and only 1 direction. 

If that sounds far fetched, well, that is exactly what happened on /r/Bitcoin in 2013 and it changed the future of Bitcoin forever, at the cost of itself, at the reward of Ethereum.

what makes it so different from anything before it is that it solved a problem called the double spending problem

basically an attacker can duplicate a file and then he can use that currency twice because nothing is there to declare which one is legit or which one is fake

traditionally we relied on a trusted third party like a bank to say, ok, this money has been spent and you cant spend it again

bitcoin solves this by using blockchain, which shares all transactions ever made with everyone, so that they know something has been spent already. but! who gets the right to declare what goes on the transaction sheet? can't anyone just say ""lol person A just sent me $1 million""? thats why bitcoin requires you to solve a really hard math problem to make all the transactions made in the past 10 minutes or so legit. the assumption is that no one would solve such a problem AND make an attempt to steal someones money thats literally visible to everyone

&gt; Moreover, 58% of all cryptocurrency mining is done in China and is typically powered by coal plants. Using the life-cycle impact-assessment methodology, I estimate that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining is comparable to that of some 6.8 million average European inhabitants — or as much as 43.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (see ReCiPe and IPCC 2013 methods, respectively, at go.nature.com/2nn7zzj).

However, Fonteinis seems to have ignored the contents of another another article he cites (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2965436) by Hileman and Rauchs, who seem to have done due diligence. Hileman and Rauchs state:


&gt; The cryptocurrency mining map in Figure 88 shows that mining facilities are mainly concentrated in locations where most of the key drivers discussed above are satisfied.7 Mining facilities are primarily located in North America, Northern and Eastern Europe as well as in China. In fact, China is the country that hosts most mining facilities and uses the highest power consumption of all countries for cryptocurrency mining. A zoom into China shows that mining facilities are concentrated in remote areas where both electricity and land are very cheap. A significant concentration can be observed in the Sichuan province, where miners have struck deals with local hydroelectric power stations to access cheap electricity.

Here are the weekly numbers on localbitcoin volume:

https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/ALL

So, there's $160 million every month of money looking to acquire physical bitcoin for real use.

I DCA in $500/month, and there are a lot of people who put in a lot more than that.

I put in about $5/day between May and June. Many people did a lot more than that.

You don't need to put in 8x. The network just needs to grow. See Metcalfe's law. Consider the real world value of email with 5.8 million users and 500 million users. 5.8 million users is just the system getting bootstrapped.

$1 million / BTC by 2020 was always unrealistic. Still, 27 billion in cost to run a network worth 20 trillion ain't bad.
