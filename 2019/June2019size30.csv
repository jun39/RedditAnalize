eporndf,Bitcoin1776,81,"I had a bro... like cool dude, but total bro. Read 4 hour body, 4 hour work week and really took it to heart. Travels the world, and I mean the world, surfs - all the time - looks immaculate, and super happy.

His income is sort of hit and miss. 4 hour work week... I mean he's serious about that. Even in crypto, he's what I'd consider noob, and that's all he did for like a year... but only an hour or two a week of studying.

Mother fucker got into ICO pumping. Like all in... guy might of had $50k (can't imagine more), and by selling ICO's to noobs he ended up with a million. Straight Million. I can't lie, I am mad jealous. He moves to the philippians, becomes a legal resident, and now he can sell crypto tax free.

But ut oh... the bear. Bear market hits, and when BTC was down to $6.5k he told me he had already lost $900,000 - I'm like geez guy. Not a sweat on his bro, laughs it off. No money to his name (per usua'), living in 3rd world countries, surfing, and doing a pinch of programming.

Even then he wouldn't tolerate a discussion over an hour on 'crypto'. Making and losing $1 Mil, he still didn't care. That 4 hour work week was serious shit.

I know a LOT of people who lost over a million in the bear markets - a lot. I got super lucky... I moved into BTC at the right time, traded down *just a little* (like increased my BTC 10 to 15%), but most importantly caught the last good ICO for a mega pump.

All the same, I still couldn't help the dude. He treated my 30+ hours a week studying equal to his 2 hours - like instead of taking notes, he was like we are 'trading tips' (we weren't). But this is common. People can't respect knowledge unless you force them (via fees).

Totally rambling, but I've seen a lot of alt coiners lose 90% - and for big, million dollar money, left with a year or two salary, if that. Many going busto.

I saw a young dude crying over $9k the other day on rBitcoin. Ya man, I know it hurts... but if you got income, you going to get better. These dude had retirement for 2, lost it all, and moved on.

I bet they're getting back into now. Doubtfully wiser. It's just a game. Some take it too serious, others too light... But when I see down $5k and so forth, I'm like bro... imagine losing 10 houses worth of dollars in a year.

And not giving a fuck, cause these guys don't. It could suffocate me, but hope is a hell of a thing. It took mad hope to buy Bitcoin, and alts in 2016. One guy I know had $300 into $0.03 Ethereum tokens... that's 10,000 tokens, like $2.5 Mil today, virtually free.

So long as you got hope, it fucking weird how the world can play out. The biggest losers in life are the ones that are convinced everything sucks.

I got a guy working 40+ hrs weekly, no *meaningful* raise in 15 years, with a sucky home life, and no heroes. He's goes as far as to resent the work of greats. Boy has security, but he has no vigor, nothing inside.

He escapes into Magic. Like so many of the downers, he plays games instead of expressing and striving for his wants. Men fall victim to this with surprising ease, that and buffets ;)

I tell him bought Bitcoin, when the time is right. I tell him *just* $10k.. I tell him, he could have hope. I tell him I can get him better work. I tell him let's build together.

No. Video games and fantasy. Life is too dreary to wake up and stand to attention.

I'd rather lose a million and have hope than die a loser 'cause I felt I was not good enough to live. Money. Money is nothing against an ounce of fire.",2019-06-01 10:10:22

epngtzw,2DaMoonBtc,56,"I watched bitcoin rocket to $1200 and I never sold a single coin. I was ignorant and confused, and didn't fully appreciate what was happening. The 2014 - 2016 bear market really fucked my head up, mostly because of regrets. If only I had sold at $1k, it was so obviously a bubble etc..... But I kept accumulating whilst price was dropping and I never sold. But it seemed every time I bought the price dropped further.

I remember seeing the price drop to $150, around Xmas time, and I was sick, and I will admit I was actually a little suicidal about the whole situation. I felt so stupid, I had lost money, and my head was spinning. Weirdly enough, that turned out to be the bottom. 

Then the price started to recover and went to $500. I was in complete disbelief but now things didn't seem too bad. I stopped buying because I figured I had accumulated enough bitcoin.

Now my plan was to sell some coin on the next bubble. 

So the bubble started, and as the price ascended I was getting more eurphoric. Unfortunately my bitch ex gf of 5 years decided to cheat on me and dump me during the bubble summit. So I had a weird set of emotions, consisting of euphoria, depression and confusion all at the same time. It was a horrible place to be.

My head was fucked again, but I did ok, selling a percentage of my coins at $17k. Weirdly enough my ex leaving, forced me to panic sell. My only regret was I should have sold a larger percentage. But I was happy.

 I held on to the fiat during the price collapse and I even refused to reinvest at $6k, even though I thought that was the bottom. I was wrong, but also right to not reinvest. Then bitcoin collapsed further, and i started to get excited at the possibility of BTC dropping to $1k. But for some reason just before Xmas I realised I was being greedy so I dumped all my fiat back into BTC at $4100. Even though I didn't get the best price I was happy to not have the fiat sitting on a trading account.  

Since then, I'm currently shocked how quickly price has recovered from the lows. I guess, I'm in disbelief.

The plan is to now sell a larger percentage during the next bubble. Which I think will peak at $200k maybe more. I want to buy a place to live and reinvest during the next collapse.

I've been through so much shit in my life, and even though im making money, bitcoin is the most mentally exhausting thing I've have experienced in my life.

epmv0xa,SarangNoether,36,"Once again, it's report time.

This month has been a lot of miscellaneous work on proofs and papers. I and my DLSAG collaborators have submitted versions of the DLSAG signature paper to conference proceedings and to the [IACR preprint archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/curr/), now that we've made some edits to account for key images in the protocols. The common basepoint used in key images would presently necessitate a self-spend to avoid identification by a sender. This introduces subtleties to avoid metadata leaking and would slow down peer-to-peer direct transactions, but may be less important for payment channels. We will be eager to receive comments and review on the preprint.

The new [CLSAG signature scheme](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/52) has undergone significant additional analysis and updates. There is [sample code](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/clsag/clsag) and [timing code](https://github.com/SarangNoether/monero/tree/clsag-plumbing) available currently, which show excellent efficiency improvements. The final version of a paper with full details and security proofs has a pending merge request to the [internal archive](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab). Comments on the paper are welcome.

There is sample code demonstrating a [version of the Bulletproofs inner product proving system](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/pybullet-np2) that allows arbitrary input vector size. Verification uses the same number of rounds as the prover, making it inefficient. While it may be possible to reduce the verifier's complexity to a single multiexponentiation (as we do for the current version in production), it is not clear how to do so.

I have a [draft writeup](https://github.com/SarangNoether/skunkworks/tree/mojoin) for a merged-input system called MoJoin that allows multiple parties to generate a single transaction. The goal is to complete the transaction merging with no trust in any party, but this introduces significant complexity and may not be possible with the known Bulletproofs multiparty computation scheme. My current version of MoJoin assumes partial trust in a dealer, who learns the mappings between input rings and outputs (but not true spends or Pedersen commitment data).

Additionally, I am performing a comparative analysis of three different sublinear transaction protocols. Each of [Lelantus](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/373), [RingCT3.0](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/508), and [Omniring](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/580) have preprints available. The different approaches to transaction privacy come with tradeoffs that deserve careful investigation to determine their applicability and feasibility to Monero.

eppmy9y,ftrader,28,"Great writeup, thanks Jonathan!

About the MVF history, I'd like to add in that btcfork created an MVF-Core variant in Oct 2016. One of the reasons was that miners at the time strongly trusted Core's code (see later Hong Kong Consensus agreement for just how strongly) and a minimal fork would benefit by making as few changes as possible to the already trusted code which was running on their systems.

I also felt at the time that if one was going to attempt a hard fork -- and a possible minority hashrate one at that -- that it would be _much better_ to have multiple clients with code diversity while doing so (therefore MVF-BU and MVF-Core developed to same basic HF requirements).

This is also the reason I thought ABC was a very good move when Amaury started it and asked me if I wanted to help. It was to be a fork on a more modern version of Core (minus the ugly bits).

There was common understanding that it would be best if other clients (XT, Classic, BU) could join in the upgrade.

They had paved the way for an eventual hard fork after all, and we owe Bitcoin Cash to them just as much as to any later efforts. In fact, several of their developers directly contributed to ABC becoming reality as well. People don't know how much of a team effort of the whole on-chain scaling community this really was.

Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as a consensus mechanism, and Ethereum is aiming to use Proof of Stake as a consensus mechanism in the future. There are different ones out there, but not too many. 

IOTA's consensus mechanism is fairly complicated and still being developed. It is a combination of already established consensus mechanisms, being utilized in ways never seen before. Some parts of it are still in development and not finalized. 

Since this consensus mechanism is completely new and takes some very interesting choices, many people in the cryptocurrency community are skeptical (rightfully so - cryptocurrency largely relies on the foundation of well established strong cryptography ). 


However if IOTA pulls it off and proves that their consensus mechanism is secure, instantaneous and fee less all at the same time, it will make a lot of waves in the crypto sphere. Whether they can, only you can decide after spending the proper time to form your own opinion.",2019-06-02 14:29:14

eprsot2,CalvinsStuffedTiger,47,"I think bitcoin as a hedge against the USD collapsing, and monero as a hedge against bitcoin collapsing 

The two primary reasons I think monero is a hedge is because bitcoin maximalists always say “if there are features that work in shit coins then bitcoin will adopt it” 

However monero does two things that bitcoin won’t ever do.  Base layer anonymity (can’t do this without a hard fork) and a tail emission (can’t do this without a hard fork) 

So bitcoin is taking a massive gamble that a) lightning networks and coinjoin / Schnorr will provide enough privacy for their users under a state sponsored level of attack 

And b) when the block reward goes away the transaction fees will be high enough for miners to continue to support the network 

Everyone in bitcoin seems so convicted in their belief that these two things can’t possibly be an issue but I can’t fathom how you can be so sure.

Correct, when the network was all miners because it was so easy to mine, and was only used by people on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org) who had **stake** in the network

**We Had to remove mining from Active Wallet Nodes**, but that doesn't remove their **stake** in the network. 

They still act as **gatekeepers** who provide security by validating or confirming blocks, and *being* the network themselves.

If any miner or other peer sends my Active Wallet Node an invalid block (invalid tx, rule change) my active wallet node will cut off this miner or peer and ban them from themselves.

Every other active wallet node and miner that agrees with my version of bitcoin will do the same.

I wanted to provide a weekly graph to give a proper overarching look of BTC’s performance over the last half a year. 


Since January 28, BTC is +155.80%. We have been following a parabola curve for 119D (green rectangle ). For context, I charted out a few of the other parabola ascents BTC has had: 


The first went +107.24% and lasted 56D. The second went 232.63% in 35D. 


We have been on a strong bull run for the last 119D, with the weekly RSI currently sitting at 79. As we can see, BTC is more than capable of sustaining overbought status on the weekly, but in this case I believe we might be due for a strong correction. 


Circled in red is a doji , a well-known indicator of indecision (or continuation). The length of this bull movement, coupled with this doji on the weekly create a strong sell signal from a TA standpoint. The psychological resistance of $10,000 is directly overhead as well. 


The previous doji (aqua) acted as a continuation pattern, but this doji was not directly on the back of a true parabola ascent, it was on the back of a high-vol week breaking out of the bear market. Contextually, this matters a lot. 


Moving forward, I think there are 3 most-likely outcomes (on the weekly). 


A. We see a correction week this week. This would validate the doji as a reversal indicator and break the parabola curve. Targets for this range would lie between $6,200 and $7,600. 


B. We continue up to test $10,000 this week, get rejected and revisit the $7,800 - $8,400 range. 


C. We breakthrough the $9,000 and $10,000 resistances and bulldoze to test the $12,000 resistance. This would validate the doji as a continuation pattern and keep us on the parabola ascent. 


My subjective probabilities: 


A: 50% 


B: 30% 


C: 20%",2019-06-03 04:37:36

B) He is a constant optimist that strongly believes in brand promotion

I think it’s B. I think this guy is so excited, bullish, and positive about Tron and cryptocurrency in general that he can only really see the good outcomes.

2) Warren Buffet has been vocal about his dislike for bitcoin, calling it rat poison squared.  But how vast is his knowledge of bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general? A lunch with Justin Sun and his guests may not yield any immense business partnerships. However Justin Sun gets the publicity, an *opportunity* to speak to warren buffet (net worth 81 BILLION), and the possibility of swaying the opinion of warren buffet that may have him walking away and reconsidering his stance on cryptocurrency.  How many giant business deals have been conducted over “lunches” just like this? Once again, all Justin sun sees is opportunity.

epypb1r,dEBRUYNE_1,39,"Arguably one of the most salient issues of a non-fungible cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) is the risk of being implicated by others. To quote myself:

&gt;Basically shows how broken Bitcoin's fungibility is. One of the most important benefits of a fungible chain is the ability to flawlessly receive payments, i.e., without having to worry about the origin of the funds of the sender. Furthermore, this protects the recipient from being implicated by the sender. A risk on a non-fungible chain that is often underestimated and downplayed. An example I've often used in the past that easily illustrates aforementioned risk:

&gt;&gt;Let's say Alice sells a painting on OpenBazaar that is bought by Bob. Alice assumes Bob is a law abiding citizin and thus sends her BTC to Coinbase to exchange them for US dollars. However, what Alice didn't know is that Bob isn't the law abiding citizen that she thought he was. That is, Bob occasionally sells some illicit stuff on the darknet markets and used his proceeds to buy the painting. As a result, Alice gets flagged by Coinbase for trying to sell ""tainted"" coins and she may now also be the subject of a criminal / money laundering investigation.

A powerful question one can ask to someone that proclaims Bitcoin is fungible is whether he would swap any output (UXTO) of similar value for his own. I can virtually guarantee that the answer will invariably be no. A prime example:

&gt; After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys — yes, all men — from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own.

&gt; They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.

&gt; Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?”

&gt; The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.

&gt; This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could be developed in time.

The wealthy know everybody is fucked and they plan to survive even if it kills the rest of us. This is not a war of ideology but of survival. Wealth ends or humanity ends.",2019-06-05 11:55:20

eq2t499,darin_gordon,92,"I'm using actix-web in my work and am familiar with the project, so I'll try to summarize for everyone why this release is so significant.

This is a major milestone for the entire Rust community because we now have the first web framework written in stable Rust with an architecture that a credible author has deemed worthy of maintaining backwards compatibility for and a code base mature enough to have earned a 1.0 designation.  

The architecture of actix-web 1.0 is very different from that of 0.7.  In many respects, it was a rewrite that began last Summer.  The architecture is no longer based on an actor paradigm but rather one of Services, largely inspired by [Eriksen et al's finagle work](https://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf) adopted at Twitter.  This service architecture is accessible through a library known as [actix-net](https://github.com/actix/actix-net).  Essentially, actix-web is a web-based actix-net server.  If actix-web were bitcoin, actix-net would be its blockchain.  Because of this, actix-net may be even more significant to the broader Rust community.  The actor models can still be imported and used but no longer act as the default mechanisms driving the server.

Regarding performance, according to the Tech Empower benchmarks that evaluate hundreds of web frameworks across all major languages, [actix-web is top-ranking and](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=52587667-bee1-4b9b-b34d-929b616d5e4c).  The last benchmark represents a beta version of actix-web from last month and results may have slightly improved with 1.0.  actix-web is very modular, allowing programmers to only use what is needed and no more.  

In terms of usability, actix-web 1.0 api is far easier to approach than 0.7.  Running blocking calls against a database effortlessly flows within combinators now where as before one had to implement a lot of SyncActor boilerplate.  Endpoint resource registration can now either be explicitly registered within an App instance or with a new set of proc macros, but routes still need to be registered manually.  The new testing api is far easier to work with for unit or integration tests.

A single person wrote two entirely difference platforms in order to get to where it is today.  I believe that future progress requires community participation at all levels.  This is a great time for system programmers to take a deep dive and learn, from the network-level up, how to build a high-performing, flexible server.

My vision for how we can get Bitcoin Cash to become the money for the world is mostly about us creating infrastructure. (not the same as protocol dev)

Infrastructure here means means the tools and APIs that companies will use to marry their legacy software (billing, payroll, accounting) with the Bitcoin Cash network. And naturally it means actually scaling full nodes. It is the stuff that makes companies avoid re-inventing the wheel.

Now, I have absolutely nothing against more protocol development. The Schnorr activation was pretty cool. So please don't take this the wrong, way. Nothing against protocol development.

It hasn't failed its just hit road blocks if you're thinking in terms of it being a global currency. On that front I think the names you've mentioned moved the goal post in their minds. Although BTC as a day to day currency in theory is a nice thought this doesn't really pan out well in practice for various reasons. 

So what are you left with? A time tested, battle hardened, and highly trusted blockchain. Is that useless? Or is it simply useful for other things than what some might have hoped for initially? I think the store of value argument is valid but for that to end up a reality BTC would have to obtain ""value"" and ""legitimacy"" in the eye of the general public. I don't think that's a nonsensical proposition. We move closer to that every year. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTC and really any cryptocurrency which uses it's own chain is designed to be driven by greed (if you want to be tactful about it you can say ""financial incentives""). This is the beauty and genius of the design. Greed drives you to learn about it, greed drives you to participate in the ecosystem (ie mining/staking, trading, holding). Greed is what's getting these heavy hitting institutions involved, getting companies like AT&amp;T to accept btc, etc. Greed drives adoption, and adoption provides legitimacy and the much needed perception of value in the general public's eye. Greed is the most visceral and powerful human emotion you could be relying on. It's the one emotion you can expect from anybody given proper circumstances. This, in theory, snowballs until BTC is where it needs to be. That snowball effect is very apparent to anybody actually looking.

Fucking Kodak (one of the leading tech companies worldwide in the 90's) sold the OLED patent to LG when they got stripped by a new owner. They tried to keep film alive and we all know how that went. Kodak later announced a cryptocurrency and bailed before ICO, I think to regulation fears but I'm suspecting just the bear market and bad decisions. They also were endorsed by Bill Cosby.

* New coins hype. Its a risk to get involved. Its also ok to sell. You can always buy back, we get these in markets ffs. Don't aim for 1000%, aim for 1% today its a lot easier that way. 

* People are new, people are stupid and people are crazy smart. Accept it.

* Nobody wants to make you rich. There's no coin focused around dethroning the current wealthy elite. There's plenty of coins based around taking your money. Anyone that has to convince you to buy their coin is selling a scam.

TL/DR: BTC run ends weeks before market peak.  People dump in to alts and alts go insane which precipitates the market peak.  ETH people think flippening is going to happen because ETH/BTC trend reverses as many predicted, ETH remains bull as fuck for a full week while the rest of the market is blood red.

I still remember the BTC and ETH ATH's like it was yesterday, I was really involved at the time and think I can give you some sense of the market sentiment and what was going on.

Bitcoin going on it's run to 20k was a run that lasted a while and ended Dec 17.  But the whole crypto market peaked weeks later on Jan 7th. Why?

Because Bitcoin was going to dump eventually, everyone poured in to alts once Bitcoin started to go down, and this continued for several weeks of ""alt season"" until the market peaked on Jan 7th.  By far the most insane volatility in alts happened during this period.  I remember this being my first realization that the market was far too irrational for this bull market to continue.  It was absolutely insane.  Now you could just leave it here and just say that ETH peaked later because some of those people who sold their BTC traded it for ETH, which certainly did happen to some extent, but I think there's more to the story.. especially considering that ETH remained very bullish after the whole market started crashing and went up by about 25% over the same time period that the whole market was down about 20%.

ETH people, like myself, had been and still were focused on the idea of the ""flippening"".  Earlier in the year in June, ETH had come extremely close to overtaking Bitcoin in market cap and a lot of people believed that there was a trend here which would continue.  And it just so happened that, on the 7th of December, the ETH/BTC, which had been going down while BTC was on it's run, did a hard reversal as many people had predicted, signaling the beginning of the flippening.  This got a lot of people excited, including myself, but it would end up being an enormous fake-out which would cause many people to buy ETH at the very top of the bull market which was about to turn bear.  For a full week, while everyone other coin was screaming bloody murder, ETH was all green dildos, emboldening those who were counting on the flippening to continue to bet long on ETH inspite of the rest of the market screaming bloody murder.  We all know how it turned out in the end.

That's what I think happened, for what it's worth.  It taught me a valuable lesson about larger trends... no matter how much you think some smaller trend is unstoppable, all trends bow down to the larger bull/bear cycle.",2019-06-06 07:58:53

Right; the exchanges often interfere to make sure they can steal the lions share of any profit, but the real shining phase for bitcoin is not the economic crash.

Bitcoin will likely go down (in USD terms) during a crash along with everything else. (because whats really happening is the dollar is rising hard). This phase is very short; because dollar deflation is very unstable.

The time for bitcoin to shine is the recovery phase when the fed tries to ""fix"" the crash. Thats when inflation is happening, and its a long climb; a perfect time for bitcoin to rise.

eqdcnb4,sunburntcat,36,"Everyone has a different opinion for why they think bitcoin is a better form of currency. One of the more common has to do with the act of “quantitative easing” whereby the Federal Reserve buys government bonds to in mass quantities. Its a complicated process that stems from the 2008 crisis, and no one completely understands the impact. Since the Fed members are largely appointed by the government, it is extremely unintuitive to buy your own assets and isnt a free market, where the lender and borrower are independent parties with their own goals. 

You mentioned negative interest rates. In a negative interest rate environment, borrowers are PAID to borrow money. It’s like swiping a credit card and instead of having to pay back the balance with interest, you only have to pay back 95%. This is a great deal for us as borrowers, but the problem is that banks have way more capital than we do and have better access to these loans. Essentially, banks get richer without taking on ANY risk. In an efficient capitalist system, I take a risk on you by loaning you money and hope that you’ll pay me back with interest if you are successful in your business ventures. 

The truth is, no one has any idea how quantitive easing and negative interest rates affect the economy. But both are extremely unintuitive and for many, it smells like a broken system.

I personally think it’s not an immediate problem but a long term one. As a software engineer, who hates that Congress has a lack of interest and care about finance and technology, I think bitcoin is a great asset to own, considering the trade war and china’s rising ability to disrupt our political and financial systems with cyber attacks.

eqik9vs,Mr_Yukon_C,53,"Honestly, I think this submission is ruined by the fact that it's laced with what appear to be BTC maxi-lite narratives regarding Ethereum / ETH.

&gt; (i) Bitcoin is the hardest money there is and therefore valuable.

Many people disagree strongly with that claim.

Bitcoin is barely even functional when the network becomes even remotely stressed.

Taking *days* and fees approaching *triple-digits* to complete a successful transaction under moderate to heavy network loads, qualifies as essentially non-functional in my opinion.

&gt; (ii) Ethereum fills the gaps that Bitcoin does not.

No, Ethereum is everything Bitcoin was *supposed to be*, and a whole lot more.

&gt; It is hard though to model (lol) $ETH because almost no parameters are set in stone. We don't know if there will ever be a hard cap, or the final inflation rate, staking rewards, et cetera. That's why I will take the historical 0.025-0.15 ETHBTC ratio range as an indicator. The assumption here is that Ethereum remains unchallenged in its niche (however you want to call it, from ""smart contract platform"" to ""global computer"" or ""the new economy."")

That is the classic maxi move of attempting to paint Ethereum into the smart contract / world computer *only* corner, while implying that ETH is *not* ""sound money"" or a ""store of value"".

Neither could be further from the truth.

So let's revisit, shall we?

For starters, the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is titled:

*Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*

Not...

*Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Hard Money System*

Or...

*Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Store of Value System*

The whole ""hard money"" / ""store of value"" narrative is one that BTC maxi's were forced to pivot to once they realized that Bitcoin has failed at becoming a *usable* peer-to-peer cash system.

Ironically, Ethereum and ETH are actually delivering on the idea behind Bitcoin.

For something to become a currency / money it has to legitimately be a few things.

Primarily:

- usable
- useful

ETH is both of those.

Right now, the Ethereum base layer contains a fair bit more throughput than Bitcoin's.  For the time being, Ethereum also suffers from the same congestion issues as Bitcoin.

However, Ethereum contains the means via a fully programmable and turing complete virtual machine, to be able to implement feature-rich 2nd-layer scaling solutions that will actually work (unlike Bitcoin's Lightning) and provide significant additional throughput.

In addition to that, Ethereum is also working directly on scaling the base layer, something Bitcoin has never even bothered to attempt.

In addition to all of *that*, Ethereum's EVM allows applications to be built on top of the network that all work in unison, leverage each other, and ultimately form a new *decentralized* financial ""economy"" based on — you guessed it — ETH.

Many have watched that economy emerge and begin to flourish right in front of their eyes for the past 4 years since Ethereum launched.

Every day some new tidbit of functionality comes online within the Ethereum ecosystem, which in turn bolsters the need, demand, and value of ETH within said economy.

---------

And that folks, is how you end up with an *actual* money / store of value in terms of something that is legitimately everyday-useful within a flourishing ecosystem / economy.

---------

Lastly, it's worth noting in the context of ETH that as long as network demand and growth outstrip supply, then price will go up.  That is basic supply/demand economics and true for just about anything.

Also, once Ethereum transitions to Proof-of-Stake then ETH issuance will drop to a number that is very low, much lower than even Bitcoin.

In fact, I believe issuance can drop significantly once the beacon chain starts finalizing TXs on the main chain, which *could* be before full PoS even.

So in the meantime, talking points about things like ""hard caps"", inflation schedules, etc. are nothing but useless rhetoric clinging to an old-school and outdated mentality regarding economics, all while attempting to defend a network that has unfortunately failed to deliver on a truly *Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*.

eqib8gp,krokodilmannchen,33,"So, I mentioned yesterday that I would do my own write-up on how to go about taking a 10-year long position in crypto. I'll say that this largely overlaps with my view for the future. The goal here is not to predict the future. It's to have *some* plan in place to eliminate rash emotional decisions. It's a shitty first draft but I've got to start somewhere. Before we go, here is my core thinking.  


(i) Bitcoin is the hardest money there is and therefore valuable. I'll use the [stock-to-flow model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) and highly recommend you check out [Planb](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD). He did a podcast with Stephen Livera which you can check out [here](https://stephanlivera.com/episode/67). In the years I've spent reading and trying to get smarter about cryptocurrency, this is about the best model I've seen. I use the model in the graph below. [Source](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1133388321563062275).  
(ii) Ethereum fills the gaps that Bitcoin does not. If you don't know what that means, have a [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAmNjJRtLGo) at the recent EY presentation from Paul Brody. It's informative, funny, and some say mothers like watching it. It is hard though to model (lol) $ETH because almost no parameters are set in stone. We don't know if there will ever be a hard cap, or the final inflation rate, staking rewards, et cetera. That's why I will take the historical 0.025-0.15 ETHBTC ratio range as an indicator. The assumption here is that Ethereum remains unchallenged in its niche (however you want to call it, from ""smart contract platform"" to ""global computer"" or ""the new economy.""), in part because adoption and development are speeding up, not slowing down.  
(iii) the market is cyclical based on Bitcoin's halvenings. These give us more or less 18 months of rising markets, and two and a half years of bear/stagnation/accumulation. The next halvening will happen in May 2020. The ""sweet zone"" is somewhere between start 2020 and end 2021. I'll assume the same pattern for the start of 2024-end 2025.   

Now, I don't care if you go all-in on Bitcoin, Ether, or if you hold both (like I do). No matter what you choose, you'll still have to keep a tight eye on Bitcoin's movements. I'll believe that decoupling is a fact when I see it, but 2018 has clearly shown that Bitcoin is the market leader and all other coins follow. 

### So, let's get started.  



Year | Bitcoin Price | ETH 0.025 | ETH 0.15
---|---|----|----
2020 | $50 000 | $1 250 | $7 500
2024 | $400 000 | $10 000 | $60 000
2028 | $3 200 000 | $80 000 | $480 000  

Few caveats:  
- Please note that these are, as per PlanB, conservative guesses (the BTC price). The market tends to overshoot 2-4x, so $100k-$200k/BTC in the period around the 2020 halvening isn't out of the question. (Similar to the empirical evidence that a 80-95% decline happens after a bull run.) So feel free to apply that factor to $ETH, too.       
- The 2028 price prediction gets very, very messy. Grains of salt needed. The $80k/ETH prediction puts Ethereum at a $10.4 trillion value.   
- This model does not include staking rewards.   

### Okay, but what does this mean?  

Well, it can mean a few things. If you are running a fund (like Andrew Keys), you'd probably try and make as much money as you can (""for every 1000 ETH, we managed to get 2500 ETH"") by selling *somewhere* around the top and buying back in during the bear. Obviously, this is hard and nerve-wracking because there will always be some other fund manager that outperforms you. I'm imagining Jared Vennett's smug face.    

But we're not running a fund. We want to be [independently financially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJjKP8vYjpQ). So let's say you have 250 ETH ($62 500*) today and you want to end up with $2.5m and a house. How would you go about it? (Feel free to use your own numbers &amp; goals.)   

Well, taking the ten-year perspective, you'd need 31.25 ETH at $80 000 per piece to get up to your $2.5m. Let's round it up to 50 ETH because of taxes and the ~~hookers~~ house (or about 1.25BTC / your BTC/ETH mix). Those are your long term holdings. That leaves you with 80% or 200 ETH. Let's say you want to keep another 20% for the very long term, talking decades here. So you've got another 160ETH. 

I'd say that there are different strategies you can follow here. You could consider selling 10% or 20% on every doubling (from ATH). What I mean is sell xx% at $1400, x% at $2800, x% at $4200. You could consider waiting for a specific moment in time: 160 ETH * $15k/ETH gets you to $2.5 million, too.  

I'd say that my main goal is to be able to hold enough cash for my [personal runway](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/968602569181339648). If the market is cyclical based on the four-year halvenings, you'd probably want a 4-6 year cash buffer. Depending on how much you need, you could put 100 ETH to work towards that goal. ie. if you need $50k per year, that's $300k or +- $3000/ETH. Seems very attainable in the coming years, and it gives you a great position for the long run.

The lucky ones managed to sell out in time to only lose like 10 grand, but a couple of those guys ended up left with zip.

Funnily enough, the whole damn thing happened again to the same guys a couple years ago when bitcoin was making the rounds in mainstream news sources.  Chances are, if you are hearing about a crazy way people are making money (a bubble), you are too late to participate in making money on said bubble.

eqhyj8v,jp_rosser,32,"This is an interesting question so I'll answer:

1) Bitcoin is important as an early practical application of DLT. However I think Bitcoin is also hamstrung by this position. You can see new cryptoassets being issued that are more innovative than Bitcoin. Bitcoin can't make any radical changes because there's too broad a community with too many different priorities involved in the community. Only the least radical changes are accepted now.

At this stage Bitcoin is the biggest because it was first and therefore the one people have heard of. I expect in the next 10 years, as cryptoassets continue to permeate into the mainstream, for a better cryptoasset (which may not yet exist) to become dominant at which point Bitcoin will decline to bring held by the ""purists"" only.

2) I don't know where the value of Bitcoin comes from. I have colleagues ask me this question and the only answer I can give is ""hope"". That isn't a problem of itself: Take a Joshua Reynolds old master. The physical thing you own is an antique canvas and antique paints. The physical components aren't as valuable as the whole. What gives it value is the hope/expectation that Joshua Reynolds' reputation will ensure the whole has value beyond its constituent parts. So much of value in assets relates to hope or something similar.

The difference with Bitcoin is I don't know what people are basing the hope on. I can see Ether has value because it is gas for DLT which is designed for Dapps. Maybe that goes beyond hope, into true value in that function, but there's probably still a hope aspect that (a) people will still want to develop Dapps and (b) Ethereum will remain the go to DLT for Dapps. What is the hope for Bitcoin? That it will replace fiat currency? That it will allow cheaper transfer of value across borders?

I don't know if there's anything there to legitimately give Bitcoin hope value, let alone the $1,000's of value it is currently given. As such I think Bitcoin's value will fall. I don't know when but I expect it and I don't want to buy into something I sincerely believe will fall. Linking back to reason 1 above, I expect what will cause Bitcoin's value to fall will be the mainstream adoption of a better cryptoasset which will sound the death knell for Bitcoin and possibly many others. But that better cryptoasset could well be the cryptoasset to replace fiat and its value could potentially dwarf the peak seen in December 2017.",2019-06-09 18:54:18

Bitcoin won't even look especially ""hard"" when Ethereum's 1.0 chain starts getting finalization from the beacon chain and reduces inflation to less than 1%, while Bitcoin just has a halving to 2%. And Ethereum's lower inflation at that point will be based on better technology that doesn't *need* as much inflation for the same security. Bitcoin's halving schedule relies on fees going up enough to replace the lost security; Ethereum will be able to maintain good security at low inflation without high transaction fees.

I see no reason for the ratio to stay below 0.15. When Ethereum has lower inflation, better security, and vastly better scalability than Bitcoin, I expect it to go above 1.0.",2019-06-09 23:27:31

If so, the same applies to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Stellar Lumens, Monero, IOTA, NEO and a ton more. That kind of simplistic finger-wagging logic is infuriating. You act like the only other option is being a no-coiner, which I am not.

If Bitcoin has a larger network and eventually scales, who in their right mind would ever use Litecoin? Almost no one, just like almost no one uses Voat instead of Reddit despite the heavy campaigns in 2015/2016.

If IOTA scales and becomes the *de facto* protocol for the IoT, enable an infinitely scalable network of feeless transactions, who in their right mind would ever use Litecoin? Almost no one, just like no one uses caravans to move merchandise in a world where trains, cargo ships and trucks exist.

If Monero becomes mainstream, it enables fast, fully anonymous and private transactions creating the first inscrutable digital economy. If this happens, who in their right mind would ever use Litecoin? Once again, almost no one.

This sub has such a poor understanding of competitive advantage, it's honestly unreal. You can't just cite one advantage of your project that is being shared by *virtually everyone* and assume everyone will jump on board because of that. It's all about incentives and, in the long term, absolutely nothing indicates that Litecoin will be able to provide incentives that will motivate users to adopt and use it. Even if they do, the actual value added of non-feeless peer-to-peer digital transfers in a decentralized network is not that amazing. Lots of people do not need or want to participate in a trustless network (they are perfectly content with trusting institutions, which clearly isn't a mentality that you and I agree with, but that's beside the point). So, if your cap is 10 million 'real' users, what kind of market cap are you expecting? Do you really think the average user will hold more than $1,000 in LTC at any time?

You absolutely *can* assign an economic value (both current and future) to cryptoassets, it's just that people never do because that value is consistently several orders of magnitudes lower than even current market cap.

Literally thousands of documents, piled on the floor, on a desk, on shelves, of peoples' financial information. Credit card statements, bank statements, personal data, etc. Probably 3000 folders with all this stuff in it. Even where there weren't piles of folders, there were just loose papers, magnetic cards, surveillance cameras, it was just the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

And of course, some of these documents and folders had blood and brains spattered all over them, didn't matter to me though since the detective on scene had said it was fine to take the body. The police had to clear a path by collecting the papers from the route we would take from the door to the apartment to where he was. 

A couple of months later, it came out that the guy had over a million dollars in cash and bitcoin. Apparently the state police were on to him and he decided he didn't want to try to run with his seven figures or go to jail for what would have been probably less than 10 years.

Dito isso, fiquei com pena dele e botei pra trabalhar comigo (tenho uma ""holding"" com participação em algumas empresas, então temos alguns setores como marketing, TI e contabilidade compartilhados) e como ele era formado em Redes, achei que ficando de olho nele ele conseguiria se sair bem. Primeiro dia ele já fez uma piada meio machista que já deixou algumas mulheres meio com raiva, na segunda semana quis elogiar o cabelo duma menina que tinha cortado e de alguma forma conseguiu passar a impressão que ela tava fazendo isso porque ""tava querendo"" (essa semana ele tentou elogiar uma prima nossa no Facebook, dizendo que ""ela tava parecendo a menina lá do caso do Neymar). Na hora do almoço, o cara parecia um ogro comendo, na reunião só dava palpite merda, demorava 10 anos pra entender o que a gente pedia, quando entendia, demorava muito (chegava junto comigo, saia até depois alguns dias), quando fazia tinha esmero nenhum, apesar dele sempre achar que estava bom (e acredito que na cabeça dele, estava mesmo). Qualquer feedback que eu dava ou tentava dar um toque, ele tentava abstrair, não entendia, até que eu tinha que desenhar pra ele. A sorte dele é que ele tinha um boi de ninguém tratar ele mal na cara dura porque querendo ou não era parente do chefe, mas em menos de 1 ano, pra minha sorte, ele quis sair pra investir em Bitcoin (e se deu bem com isso) e me livrei da bucha. 

Dito isso, como já falaram no tópico, agência é isso mesmo, os caras te sugam pra cacete, mas é o normal do tipo de empresa, tanto que parei de trabalhar em algumas e fui logo pra TI, pra evitar esse tipo de gente o máximo que desse. Mas cabe a você também refletir um pouco, o que você fez de errado, o porque tua supervisora ficou com raiva de você ""do nada"". O porque em teoria todo mundo se fode com o trabalho ""tendo que entregar mais e mais rápido"", mas só você tá com a corda no pescoço e o resto tá de boa? Depois de matutar um pouco, trace o que você planeja em fazer. Agência parece que não vai rolar pra você, mas trabalhar com algum suporte a venda ou setor de marketing ainda esteja ao teu alcance sem mudar muito de área.

eqrgs6t,deadalnix,51,"OK, let me try t have a dig at it.

First and foremost, are they able to reason? This is capital, because if they ended up with the same position as you based on faulty reasoning, they are only there by accident and it's only  matter of time before they embark on some non sense journey.

In the case of Ryan, there were many red flags early on, such as the belief that hash-rate drives price. According to Ryan, this is demonstrated by the fact that people were mining Bitcoin before it had a price - neglecting that people could find value out of mining bitcoin such as speculation, instruction, curiosity, etc... This position is nothing more than a rehash (hohoho!) of Marx's theory of value, which has been debunked countless time by now. Ryan was already espousing this position before the Bitcoin Cash fork.

Another one is Bitcoin Script Turing completeness. Like the previous point, Ryan already espoused this position before the Bitcoin Cash fork. However, nothing but promises were made on that front for many month, and the first time something was delivered was Clemens presentation in Tokyo. However, Clemens failed to demonstrate that Bitcoin Script were Turing complete, but simply that Turing complete system could be built on top of Bitcoin, which was not novel as a concept, but the way Clemens did it was novel. I showed Clemens the concept of zero knowledge contingent payments: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Zero_Knowledge_Contingent_Payment as an alternative that was better on pretty much every front, and known since at least 2014. In any case, while this novel method of doing something we already knew how to do was intellectually stimulating, it certainly failed to demonstrate that Bitcoin Script were Turing complete, and for good reason: THEY AREN'T.

You have here two examples that predates the fork of Ryan adopting completely irrational position. We are not talking disagreement here, and this is a most important distinction. We are talking flat earth grade demonstrably false positions. This is a good sign that Ryan's alignment with Bitcoin Cash was accidental, and not reasoned, that that him going off rail is only a matter of time.

This types of example are also found in many other circumstances. Richard Spencer or Chris Cantwell are very good examples of this. They used to be libertarians, but turned white nationalists. however, if you listen to them int heir libertarian time, they can't seems to make an actually cogent case for it, simply something that sounds nice, but is full of self contradictions when you dig a bit deeper.

Another angle you can look at is ability to deliver, especially compared to social media profile. If you objectively look at Ryan's track record, it's not pretty. He tried to introduce Bitcoin to reddit, and even managed to do so for a short period of time IIRC before being fired. He then pivoted to try to build a payment channel technology that never panned out, then to build something on top of litecoin that never panned out, then yours that he managed to build, but abandoned right away to build money button, and is now pivoting toward some namespace project. You have here the typical pattern of someone who is unable to deliver or follow through anything, but gets a lot of attention. This is indicates that:

1/ The person is unable to deliver but a very good communicant and manipulator and so can make you believe that he/she can deliver. Prototypical example is Elizabeth Holmes.

2/ The person is in fact uninterested in delivering, but is going after the attention/notoriety/position they can get from whatever they started. Once a project is far enough along that it doesn't suit such goal it is simply discontinued.

In both cases, it is paramount that one can look at facts objectively. The person will always have a truckload of excuses and every single one will sound plausible. The smoking gun is the repetition of the pattern.

I'm always reluctant to give names, because I want to avoid giving publicity, and want to avoid BCH turning into a cult. It is important that the skills of the community to detect such people improves rather than the community to rely on me or others with a good track record on the matter as it would just create a new priesthood for a new religion - and will inevitably, in time, be corrupted.

eqsg7di,rjnm,87,"So basically I believe the entire thing was set off by my dad's wedding. We traveled to attend a couple of weeks prior. My stepmom's family is pretty wealthy. The wedding was a little elaborate, and her family is huge. Picture a big wealthy east coast family with huge houses and a bunch of cute-ass kids running around.

My boyfriend was super into marriage and having kids. I was on the fence about marriage (not with him, just in general), and I am firmly child-free. He was also super stressed about finances. We weren't doing too bad, but he did have the $100,000 in school loans, so I think the realization that we were never going to have that life made him snap.

This turned into an obsession with making more money. Which is where bitcoin came in. He started talking about bitcoin all the time. In retrospect, I should have been concerned then. Manic-depression runs in my family, I should have seen the signs of the mania. If I had've been less checked out of the relationship I could have helped sooner.

He was constantly talking about bitcoin for several days prior to the huge mental break. Kept asking if we could set some money aside to buy some. This is when bitcoins cost about ~$3000 a pop. Of course I said no. He also watched some documentary on Netflix about bitcoin and he acted like it was the word of God. It was insane. But I ignored it. Because that's what I do, I ignore things and run away.

During all the conversations we had prior to him being committed and after, he still obsessively talked about bitcoin. How it would make us rich, how all the ""sheeple"" didn't understand how important cryptocurrency was. I honestly don't remember most of it, but he basically had a fucking bitcoin manifesto.

By contrast, in Monero, this is all protected by Monero's inherent privacy features. Additionally, the argument that you give up all your privacy by buying Monero on a regulated exchange is moot, as Monero's privacy features 'kick in' once you withdraw your XMR from the exchange. Lastly, my musings on Wasabi wallet &amp; Bisq:

&gt;I find it ironic to see the Bitcoin community recommending Bisq whilst essentially the only pair with reasonable liquidity is XMR/BTC. Furthermore, you can essentially only trade BTC for XMR, as XMR for BTC provides quite a high risk of receiving tainted coins. See:

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/bwmjoj/shum_exchanges_blocked_a_user_after_receiving/epymhs2/

&gt;With respect to Wasabi wallet, it remains optional privacy, which does not provide fungibility (an essential property of sound money) and may invoke the view of ""what are you trying to hide"". See:

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bwna8l/exchanges_blocked_a_user_after_receiving_tainted/epyt8ng/

&gt;Furthermore, the privacy provided by Wasabi wallet is vastly inferior to Monero's privacy properties, especially given the size limit of 0.1 BTC (which thus requires you to recombine outputs (thereby essentially destroying the previously obtained privacy) for transactions of larger amounts).

One more thing I'd like to add, Wasabi does not provide plausible deniability, as you have to actively participate in the process. By contrast, Monero's privacy features work passively and therefore provide plausible deniability.",2019-06-12 20:24:02

Liquidity as measured by order book depth and *real* volume is actually fairly decent, especially in comparison with coins of a similar market capitalization.

There are a number of Monero meetups as well as an upcoming Monero Konferenco. It should also be noted that promotion events cost a lot of money and Monero, given that it is not backed by a company, simply does not have this money. 

&gt;No good OTC services for XMR.

There are five large OTC services that support Monero:

- DVChain
- Cumberland mining
- Kraken OTC desk
- Circle OTC desk
- Galaxy digital (Mike Novogratz) OTC desk

Genesis capital also has Monero available in some form:

&gt;It's too hard for normal people to understand XMR.

An easy explanation is that, with Bitcoin and other transparent chains, the people you interact with (as well as blockchain observers) can see all your transactions as well as your balance. By contrast, in Monero, both the balance and the transactions are private. 

&gt;Regulation troubles.

See:

&gt;People often like to purport that Monero will inevitably get banned. However, the new FinCEN guidance is basically inconsistent with that notion. From the CoinCenter article:

&gt;&gt;Section 4.5.3 states that exchanges are not per se banned from using privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies but will need to comply with the same BSA regulations they comply with for typical cryptocurrencies. We believe that this is possible. Exchanges need to know their customers but they do not have a black letter law requirement to know the customers of their customers. In other words, a bank needs to know who you are but they are not obligated to know the name and address of people that you pay using cash you withdraw from your account.

Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?”

For all their wealth and power, they don’t believe they can affect the future.

The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.

This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could be developed in time.”

eqyhfgc,DamonAndTheSea,100,"ETH exploded due to the financial mechanics of the ICO craze.  Small coin creators with nothing more than a flimsy website could raise money for their ICO distribution by asking for payment in ETH.  

Because there was absolutely no regulation and because the crypto market was hot due to speculation on Bitcoin, this created *massive demand for ETH* which was simply the *payment method* for these new tokens, and thus ETH’s meteoric rise related *very little to ETH’s fundamental value as expressed by DApp usage and business adoption.*  Price rise had nearly everything to do with speculation in the alt market and external fiat being routed through ETH tokens as payment for ‘DentaCoin’ or whatever bullshit people were buying.  Speculation in the alt market created the demand for ETH. 

These ERC20 tokens could be created for nothing of course (other than dev costs, which often meant a small group of 3 devs forking Bitcoin and changing a few parameters), and so the coin creators were ETH rich until the market dropped.  Many ERC20 projects that didn’t sell the market top and didn’t have the runway or talent to deliver on their promises were forced into selling into 2018’s weakness which expedited losses in ETH and nearly all related alts as compared to Bitcoin. 

I say all of this only to suggest that it’s unlikely we see an exact repeat as many investors where burned and the market is maturing in terms of regulatory constraints. It’s very possible we’ll see Cardano’s price appreciate if/when quality DApp devs chose to develop on the Cardano blockchain and only when those DApps find users.  

There will of course be more speculation in the next cycle that may drive token prices again much higher than fair value, but anticipating ADA to repeat the ETH cycle and post 1800x gains in the same timeframe is wishful thinking.",2019-06-13 08:49:08

I think part of the point though is to also show that such a strategy (of only buying in dips and selling at highs) is extremely hard to execute.  The dips in the market are of all different percentages (56% in 2007 vs only 19% at other times) and the highs are also of varying magnitudes.  So if someone wanted to do this, *how* would they do it?  Realistically speaking, maybe looking at Bitcoin would be a good example - how many people bought it when it was thousands of BTC per dollar or whatever and sold it when it got to a few dollars per BTC?  How many actually rode it from that starting point to the 20k/BTC high?  Not a lot, but the point is most people looking to make a few bucks sold it off well before those crazy highs, and no one would have any way of predicting what it would do.  At least the three presented scenarios are vaguely plausible - one person is a Scaredy Cat with bad timing so they invest at the worst times and then freak out and stop, the second waits for the biggest possible dip with good timing and the last just periodically invests.",2019-06-13 21:59:47

eqw2seq,SEND_ME_YOUR_RANT,51,"There are two types of ways that states characterize property owned with respect to marriage. 

Some states are separate property states, meaning that when you get married to someone, both parties retain 100% of their ownership of that property. 

Others are community property states, meaning that when you get married, property acquired *during the marriage* is equally owned 50% by both parties. 

However, in community property states, property acquired before the marriage or after separation is still considered 100% the property of the party who purchased it. 

If you take a divorce to trial, in either type of state the judge is going to determine ownership of all property at issue. If it’s community property, the judge will order the property sold and the proceeds split evenly between the parties. If the property is determined to be separate property, the judge confirms ownership to the owner. 

A majority of divorces settle by agreement rather than go to trial, because trials are expensive. So you can dispose of marital property if you can come to an agreement. For example if the house is community property, you might agree to let your ex have it if they agree to you keeping your bitcoin collection. But you have to AGREE to settlements. 

Therefore, if OP had the dog before marriage, there is no way for his ex to fight him for it. He either agreed to give it away cuz he’s a cuck or OP is lying. Both are reasonable explanations in this case.",2019-06-13 00:15:04

It's the banks that have reason to fear over GlobalCoin, not us hodlers.

Facebook will have to adhere to all of the regulatory requirements imposed on banks.  It's not just KYC/AML, although that is a lot of it.  GC will instantly have hundreds of millions of users from day one, and so it's a virtual certainty that new account openings at the banks are about to plummet to something close to zero.

Ponzi schemes depend on regular and reliable infusions of fresh currency in order to pay off obligations to previously established accounts.  Facebook is about to be a mortal threat to all of that.

What's the best play for the banks then?  To fully embrace crypto.  Zuck Zuck before he zucks you.

A bank has almost no impediment that I can see to becoming a cryptoexchange and offering a stablecoin.  The hoops that a Coinbase or a Gemini had to jump through were jumped through many moons ago by the banks.  And it's not as though they don't already have or can't buy the talent necessary to pull off a first-rate implementation.

If you're a normie sitting on the sidelines smug in your belief that Bitcoin is a scam, the news that your bank is suddenly going to let you trade in crypto is going to feel like a brick outside the head.  Even if it is only a stablecoin.

Bitcoin has resorted to copying Ethereum's features like ERC-20 tokens via sub-optimal solutions on Lightning Network, which is woefully underutilized to begin with- nevermind the fact that Bitcoin Maximalists proudly proclaimed that such tokens were useless.  IEOs claim to have usurped all of the value Ethereum ever had, by trying to take a bit out of what was the hot ICO market of 2017.  And what feels like dozens of ""Ethereum-killers"" claim superiority over Ethereum, and most of them aren't live, and suffer from flawed token distributions which will render their on-chain governance mechanisms as captured from day one.

There is one leader in this market with respect to technology development- that's Ethereum- and there are many reluctant followers following in its footsteps.  *Despite all of their promises, everyone keeps building on Ethereum anyway.*

Microsoft's on-board, Google's on-board- with the core infrastructure needed to bring many other big players on-board. DeFi is hitting its stride. Services like Coinbase are starting to support native decentralized services available on Ethereum, like DAI. There are rumors that Ubisoft may be building a game with items stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

We are super early even now.  Most people still can't understand how this technology works, and when it reaches scale, they won't even need to.  It will be a built in back-end for their favorite services, which will work better and more cheaply than they ever have before.

It's been a while since I've written something this bullish, and it's because it's been a while since I've felt *this* bullish.  Yes, near term pullbacks are certainly possible, but even with respect to that, I maintain a heavy bullish bias for a long term entry as ETH is under $300 in the near term, and probably up to $400 or $500.

Even if it’s not rare, people will still want to make clothing, bedding, etc. out of it, and textiles don’t last very long, so there will continue to be a demand. 

If bitcoin or dollar bills weren’t valuable, nobody would want them, so they would become virtually worthless if you flooded the market. Commodities like gold and diamonds are *slightly* less vulnerable because there are uses for them due to their innate properties (i.e. diamond-tipped tools because of diamonds’ hardness, or gold used in dentistry because it’s chemically inert and hypoallergenic), but you don’t need very much for those uses and you don’t lose much in the process of using it (gold is melted down and reused all the time) so the demand for anything other than aesthetic (ergo market-dependent) uses won’t be very high. 

However, think about how much cotton and polyester we *consume* on a daily basis. A fiber that is ideal for a lot of uses would be used, even if it’s produced in large quantities, and while the demand wouldn’t be enough to keep its value that high, you would still be rich AF if you controlled the world’s supply of it. Regardless of how abundant it is, people will still see value in it because it’s useful, and they will keep buying it as they use it up.

Edit: The fact that it’s the lightest, warmest, and softest fabric in existence also means that it has specialized uses that will command a high price tag, even if it’s abundant. Emergency blankets would be made out of it. Winter clothes not just for regular people but for outdoorsmen willing to pay top dollar for light, warm longjohns that will help them climb Everest.

er2tfem,PM_ME_UFOS,39,"Let's try some math. Miners need 1800 bitcorns in rewards every day for mining, and much of that has to be cashed out to dirty fiat to pay for electricity and other opex. Given how long bitcoin was at $4k, I'm guessing most miners around today need to cash out around $4-5k per mined coin on average to pay the bills.

At an average of TUSD$9,000,000/day flowing in that's:

9000000/1800 = $5000 per coin

I'm guessing they're injecting Tether into the system at an equal rate to miners taking fiat out to keep the price afloat and the whole thing working at all.

Eventually miners could run out of real actual fiat to take out of the system, but considering how many bag hodlers probably bought at $18k and are waiting to cash out until moon there may be a surprising (to us in r/buttcoin) amount of liquidity for miners to leach out of the system before it all comes crashing down.

The story would go something like:

* Miners in China get an electricity bill to pay, so they take their btc rewards to bitfinex to exchange for fiat
* reward btc is put up for sale on the order books
* bitfinex mints enough tether to buy it
* miner has a special deal with bitfinex and withdraws actual fiat to pay their bills (fiat from bag hodlers who bought @ $18k in 2017)

So a bunch of new unbacked tether is thrown into the market to counteract the liquidity being drained out of it and keep the prices afloat. There's got to be a steady trickle of bag hodlers still buying, so they're only draining their liquidity at `$9m - &lt;new capital&gt;` per day.

er8ppvb,Metalgear_ray,78," Here are my thoughts on the latest news on Binance axing its’ US customers:
 
For the first time since I bought Vechain in January 2018, I questioned my investment into this coin when I saw the news. The large majority of the updates and information that has come out from Vechain and its’ associated partners has been overwhelmingly positive in my opinion. However, we all know this is a high-risk investment that’s not only subject to internal strengths and weaknesses but also external/systemic threats, with the recent Binance news being the biggest one yet.


I think in the short term this will be bad news for Vechain’s price and alts in general for obvious reasons. Their US customer base is significant (I’ve heard 15% thrown around) and that obviously helps provide a lot of liquidity to coins including VET. It is likely that it will not be listed with the new US Binance site as that will probably mirror what Coinbase has to be compliant with US regulations. The recent rise with Bitcoin suggests people are dumping alts and going into the ‘safer’ investment and I wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue. This will certainly propagate the price negativity that has dominated this sub for the last few weeks. With all of this factored in, this was the first time I considered dumping my VET and moving it all into ETH which represents the largest part of my portfolio.
 
*However*, the more I thought about it the less reasons I could actually come up with to sell, especially after reacting emotionally and not logically to this news. I considered the following in my decision:


·         First and foremost, I have made peace with my investment decision into this coin and the money I’ve allocated towards it. I am not losing any sleep over short term price movements because my timeline is at this point is 2+ years. It is clear from some of the responses here that many lack this clarity and did not come in with any kind of distinct strategy other than ‘moon’. Otherwise, they would have sold or at least reduced their position so it didn’t stress them out so much.


·         How many other coins are trying to build an entire ecosystem like this *and* have a dedicated exchange to that ecosystem? How many of these exchanges have large scale enterprises in mind, such as developing a custodial solution for institutional investments? I mean imagine being a coin like NANO which also has a lot of its liquidity on Binance, what alternative do they have?


·         Following that same thought, this may be a boon to Oceanex in the long term as it drives US customers interested buying/trading VET to their preferred exchange (heellooooo OCE). I think we would all agree Binance has too much control of this market.


·         What other coins have a [long-term roadmap (https://i.imgur.com/O9OswGu.jpg) that specifically carves out time (2019-2021) for regulatory development? Vechain is clearly trying to do things ‘right’ in terms of compliance because 1) they are working with large scale enterprises that demand compliance with the law and 2) you cannot build a system of trust that operates outside of the permitted legal framework.


·         Following that thought and Jason’s tweet from yesterday, I am confident that Vechain is working closely with regulators to ensure Oceanex can operate in large markets like the US. Especially given the rampant rumors of the PWC client based in the US that’s yet to be announced (Boeing? Cisco? Disney? Faceb- just kidding.)



I mean consider what would happen *if* Oceanex gets approved as a crypto exchange in the US or China (or alternatively, a listing on Coinbase). Think of the advantage that provides in the vacuum created by Binance’s downfall. It’s not something that’s going to develop in the immediate short term but could turn into a long term advantage. Now with all that said, consider all of the other advantages that are already mentioned frequently here:

- Core of DNV GL’s business infrastructure among a diverse group of business relationships (‘muh partnerships’)

- Tokenomics that actually make sense and provide reason for VET’s value (*extremely* important IMO)


- Experienced team with a well laid out vision for the future of the company


- Research arm with several high profile partnerships


- Support from well-known VCs and equity purchases by PWC and DNV GL


- Vast array of *demonstrated* use cases in real-life situations where business can actually start to measure the value they provide. Yes, cynical peanut gallery, these are ‘only’ POCs but anyone who understands how a business operates with the implementation of an IT project this massive and cutting edge knows that this is the pathway forward. If these POCs hit, we are in the fucking driver’s seat. 


- Even more hypothetical use cases in the pipeline: vaccine tracking, carbon ecosystem, asset tokenization (real life and video games), etc.


- Scalability via conscious compromise on decentralization


- Technology that facilitates adoption:  MPP, multi transaction clauses, Toolchain, accelerator program, custodial services


- Strong community with steadily increasing developer presence (ETH is still king here however)


I could go on. I look at the above and I cannot excuse dumping this coin. I think the questions you have to ask yourself: are you willing to take the high-risk crypto journey? Are you willing to potentially watch the short term price take a hit, even after a long bear market? Are you willing to be patient? I know I am.",2019-06-15 23:36:32

&gt;Therefore, a team of management sciences and informatics researchers at TUM has carried out the most detailed calculation of the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin system to date. Working like detectives, they proceeded step by step to gather conclusive data.

&gt;The team began by calculating the power consumption of the network. This depends primarily on the hardware used for Bitcoin mining. ""Today special systems are used, known as ASIC-based miners,"" explains Stoll. In 2018 the three manufacturers who control the ASIC miner market planned IPOs. The team used the mandatory IPO filings to calculate the market shares of the companies' respective products. The study also had to consider whether the mining was being done by someone running just one miner at home or in one of the large-scale ""farms"" set up in recent years by professional operators. ""In those operations, extra energy is needed just for the cooling of the data center,"" says Stoll. To investigate the orders of magnitude involved, the team used statistics released by a public pool of different miners showing the computing power of its members.

These markets are highly irrational and sometimes feel like the people investing in them are completely stupid. See Ripple etc.
There is nothing wrong with riding the wave with BTC, Bitcoin Gold or even SV. Do I think that these projects will stand the test of time? No. Eth will overtake them, because Ethereum has more Devs, the better infrastructure and people that actually have their head on straight.

So because of this, people do a ""brute force"" search. They keep trying random large numbers, hash them using the same algorithm, and see if it matches the small number. If it matches, you found the right number, and you win the race. If it doesn't match, you pick another random large number, and keep trying again until someone finds the large number that matches the small number. 

The same equation *can* be seen more than once, but it's extremely unlikely.

Going through his post history you got gems like this 

&gt;I have seen you make a similar post within /r/apple at least once before. Apple products are luxury goods for individuals with high incomes. $1800 is not a lot of money to many of us. Whether I buy a $500 laptop, a $1800 laptop, or a $5000 laptop makes no difference to me financially.

&gt;If this is a testament to how you spend your time there is no need to wonder why you are poor. You too probably do not understand why someone would buy a luxury car, clothing, or home. You lack sophistication and culture so you rage with jealousy and envy on the internet about things you don't understand.

[link](http://np.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1hzivf/what_changes_have_you_noticed_in_mavericks_beta_3/cazo069)

and

&gt;Apple laptops are not by any means the most expensive computer someone can ""come across."" I also own an Asus G75VW-DH72 and a variety of other computers that I have purchased over the years. &gt;**Again, you are obviously poor.**

&gt;You are right, I do not have the same concept of money as you. Whether or not I am purchasing a Apple laptop or a Mercedes makes no difference to my quality of life nor does it alter my financial state.
Would you consider someone foolish for spending $1.99 on a pack of gum instead of the cheaper .99 option? Your concept of money is one of a poor persons. You have an inflated view of $1000 that many of us do not have.

&gt;If it makes you feel better I can send you an old Apple product collecting dust in my closet. You seem to be the type of person that is poor from lack of education and drive rather than an unfortunate circumstance so you may not deserve it but that is okay.

era41ev,albions-angel,39,"I THINK I understand what they are trying to say. I will attempt to simplify it and maybe they can come in and correct me. 

Lets say Alice buys something off of Bob for £1 (lets ignore bitcoins and use real world money). She does this by bank transfer (because its not 1999 any more Bob!). Carol also buys something off of Dan for £5. This all happens on the 1st of Jan. That is all the trading that happens in the world that day. 

The bank wants to make sure that these transfers are recorded, so that Alice loses £1 and Carol loses £5, while Bob gets £1 and Dan gets £5. So it creates a simple receipt system. Any transaction will be written as ""Buyer Initial + Seller Initial + # of £"". So Alice's transaction is AB1, while Carol's is CD5. That means that the total transaction receipt for Jan 1st is: 

AB1CD5

Ok, but thats really easy to figure out who got what. So lets ""encrypt"" that data. We will use a clever and UNBREAKABLE code which does the following. 

1. For each transaction in the Receipt, assign a number to each letter, from A=1 to Z=26.
2. Add the numbers of the 2 initials in each transaction
3. take away the number of the value traded. 

Thus, AB1 becomes 1+2-1 = 2. And CD5 becomes 3+4-5 = 2. So the ENCRYPTED receipt for Jan 1st is 22. The bank is happy the transaction is real, AND that its hard for someone to steal Alice's or Carol's data. Job done, lock the receipt in a filing cabinet. 

But, thats because we trust the bank. What if we DONT trust the bank? What if there is NO bank to trust? Well, in that case, we should check that the algorithm works. Now, imagine the world woke up stupid, and couldnt reverse engineer the above algorithm. Now we have to employ someone (Eve) to manually test each and every combination of 4 letters and INFINITE numbers until we randomly stumble on the combination that gives us 22. Until Eve is able to do that, the entire day's transactions might be fake. We simply dont know. Eventually, Eve does prove it, finding the correct combination (AB1CD5). We all nod our heads and go ""ok, well the algorithm clearly works, and in this case, 22 is a number that can fall out the bottom of it, so all transactions for Jan 1st are correct"". That ""block"" of transactions are now valid, and we pay Eve £1 for her time. But that took Eve a while and its now Jan 5th, and there are 4 other ""blocks"" one after the other, all in a ""chain"" that need solving. Guess we better drag Eve back into the office, its going to be a busy week!

I THINK its exactly like that, except:

1. There arnt 2 transactions, there are millions
2. They dont happen once a day, they happen every second
3. The unencrypted receipt isnt a simple alphanumeric code
4. The encryption algorithm cant be broken by a 5 year old
5. We done use £, we use a magical pretend currency called bitcoin (which is totally ""less real"" than ""real"" money, which totally has a ""real"" value and absolutely isnt a proxy for a pretend amount of shiny yellow metal we dont have any more and was only worth stuff because it looked nice and whose original intrinsic value is based on a simplistic bartering system of bright stone beads for goats...)
6. Eve isnt a person, shes many people, and shes not doing calculations by hand, shes buying high end graphics cards, overclocking them, running them day and night for years, performing billions of calculations every instant, and then reselling them ""as new"" on ebay for just under original price luring unsuspecting gamers into accidentally destroying their new gaming PCs no Im not salty HonestMike66 I just wanted to play Vermintide II and I dont think it was too much to ask to be able to do that and not have my computer burst into flames.

erai58d,ReverseAbortion,37,"The problem with digital stuff is, it can easily be duplicated. That's one of the hard problem Bitcoin trying to solve in the beginning.

Suppose you own 1 dollar bill in PDF format. If you ""send"" it to me, now we both own the same copy of that dollar bill. And that's not how cash supposed to work, right?

What Bitcoin do is, it make sure that when you ""send"" a unit of money to me, I should be the only one owning that unit of money now. Just like how a dollar bill in your wallet works when you hand it to me. No 2 copy like sending PDF in email. Get the idea?

To achieve that, we need a massive ledger, a record of every transaction of digital money in this world since the beginning, in this case that digital money is called Bitcoin. 

To make sure it's secured, we need thousands of exact same copies of that ledger, managed and fact checked by volunteers all around the world. 

Running a ledger fact checking operation will cost you ridiculous amount of electricity, as the difficulty to manage it will increase day by day as the network grows bigger. But don't worry, the system will compensate your effort with an amount of Bitcoin.

Now to answer your question, who set the value of Bitcoin? Here's how:

If you own a super computer farm to help manage and secure the Bitcoin network, and at the end of the month you check your Bitcoin wallet and you get compensated a total of 1 BTC. And the cost to run that super computer farm (electricity, salary, rent, etc) is around $4,000 a month.

Will you sell that 1 BTC for less than $4000? How much will you sell it? As high as people are willing to buy in the open market, right? Of course you want some profit for running that operation.

But whatever happen, you will always try to never sell it below $4,000.

And that's how the base price is ""set"" by the supply side.

- O pavão falou que bitcoin não é rastreável. Bitcoin é rastreável sim, a polícia americana já tá  bem vacinada nas técnicas de rastreamento. A maneira mais fácil é vc procurando em registros públicos ou privados a pessoa divulgando seu endereço em algum lugar, e com bitcoin o endereço é fixo. Existem criptomoedas focadas em segurança como Monero e Verge, sendo Monero a mais abrangente e utilizada. Isso é algo que qualquer um minimamente estudado no assunto sabe.

- o cara tem que ser muito burro pra fazer uma transação absurda dessa para uma corretora. A corretora precisa ter o caixa preparado pra isso, inclusive, e dependendo do valor a receita federal fica sabendo na hora e te cobra IR. Até o mais leigo do crime sabe que a melhor forma de ter essa grana é diluindo em vários peers, usando proxies para transações (preferencialmente os que passam pela China ou Russia, por questões políticas) e lavando o dinheiro, fazendo isso paleativamente sem passar o limite mensal que a Receita pega.

- Não é nenhum segredo que o Glenn Greenwald fazia defesa de extremistas. Ele até explicou isso no programa pânico recentemente. Se você parar pra pensar, por essa lógica todo defensor público é um potencial nazista.

It is facilitated by a multisig federation which never has complete control, making it non-custodial.

It integrates seamlessly with the Lightning Network, allowing the opening/rebalancing/closing of channels to occur off-chain via Statechains, making on-boarding onto Lightning instant, and allowing you to swap participants in and out of channel factories.

Privacy is also enhanced. UTXOs can be swapped atomically, allowing for the equivalent of off-chain coinjoin. Blind Signatures make the federation completely unaware of what they are signing. They can’t even see whether their activity has anything to do with Bitcoin!

This and many more features become possible off-chain – Discreet Log Contracts, cross-chain atomic swaps (DEX equivalent), transfer of non-fungible RGB tokens, etc! Curious to learn more?

They’re making a crypto currency backed by real assets to try to stabilize its value.  So rather than bitcoin, whose noble goal is to create a stable currency outside of manipulation of central bankers, this crypto attempts to make a currency that *is* manipulated by developed economies central planners.

This may not make any sense to you as a likely member of a developed economy.  But there are many more people in the world who do not have ready access to a stable “first world” currency.  Add to that the fact that in many developing countries Facebook basically *is* the internet, I can actually see this working out in a profound sense.  In East Africa, for example, people extensively use person-to-person electronic transfers over cash.  For most users, this would be improved if the medium of exchange was a stable currency.

They're really fantastic and worth the read - in these early exchanges you can see how questions and concerns form skeptics were handled with lucid focus, consideration and a generally benevolent tone on the part of Satoshi (whoever this person really is).  This was all before Bitcoin even launched.  And while I understand the basics of how Bitcoin works, I was encouraged to see the [ELI5 dissections of Byzantine fault tolerance](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/11/) thoughtfully laid out by the original author. 

It's frankly amazing that whoever designed and wrote the protocol was able to forecast the entire trajectory of Bitcoin's operation in the real world as we've known it to date - double-spend problems, honesty though longest chain, block timing disparities and the Moore's law effect of computer advancement then baked into mining difficulty.  Resolution to these potential weaknesses have all played out, more of less, inline with the author's predictions.

erfkjdt,notmyrralname,66,"Xrapid is the flagship product that utilizes specifically xrp to achieve settlements. 

Heres a simple view of how it works and how xrapid can effect price/xrp:

- Xrapid partner wants to send money from A to B. 

- Partner deposits money into xrapid. 

- xrapid purchases xrp (using partner money) on local xrapid-enabled exchange. Unlike when you or i buy xrp (we try to get as many xrp as we can for our money), xrapid does not care about price per xrp. It gets as many as are necessary to equal the target value to transfer. Meaning, if the partner wants to transfer $1B from A to B, and the entire order book of xrp on exchange A (from the cheapest up to the most expensive) equals $1B, that is what xrapid buys. 

- xrapid sends xrp from exchange A to exchange B. 

- xrapid sells xrp for currency B to achieve target value. 

- finally, xrapid sends currency B to recipient. 


Youll notice one critical piece in that process that has the most effect on value per xrp: its that xrapid does t care about what price its buying at. All it cares is getting “X” amount of xrp. As the demand for xrp use rises, meaning as more and more xrapid transfers take place, people will get the picture that they dont need to sell their xrp for less. So the lower value listings of xrp will dry up. You can see this happening right now, as more people want to buy bitcoin for instance, the market goes up. Supply/demand. 

Also, to head off the likely fud, there is an argument that “banks wont be willing to make you rich by buying your xrp”. Silly. Banks couldnt care less if you are rich or not. In this scenario they are making their money off of the utility of remittances. They do not feel the cost of buying xrp. It is completely invisible and not even a relevant part of the equation. All they care is that they are able to send $1B at the speed of light for a fraction of the current cost.",2019-06-18 07:30:43

erh712l,IgneousWrath,61,"Meanwhile last night I absolutely lit a guy up with a Luger, he ran around the house with his big ol MG and immediately jumped in the window with only about 15 health left. As he was doing his window jump animation I shot at him a few more times to finish him off, but his hitboxes were not lining up. Of course at that point I ran out of bullets in my clip so I decided to melee at him instead. I swung directly at him and... nothing happened. That's when he decided he was going to invest in Bitcoin. So as I was standing there swinging at him, he pulled out his cell phone and transferred $30,000 into stocks. He got rich, he became successful and moved to New York where he started a family and raised two children. One became a lawyer and the other a doctor. At the age of 70, he sat on the front porch of his beach house in Florida and wondered, ""What ever happened to that guy that tried to mug me back in the war?""

He flew back to Europe and returned to the house where it all began. He found me still at full health, still swinging my shovel at nothing. To make it fair he positioned himself in front of me again. To his surprise, I had reloaded my Luger and I was ready to go. One shot, miss, even though he was 2 inches away. Another shot, miss, because this time he managed to stand even closer.

erg2bvz,deadalnix,57,"Yes.

The first obvious reason is that you need people on hand ready to handle emergencies such as security vulnerabilities. Attacker get smarter and smarter and therefore this will be an ongoing battle. As I explained, even if you do nothing else, you need a critical mass of devs able to handle this.

But this is not all. First, with scale, everything becomes exponentially worse. Imagine the code could be optimized to win 1ms when validating a transaction. Right now, this would barely change anything. At 1000tps, you have one CPU core pinned at 100% constantly due to that 1ms. And you have this bug that corrupt the DB once in while when writing a transaction to it. Maybe it isn't even a bug, maybe it is just the hardware that is failing you once in a while. It happen to one person per year, so not a huge deal, and you can tell that person that the DB is corrupted and they need to IBD again. Now move that to 100tps. You have 3 people getting a DB corruption EVERY DAYS. You need to change you DB system, add error correction or something because this is now a serious problem.

And then, the stack on top of which you work changes constantly. This happens on a regular basis. Let me try to make a non exhaustive list of this types of event since the inception of bitcoin, since this is work that would have to be done even if we assume everything was good from day 1:

1/ People started using SSD. SDD have vastly different characteristics than HDD. First they are faster, especially for non sequential reads. That means the optimization work will need to be redone altogether as the tradeof made are not the same anymore. But they also do not like being writen to many time at the same location. As a result using the same data structure in the DB as on a typical HDD would drastically reduce the lifespan of an SSD. You need to change the data-structures the DB uses (usually B-tree for HDD, log structured merge tree for SSD). Finally, SSD has a higher error rate than HDD. It means there will be way more DB failure and corruption due to the hardware and you need to compensate in the software.

2/ The bottleneck on the network was bandwidth, now it is latency. We got faster and faster internet. Or did we ? Not really. The time it takes for an information to go from point A to point B hasn't really changed, what changed is how much information we can move. This means that the tradeof made in the network layer don't make a lot of sense now as they are not optimizing for the limiting factor. The network layer will need, in time, to be rewritten to account for this new reality.

3/ Everybody uses a mobile phone. This is fubaring the whole internet, not just bitcoin, because mobile phone can, and often do move. You can't assume the endpoint you are talking with is at the same location on the network. This causes horrible user experience, for instance when you get out of your home and switch from wifi to 4G or vice versa and the damn thing drop all active connections. New usage need that we need to change the software to handle it.

4/ New CPU architectures. It is now common to build servers with ARM chip in them (hello Rasp Pi nodes). Well the damn thing needs to build and run on ARM.

5/ Spectre/meltdown and other CPU side channel leak. You want your private key to stay in your wallet and not be accessible from any javascript running in your browser, right ? That means we need to tweak the crypto libraries to limit side channels. New CPU come out all the time, and every time they do, this is an exciting opportunity for a new side channel.

6/ Change in 4rd party dependencies. OpenSSL changed it API in version 1.1 . You wouldn't be able to run any old version of bitcoind on a modern system because of this. Same goes for BerkeleyDB and various other dependencies.

7/ Different environments to run in. Windows 10 for instance. That means a new set of API and bugs to manage :)

8/ High DPi screens. Program used to draw pixels on the screen. The problem is, we have 15"" 4K screen nowadays and it looks ridiculously small. If you make it bigger, it's laughably big on a previous generation screen. The concept of DPi solves this, but that means using a new set of graphic API and libraries.

I think you get the point. Even if we assume constant usage and no new features, there is still a ton to do. This internet thing is fast moving and constantly changing. The computers plugged into it as well. Add scaling problem on top of this and you get what's using 90% of the dev time. New features actually barely register in the workload. For instance, over the past 6 month, 15 commits have been made relative to schnorr. Over that same time, 1048 commits were made. It's less than 2%.",2019-06-18 11:20:10

eribew8,brokendefeated,146,"I've read about it and it seems to be aimed primarily towards people in developing countries around the world, like WeChat Pay is aimed towards Chinese citizens. 

Main purpose is to cripple mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and kill remittance services like Western Union. Plenty of people in developing world depend on remittances sent by family members who live in 1st world countries. For example, the United States is currently the largest source of international remittances in the world, sending a total of $56.3 billion in 2015. Significant percent of that money is taken by 3rd parties like Western Union, which is still the most popular way to send and receive remittances. People in rural regions simply don't have access to traditional banking and easiest way to receive money is to go to the nearest post office and get money sent via Western Union.

Since smartphones are no longer luxury and 3G/4G coverage around the world improved significantly in this decade, FB coin plans to take advantage of this. It will allow people to receive send and receive money across the border at low or no fees. Since it's partnered with Visa and MasterCard, you'll most likely soon going to be able to pay with FB coin at places which accept Visa and MasterCard. Also services like Venmo are unavailable outside of the US and this is where FB coin comes into play. Whatsapp is extremely popular in developing world and it will allow you to send FB coin to other people easily.

Which meant I didn't get paid, in addition, I was supposed to be paid in bitcoin, and one of it's biggest bubbles happened soon after that, so I'll always have that thought to sting me for the rest of my life. 

Anyways, I started when I did because I was numb, depressed, and couldn't find a job. 

I didn't actually need the money, but, like a lot of people who get exposed to crime, there was an incredible allure to the idea of ""fast money"" ""fast money"" is one of the most dangerous concepts for youth, it's so tempting, the idea that I can make what my parents have spent their lives getting jobs to make with way less effort. 

But as for the numbness thing, somebody paying to have sex with you can feel super gratifying, I had (and still have) super low self esteem, so the idea that I was so attractive that somebody would pay money for me gave me a good feeling that I was not getting anywhere else.

I say I got off easy because I managed to get away from all of that without getting caught by anyone in my life, and most of them still don't know the full extent of what I did.

So yeah, that's why, another thing I'll mention was that I was sexually abused as a child, so that experience fucked with my head a lot obviously.

Most of the trading volume in crypto is in a coin called Tether that is printed at will by a sketchy exchange called Bitfinex. At first, Tether promised to maintain a dollar peg by holding equivalent assets in cash (i.e. $1bn Tethers exist, so Tether Inc will hold $1bn in cash), and they promised regular audits. An audit was never done, and recently the NY AG charged Tether with fraud when it was uncovered that the cash they are supposedly backed with doesn't exist, and Tether is backed by loans between Bitfinex and Tether, which are collateralized by alleged bank accounts that have been seized by foreign governments on money laundering concerns. So all the money that Tether was supposedly holding to cover its peg was actually just given to Bitfinex to cover other losses. Importantly, the same people are directors of Tether and Bitfinex. Somehow, $16bn of Tethers still exchanged hands yesterday ($17bn of Bitcoin was exchanged).

Read this for your drug or whatever buying purposes. It will help you stay safe, mainly from the police.

Silk road as you may or may not know was taken down a few years ago. You may pick from the markets on dark.fail (yes, dot fail is a valid thing) for your choice of items.

No, no one is going to murder you. There's no incentive for someone to travel, murder someone, and get what..money? (You could murder/rob someone locally if you wanted money). So it's quite unrealistic for someone to come after you.

The rest of your questions are answered in the darknet bible. One thing that I recommend and seems not to be the standard is USE MONERO (a private cryptocurrency).

Two reasons

1. Way cheaper than bitcoin (bitcoin fees are ridiculous)

2. Way more private than bitcoin (you can't see how much, to who, from where, stuff was sent).

The question arises, where do I get this elusive monero? Answer: localmonero.co. Choose one of the reputable vendors (they have 100% feedback) and send your money in the mail, or buy online if you wish.

erk98qh,runawayblackman,39,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

10. The bitcoin/crypto infrastructure has never been in better shape - there a more services/offerings than ever. and they are, on average, more trustworthy and better engineered than ever. 
11. More big-name backers (like @Jack) who are talking up BTC, investing directly in BTC and building out the ecosystem. 
12. Financial / news media are more fluent in bitcoin and crypto than they have ever been. If anyone remembers back to 2012/2013, the quality of reporting was utter shite - riddled with false statements and negative framing. Reporting is still not fantastic, but sooo much better than it's ever been.

And this is good news bcs some day we will have this. And when we do, the entire space will get a major boost in terms of validation of a core idea (programmable money) and in terms of valuation. 
14. We are setting a magnificent launch pad for the next halving. Anywhere from $7.5-15k will set us up so fucking beautifully for a pre-halving pump.

erpmip3,Bitcoin1776,56,"I want to take a second to point out the GENIUS of this security system.

There are two basic approaches to security: multi-sig wallets and this. This is NOT a multi-sig wallet, this is taking a private key and splitting into multiple pieces are 'parts of a soul'.

This is 'break in case of emergency', and each time you break it and store it again, you make a new one.

So imagine, instead, of doing a multi-sig, you create new private key, shard (split) this, and then must visit each of the 12 banks once again, to store and safeguard your secrets, after transferring all the BTC value to the new address.

Pain in the ass right? Well, multi-sigs have a huge flaw, and that is 'technology'. Technologies change and can break multi-sigs, or get them hacked. Ethereum has lost near $1 Billion due to multi-sigs breaking, probably 70% of their early enterprise investors ruined.

What the Winklevoss brothers did was NOT rely upon technology - it is just a paper wallet, which they cut into many pieces.

So this indicates three things :

1) It is not an active wallet with funds going in and out. Of course, it very well could be but the 'hassle' is visiting 12 banks each transfer, as opposed to 3 or 4 with a multisig.

2) Their wallet will change each time it is accessed. It's a 'one use' wallet. While this might be trivial on the surface, it helps not to have one-wallet linked to a variety of incoming and outgoing transfers - perhaps one of those is honeypot drug money, and now the FBI says all your money is 'corrupted', as they do.

3) They are committed to the technology. Without active trading, they profit from the scale of Bitcoin not fluxuations. Their 'technological interests' are in basic tech, only. If BTC core changes substantially, it won't break their systems so long as paper wallets still function (the foundations of all BTC code).

An example of a sharding technique would be as follows:

Private key - BITCOIN123456789

* Bank 1 - BITC

* Bank 2 - OIN1

* Bank 3 - 2345

* Bank 4 - 6789

Or you do like

* BITC - 1 - 5 - 9

* OIN1 - T - 4 - 8

* 2345 - I - I - 7

* 6789 - B - O - 2

To get into situations where you can have high rates of failure, and bruteforce the rest.

Paper wallets (not much talked about these days) use a series of 12 or 24 standard dictionary words from a list of 2,048 possible word choices, with a 13th or 25th 'word' which can be anything, for the password.

It's *relatively* easy to brute force 1 or 2 unknown word combinations, but beyond that a challenge. Brute forcing passwords is more problematic, as each incorrect entry locks out the wallet for double the period of time.

So brute forcing a password 8 times would lock out the wallet for 2^8 seconds or 256 seconds... doing it 20 times is 1,048,576 seconds - thus 'time' is the issue, not computational brute forcing tries - and thus, this is the opposite of what hackers want (speedy theft, speedy exit - before sounding alarms).

With seedwords, brute forcing 1 is 2,048 tries, 2 is 4,194,304 tries (2,048^2)... brute forcing 12 is 2,048^12 is a number 40 digits deep, at the edge of global computational ability - and 24 words is 80 digits deep.

So to review:

1) Their method is low tech, not subject to breaking changes.

2) It is simple for others to understand, should they have to teach it to children.

3) It can sustain a high rate of failure. I suspect they'd have it setup so that 9 out of 12 banks could fail, and they could brute force last words, if needed (presuming it's split into 4's).

4) Paper lasts centuries, USB drives fail after years.

And that is that. It could be as easy as cutting paper slices into 4s, or it could be more complex, but that's the root of their technique.

This is not an actively traded Bitcoin wallet - this is an investment in the ecosystem. They only succeed if Bitcoin succeeds, longterm.",2019-06-21 22:06:32

erp7lov,ethacct,38,"Here's a fact: you could have become a billionaire last year, starting with less than $1000.  It's true!  All you had to do was pick the top-performing stock 365 times in a row, and roll your earnings over into that new stock every single day of the year.

Here's another one:  assuming you're older than 11, you could've mined THOUSANDS of Bitcoin back in 2008 or 2009, and been a multi-millionaire right now.


I'm guessing, however, that you don't feel too bad about these missed opportunities.  It's pretty ridiculous to think that a person could perfectly predict the top-performing stock every single day of the year, and obviously very few people had the foresight to believe that Bitcoin would be worth thousands of dollars (and even those that did, fewer of them still had the balls to hold it this entire time).  So if you don't feel bad about missing those opportunities, why do you feel bad about missing others?

Take your time, do your research, and choose an investing thesis.  If you really think that ETH will outperform other assets in the long run, then who gives a shit what EOS does month-to-month?  It doesn't matter because long-term it's probably worthless.  

And if you think EOS is going to perform better in the short-term and ETH in the long-term, then make your trades and watch them play out.  Regardless, there's no point in being 'jealous' of the gains of other cryptos.

Bitcoin is novel.  It's something that sounds so dumb, so scammy, but when you look at it and try to understand the problem that's being addressed, you can start to get it.  I highly recommend you read the original whitepaper if you haven't, and are thinking about crypto.  It's simple, lucid, and a lot to think about. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Think about it terms of what it actually is; a social system of rules whereby people can cooperate more efficiently than with other systems.  Bitcoin, through Nakamoto consensus, significantly limits the ability of malicious actors to game/cheat the system, and strongly promotes consensus and cooperation.  These are emergent properties from a simple, ruthless, and imperfect system that many in the cryptography community originally reviled.  It was too inelegant, too barbaric to work.  But that ugliness is also the strength of the system, and now proof-of-work systems have been proven to be remarkably robust and effective.

Crypto has a future; there are problems to address and they will likely evolve and improve.  PoW + blockchain was the first major innovation.  It's possible there will be more truly novel systems created, but thus far this hasn't happened.  The future may be Bitcoin, or it may not, but there's a future.

But the salient point is that the cat is out of the bag.  We have something that's new in a very fundamental way, one that we don't understand yet.  There's no going back.

________

I strongly caution those that are outright dismissive of Bitcoin.  If you study social problems, game theory, and the challenges of cooperation, you realize that Bitcoin is special.  It came out of nowhere and did what most thought was probably impossible.  If you don't see the value in that, that's on you.

As a financial decision, it's *way* more complicated, but you shouldn't disbelieve the growth scenario.  This is innovation that may mediate some notable fraction of global wealth.

Gamble: short-term trades, trying to time bubbles, etc.

Investment: 5-10+ year holding. But I would make this contingent on staying informed about crypto development, watching whether another true innovation comes along.",2019-06-22 05:13:02

Contrast this to USDC, issued by coinbase, that can always be exchanged by any user for USD.

If tether is pushing up the asset price, it is in a similar way that the US Federal Reserve pushes up real estate and other asset prices by allowing a system of fractional reserve banking.  There are two big differences though: the fiat reserve system is based on actual assets like houses, (I'm loath to include) cars, businesses, etc, plus the promise of a person (with a history of producing marketable services/products) to pay in the future; the tether system, however, is backed by the idea that you can convert your USDT into USD, which is false on its face because end-users can't convert, but is probably also false because Tether doesn't have enough cash/bonds/assets to cover a full conversion of all USDT into USD.",2019-06-22 12:02:31

Today, blocks average about 1.3mb each, and txs are much more dense (more outputs per tx), thanks to segwit and tx batching respectively.

Because of these two factors, Bitcoin can handle 30-50% more economic activity before a fee event like this occurs. Additionally, fee estimators have gotten better.

So again, the answer to your question is that no one knows, but we're in a better place than we were last time.

erquy1z,TheGreatCryptopo,41,"Hal Finney. AKA Satoshi Nakamoto. RIP. Craig Wright, Go Fuck Yourself.

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",2019-06-22 06:31:44

The math doesn’t add up. Even if you bought in at $1k/BTC, you claim your portfolio went up 28x when bitcoin didn’t even fully top 20x from Jan 2017 prices.

Even IF you somehow beat the market by almost 50% portfolio growth in the first big crypto bubble, you also would’ve owed ballpark 150k in cap gains taxes if you were in the US for the 600k you liquified.

So, 150k taxes plus 100k diversified (so
you look savvy), plus 50k just handed to your parents (so you look generous) brings us to 300k, which is half the stack you said you cashed out.

Avg student loan debt in North America is about 40k, which brings us to almost 350k before we account for a condo purchase and some world travel, which could’ve only cost you 150k total.

I live in a mid-tier city and new condos go for about 225k starting, with modest homes in the the 300-500k range, so you must’ve gotten a steal of a deal with that condo!

But then again, you’re apparently quite savvy with money, since you got that 50k cash while also having credit card debt and student loans, while also getting someone to sign off on your condo purchase without wondering how you could pay it off in cash, since a non-predatory loan would be hard to get with your existing financial situation.

So either this is the story of a lifetime or it’s another bs moon post, karma farming like we saw every day through 2017.

ertu7fw,saibog38,36,"A lot of people mention gold as the biggest market bitcoin can potentially disrupt, but imo the sovereign bond market (particularly those of sovereigns considered the ""safest"", i.e. the US, Japan, EU, etc.) is the bigger fish bitcoin can potentially compete with on the ""store of value"" front.  

Money traditionally is not just a medium of exchange, but also a means of saving.  Back in the times of gold as money, saving was often as simple as just storing gold, since it was a generally deflationary asset that served that purpose well.  In our modern fiat monetary systems, we've seen a bifurcation of the medium of exchange role (currency) and the savings role (sovereign debt).  Modern fiat currencies are generally inflationary and thus not a desirable savings vehicle, so that role is fulfilled by interest-paying sovereign debt, the safest among which is the debt of the currency-issuing sovereigns with the best fiscal responsibility.  The global reserve asset for much of recent history has been US debt, which serves the ""savings"" role for the US monetary system alongside the Dollar's currency role.

Bitcoin, like gold, is a deflationary monetary system where the money itself can serve as a savings vehicle, and it potentially competes with any market where people are simply looking for ways to store their wealth (a healthy portion of the real estate market falls in this category as well, as well as conservative index funds).  Yes, it's volatile right now, but there's simply no way for a free market asset to go from zero to ""global reserve asset"" without a metric shit ton of volatility along the way.  Volatility *is* reducing as it grows, and the fact that it's still so volatile is a sign of how much runway there's left.

There are strong network effects associated with any dominant reserve asset (liquidity for example, and less measurable qualities like ""trust""), and our current systems of wealth storage are actually quite messy due to various problems with all the options - the biggest is US sovereign debt, but it's not easily available to all and carries unavoidable political risks (sovereign debt historically does not fare well over the very long term, hence why gold has endured for so long).  Gold, while being ""deflationary"" is not nearly as deflationary as it could be - supply increases roughly 1.5-2% a year due to mining, which limits its deflationary potential (and that's why sovereign debt can actually compete favorably with it when well managed).  Bitcoin approaches 0% supply growth and thus can be perfectly deflationary.

Looking at all the markets bitcoin can potentially siphon value from, we're looking at a sum value on the order of 100 trillion dollars.  Even a small portion of that puts bitcoin into the 7 figures and above.  

As far as ""why bitcoin rather than some other cryptocurrency with all the same advantages and more?""  Simply because it's the first, it's the biggest, and it's good enough.  For those concerned about transaction fees, all I'll say is our current monetary system scales in many layers - the core of the USD monetary system is the centralized ledgers at the Fed and the Treasury, ledgers that ordinary people never interact with.  The consumer banks, credit cards, paypal/venmo, etc. that ordinary people deal with are like layers 3/4/5 in our monetary system.  I expect bitcoin to scale in a similarly layered manner, but with even better properties due to the permisionless and open nature of the base layer.  I'm not saying it's *impossible* for bitcoin to get replaced by something else, but I do think it's highly unlikely (and would be a setback for cryptocurrency as a whole, since it will be hard for any cryptocurrency replacing bitcoin to achieve the same levels of trust, since it's own ascension would set a precedent for failure of the leading cryptocurrency).  

And I know many think the whole ""store of value"" narrative is a recent pivot, but speaking for myself [I've always seen that as principle to bitcoin's value proposition](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1sowur/how_is_a_2600000000000_market_cap_for_btc_possible/).  I've also been [arguing for layered scaling](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1zyz9i/can_bitcoin_really_be_a_microtransaction_platform/cfykrnw/) since well before transaction fees went up and lightning network was a thing.",2019-06-23 10:30:17

&amp;#x200B;

Believe it or not, but yesterday was a down day for our chart.  We failed to exceed the previous high, and the low for the day resulted in a reversal to a column of Os.  Of course, based on the movements last night we are in a tentative new column of Xs—and a tentative double top break out.

When bitcoin acts like this charting is difficult to use because the whole thing is unpredictable—and it doesn’t act like it has in the past.  I guess that is the definition of unpredictable.

What we can do is look at the formations and make some general judgements about potential breakout and break down points.  We can establish some target ranges—but not specific prices.

So, we are in a tentative column of Xs.  If the price drops below 10450 before 7 PM this evening the reversal is will be negated and we continue down towards the High Pole Target price of $9,600.  Call me crazy, but I am thinking that target price is not likely today.

The target for this breakout using the width of the formation is the $11,900 range.  Using the basis of the last breakout (30 boxes high) puts this breakout at $16k sometime in the next week to 30 days.  While that gives me a tingle down my leg, again I am skeptical of it happening in the next week.

Ending above 11k for the day is a good place to start.  Then we can start thinking about adding thousands more to the price.

erynnfh,suninabox,44,"Steam ran into this problem, and they're not physically sending anything.

Someone buys a game worth $20, and pays with 0.002 bitcoin, but by the time it clears 0.002 bitcoin is only worth $18. So then Steam would decline to authorize the transaction until they paid a ""top up"" to get back to $20, or else refund the customer.

Either you consistently piss off customers by requesting ""top up"" amounts and refunding them, or you consistently allow customers to get away with underpaying, neither is desirable for a business, not to mention it makes accounting a nightmare.

Here's the quote from the Steam team when they dropped it :

&gt;Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

&gt;The normal resolution for this is to either refund the original payment to the user, or ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. In both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again. This year, we’ve seen increasing number of customers get into this state. With the transaction fee being so high right now, it is not feasible to refund or ask the customer to transfer the missing balance (which itself runs the risk of underpayment again, depending on how much the value of Bitcoin changes while the Bitcoin network processes the additional transfer).",2019-06-25 06:46:23

erxsahs,Merlin560,31,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

Well, that was a fun weekend.  We reached a high of $11,283 yesterday and today we sank down as low as $10,550.  

The reversal today will be “tentative” until the “end of the day” which is 7 PM EST or 00 UTC.  If the price rises above $11,384 (we use 1.5% boxes now) it will negate the reversal and a box is added to the column.

Clearly, we are in the midst of forming another formation.  The column is 30 rows high, versus 35 boxes for the last breakout.  Technically speaking we could hit as high $12,083 this time around before it really starts to form again.  I am not “predicting” that, it is just what one of the “predictive” measure methods says it could reach.  I am perfectly happy settling around her for a few days.

The high pole warning target is back down at 9700.  This level is a 50% re-tracement.  If you are shorting from near the top, that price would be where I would start looking to close it.  If you are looking to buy a dip, watch for the fall to around this level and then when it turns you should be able to scalp up two the 10,900 area from that bounce.  This represents the flag pattern that we’ve seen several other times.

When we are seeing volumes like this weekend and such dramatic price movements, it is difficult to make effective predictions.  If you are watching every tick, you might be able to do better than this.  I saw some posts this weekend working the one minute chart.  That means  paying more attention than I like; but if it works it works.

The numbers are on the chart.  Good luck.

So I'll give my .02¢ on the one and only Jim McIngvale. I have very strong opinions about him and only hold Bitcoin, so don't be surprised if that .02¢ is worth $100 by the time I'm finished.

  


My first job ever was selling dinette sets at Gallery Furniture. It was the Summer of '95, I was 15 yrs old. Customers always assumed that I was Mack's son being so young and he got a kick out of that. He was always jovial with me but I stayed on his goid side.

  


Back then, GF was just a hodgepodge of attached, one-story buildings and trailers sprawling across the property in no particular direction. I worked my little ass off as a greeter to start, often volunteering to go down the street to load furniture at what used to be the distribution center. Mack saw my work ethic and rapport with customers and personally promoted me to sales my first week. He paid me about $12/hr. Again, I was 15 and it was 1995...pretty damn good money.

  


He treated us all quite well. Ponying up for a huge, catered lunch most days while paying for every employee to eat free at the on-site Schlotzky's others. But the man *is* intense. That ""aura"" that most **highly** successful people possess? Mack's got it in spades. Success breeds success and hard work is contagious. But so is complacency.

  


I've seen the wrath of Jim McIngvale on a tirade and it wasn't pretty. Wasn't supposed to be. He didn't care if it had nothing to do with you nor what you were doing at that moment. If he saw something that didn't adhere to his high standards, he'd get on the store's loudspeaker and order us all to come to the service desk up front. He wanted to make an example of the culprit. I've seen him fire people on the spot. I've seen him fiercely rebuke his own sister as he held the handful of family members who worked there to *at least* as high a standard as everyone else.

  


Someone in this thread complained about him openly admonishing an employee. Welp, that employee could certainly quit if he/she was unhappy. But I'm willing to bet that's wasn't the case. Mack isn't out of control nor stupid. What comes off as boorish to you is actually calculated behavior. I'd ask some of his naysayers here, ""What have *you* built? What have *you* done with your life?"" Not bc I think that you've likely done so little but bc Mack has done so much.

  


It was just him, his wife, a pickup truck, a literal fistful of cash and some true MF'n grit at the onset. The man wasn't *handed* a damn thing. No silver spoons, no trust funds. Just roll-up-your-sleeves hard work and the American dream. Mr. McIngvale embodies all of that.

  


Someone else here suggested that he ""puts on a front"". Welp, he's a born salesman. What the hell else do you expect? When he's hoppin' around in front of the camera, smile from one big ear to the other yellin' ""Save you MONEY!"" or when he's making a public appearance, you're getting showman Mack. When he's roaming a store shooting glare lasers, you're getting iron-fisted leader Mack.

  


I'll tell you what **wasn't** a front, him opening the doors up for displaced Harvey victims when others wouldn't (I'm lookin' at you, fake-ass Joel Osteen). I really *should* bc philanthropy simply **cannot** be praised and lauded enough but I'm not going to list all the amazing things this man and his wife have done for Houston (and around the world). Suffice to say, Mack loves Houston and Houston loves him back. He wasn't born here but he's a true son of the city in my book and he deseves everyone's respect.

  


As you can pronably tell, he was an infuential figure to me in my youth and left an indelible mark on my perception of success and determination. Get well soon, Mack.",2019-06-26 21:23:08

Ask yourself which project is playing the more plausible angle...

IOTA does everything bitcoin does but without fees and less energy use and its also maneuvering to become the standard protocol moving data in a world with 80 billion connected devices interacting constantly.

But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys — yes, all men — from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own.

They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.

Which region will be less impacted by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked, “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the event?”

For all their wealth and power, they don’t believe they can affect the future.

The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr. Robot hack that takes everything down.

This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers — if that technology could be developed in time.
That’s when it hit me: At least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology. Taking their cue from Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Peter Thiel reversing the aging process, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape.”

There are a couple places where we saw a High Pole Warning (4 boxes above the formation start point (the green boxes with the “F” numbers—this is how I track the formations.)

If we went up 61 boxes, a 50%  retrace would be about 30 boxes.  This puts the base price any around $9,600.  For this most recent formation the High Pole Warning target moved up to 12,264—but I think the $11,000 target from yesterday is still more likely. 

These kinds of declines remind me of having the flu.  You go into the bathroom and puke.  You think you are fine.  Then you puke again.  And then, again.  Until finally you're done.  That could be one day, or three or four.  (Or all of 2018.)  But it ends.

Did I say flu?  I meant when you drink too much.

If you zoom out, this is a normal start of the formations we’ve seen for months.  The price shoots up, then it drops and we create a flag or pennant.  After a few days it moves again.  Zooming out and looking at the columns (X for up, O for down) and its possible to see the natural pause points, tops and bottoms.

I don’t put these charts up as “ day trading” advice, but rather as tools that you can use to set your own price targets and gain a perspective of where we are in the big picture.  ""Knowing"" that its possible to drop top $11,000 makes the drops a little easier to experience.

No one likes seeing the “value”of their stack drop significantly.  But damm…we are still over $10K.

As an aside, the volume up on Tuesday is almost matched by the decline today.  Clearly, today will eclipse yesterday because we are already there. But the comparison is interesting—meaning we’ve fallen all the way back to Monday with almost equal intensity.

That really doesn’t seem that horrible to me.

The numbers are on the chart.

es3vjp8,sodafountan,45,"There doesn't necessarily need to be more ""volume"" for the price to increase. If everybody decided to not sell any of their bitcoin, the price would increase indefinitely until someone decided to sell, which would be the new asking price. 

This happens on a global scale every second of every minute across hundreds of exchanges, the average price across all of those exchanges is the one you see on CMC. 

But if nobody on earth ever sold bitcoin again, and millions of people were all bidding to try to buy those bitcoins, the price would just increase vertically until there was enough supply to meet that demand. Everyone has a price they'd sell bitcoin at, but in theory, if bitcoin is truly ""priceless"" the price could hit a million, a billion, you name it. 

That's what's happening now. People always look too heavily at the demand side of the supply and demand equation, that's a fallacy. Supply and Demand are equally important in determining the price of a finite asset.

In short, if demand stays constant and all of a sudden supply gets greatly restricted, the price will go up without any new ""volume"" entering the marketplace. But alas when the price goes up people tend to pay attention and demand/volume increases as well, which creates the snowball affect you're seeing now.",2019-06-27 02:52:12

Secondo anno: una psicopatica che di giorno mi faceva la punta al cazzo perché “non poteva sentire odore di cibo buono (il mio) perché era a dieta” e di notte mi piombava in camera alle due chiedendomi se volessi patatine fritte + un fuori corso a scienze motorie che ogni giorno mi snocciolava i serissimi motivi per cui mannaggia ai pescetti non era riuscito andare a lezione, come se fossi sua madre

Terzo, quarto e quinto anno li ho fatti con due mie amiche + una quarta coinquilina jolly che cambiava ogni anno, tra cui quella delicatissima che ogni settimana faceva venire il suo ragazzo col figlio di lui (cinque anni), io dovevo fare la babysitter mentre loro scopavano, ci ha lasciate in merda con l’affitto a maggio perché ha smesso di pagare, è venuta coi suoi a portare via la roba ad agosto e quando hanno pranzato mi hanno lasciato tutta la loro merda da pulire. Lei è seconda solo a quella romagnola di origini marocchine che si faceva trovare a scopare a porta aperta, cucinava esclusivamente pasta con l’aglio e periodicamente venivano a trovarla i suoi e portavano casse di cipolle che andavano a male e accendevano incensi “per cacciare le cattive vibrazioni che si sentono qua”, plus: le chiedevamo di non fumare in casa e lei lo faceva comunque quindi ho cominciato a incularle accendini e sono arrivata a trenta

Sesto anno: matricola di economia che si fa fare gli shooting fotografici per Instagram dagli amici, ha messo su il suo canale YouTube su come diventare businessman e ti tratta come un povero rincoglionito perché non investi in Bitcoin ma poi lo becchi in casa con la canottiera da camionista e gli airpods a scongelare il pollo con il phon e non sa che se tieni le scarpe da palestra in camera poi puzza di piedi tutta la stanza

es8zwdy,masterflex11,38,"&gt; You’re buying Bitcoin today in the hopes of someone else buying it in the future at a higher price.

That's not entirely correct. You're also hoping for adoption and the more vendors using BTC will increase the purchasing power and naturally price, since there are only around 17m in circulation.

&gt; Cryptocurrency doesn’t create any wealth; it only transfers it between people. And it’s not even a useful commodity like food or energy. 

I take it you mean BTC specifically and not others like ETH that offer smart contracts etc? If so, the number of vendors accepting BTC has never been higher. If BTC succeeds (yes, even after 10 years we are still in the early stages of adoption considering the monetary wealth throughout the world), we could very much see utility companies accepting it in the future.

&gt; Some people have “made a profit” trading Bitcoin, but that doesn’t make it any less scam-like.

But why is it a scam? It has a value and can be traded for goods. It's not too different to the dollars in your pocket, except is isn't centralized or controlled by banks, is distributed, safe from quantitative easing and isn't affected by inflation.

&gt; I wouldn’t touch Bitcoin with someone else's money, let alone my own hard-earned cash/stocks/investments, and I’d advise anyone else to do the same. T

But to me you don't seem to understand the technology (and I mean no offence by that) yet are instructed people to keep away and have stated it's a ""scam"".

The beauty about BTC and other cryptocurrencies is that it's trying to shift away from where the current world monetary system is underpinned and controlled by the few (banks). Look at how the banks almost caused the complete collapse of the global economy in 2008, it was fueled by greed and the public have fitted the bill by staggering public borrowing to fix the mess.

You then have other blockchain projects that are aiming to introduce amazing new ways we deal with transactions. Other projects like IOTA for example are trying to build a system where computers can interact with eachtoher like never seen before:

&gt; IOTA is a revolutionary new transactional settlement and data transfer layer for the Internet of Things. It's based on a new distributed ledger, the Tangle, which overcomes the inefficiencies of current Blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

This and other projects has the potential to change the world on par or more so that how the Internet changed things.

Companies throughout the world (IBM, VW, Banks you name it) are involved in blockchain because they see the potential this technology brings. 

I really do encourage you to read up on it some more. I, like you, felt the same when I first heard about it but bit-by-bit (including the global technology company I work for) frequently started talking and discussing the tech behind it all and are innovating new ways to make use of it.",2019-06-28 20:50:14

1. Dynamic proof of work (v19): prioritize txns based on PoW difficulty. During a spam attack, in order to keep normal txns from being confirmed, the attacker need to keep outbidding the PoW difficulty of these normal txns. It’s easy for casual users to raise PoW, but it will get costly very quickly for the attacker to keep up, and eventually reaching a point where the attacker cannot afford to effectively push out the same spam rate anymore, while it still takes casual users a few seconds to get the transactions confirmed. 

2. Memory-hard PoW (in active research): this reduces the advantage of using ASIC or GPU to spam network, making it even more costly to carry out spam attack.

Confirmation:

1.  Block-cementing (v19): in Bitcoin txns are considered to be confirmed after 6 txns, but it’s actually probabilistic. If someone with super ASICs starts mining a different chain, there is no guarantee that the txn won’t be discarded. After v19 is out, all Nano transactions will be fully confirmed without possibility of rollback. The current default stall-threshold is 60% of online weight and most nodes use this default. So we need at least 30% (majority) of the online weight to vote for a transaction for it to be considered confirmed. It’s simply wrong to say in Bitcoin it’s always 100% and in Nano it’s 30%, because hashing power fluctuate too. During the bear market hashing power dropped a lot, just like that sometimes Nano’s online weight drops due to Principal Representatives staying offline. So if you want to make a fair comparison, you should use the maximum hashing power ever existed in this world as 100%, then Bitcoin is probably way below 30%.",2019-06-29 18:45:13

to u/Aminok:
You are absolutely right in that it is way easier to ramp up transactions on a permissioned blockchain. This is in fact VeChains usecase and purpose. Other projects like NEO do it in a very similar way.
Regarding the security concerns please read below.

To: u/Coinpredictionsnet
Hyperledger is actually on a whole different level because its not specifically public. While I would not say you are 100% wrong here, you also are far from being 100% accurate.

To: u/cryptomaison:
Another one thats not 100% wrong nor 100% true here.
Transactions are only free if you have a stake in VeChain, and even then its not as much free transactions as you wish. Your token generates Gas (vThor) and enables you to send a predefined number of transactions per day based on your stake. Thats neither free nor unfree.

Regarding security concerns and the whole discussion about decentralisation, immutability and permissionlessnees:

These three exist on a spectrum, and the farther you get to good decentralisation, immutability or permissionlessness (D-I-P in the latter), the more inefficient it gets.

While there are usecases where superior D-I-P is king, there are usecases where these three are not needed to be super strong.

For the monetary usecases like Bitcoin has it, it is absolutely worth it to use ressources to achieve a very high D-I-P.

For not-life-threatening usecases like tracking a bottle of wine, it would actually be super wasteful and inefficient to use all as much energy as bitcoin does on a transaction. I guess even the most hardcore maximalits will agree that spending 50cents on a transaction to track a bottle of wine would be just stupid.

When it comes to the more important stuff like uncensorable, unconfiscateable money, inefficiency is actually worth it. Thats why Bitcoin exists and this is the cryptocurrency with the highest marketcap.

If you would have to flee your country tomorrow, you would never consider VeChain nor Ethereum to store and ""hide"" your net worth while running away from your government. Because Bitcoin is absolute king for this usecase.

That's also why this is not Ethereums usecase. Ethereum is actually less decentralized and less immutable than Bitcoin. But it has a place. It lives on a spectrum of decentralisation, immutability and permissionlessness. 

So does VeChain. Its a different usecase.

Some of the comments remind me of the early days of the internet. The strongest ioeologists wanted to make all information free and accessible for everyone. While I absolutely value that, the truth is, we actually face walled gardens, paywalls, closed ecosystems and all the stuff we opposed. 

Of course we can try to fight back, but sorry folks, if we manage that, it will be on bitcoins back, not Ethereums. And there will still be usecases for less decentralized, less permissionless and less immutable projects.",2019-06-29 04:04:53

esbn72u,SenatusSPQR,53,"
Nice, a long post that actually seems to want to discuss pros and cons for once. I applaud you.

&gt; I believe currency, especially global decentralized ones, is a winner take all. There's an opportunity cost to holding two currencies. I can't have my maximal purchasing power in both, as one will be weaker. The only way for nano to succeed is to convince regular people to adopt it. And the best way to get regular people to adopt it, en masse, is to convince Bitcoin holders to give up their coins and switch. As of right now I'm not convinced.

We partly disagree on this first step. While I do think that a global decentralized currency is a winner takes all endeavor, this does not mean the same as convincing regular people to adopt it. As long as everyone is content having their fiat dollar or euro money (or perhaps libra soon), they won't move into decentralized currencies except perhaps as a hedge to their fiat currencies, or if that currency offers some other benefits (such as, perhaps, being used easily across borders, being cheaper to transact in, etc).

So while we do agree that decentralized currencies are winner take all, I don't think that these decentralised currencies currently compete with government fiat. They might for some countries and perhaps for more countries in the future, but not at this point.

&gt; 2)Bitcoin Pros: can't debase it, so it's a better store of their purchasing power, when used to save (long term) than Fiat since governments can't stop their printing machines.

&gt; 3)Nano Pros: instant and free transactions

I think those pros for Bitcoin also are pros for Nano, right?

&gt; Cons: abysmal adoption. What's the point of no fee transactions when I can't find anyone to spend it on? Why would I save in nano when I can save in a better currency and have more purchasing power? The nano:btc ratio doesn't bode well with me and I would be losing purchasing power switching over, with no one to transact with at the end. Sure I can sell nano for Fiat when needed but that's a waste of exchange fees and I should've just stayed in Fiat. Also I would've gotten more Fiat if I had stayed in Bitcoin.

Yes, adoption is lacking so far. This however is changing with Kappture implementing Nano (and only Nano) on their point of sale terminals in the UK. When it comes to the Nano/BTC exchange rate that's a bit of a moot point in my opinion, I could also find a ""store of value"" that performed better than Bitcoin over the past period so one could say well, that did better than Bitcoin, so that doesn't bode well for Bitcoin as a store of value. Nano should be judged on its own merits. Either way, even receiving Nano and then converting it to USDC or whatever you want could actually be cheaper for merchants than dealing with the credit card fees. Merchants might also want to keep it in Nano rather than convert due to what you mentioned earlier: while fiat is inflationary, Nano is not. It is a far better store of value than dollars or any fiat currencies are.

&gt; With Bitcoin, a person can understand the need for a safe store of value that won't be debased by a government. Nano can't be debased as well, but you'll be be losing purchasing power compared to Bitcoin that offsets any fees.

This is simply untrue. Bitcoin has more inflation than Nano (as Nano has none) so you would, ceteris paribus, be losing more purchasing power keeping it in Bitcoin than in Nano. That the market has recently been better to Bitcoin than to Nano doesn't change that this is a fact in the long run.

As to spam mitigation: spam is definitely a risk for Nano. However, what dynamic proof of Work does is that becomes prohibitively expensive to do massive amounts of transactions. This won't be a problem for any actual user as (speaking for myself here) you'd be hard pressed to find me doing more than one transaction every few minutes. Your transactions are precomputed, so as a normal user you would barely notice this. If you were trying to do 50 per second, or 500 per second to overload the network, this would be the bottleneck for you though. The PoW needed would go up to the level where its incredibly expensive to keep this up, and normal users can still get their transactions through by simply using slightly more PoW than you can spam. It's a pretty genius way to do it, in my opinion. I'm hoping someone else can explain the technicals in further detail as I might botch that, but what I listed is the basic idea behind it as far as I know. Same for the consensus part as I'm running out of time right now, but Nano is actually further along when it comes to transaction finality than even Bitcoin is.

In short, while some of the points you raise are very valid (a lack of liquidity and adoption, mostly), these are things that are improving over time and recently this has picked up pace with Wirex coming to the US with Nano in Q3, Kappture rolling out their point of sale terminals with Nano in Q3 and Appia Pay coming which is coming soon.

When it comes to a store of value, Nano doesn't have inflation. When it comes to fees, Nano is cheaper even than credit and debit card transactions are for merchants. It's faster, it barely uses any energy which is only going to become more important in the future, and it's a crypto currency network that is ready to be used right now. If people were to lose trust in government fiat right now, nothing would be more suited for transactions than Nano is. 

I'll come back to you later for the last points, I appreciate the very long post but it makes it hard to find the time to reply to it all all at once!",2019-06-29 18:44:21

escfwfg,JalelTounsi,55,"For those who can't view the article:

After bitcoin fizzled and popped early last year, Wall Street seemed to lose interest. Goldman Sachs went quiet on plans to open a desk trading digital assets as the price of the cryptocurrency plummeted, falling as much as 80 per cent. In October last year JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon doubled down on his initial scepticism, saying he did not “give a shit” about bitcoin at a conference.

But now that prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have climbed back up, some senior figures in the financial services industry are thinking again, wondering whether it was the spike or the crash that was the anomaly. Flow Traders, an Amsterdam-based listed trading firm specialising in exchange-traded products, announced in April it was adding cryptocurrencies to its line-up. Last month a group of 50 companies including Jump Trading and DRW — two high-frequency trading houses — and Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank, formed a group to develop a “deep, efficient and secure” market.

“Over the past two years we have seen evidence building that bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class so it makes sense to add it to portfolios,” said Marcus Swanepoel, a former Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered banker now running Luno, a crypto company.

Bitcoin’s trajectory has certainly been eye-catching. Its price has more than doubled in two months, finishing the week around $11,800. This is some way off the highs of late 2017, but enthusiasts say the rally will continue.

Chief among the reasons offered by bulls are Facebook’s recent announcement that it will launch a new digital currency next year — which came a few months after JPMorgan created its own “coin” for payments — and a sharp turn in monetary policy from the US central bank. Along with dovish noises from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, that has helped drive the value of negative-yielding debt around the world to about $12.7tn, according to data tallied by Bloomberg and Barclays. In that context, yield-less gold looks appealing — as does bitcoin.

“There is a lot of demand coming from Asia and Japan where bitcoin represents a wave of hope against a deflationary monetary environment,” said David Mercer, chief executive of LMAX Exchange, a currency-trading platform with about $400m a day in crypto volumes, which started offering cryptocurrencies last year. “It’s become a safe haven of the digital space.”

While demand for crypto remains driven by retail investors, particularly in Asia, institutional practitioners are increasingly getting involved, drawn by fat spreads and increasing volumes. According to Mr Mercer, six of the largest high-frequency traders on LMAX’s fiat-currency platform are active in the crypto market as well.

In public, big banks remain wary, although a head of electronic trading at a large US lender said traders would jump at the opportunity to trade crypto — a market with a total capitalisation of $336bn — if given the chance. Jan Strømme, a veteran of currency markets, set up a crypto-focused trading firm Alphaplate in August. He says young programmers and quantitative traders are shunning careers at banks to work at crypto-focused companies as interest from institutional traders picks up.

Graham Rodford, founder and chief executive of Archax, another crypto platform, started trading bitcoin six years ago as a side project from his day job as head of compliance at Omni Partners, a London-based hedge fund. A former head of operations at HSBC, he is betting that in the future hedge funds will do their fundraising through platforms such as Archax, and will trade all asset classes — including stock and bonds — in digital form.

ese8lgj,Nagosh,41,"So in the past month I've lost more Bitcoin than I would like to lose (obviously I wouldn't like to lose any at all). This run up far outpaced anything that we thought could happen. We all thought there would be more consolidation than this but the market will do what it wants. And even if it continues up at this pace I wouldn't say it is necessarily bad. I mentioned before that it could be that there is just no supply left. Supply is much harder to measure, imo. Well, demand can't really be ""measured"" either but we are almost at 20k and there isn't nearly the since of mania that was there at the end of 20k. Literally everyone was talking about it and trying to get in. Most major exchanges had difficulty with the number of new accounts signing up. In hindsight it is obvious 2017 was a bubble. So the likely scenario here is not that we have a huge increase in demand like in 2017 but a more smaller supply than we might think. It would also explain why none of us understood this run up. No one can measure the amount of supply there is but it is now likely that there are *a lot* more coins in long term bags than we thought. Because of this I no longer want to try to time tops.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead I'm going to now try to get into a long term long. I wanted to do this after we retraced 30% but those have been elusive. Even now we may not get one. Because of this I'm going to start DCA'ing into a long position. I want to be about 5x in about 3 months, and depending on my average entry I may try to get 10x in 6 months. If we drop below 10k I'll probably start tripling my DCA. Obviously I want the CA to be as low as possible and I doubt we get much below 10k. If we do get to, say, 8.4k, I'll stop my DCA and go completely in at that price point as that is where I wanted to long initially. I will also be altering my DCA depending on how high we go. For instance, if we make a new high at 17k and then come back down to 13k, I will be tripling my DCA at 13k like I would have done sub 10k. I will also be increasing my ""all in"" price point at these new highs. All of this is in hopes of getting my CA as low as possible before we make a new ATH.

ese4l24,jcoinner,40,"1. A random number is generated from entropy - often thermal noise in hardware but other methods as well. Lengths vary from 128 to 256 bits but 256 bits is most common (will correspond to 24 words in next step).

2. The random value is broken into 11 bit chunks (in the case of BIP39). Each 11 bit chunk is used as an index to a list of 2048 [standard words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md). Different language versions exist. There is usually a partial chunk left over.

3. A sha256 checksum is calculated for the random value. The first bits of this (length determined by random value length) is added to the last partial data chunk to make a complete 11 bits. That is also looked up in the word list to make the final ""checksum word"".

4. That word list is given to users as backup.

5. That random number is fed into a series of math processes (hash functions) to create a **master private key**. It is deterministic - meaning the same input value always gives back the same key.

6. That master key is passed thru another sequence of math processes to generate a sequence of single private and public keys (again deterministic).


The whole process is standardized as [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standards. These docs give more complete and accurate details of math and example code. Various other BIP standards come into play for variants, derivation paths - things like segwit, bech32 etc.

Years later more titans were announced, and the second biggest thing that distinguished themselves from your typical high end consumer gpu is that they were so expensive that you must be a madman to spend a grand on a gpu.

Thats at least all under my point of view,
