f5yh73i,Regjohn,2,"&gt; So in other words you are saying we may expect the unexpected which, from one perspective may seem a market movement too obvious and therefore expected, but by being so obvious becomes unexpected. Fair point, though if expecting that the obvious is unexpected is too obvious, then bitcoin not doing the obvious would be the non-obvious and so doing the non-obvious would actually be unexpected.

Privacy is a spectrum. You can either be transparent or very private in the way you choose to use Bitcoin. You can either buy Bitcoin without ID and use a wallet you control not linked to your ID for onchain transactions -

Or you buy Bitcoin with ID and tan mix the up afterwards with wasabi or joinmarket

f65k2ln,JustResponding123,2,"My thoughts on this matter:

If you have two systems that essentially do the same, you need to look at why people would want to use one of them and not the other. So let's see how BTC and BSV are different for various use-cases:

1. Money transmission:
   1. BSV - just works. 0-conf is good enough for small purchases and offloaded to merchant/business. User doesn't need to know or care about it.
   2. BTC - blocks are full, so need LN. LN is still in ""beta"" and not clear when it will be ready for mass adoption. Lots of questions with KYC for LN nodes. User needs to open and maintain payment channels, etc. All in all I'd say bad user experience.
2. Data storage:
   1. BSV - you can upload any data you want, as long as you pay transaction fee. Is it really stay accessible indefinitely is still an open question and market still has to provide any viable long term solutions.
   2. BTC - openly hostile against storing data. At best you can run some kind of side chain, but I don't know any active projects that would work on that.
3. Censorship resistance:
   1. BSV - neutral (or could say law friendly). Everything you store on chain, every payment you make is trace-able, even though it might stay pseudonymous. Miners are big companies that will follow the law of their local jurisdiction and probably world wide court orders to either lock some addresses or even confiscate the Bitcoin.
   2. BTC - claim to be censorship resistant and this is the only advantage they have against BSV. I'm not convinced it would withstand the full blown force of multiple countries if they decide that it's used mainly for money laundering. This becomes much more likely if there is a much ""friendlier"" alternative like BSV. If multiple countries would cooperate, they could shut down largest mining pools in BTC, which would cripple the chain. Even if you consider that mining pools mostly consist of ordinary people who could easily switch to other/new mining pools, state still can ban ISIC production/sales to individuals (there are just a few manufacturers), which would again cripple any future expansion of BTC mining. 
4. Current adoption:
   1. BSV - still very fresh, but quickly growing. Having NChain and CoinGeek actively promoting it, helps a lot to spread the word. As a developer myself, I see a very large potential for future use of on-chain data.
   2. BTC - has the best brand at the moment, but I'm highly doubtful they will manage to keep up with competition from BSV. I'm not aware of any big companies (except maybe Blockstreem) that would advertise BTC to the public. I think BTC reached it's adoption and capacity limits for the moment and I don't see any viable path forward for them to expand.

I don't believe majority of the people need the censorship resistance advertised by the BTC. Most of the people will be happy to use BSV as long as it works and fulfills their daily needs. So I think BTC might survive if it manages to proof it's resilience against government, but it will be a niche product rather than mainstream solution. 

I can't say that BSV's openness is all good without it's side-effects. I liked the suzerainty ideas propagated by BTC a lot initially, but I also see a lot of valid points from Craig Write against it (like criminal benefitting from it much more than ordinary people). I am a bit concerned that BSV can become a very powerful instrument of the ""world government"" some time down the road, but I don't believe this is a concern for a near future, and most of the people don't think so far down the line, so this will not prevent them jumping on BSV train if it's useful and ""good enough"" today.",2019-11-02 22:55:37
f65izlk,BitcoinSatellite,2,"Short summary for this report:

- They collected the non-BCH data manually by watching a live ticker of a website ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4mnfas/)).
- They omitted at times 67% of daily non-BCH retail transactions ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dkt3xc/bitcoin_cash_meetups_are_what_bitcoin_meetups/f4kznmd/)) and assumed the data was not verifiable after September ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/)).
- They continue to refuse releasing the raw data they used in the report for verification.
- I got permanently banned from /r/bitcoincash for pointing this out ([source](https://i.redd.it/bidi3lksqvs31.jpg)).

This kind of marketing is exactly why people consider Bitcoin Cash a scam.

Don't trust. Verify.

f68f1uc,nowitsalllgone,49,"Whatsat is a new text messaging app that uses bitcoin's lightning network to exchange messages instead of money. It is possibly the first third-layer application to be built on top of the LNP/BP stack (Lightning Network Protocol on Bitcoin Protocol). The lightning network is a good candidate for exchanging messages because it is already capable of routing bitcoin transaction data in a private, peer to peer way, and bitcoin data is already a form of text message. Whatsat works with the existing lightning network on the bitcoin testnet and leverages the built in capabilities that most up-to-date lightning nodes already support. What it adds is a new data type: instead of transmitting transaction data, it uses other lightning nodes to transmit a custom message to the recipient.

There is not currently any charge for exchanging messages over whatsat, but if usage grows, lightning nodes may begin charging money to route whatsat messages, creating a pay-per-message model. This could increase revenues for lightning node operators and potentially incentivize the development of special purpose mesh networks for privately transferring both money and messages to any lightning user -- separate from the internet and built on the LNP/BP stack. The future is bright! Test the software today.

This was my answer.

""This is infrastructure inversion. You're currently paying a monthly fee for internet access (which IS messaging) and you get bitcoin/lightning on top. In the future, you might just pay lightning nodes on a per-message basis for all data types, including money transfers.""

You might not need to pay a monthly fee for internet access in the future. If the lightning network overtakes the internet as a more efficient/cheaper way to transmit messages, then you'll only need a connection to a lightning node through a mesh network. With that, you'll be able to use that connection for all the things you use the internet for today, but without a monthly fee. You'll just pay a few sats when you want to send someone a message or ping a website for information, and others will pay a few sats if they want to send a message to you.",2019-11-03 06:25:10

f67qphp,pwuille,12,"This is what Bitcoin Core does currently since a few years:

The problem is split up in two; one is the maintenance of the mempool during normal operation. The other is constructing a block from the mempool.

Conflicts are dealt with in the mempool: the mempool is kept consistent with itself and with the tip of the chain at all times (meaning that it is always possible at all times to construct a sequence of blocks that confirms everything in the current mempool). This implies that when a conflicting transaction is received (with another unconfirmed transaction), it will only evict the existing one if (a) that transaction has the BIP125 flag set, and (b) the feerate of the new transaction is higher than the average feerate of all conflicting transactions combined and (c) for DOS protection, the fee of the new transaction is strictly larger than the fee that was evicted (to prevent turning the P2P network into a free relay channel for everyone). If these conditions are not met, the new transaction is simply ignored.

Then, block construction. First, all transactions are sorted by average ""ancestor feerate"". This means that for every transaction, its ""package"" is computed as the set of all mempool transactions directly or indirectly depended on by the transaction being considered. The ancestor feerate of a transaction is the defined as the fee of the whole package divided by the weight of the whole package. Then, the mempool is sorted by descended ancestor feerates. If a child has higher feerate than a parent, it will sort higher than the parent generally. If a child has lower feerate than a parent, the child will generally sort lower. Then the process iteratively picks the highest ancestor feerate transactions from the mempool, removing them (together with all their ancestors) from consideration and adding them to the candidate block. While doing so, the ancestor feerate of all other transactions that share a parent with the included transaction are updated (e.g. if you have A with children B and C, and B is included together with its parent A, C is updated to no longer have A in its package). This continues until the block is close to full; if adding a package would exceed the limit, it is skipped (we don't go back and reconsider earlier ones).",2019-11-03 04:12:28

f69v4de,Mengerian,7,"Sure, I can expand a bit. (I'm Antony Zegers BTW, for those who don't know my handle)

Here's a link to the talk that Amaury mentioned (queued to the spot that's most relevant): [https://youtu.be/NpOQwDwsFvo?t=939](https://youtu.be/NpOQwDwsFvo?t=939)

To summarize, basically it has to do with ""Schelling points"". This is a concept the game theorist Thomas Schelling described in his book ""The Strategy of Conflict"". The idea it that, in a leaderless situations, people need to find points to coordinate around. These coordination points have to be easily identifiable, and give people something to rally around. In the case of the Bitcoin consensus rules, all the miners and network participants have to agree on the rules, with no leader. So whatever rules are used tend to be ""sticky"", because it's something that everyone can see, everyone knows about, and knows that everyone else knows about it.

To change a Schelling point is more difficult than maintaining an existing one. It's easy to understand, the people who wanted small block size can easily coordinate, since that precedent has already been established. They will all be 100% united at the 1MB block size. Everyone who wants to change need to figure out how to coordinate, and this requires establishing a new Schelling point. If this doesn't happen, then the Big Blockers, even if they are in the majority, will be fractured with each faction being smaller than the minority Small Blockers.

The way that this coordination problem can be solved, to enable a move to a new Schelling point, is with a ""Commitment Strategy"". This basically means that someone has to make the first move, and stick their neck out. This was basically the problem with BU's ""Emergent Consensus"" it didn't provide a way for someone to commit to a new block size limit, and time when it would activate.

Similarly, the UASF movement displayed strong commitment (this is what I describe in the talk), and the Segwit2x side didn't display similar commitment. This makes it easy for the Small Blockers to rally together and remain united, while the Big Blockers were fractured. So it was predictable that Segwit2x wouldn't work out.",2019-11-03 11:25:56

f69iq8j,cryptorebel,5,"Well it is a good question.  The answer I would say is that it is up to the market. Maybe businesses won't find it useful to upload certain things to the blockchain, maybe they will. The whole point of BSV is to open up the ledger and let the market decide. On BCH/BTC they want to tell us its spam and tell us not to do it.  BSV wants to allow the market to try things, if they succeed great, if not that is fine too, it was not meant to be.

That being said, I do think there are some good reasons to upload data, and there could be a lot use-cases that become economical, enabled by big blocks and cheap fees on BSV.  I also think that as more people upload data, a network effect is created making the uploaded data become more and more valuable as time goes on, and the network of uploaded data and applications grows.  For people to start to grasp the potential of that, I suggest [they watch the presentation of weatherSV from coingeek seoul](https://old.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/dea3ds/weathersv_presentation_at_coingeek_seoul_6h19min/). You can really start to see how putting data on the ledger can open up a whole new world.  It can change incentives, for example creating a reason for people to contribute data in a more accurate fashion.  Also as the data begins to accumulate on the ledger, you can imagine services and applications being built around this data, utilizing it for some market need.  Tools and interfaces can be developed to utilize the data.  As other types of data are uploaded from other entities, the different genres of data can all start interfacing with each other, adding further value. As it grows the value of it grows and compounds. Soon everyone may prefer to put certain data on-chain to utilize all the amazing services, and the network effect grows. This is the potential.

One subtle thing about uploading data to the chain is that it is a common interface that is also permission-less. Anyone can participate, there is no red tape involved, nobody has to ask to contribute or to build tools or services for the data. They know its going to be there and going to last, unlike an Amazon server. It is freedom. Also, Bitcoin is a public ledger, which should be obvious, but sometimes this fact is evading people's minds.  Hosting on Amazon is a private ledger, you need permission from someone to participate, its run and controlled by a centralized entity. There is a higher chance the data is lost, the data could be corrupted or altered, its not provably time-stamped as it is on Bitcoin. Most importantly it lacks the network effect of a public ledger. If you want to know why data loaded onto the chain is more valuable than something like an Amazon server, you have to focus on the fact that Bitcoin is fundamentally a public ledger and Amazon is not. Imagine Bitcoin being a giant book, where everyone pays small fees to put entries and data in the book. It is also a very big book if you are on BSV.  BCH/BTC are smaller books with less pages, and less space.  Well I think the BitCoin book, the universal public ledger has value.  Anybody can go use it and add to it and build on it, this could create a compounding network effect, and you can't do that with Amazon. So maybe a public ledger costs a little more than Amazon, but it also delivers more value and cannot be done any other way.  A universal, digital public ledger is a new invention for humanity.",2019-11-03 09:53:36

**Hashrate** \- I reviewed growth over multiple periods with similar effect. Of course taking it from 2016 would be most extreme but it is also meaningless. Its like measuring Bitcoin from difficulty of 1, it tells you it is higher. Thus I presented observation from two points where mining was an established business for all coins - start of 2018 bear market and 2019 YTD which was the capitulation phase. These are key periods for miner investment decisions and thus suitable for the purpose shown.

**Volume Profile** \- this is volume on-chain. It is obvious that the BTC price and USD price both play into this however smart money investors are often hedge funds and are accumulating with USD cost basis. External investors provide USD and expect USD return. Miners also operate in USD terms. I have run the same analysis on the BTC chart with the same observation, I choose to present the USD chart for familiarity of readers.

**Miners distributing** **coins**\- miners are likely to be selling as difficulty is compressed meaning they are distressed (else why switch off the machine?). Miners are rational actors and will not operate at a loss. Thus they must sell coins. If their power bill is $100 and DCR price drops, they must sell more DCR to reach the cost (seems obvious right...). Please read Willy Woos article I linked where we have seen the same behaviour throughout Bitcoins history. This acts to put more coins into circulation for non-miners to purchase at a discount. Long term, this increases coin distribution and improves decentralisation (exactly the role PoW is intended to fulfill).

A stochastic process X(t) is statistically self similar with the (Hurst) parameter H, if for any real a&gt;0, the process (a^(H))*X(at) has the same statistical properties as X(t). In other words, the mean, variance, and auto-correlation functions of X(t) satisfy the following properties, respectively:

a. E(X(t))= E(X(at))/(a^(H))
b. Var(X(t)) = Var(X(at))/(a^(2H))
c. r(t,s) = R(at,as) / (a^(2H))

where r(t,s) is the autocorrelation function of the original process X(t).

As an example, consider the Wiener process W(t) which exhibits self-similarity, otherwise known as Brownian scaling. In this particular case, the process V(t), defined as:

V(t) =(1/sqrt(a))*W(at)

is itself a Wiener process.

So what does it mean, you asked? It means that the Bitcoin price series is a self-similar stochastic process (most likely some function of a Brownian motion process), which in the concrete case of your question implies that, regardless of whether you're looking at the 15-minute chart or the daily chart, the Bitcoin price process remains a stochastic self-similar process, and will exhibit the same stochastic characteristics at any and all time frames.

I can answer that. It comes from nowhere. He doesn't get any, for the most part. Nor does any other free open source developer. Original Core dev Jeff Garzik confirmed this explaining donations amounted to little more than 'beer money'.

The thing is there is top rate technical engineering going on with a FOSS project like Bitcoin, but no matching top rate funding. It's a bit of a catch-22. Nobody asks the devs to produce software - they voluntarily do it for differing reasons - ideology, entertainment, education, cool factor etc. However, the product produces immense user value, just like something like Linux. Devs could earn a good living as a traditional employee, but their FOSS actions demand more of their time where they have to choose. They'd rather do the FOSS for all its benefits (including escaping being an employee if there are any residual monetary benefits), and users would rather they continue FOSS contributions, but users are unwilling to pay for something under the heading of 'free'. Go figure. That's why, as I've explained repeatedly, people like myself encouraged devs to form companies and tap into VC funding which is abundant in the U.S. (see money losing companies worth billions in valuation).

&gt;or how much he's received

He received whatever his share of the fundraisers have been for the BCH community, which has largely relied on Roger Ver's pocket I'm sure.

f6ilvgw,quietfryit,1,"A single large player manipulated the price of bitcoin as it ran up to a peak of nearly $20,000 two years ago, a new study concludes.

The study reviewed the period between March 2017 and March 2018, when the price of bitcoin soared and its total market value rose to $326 billion. About half of that increase was due to the influence of a manipulation scheme, according to the study’s authors.

They said the unknown manipulator operated from a single account at Bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. The manipulator used another cryptocurrency, called tether, to boost demand for bitcoin, leading to the price surge.

It isn’t clear by how much or if the manipulator profited. Bitcoin traded at nearly $9,200 on Sunday.

The study—written by John M. Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas with a background in forensics, and Ohio State University finance professor Amin Shams —was accepted for publication by the influential Journal of Finance and will be published online Monday. An earlier version of the study argued tether was being used to manipulate bitcoin prices, but didn’t connect the scheme to one entity.

The paper doesn’t definitively conclude who the manipulator was. But it strongly suggests Bitfinex executives either knew of the scheme or were aiding it.

“If it’s not Bitfinex,” Mr. Griffin said in an interview, “it’s somebody they do business with very frequently.”",2019-11-05 00:17:48

A previous relevant comment:

&gt;I don't think the usability is bad, especially in comparison with a few years ago. Nowadays, there are multiple mobile wallets, multiple desktop wallets, as well as a GUI that is better tailored to the userbase (via the introduction of the simple modes). There is evidently a lot of room for improvement, but to say usability is bad is an exaggeration in my opinion. 

&gt;I feel that people talking about usability often make an unfair comparison to Bitcoin (and clones), who have had more than ten years to optimize UI/UX. By contrast, Monero had to do everything from scratch, because of the different codebase. Monero's inherent privacy features further complicate UI/UX.

f6mqb3l,djpeen,2,"&gt;our analysis has attracted some petty criticisms. In an effort to both protect our merchants and provide an additional measure of confidence, we have elected to have our raw data and analysis reviewed

Haha, I'm sorry if asking you to justify claims is pretty

Let's take a look at how independent the auditor is:

 - http://echtfin.com/
 - ""built with emergent coding""
 - ""built for Bitcoin cash""

So the ""independent"" auditor just happens to be a supporter of BCH, what a coincidence, and they use emergent coding, jeepers I would not be surprised if they were funded with the same cash that painted all those bch cars

It is claimed that the data is ""verified"" by the auditor, let's see how they did that, under the section titled ""assumptions"":

&gt;  ""I have accepted the blockchain addresses provided by Mr Otto for all underwritten and other retail merchants""

Ok, so the data was verified by assuming it's truth, good job


But still the most important claim (""Between them the data confidently covers the vast majority of crypto retail sales in Australia"") is not justified, how are we the reader to know that this is true?",2019-11-06 03:01:04

f6nrgnr,spellp,1,"I'd also like to contribute the best vendor order when you're selling off your loot. For the best buying prices for your hard earned items (because every vendor pays differently) sell in the following order:
1. Therapist (pays the most for instant butt items by a long shot)
2. Skier
3. Mechanic
4. Prapor, if you have anything left. I guess Peacekeeper if you're after USD or levelling him?
Don't even fuck with Fence. I haven't conducted a single transaction with him. His prices are abysmal for both selling and buying. I guess he's useful if you've accumulated mad knives and feel like making hardly any money at all for them?

BONUS TIP: trade any Tetriz you find for a bitcoin with Mechanic and sell said bitcoin to Therapist to milk an additional ~$40k.

As soon as you figure out how to make money this game really opens up. It may behoove any new players to do some research (I try to avoid doing this; the organic discovery of this game is really something I'd recommend experiencing) and develop your own run. Itll probably be on Interchange. A few other random tips off the top of the dome:
-if you go in without armor, expect to die instantly (think about the loot run/hatchet run implications). If you don't, then that's just icing on the cake
-scavs have 20/20 vision (usually 🙄)
-to help mitigate gear fear, think of every single item as a consumable. Guns, armor, even loot that's only good for selling. All one-use consumables. This helped me come to terms with losing everything upon death by managing my own expectations proactively
-armor &gt; guns when you're talking about survivability. Cool RSASS, too bad a single sphotgun pellet fired by fucking Kiril Slabodon to your elbow will instantly waste you if you're not wearing anything 
-the true litmus of a ""successful"" raid is the value of the loot you extracted with/died but kept up your butt vs. The total cost of the gear you brought in. This concept really helped me change how I thought about what I was equipping myself with prior to each raid. The better shit you bring in, the more you have to successfully leave with to stay profitable. Staying in the green is more important than looking rad or having a cool gun.",2019-11-06 08:56:51

f6nr0bw,iwantfreebitcoin,1,"The argument here is kind of silly, regardless of your views on Facebook or Libra. 

&gt; For a system that is designed to be run in a consortia of highly regulated multinational corporates, all running Facebook signed code and access controlled by Facebook it simply makes no sense to deal with malicious actors at the consensus level. 

Of course it does. You don't know what your counterparties will do, or if they were hacked and behave maliciously. Things like Raft and Paxos are only safe when run by a single entity within a LAN.

&gt; Preventing double-spends and forks is simply not an issue that a properly designed payment rails should ever have to deal with *by design*. 

So permissionless cryptocurrencies (other than Algorand) are stupid? I don't think this is what he means to say, but it is what he is saying.

I don't understand what he was trying to say about privacy, but it Libra has a similar level of privacy (at the protocol level) as Bitcoin. That is, it is bad, but technically not non-existent. And HotStuff BFT is pretty much the cutting edge of BFT algorithms. Even if it can't handle worldwide, all transactions throughput, I'm not sure why that is a legitimate critique.

I'm not familiar enough with programming language theory to assess what he has to say on the Move language. 

The critique of the cryptography seems like it is grasping, but indeed, Libra would rely on more exotic primitives than exist in Bitcoin. But that's true of most cryptocurrencies, and all proof of stake ones.

&gt; The final conclusion one must take away after doing technical due diligence on this project is this simply that it would not pass muster in any respected journal on distributed systems research or financial engineering. 

What? HotStuff BFT is peer reviewed and was designed by researchers who have been doing consensus algorithms research for decades.",2019-11-06 08:51:38

&gt; 
&gt;  Cinco curiosidades que se desprenden del escrutinio finalEl escrutinio final de las elecciones del pasado 27 de octubre concluyó en casi todas las provincias con mínimas diferencias entre los resultados obtenidos de manera provisoria y éstos. **Alberto Fernández mantiene una diferencia cercana a los 8 puntos de Mauricio Macri y se encamina a que la Justicia lo proclame ganador.**
&gt; 
&gt; Tal como indica el Código Nacional Electoral, 48 horas después de concluido el comicios los juzgados con competencia electoral de cada distrito inician el escrutinio final, el único con validez legal. La Cámara Nacional Electoral ya dio a conocer los resultados de 22 de las 24 provincias. Restan los de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, donde ya concluyó el recuento, pero aún no se difundieron los datos y el de la **provincia de Buenos Aires.** Los números de esta última suelen demorarse más por concentrar la mayor cantidad de ciudadanos en condición de votar.
&gt; 
&gt; Aunque en su mayoría los datos obtenidos la noche de la elección y las del recuento provisorio muestran mínimas diferencias, se desprenden algunas curiosidades.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Córdoba
&gt; 
&gt; La provincia que selló el triunfo de Mauricio Macri en 2015 se mantuvo fiel al presidente. No fue suficiente para darle un segundo mandato, pero sí para llevarse la distinción de haber sido el lugar donde más diferencia obtuvo en relación al Frente de Todos. La fórmula Alberto Fernández – Cristina Kirchner consiguió 29,31% de los votos contra más del doble de Juntos por el Cambio, 61,31%.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Entre Ríos
&gt; 
&gt; En la provincia mesopotámica la disputa era también por las bancas en el Senado. Los resultados provisorios habían dejado al macrismo, en la categoría presidencial, con una mínima ventaja frente al kirchnerismo: 44,49% vs 44,32%. Finalmente, Juntos por el Cambio obtuvo 44,44% contra el 44,39% del Frente de Todos, la menor diferencia entre ambas fuerzas en todo el país. En la categoría Senadores, se repitió la tendencia y el oficialismo se alzó con las dos bancas de la mayoría, hasta hoy en manos del peronismo.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Santiago del Estero
&gt; 
&gt; La tierra de los Zamora es también la del Frente de Todos. Allí el 74,95% de los votos fueron destinados a la fórmula Alberto Fernández – Cristina Kirchner y se despegó 56 puntos de Mauricio Macri – Miguel Ángel Pichetto (18,37%). Fue la mayor diferencia obtenida por los Fernández en todo el país.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Formosa
&gt; 
&gt; En el norte el Frente de Todos también cosechó buenos números. Aunque no se acercó a las cifras santiagueñas la provincia que desde hace 24 años gobierna Gildo Insfrán le otorgó el 65,21% de los votos emitidos allí. A Macri le correspondieron 28,46%.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Santa Fe
&gt; 
&gt; El tercer distrito con mayor peso electoral, durante años disputado por Cambiemos, el peronismo y el socialismo, se inclinó por la candidatura de Macri. Allí Juntos por el Cambio obtuvo también una leve ventaja, 43,49% de los votos contra el 42,68% del Frente de Todos.

out of circulation DOES NOT MEAN `lost`... it means being held by someone for use at a later point in the future...also the article posits that satoshis original stash is gone forever (100% certain)...no that's not provable... it's very likely sure, but it's not provable.  I'd agree that those coins are likely gone if satoshi is an individual and has passed away if not then those million fall into the Out of circulation category.

Bitcoin that is truly gone is stuff that was burned/sent to an unrecoverable address (things like the 1BitcoinEater address or the MasterCoin Exodus address or the counterparty burn address)...indeed those coin are lost but those are potentially in the thousands, not millions....

BSV has a huge amount of energy, its something you can feel and see with all the apps and projects being built and the scaling achievements.  

Another thing that is more subtle that you need to understand is that BitCoin is a ledger. This is about a public ledger. If nano wants to compete they should have forked the Bitcoin ledger. As I predicted [there would be many ledger based forks](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).

If you were editing user images automatically, what do you think would be more reliable: your own creation or an established Python library like PIL?

If you needed to secure a database would you write your own database system or use something existing like SQL?

In computer science you wont even ever be an expert of 0.00001% of what there is to know, so it's best to work with stuff created by experts instead of wasting your time reinventing the wheel.

f6q3ueh,500239,2,"&gt; Its funny because its still 100% bunk to make any such claim.

Which is why 5 years ago it was never mentioned seriously. How can something be a store of value when it only existed 5 years? It cannot.

The whole ""Store of Value"" narrative was started by Blockstream and Samson Mow's who Keynesian theory where utility comes second to store of value... which of course makes no sense.

The litmus test is, why is Gold considered a store of value but even rarer earth metals are not? It's because Gold has immediate value in terms of being used in jewelry, electronics and dozens of others of applications. It has value by means of applications not because of it's rarity. Without utility there is no value to begin with, let alone one that stores value.

When Bitcoin is completely stripped of value, why would anyone want to hold any? Bitcoin without it's utility, ie frictionless digital cash, has no value, plain and simple. We're witnessing a ponzi scheme from what once was something that had utility.",2019-11-07 04:59:59

I also see your Myspace argument applying to Bitcoin itself. Other than being the first mover and having a brand name, there isn’t much else going for it. It’s not really cheap or fast, and it doesn’t have smart contracts. Imo, Bitcoin’s use case (a store of value) is a small subset of Ethereum’s seemingly unlimited number of use cases.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy  

On the Blockchain, the only information is the address and amount  

The general principle is that the address on the Blockchain is anonymous in itself. The risks to anonymity are exposure of the address off the Blockchain. Someone posts to /r/Bitcoin ""help my transaction is taking too long to confirm"" with the txID, and there's a permanent link on a public forum connecting that transaction's addresses to a Reddit username. ""Please donate"" addresses are worse - public exposure and address reuse together. Exposure and reuse reduce the privacy of all transaction participants, not only the lazy address publisher/reuser  
Otherwise, even if everybody hides their addresses and never reuses, the other party to a transaction knows the details you supplied during the transaction. If you buy socks for Bitcoin, the merchant knows your delivery address. If you buy a VPN service, you can supply a false name and single-use email address and the VPN company knows only your IP address and makes a promise not to store this  

If the address belongs to an exchange, the exchange has already supplied the ID, personal details and Bitcoin addresses of their customer - to the FBI, IRS, and any other authority who asks for it",2019-11-07 16:07:32

I don't even know why anyone would listen to his podcast.

He also admits he doesn't understand investments as his mining business was a loss to him and many other blunders. He's not successful by any metric so what value does he give on his podcast? I sure don't know.

He's Tony Vays 2.0, but at least Tony Vays faked that he understood Bitcoin, whereas Peter openly states understanding Bitcoin is not necessary if you want to discuss Bitcoin technicals.

I mean, who in the world actually **uses** Ethereum Classic or Decred?? - absolutely no one! Don't get me wrong, decred is interesting but it lacks real world use and it lacks purpose. 

We need to change the conversation from market cap to real world usage stats. And we need to take those results to merchants. Here's a real world example.. take a look at [bitrefill.com](https://bitrefill.com) and look at the checkout. Here's the order they appear; Bitcoin, Lightning, litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Dash, Coinbase.  I refuse to believe Dash is the least used of them all! So many merchants, when they list their coins, they put litecoin second or third and I really truly don't believe it reflects reality. They are perpetuating a lie and it needs to stop.

Maybe we can start with Discover Dash, go to all the merchants and ask them for the real world stats for all the coins they accept. Or go to the payment processors and get the stats from them. If I'm wrong then fine, but I don't think I am.",2019-11-08 07:30:54

f6uwent,nullc,4,"You continue to entirely misunderstand the motivation for MuSig.

The purpose of MuSig is to prevent rogue key attacks.

The expectation for thresholds with MuSig would use secret sharing under the hood, sure-- this is so trivial that no space in the MuSig paper is wasted belabouring it, and the part that isn't trivial is making signing time both efficient and byzantine robust for arbitrary thresholds -- and that's currently an unsolved problem (well, there is a presumed solution but it doesn't have a security proof).

By promoting simple secret sharing of keys you're promoting [shamir secret snakeoil](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Shamir_Secret_Snakeoil), and advocating an actually insecure scheme.

I see that you've revised the document since I [last commented on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dt61mg/how_to_do_your_very_own_faketoshi_private_proof/).

The new addition includes:

&gt; When signing, each participant “i” rolls a random nonce “ki” and publishes G*ki, signing their message with the “xi*ki” as the private key. After verifying that G*xi*G*ki is valid, 

They cannot do this.  Participants other than ""i""  know  xiG (signer's public share) and kiG (signer's public nonce for this session).  When you sign with xi*ki,  the participant learns  xi*ki*G from the signature...  Deciding if point Q == xi ki G  given points P = xiG and R = kiG  is called the ""[decisional diffie-hellman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption)"" and is presumed to be computationally intractable in non-pairing groups like secp256k1.

Several people have [really strongly suggested](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-September/016360.html) that you need to actually implement your schemes from top to bottom to be sure that they work at all, and that formal analysis is needed to prove the security of working schemes because it is so easy to get wrong.

It's really harmful to the public that you keep throwing insecure or just non-working stuff over the wall and arguing that people should use it until anyone who might review it just resigns themselves to the fact that you won't listen.

[As an aside, secret redistribution is only secure under a rather strong assumption that participants forget their old shares at re-sharing time. Otherwise, once enough original parties have dropped out to meet the threshold they can simply use their old shares to reconstruct the secret without any participation from the current key holders.  One could, if one wanted to, reshare a key originally delinearized via musig, in any case... but it's unclear to me how useful resharing actually is in practice due to the forgetting assumption. When the secret is the private key for bitcoins there is a straightforward and obviously highly secure way to rotate signers: move the coins.]",2019-11-08 08:45:58

&gt; 
&gt;  Melconian: “A la Argentina no le deberían prestar más para los gastos corrientes porque eso es droga”El economista y ex titular del &lt;a data-id=""166"" data-type=""1""&gt;Banco Nación&lt;/a&gt; **Carlos Melconian** advirtió que entre los vencimientos y los posibles ingresos que se calcula **para 2020 los números no dan,** por lo que la deuda deberá ser renegociada. En ese sentido consideró que debido a los antecedentes de Argentina al repetir una y otra vez la misma su historia, “**le deberían dejar de prestar dinero para gastos corrientes, porque eso es droga**”.
&gt; 
&gt; Según sostuvo Melconian, ""ganara &lt;a data-id=""1""&gt;Mauricio Macri&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a data-id=""5""&gt;Alberto Fernández&lt;/a&gt; , **las cosas que hay que hacer son las mismas**. Yo di una batalla por un conjunto de ideas en las que perdí. Macri fue mal asesorado, **no supe cómo llegar con mis ideas** y se aceptaron las de otro. Siempre doy la derecha (por Alberto) a los que se meten en la función pública desde una línea homogénea de hace muchos años. Me importan tres carajos esa cuestión que dicen de los panqueques, no ando en esa"".
&gt; 
&gt; En ese sentido el economista explicó que “**si miramos cuantitativamente, la deuda es un numero imposible**. No solo coincido con Alberto Fernández, si no que le dije al presidente Mauricio Macri que era la deuda no era honrable en 2020. Hasta abril tenés una suerte de negociación. Después, si Argentina no lo tiene resuelto, entrás en una cosa más formal. Si me sacás de la semántica, Argentina no paga todo lo que vence y ponele el nombre que quieras. **Al default todavía no llegamos**, que es 'me entregué en forma generalizada. No voy a pagar nada"".
&gt; 
&gt; **“Entre los vencimientos y los posibles ingresos que se calcula para 2020 los números no dan,** por lo que la deuda deberá ser negociada”, insistió Melconian esta mañana en diálogo con varios medios. En ese sentido consideró que debido a los antecedentes de Argentina al repetir una y otra vez la misma su historia, “le deberían dejar de prestar dinero para gastos corrientes, porque eso es droga”.
&gt; 
&gt; Según el economista, “**desde el punto de vista profesional y diagnóstico que la Argentina tiene que volver a crecer**. El consumo interno como parte del PBI es muy importante, pero además de su consumo interno, tiene que venderle al mundo, y eso está complicado"".
&gt; 
&gt; “En el menú de alternativas puede estar la **dolarización**, pero los mismos que no quieren pesos tampoco quieren dolarizar. Te quedás casi sin instrumentos y tenés que tener precios relativos acorde, sino estás muerto"", agregó.
&gt; 
&gt; Para Melconian, ""**el 2003 hubiera sido un buen momento para lanzar un programa integral en vez de aprovecharse de la herencia recibida**. En el otro extremo, en el 2015, estaban cero preparados para un programa. Más allá de que cometieron el error de poner en práctica una política económica inadecuada y tomar deuda. En 2019, vamos a tener un buen diagnóstico y después vemos cómo sale la historia, porque cada presidente dejó una situación más complicada que el anterior""
&gt; 
&gt; ""**Pasamos inadecuadamente del cepo heredado en 2015 a una política económica inadecuada**. Ahora estamos en el camino a emprender una tarea puede terminar en libertad cambiaria, que no falta de regulación. El cepo llegó para quedarse y habrá que ver cuál es el programa del nuevo gobierno. **Va a ser muy difícil ir a una baja drástica de la inflación y en el corto plazo no hay riesgo de hiperinflación,** pero no jodas"", concluyó.

Then as the price rose and i thought about investing almost all my savings in it but didn't really have a clue where to get them (because i was underage and my mom laughed about me when i talked to her about bitcoins) and found someone at [ebay-kleinanzeigen.de](https://ebay-kleinanzeigen.de) the german version of craigslist who wanted to sell a some BTC that i wanted to buy but he already sold it to sb then i lost focus on the task and came back when the prices were way higher and thats why im not retired yet! But now my whole family is onto bitcoin, we did made a 'bit' of money but we all could have already retired if s.B. would have taken underage me serious!

f75ihqu,dEBRUYNE_1,5,"&gt;claims that wasabi makes Bitcoin ""fungible""

Fungibility can only be achieved by privacy by default, otherwise an observer can still differentiate between different types of outputs. Put differently, optional privacy does not provide fungibility. 

Besides, Wasabi is scarcely used (and that may even be an euphemism). Transaction count of transactions utilizing CJ (the optional privacy feature available on Bitcoin) *per month* is approximately 1/3rd of Monero's transaction count *per day*. Put differently, Monero does about a hundred times more transactions per month than wallets utilizing privacy features in Bitcoin.

https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1191038010466426881

Additionally, a previous comment of mine where I made a comparison:

&gt;First and foremost, see:

&gt;https://twitter.com/nopara73/status/1147497731147149312

&gt;&gt;Compared to privacy coins Wasabi is just a temporary hack. I think without Confidential Transactions, as the transaction fees grow, privacy will be priced out of Bitcoin's main chain.

&gt;A few more differences:

&gt;- Wasabi has significantly weaker privacy properties than Monero.
&gt;- Wasabi is currently limited to 0.1 BTC outputs.
&gt;- Combining Wasabi outputs is potentially disastrous for your privacy. 
&gt;- A fee is paid to Wasabi for each transaction, which potentially puts the developers at risk. 

&gt;&gt;expensive 

&gt;One also has to bear in mind that Bitcoin transactions are significantly more expensive, i.e., currently a Bitcoin transaction costs around a few dollars, whereas a Monero transaction costs around a few cents.

Lastly, it evidently suffers from the detriments related to optional privacy:

f76qpz7,sindysflowers,4,"The Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Frauds of the Guardia di Finanza of Rome, concluded a sophisticated technical investigation into the world of the Dark Web, identifying the administrators of the well-known Berlusconi Market, an online sales platform for all kinds of illegal goods, under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor of Brescia. The investigation, started last May with the Darknet operation.Drug, had allowed to identify in Barletta (BT) a narcotic substance vendor, known in the Dark Web environment as g00d00, and to arrest him together with another person found in possession of firearms. During the operation, even 2.2 kg of drugs (cocaine, ketamine, MDMA) were seized ready to be marketed on the Internet, 163 ready-made ecstasy tablets and 78 stamps impregnated with LSD. Furthermore, a commercial premises had been seized, located in Barletta (BT), where the Bitcoin exchange activity was exercised, the virtual currency very widespread in the world of illegality connected to illicit trafficking in the Dark Web.

The personal computers, notebooks and smartphones seized during the operation were examined according to the best forensic analysis techniques to trace the administrators of the Black Market called Berlusconi Market, a virtual place of sale of illegal goods with earnings of thousands of euros monthly. As is known, the Dark Web Black Market are computer resources accessible only by using browsers that allow you to surf the net in complete anonymity (TOR browser with domain.onion). The resources of the Dark Web are not indexed by the common search engines and are not registered in the public domain registers as they are aimed at guaranteeing the anonymity of the users who browse there. To achieve this, the connection is made to ""bounce"" between multiple servers, located in different states, called nodes, so as to make it almost impossible to trace its real origin.

Furthermore, the data exchanged is encrypted between one node and another. Access is not free but restricted to accredited users. Thanks to the expertise and intuition of the investigators during the forensic analysis of the devices seized from the arrested subjects, it emerged that the two subjects were also involved in the management of the Dark Web Blak Market called Berlusconi Market. Berlusconi Market presents itself as a real online market in which the numerous vendors (vendors) advertise and offer illegal goods and services for sale. Berlusconi Market was managed by two ""nicknames"" of which one - VladimirPutin - with the role of administrator and the other - EmmanuelMacron - as moderator. Starting in January 2019, Berlusconi Market represented the most important Dark Web market, both in terms of quantity of items for sale and the volume of trade with over 100,000 announcements of illegal products. Berlusconi Market works in the same way as a normal e-commerce site, with the difference that it manages and promotes the sale of illicit products, exploiting the anonymity of the Tor protocol, characteristic of the dark Web. The creation of an account on this portal is set to username and password, in total anonymity. Considering the peculiarity of the merchandise offered for sale, the use of the Market makes the resource in question extremely dangerous, since it is addressed to a vast audience of buyers and sellers, being accessible to subjects from all over the world.


The products on sale are organized in the following categories: - services relating to the so-called ""Bank Drops"", services for which an intermediary offers to make a transaction on a current account indicated by the customer, upon payment of a commission equal to a certain percentage of the transaction made. This service is generally requested when you want to hide the origin of a certain financial availability (even in bitcoins) that will be sent to the intermediary, who will deliver the sum to the final recipient through a traditional bank transfer from a “clean” current account At your service; - announcements relating to national and foreign identity documents, showing the distinctive signs of the respective countries. There are different types of documents offered for sale, material or digital.

In the case of digital identity documents, there is the possibility for customers to purchase so-called templates, that is real editable files on which to enter personal data and photographs as desired by the end users, and then print an unlimited number of false documents. - more than 30,000 sales announcements relating to drugs and drugs divided into: Benzos (psychotropic drugs), Cannabis &amp; Hashish, Dissociatives (dissociative hallucinogens), Ecstasy (MDMA or ecstasy), Opioids (opioids), Prescription (medicines subject to medical prescription) , Steroids (steroids), Stimulants (stimulants), Psychedelics (pischedelic substances), Pharaphernalia (instruments for alteration and products for the treatment of drugs), Other (substances and non-categorized drugs), in addition to cocaine and heroin ; - 600 announcements concerning the sale of gold, silver and other jewelery products, probably of illicit origin or counterfeit; - more than 5,000 announcements relating to the sale of weapons, explosives and ammunition, including Kalashnikov-type weapons of war; - software including different categories of malicious applications (computer viruses), including: Botnet, Malware and Exploits; - Security &amp; Hosting, where remote control utilities and VPNs can be found to conceal your IP address, all tools aimed at increasing security measures in terms of online anonymity, in order, generally, to disguise your virtual identity for the fulfillment of unlawful purposes or bypass government blocks.

As part of the forensic analysis, conversations exchanged through instant messaging applications with a third party emerged, which managed to exercise a sort of control over the proceeds linked to the Berlusconi Market sales platform as administrator of the market itself. The ability of the investigators has therefore allowed to identify the third subject, equally resident in Puglia. From the complex of technical investigations carried out, it emerged that the three subjects established a criminal association for the administration of the Berlusconi Market platform, since: - they incurred the expenses related to its operation; - have made management decisions; - they were in possession of administrator credentials; - they divided among them the illicit proceeds accrued for about 41 bitcoins, equal to about 400,000.00 euros against a total volume of annual transactions equal to about 2 million euros. In essence, they set up the IT infrastructure in order to manage the Black Market, which was aimed at users from all over Europe and the world (USA, Canada, Australia), and therefore consumed an indeterminate series of crimes in competition with third party vendors , such as the sale of war weapons, of narcotic substances for large quantities and of counterfeit currency, the receiving of stolen goods through the sale of counterfeit credit cards, counterfeit identity documents, credit card codes and credentials or home banking taken away through unauthorized access to IT systems, all crimes compounded by the transnationality of the conduct.


The conduct of the Black Market administrators therefore made it significantly easier for offenders to compete with vendors by granting a web space (showcase) on their virtual store (store), together with payment management (in cryptocurrencies) , in order to make a profit for this illegal activity. The elements gathered thanks to the meticulous investigative activities carried out by the specialized staff of the Privacy Protection and Technological Fraud Unit of the Guardia di Finanza, with the constant coordination of the Public Prosecutor of Brescia, led to the issuance of personal precautionary measures for custody in prison at with three subjects (GDM and GR, residing in Puglia and LDV residing in Puglia and domiciled in Turin). Officials and judicial police officers belonging to the aforementioned Special Unit carried out the measures ordered, also carrying out 5 house searches in Barletta (BT), Andria (BT), Putignano (BA) and Turin. During the searches several technological devices were seized (personal computers, notebooks, digital memories and smartphones) on which the forensic analysis will be subsequently carried out, also to trace the various Black Market vendors.

A precision sling and numerous packages of alleged drugs and illicit drugs, which will be subjected to technical analysis, have also been seized. Since the execution of the precautionary measures, Berlusconi Market has stopped operations. After the operations of the US FBI and the Dutch police against the Black Market ""Silk Road"", ""Alfa Bay"" and ""Hansa Market"", Berlusconi Market is the fourth example in the world of Black Market of the Dark Web rendered inoperative.",2019-11-11 09:48:26

There might be some misconceptions that you need to get rid of on the bible story, but after that it's pretty easy to know what the argument is without putting a lot of study time into economics. 

For example, if someone asks you about taxes, then you can just point out how Jesus said that the government owns the money, so give the government back all it's money and use something else (e.g. gold, bitcoin).

f79ea5a,SquantoPaco,1,"**Coinbase vs Coinbase Pro vs Cash App**
 
All these companies are insured and very easy to setup and verify with great UX. Due to its simplicity Cash App is a little easier to use out of the 3. All these methods require AML/KYC verification, cash app delays this until you withdraw the BTC.
***
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)
 
**Pros --** Easier to Use than Coinbase Pro. Allows you to **lock in** a price (but have to wait \~1 week) for BTC to be released which is helpful during a bull market
 
**Cons --** Coinbase has upset some of the Bitcoin community for supporting [scams and insider trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l1KwAZKGts), \~1 week delay on withdrawing Bitcoin, more complex to use than cash app, highest fees with **1.49 % bank transfer** and **3.99% debit card fees**, overcharges on withdrawal fees or onchain transactions
***
[Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com)
 
**Pros --** Lowest fees of the 3 at **0.5%**, but there is a week delay(\~2 days SEPA in EU) before the funds are deposited preventing you from buying. Free ACH deposit and withdrawal, no fees to withdraw bitcoin
 
**Cons --** most complex to use of all 3
***
[Square Cash App](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin)
 
**Pros --** Easiest to use of the 3, Best alignment with Bitcoin politically, Allows you to lock in the price immediately and withdraw quickly(once verified), No fees to buy Bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin
 
**Cons --** Only available in USA, despite having no fees their spread is slightly wider thus making them slightly more expensive that coinbase pro typically
***
Cash App charges no fee but on average has a larger spread of **\~1.6%** compared to Coinbase Pro. Thus you will pay **~1.1%** more than Coinbase Pro. At Coinbase Pro you pay a 0.5% fee and can deposit via [ACH](https://ryzecrypto.com/resource/how-to-fund-your-coinbase-pro-account_5d9b45487feda85616e7c386) but, the deposit typically takes between 2-5 business days to be credited on your account.
 
Thus, if you want to wait a week you can save a dollar, but also likely buy BTC at a more expensive amount in a bull market.
***
**TL;DR**
*
You should never use regular Coinbase due to the fees.
 
Use [Cash App](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/1016-bitcoin) if you need to instantly lock in the price, for everything else use [Coinbase Pro](https://ryzecrypto.com/resource/how-to-set-up-a-coinbase-account_5d9b5b2b7feda85616e7c396).
 
**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange. You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys. After buying your bitcoin withdraw them to a [secure offline wallet or a cold storage custody solution](https://ryzecrypto.com/resource/crypto-wallets-and-storage_5db84c657feda85616e7c3b3).**",2019-11-12 06:05:02
f79ex5g,500239,1,"&gt; Not sure you know: We actually, really, honestly had that already once. Lookup Monero Classic. ASIC manufacturers keept an ""old"" chain alive. People then voted. They mostly did not like the chain of those ASIC people, they liked the chain that the Monero devs built and forked forward.

Oh wow didn't know about that.

- How did people vote, or establish which chain was ""Classic"" and which chain remained monero? Do miners, user or devs decide that in Monero?

&gt; Never mind your report that BCH suffered from forkings, by the way, IMHO. BCH itself forked off BTC. Now we should ask: What damage did all those many Bitcoin forks to BTC itself?

Bitcoin did damage to itself when Bitcoin Core devs blocked any reasonable attempts at scaling. Even the Lightning whitepaper requires at least 133MB+ blocks for global adoption and Core blocked a reasonable 2MB. I mean how has SegWit helped Bitcoin's congestion is a question you can ask yourself, when people are still waiting hours in the mempool.

&gt;  Well, still only like mice fighting each other between the feets of an elefant, those forks, if you ask me.

Afaik only BCH has shown it can scale. Monero has not. And BTC and Eth are clogged with no reasonable proposals, so it would seem we're the ones leading in this area and the mice are following us.

This, among other arguments have been said for as long as every single new crypto that comes out against bitcoin.
( https://99bitcoins.com/ )

So ive heard it all before.
All markets..ALL of them are and have been manipulated..even traditional ones so thats never every really going to be any rebuttal or exude/reasoning in the least. I wish people would stop using that as one. 

Bitcoin is not like NEO or any other crypto as NEO skyrocketed to an (xrp never before seen) 190 bucks and NEO GAS was..but even I know that BTC will still be on top so i traded near the top for more BTC and it was a very wise move. 

There are no ""XRP"" futures, or ""XRP"" Baakt....or XRP Retirements out there at all.

BTW, with your example, it looks like you grossly oversimplified it.
I could do the same too...BTC has 21 million in existence..its actually more like 18/17 mill because of how many were lost over the yearsand ripple has 99,991,298,961.

Basic math..supply and demand. One is older, has been around and incredibly more rare than the abundant xrp. 

I mean..if were going to oversimplify things....

And no, its not just about the price, but its worth a shit ton more than ripple. Period. Also look at how long ripple has been out vs BTC vs ETH and its STILL sub 1 buck...peaking at a little over 3 bucks?


Ripple is the ""pennies"" of the crypto space.

f79l0gx,5tu,1,"So all mining is doing is taking a set of transactions people have/are doing, plus a single funding transaction of 12.5 btc to your own address, plus the hash of the previous most recent block you are building on, plus a random number called a nonce.

It takes that chunk of data and hashes it via a simple process.  SHA256 hash twice.

If the produced value is higher than the current threshold, you increase the nonce (and optionally add new transactions you hear on the network).

Eventually when you find a combination of all that data that produces a hash value less than the threshold set by the bitcoin network your block is considered valid and will propagate around the bitcoin network as a shared truth and miners start working on the next block.

So by using more machines, you're basically just trying more random nonce values on the same block of data.

&amp;#x200B;

A home computer can probably do a few thousand hashes per second.  A GPU can do a few hundred thousand/million.

A dedicated bitcoin mining chip i.e. an ASIC (what is typically used these days) will do around 1,000,000,000,000 hashes per second.  Or put another way 1 ASIC chip is equivalent to 1,000,000  computers with fast GPUs.

Basically mining without an ASIC is not viable.   That said, it only takes one lucky hash and you've printed 12.5BTC and in theory a C64 could produce the winning hash, it's just rather incredibly unlikely given the network is currently running at around 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or put another way, the bitcoin network is using 100,000,000,000,000 high end GPU computers, so if you add say 25 high end computers to the mix, it will take on average

(( 365 days \* 6 blocks per hour \* 24 hours) / 100,000,000,000,000 ) / 25 =  \~once every \~114,155,251 years.",2019-11-12 06:52:07

f7cfpo3,straightOuttaCrypto,1,"First let me say I believe in BTC, not BCH/BSV/ETH.

&gt; I think you REALLY need to understand this key principle.

So a key principle is that nobody controls bitcoin and segwit got added ""without anyone controlling bitcoin"", but that segwit2x didn't get added because ""nobody is controlling bitcoin"".

How's that not double-standard?

To get enough to vote for segwit, segwit2x was promised, then as soon as segwit was locked in bigger blocks (clearly panned in the original codebase by Satoshi) disappeared.

&gt; Who are the 'many' you are talking about?

Early adopters, individuals like me who have both read the whitepaper and looked at the original sourcecode and who have ran or are running full nodes and who know 2x bigger blocks wouldn't have created any problem whatsoever.",2019-11-13 05:41:09

This kind of piece can only be made in an economy like ours where spending aimlessly is a possibility since acting today is preventing tomorrow's inflation. You however, by knowing this, should be putting your digital gold to good use instead of making collages, you should be growing crops and buying land. Becoming sustainable. Do this kind of thing with material that hasn't been processed by other than your hands. And even so you will be to blame by wasting that time. Bitcoin does a good job at ending consumerism and mass production. We've gotten the point so move on. Do something productive with your life.

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

f7d21jq,blue_pill_90210,1,"Sure they do. 256 AES, RSA 4096 (or a safe ECC variant)  and SHA512 are common for OpenVPN these days - a fully open source and long standing VPN protocol. Tor is using 128 AES. Tor relay's signing-only identity key is RSA 1024. Onion Keys are are more secure ECC which helps with speed over a large RSA key (I myself use the Bitcoin ECC for keys on OpenVPN with 256 AES/SHA 512).  For hash Tor has upgraded to SHA-2 last I checked, but my OpenVPN is running SHA-3 512.  Tor also uses  OpenSSL behind the scenes with open source SSL and TLS, and it has some noted vulnerabilities, but nothing that should affect its primary encryption.

For all practical purposes, both are secure from a NSA cryptographic attack if properly configured. The attack vector on a solid VPN or Tor won't be the encryption itself. It will be correlation and exit nodes with Tor or correlation and VPN servers with a VPN. Tor has sought to address the exit node issue and I'm sure others know better than me how that was addressed on this sub. If a VPN does not log activity, nothing can be had from a compromised VPN server running proper OpenVPN encryption as it can't be cracked. There are malicious code attacks against OpenVPN, but the code is so well written they get quashed pretty quickly. Such attacks hope for OpenVPN not being properly configured by a VPN user who set-up their own private OpenVPN tunnel or on a commercial VPN.

So yes, solid VPNs are running stronger encryption, but both are fine and won't be attack vectors by even the NSA. Again, Tor's true strength is its non-unique/all the same browser. This is where Tor is much stronger than a VPN running even hardened Firefox in regards to anonymity - and especially from state actor compromised websites, though a bunch of Tor users did get unmasked on the Tor browser when the FBI took over the Playpen onion site, but that was patched.",2019-11-13 09:39:49

f7d5abf,cointastical,1,"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you are in New Zealand.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  &lt;-- Filter box for currency (e.g., NZD) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CoinCorner [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], CEX.io, Coinify, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreland, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the New Zealand there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  &lt;-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  &lt;-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://medium.com/@cointastical/p2p-otc-exchanges-e-g-localbitcoins-bisq-hodlhodl-etc-20f293a2c72e)
- https://exchangerates.pro  &lt;-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).


You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

f7eljwm,Smelltastic,1,"How to use bitcoin:

1) Become an information security expert.

2) Have all your bitcoins stolen anyway because hahahahahaha you thought you were an information security expert.",2019-11-14 00:53:33
f7elgel,Hypnosaurophobia,1,"&gt; After all, you presumably go to work every day on roads maintained by the state, pay taxes, use currency minted by the state, etc.

I use the roads, but not to go to work every day.

I don't pay taxes.

I use currency minted by the state very occasionally. I use electronic currency created by the state pretty regularly, and also bitcoin, because fuck states and state currencies.

I participate in the system far less than most Americans.

&gt;Mechanisms within that system exist that can change that system, you just need to motivate enough people (and yourself) to get involved.

Yes, that mechanism is spending wealth. Our system is utterly corrupt. I vote, and have gotten involved in political campaigns for candidates and causes I deem important: like healthcare and getting money out of politics, but so far, no results, despite the slim majority of Americans having wanted universal, single-payor healthcare for a few years, and the vast majority of Americans having wanted money out of politics since forever.

&gt;making improvements in your community

I have considered mobilizing hoardes of local homeless people to vote for Yang, but not sure how I'd pull it off. Most efficient would be trading cash for votes.

&gt;They aren't wrong, they just have different priorities and life experiences than you do.

This is absolutely false. The people on the other sides are wrong. Living in a city, and storing a loaded gun by your bed is wrong. Living in the country, and storing an unloaded gun in a safe is right. Owning a gun for self-defense, as multiple grandparents, partner's parents, and multiple friends do, is wrong. Guns are not useful for self-defense, and probably make the owner and their loved ones less safe. Owning guns for sport and hunting is totally fine. I've lived in rural and urban areas. Guns are less of a problem in rural areas, where they're primarily used for hunting. But, they are still problematic. School shootings and self-shooting suicides in school and at home in the back yard happened in my small-town life growing up. Children should not have access to guns when they aren't hunting / sport-shooting with adults. People in cities should almost never have or use guns, except maybe to go to the firing range for practice. Most people don't believe this, and they are wrong. ""City liberals"" are wrong to think that all guns are dangerous, and ""rural conservatives"" are wrong to think they have any reason to bring a gun into the city, and conservatives from all densities are wrong to think that a gun is a useful tool for ""personal defense"". It isn't.",2019-11-14 00:52:28

I've had other jobs that did direct deposit. But even then, I'd have to wait at least one business day before my money was really my money. Then when I'd try to withdraw it, they'd give me a hard time about large withdrawals. They'd give me a hard time about large deposits too.

But I do agree with the general McAfee statement. The minting company isn't the ones going after crimes done with fiat currency. The police and other specialist agencies are. It would be somewhat ludicrous to hold Bitcoin accountable for it being used to buy guns.

f7hrojy,DangZagnut,1,"So they're selling themselves for huge swaths of money.  Anyone here ever get paid $15k for their dick?

Let's play math games.

So let's look at the financial picture:

&gt;  The average wage in Zimbabwe is $3036—and that's for the 30 percent of the population who are employed.
 
Compared to the US:

&gt; The average wage is $31,786 -- unemployment is 3.6%.

So the equivalent for that high end pooping dollar to an American would be: $157,045 for what, a week long pooping session, or maybe one evening per poop?

I shit on myself every morning for free, and have to go through a forests worth of toilet paper to deal with it.

I will under cut that; I'm a whore.  I will happily let someone shit on me while burning the American flag for $100,000 a pop.  Or poop in this case.

Prostitution is when you are going blow jobs for $5 because of your meth addiction.

Having your expenses catered to and flying first class to some country for a guy to shit on you for $157,045, that's not prostitution at that point, no one is ""forcing"" you do to...well....shit.  You take a shower and bring home a briefcase of cash or bitcoin wallet key or whatever you wanna go with, also first class.  All because you didn't get fat and have a pretty face.

So everyday starfish sex with some poop thrown in.  What a challenge.  Hell even once gives you the equivalent of 5 years of the average wage.  Sounds like a few trips and you're on your way to retirement in your teens.  You can buy citizenship in the EU or South America *very* easily.  So there you go, a couple weeks of people shitting on you, untaxed, and you can go be a citizen of some other country and sit on your ass all day.

One shit gets you a passport in St. Lucia and flying there first class.  They only charge $109k for a passport.  And that's considered expensive, you can do it cheaper other places or even free.

So I wouldn't say they're not being compensated for their time, they're just engaging in performance art.",2019-11-15 00:44:25

Many know nothing about the current developments and potential for eip 1559 to burn transactions etc. I think once eth 2.0 starts delivering you are going to see people flood in. I say that just from crypto people I’ve talked to explained some of these things, they do the research on what I’ve told them and they come to the same conclusions. Time will tell but I don’t think icos are needed at all. Pos / defi and maybe a couple of projects that use lots of transactions are all it will take.

f7lzz55,palmino,1,"I give my 2 cents but to say it clearly: I'm a Bitcoin maximalist so you won't get objective answers from me.

1. There was that hard fork in 2017 over the (ever lasting) scaling debate. A part of the community forked because they were not satisfied by the outcome of that debate. That is: Segwit over Segwit2x. Bitcoin is about consensus rules. In my opinion by far the largest amount of people chose to follow the Segwit way.
2. The BCH community consisted of several people that I am very skeptical about. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright are just two of them even if they forked again with BSV. 
3. Compare the ""hate"" here against the ""hate"" in /r/btc . Over the last two years that other sub was a shitshow orders of magnitudes larger than in this sub. People in /r/bitcoin tend to hate agains BCH from time to time but It's not that obvious as over at the other sub.
4. The BCH community brags about a lot of things. 18months here, segwit there, scalability, nodes, walla walla walla. And still they couldn't achieve what they are up to: the flippening. 
5. The BCH community is saying ""BCH is Bitcoin"" which I think is obviously false since the community, the consensus and the protocol decides what is bitcoin. Bitcoin is BTC, Bitcoin Cash is BCH. That's it. BCH is a fork and is not Bitcoin.
6. They are using /r/btc which is the Ticker symbol of BTC. Why?

And countless other things. They have a more centralized development and the community follows their leaders blindly therefore they could advance the protocol faster than BTC. I understand that BCH might have a nice interface in the [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) wallet or they have 0conf and schnorr but hey... Bitcoin is improving too and there is a lot of development going on and there is a ton of discussion on other media than reddit.",2019-11-16 05:57:37
f7m08nx,cryptacritic17,1,"&gt;""We can see that in all possible instances, any proof of work system, **it is incentivised towards corporate 
consolidation**. The frequently promoted idea of many individuals voting through individualised wallets 
within bitcoin does not stand scrutiny. Proof of work systems derived from continuous and updated 
investment. It is not past investment or current holdings that matter, it is the amount that a party is 
willing to spend at the time the vote is occurring. In this way, we see that the introduction of a low-cost 
voting mechanism such as that proposed in a UASF acts to lower the overall security of the network 
and allows for the introduction of Sybil attacks. In a proof of work system, it is the party's willingness 
to continue investing that provides their ability to vote for the system. To mine blocks, it is not just the 
prior investment, but rather, the overall investment at a point in time. When a proposal for change 
 
12 https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2626

occurs, it is a requirement of the system that energy is expended in the solution of a block that both 
secures a network and allows the individual miner to choose. 
The rational decision for any mining firm is to choose the most profitable strategy. The impact of 
transactional costs naturally leads to the growth of consolidated entities. Any time where there is a 
differential of any type between two individuals, it starts to become profitable for everyone to specialise. 
Even in the event where one individual is more skilled with regards to all areas than any other party, 
they will still find that they have differentials between their own skill sets. The marginal differences 
between their own skills always lead to a scenario where it is more profitable for that individual to 
concentrate on their specialties allowing others to increase the overall profitability of the firm. In the 
worst-case scenario, even where the introduction of additional people and the merger of mining entities 
leads to no more hash rate being obtained, it does lead to the reduction of time. The same amount of 
money earnt in a lower amount of time is an increased level of profit. Both parties can choose to either 
work on other tasks, engage in more leisure, or find other profit producing activities. 
**Consequently, all proof of work systems always consolidates into corporate entities**. This is the nature 
of the system. **It was not and cannot be designed for individualised control**.""

I skimmed the paper and then read the conclusion. There wasn't really anything in there that I didn't already understand on a basic level.

So, where to begin.

First of all, I like you u/cryptorebel. You've been a good friend to me. So please don't tarnish that by calling me names. Just want to start us off right.

I don't believe in a blocksize limit at all. I don't support BCH or BTC. I'll get into what I support in a minute.

In discussing theoretical distributed consensus algorithms, there's only two good ways to have a discussion on merits. 1) Empirical Evidence, and 2) Comparing a model to another model with fundamental concepts. None of us can dissect the deep cryptography and mathematics of the system effortlessly while retaining attention in a conversation so that's not really an option.

I'll start with Empirical Evidence, because I don't want to start our conversation shilling the coin I like, because I don't want to be off-putting. But after I cover that, I will compare and contrast the merits of Bitcoin to the coin and system I like.

First of all, if you look at the mining distribution of any version of Bitcoin, the distribution isn't that good. On BSV you have a miner with 30% hash and another with 17.5% hash. On BCH you have some unknown entity mining around 51%. And on BTC, it's a little more flat, but, the average distribution is like 15%. Sources: https://coin.dance/

What does this say to me? Every Bitcoin network is about four or five Court Orders away or less from a government-sponsored 51% attack. I mean, that's not necessarily a deal breaker, but I think it's a cause for concern and a reason to research alternatives.

Now what alternative do I propose? As you probably already know, I've become a part of the Nano camp. 

Nano is, in short, a delegated proof of stake driven block-lattice model that uses proof of work to prevent transactional spam. There is neither fees nor inflation in nano, so there is no intrinsic incentive to run a node.

However, there are 91 principal representative nodes of nano (not counting the hundreds of other nodes) with 15% of all potential voting power active and 99.5% of all active voting power being directed at the principal reps.  91 court orders or even 30-60 court orders is a lot more convincing as corruption-resistant than just 4 or 5.

Without intrinsic incentive, what is the incentive to run these nodes? Why are people doing it?

1) People with large sums of nano need to assess whether or not their actions are needed to protect their investment

2) Advertising to the nano network

3) Having a trusted access point to build your business on so users don't experience interruptions out of your control

Basically similar reasons for why you'd run a full node on Bitcoin. Except running a node on nano currently costs &lt;$50/month if you're trying to be a principal representative, and substantially less if you're not. And last I checked, there's about 15-20k tx on nano in a day, with the capability of that being at least 10x-100x higher.

Also, I was reading a paper yesterday about Bitcoin vs Nano in terms of scalability. Basically Bitcoin suffers in trying to scale with both latency and throughput and therefore requires constantly improving hardware. But nano only suffers from latency, not throughput, and adding more nodes to the system didn't slow it down, only adding more transactions slowed it down. So I see huge opportunity for the number of nodes in the system to massively increase.

So what am I getting at here? Why pay to use a system that centralizes into four or five ""corporate entities"" (as described by your paper) when I can use a money system that's free, instant, far more decentralized, fundamentally more scalable on the software side of things, with a solid security model that works today?

f7m416w,BigBlockIfTrue,1,"I understand why you make this plea. But I also think your position is dangerous. Let me explain.

It is important to note that peer-to-peer cash for everyone does not necessitate involving everyone in development decisions. Involving everyone in such decisions, no matter competent or incompetent, regardless of their stake, is actually a realistic possible cause of mission failure. People who disagree with decisions are still free to use the currency we develop. But everyone having individual freedom does not mean everyone is equal.

If Bitcoin Cash wants to have effective development, then we have to accept that not everyone is able to make a net positive contribution, and that we have to exclude people who are making a net negative contribution, until their performance improves.

For example, if you would have posted your message one year ago, with nChain instead of BU, how would you look back on it now?

To end on a positive note, I think the conflict can be resolved, but only if BU members take the initiative to do so. In my opinion, the solution would be for BU members to firmly commit BU to BCH (not just development activity, also fund holdings), proclaim support for periodic protocol updates with timely releases (something they never did), recognise the need for a shared roadmap (something they never did), and commit to shared governance with the FVNI node implementations (something they never really did). In exchange, BU can then negotiate a more favourable shape of this shared governance process with FVNI, for example to improve alignment with BU's internal organisation governance.",2019-11-16 06:42:53

My name is Jessica, and I'm your genuine, down to earth, girl next door. You’ll soon find that beneath my sweet, natural appearance lies a kinky side and a ravenous sexual appetite. I’m also a huge geek, so I can hold a conversation about legend of korra or Hamilton while getting you off ;)
*****

Joi, cbt, CEI, domme, subs, femdomme, mommy domme, foot, and findomme, I enjoy it all. I love telling you how to stroke your throbbing cock until you’re close to the ecstasy of cumming, and commanding you to stop until I say so. Laughing as you torture your cock to please your domme, and lick up that cum for me when you’re done. And if you like findomme, you know you're going to have to pay that cum tax and more. Do you want to dress up like my slutty princess and make you touch your sissy clitty for me? I can do that. I'll make you cum on that skimpy dress I picked out.

*I cater to the whims of the pathetic and take my clothes off to make an impression. Stop boring me and think. It's the new sexy.*

❥ I’m an asshole. You won’t like me. INTJ. My body is 90% weed. I never make any content that doesn’t make me cum or laugh. My domination style is tailored to your limits.

Optionally I can provide an overall appearance rating, sometimes accompanied by pop culture comparisons, usually not in your favor.

f7tansl,Capt_Roger_Murdock,1,"""The only way to preserve BTC's 'censorship-resistance' is massive censorship of any and all attempted transactions beyond the paltry few 100k allowed daily by the current limit, thereby forcing most users onto inherently LESS secure and MORE easily-censored 'second layers.'""

The goal is to create the best money the world has ever seen. The purpose of money is to reduce transactional friction. The best money is thus the one that does this most effectively, including: (1) reducing the friction associated with *finding* a transacting partner (by having a huge network effect -- being widely held and accepted); (2) reducing the friction associated with *making* an individual transaction (by being fast, cheap, and reliable to transact); and (3) reducing the friction associated with *holding* money between transactions (by having a predictable, finite supply). 

And the issue isn't just that BTC's fees are ""high."" It's that its fees become *progressively higher* as the number of people attempting to use the network increases. Forget BTC being impractical as a way to pay for individual cups of coffee. With its current crippled capacity (allowing for only about half a million tx per day), if it ever did see anything approaching adoption on a global scale (billions of users), it would quickly become impractical as a way to pay for anything less expensive than a *coffee shop*.  In other words, Bitcoin BTC is currently in a position where as it becomes a better money along one essential dimension (thanks to increased adoption and network effect), it simultaneously becomes a worse money along another essential dimension (as growing congestion causes transacting to be increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable). An arbitrary and increasingly inadequate constraint on transactional capacity is a collar around Bitcoin's neck that turns into a noose as the network (attempts to) grow.

And no, the Lightning Network, [which is really a semi-custodial banking system](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/beypf7/interview_with_peter_rizuns_critiquing_the/elcm0ix/), does not solve the problems created by crippling Bitcoin's capacity.",2019-11-17 23:57:41

f7pjftj,RetardIdiotTrader,1,Try telling that to the maximalists on here. I'm not buying an since digit of Bitcoin until the alts ratios are going nuts.,2019-11-17 09:22:49
f7pnarq,cointastical,1,"&gt; So, let's say you want to choose the easiest, fastest, most straight forward way (as in, put int he card numbers and your wallet address, click next, and be given your $50 worth of bitcoin in seconds), which service would you use? 

I wouldn't.  Being that it is so risky for the seller to accept a prepaid gift card, they much charge a high fee to make up for the occasional losses.   I dont' are to pay 30% more for bitcoin than the spot price, so I use other methods, (e.g., using cash for an in-person, cash trade).

I understand that for some paying a $15 fee on a $50 buy is simply not a big deal, due to it being convenient (i.e., can be done completely online in a matter of minutes).

Choose the sellers with many trades and a no (or almost no) negative marks.

Paxful will have the most sellers that accept a prepaid gift card.

Some buyers prefer to place an ad themselves, ...e.g., on No-KYC exchanges like  HodlHodl or LocalCoinSwap, in which a lower price is being offered.  If you can be patient, placing an ad with your offer can provide the best mix of price and convenience when buying bitcoin with a prepaid gift card.  HodlHodl only has e-mail notification (for now, but they are working on an additional notification method), so LocalCoinSwap with its Telegram notifications is probably the right P2P exchange for this type of trade where you are placing the offer to buy.",2019-11-17 09:49:06

f7wwwzd,EngineeringKid,7,"(EDITED for schpelling and typose)

I've done it.

No secret really.

Just like all the realistic books say. Save, invest, be smart and strategic.

To answer your question (perhaps reword this):

&gt;I hope to derive lessons and key variables that can inspire and assist in my portfolio management.

1. Key variables. Hard Work AND Smart Work.  There's a lot of **HARD** workers at McDonalds and construction jobs.....and a lot of **SMART**    Workers who work for me as engineers / technologists /comptrollers / accountants at my job. You need to be both.
2. I didn't get rich from my 9-5 job. Neither did my spouse. But we both have very good paying jobs and over a dozen post graduate certifications/designations/qualifications between us. That gave us a very soft security blanket in life. With our incomes we could afford to go take some BIG but CALCULATED risks and bet on ourselves.  We were BOLD, and it  has paid off.... but not stupid (like weed stocks or bitcoin or mary kay crap).
3. Before the Real Estate ""boom"" I was a fan of making money in real estate (having flipped houses DURING university in the summer...when houses were cheaper.) My wife had a similar mindset and had also been a landlord AND bought 2 pre-construction condos on spec and sold for at close profit. We weren't realtors (not a REAL job IMO) but we knew real estate AND home renovation/construction AND dealing with people (negotiation, marketing, advertising, expectation management and professional communication).

So, Aspect 1, 2, and 3. We bought some crappy properties; like uninhabitable, sold for land value only...full of needles and dead cats, owned by hoarders or slum lords who rented to guys in a band. The kind of places no family would ever live in.

&amp;#x200B;

While others in my demographic were playing golf, tennis, cycling or netflix-ing, I spent my evenings and weekends filling dumpsters with asbestos laden plaster board, pulling out aluminum wiring, cutting trenches in poured concrete basements, making legal and illegal suites. Getting (and dodging) stop work orders with the city, and evicting tenants from hell by force.  I spent many months renovating one place, while I was running an AirBnB in the basement apartment of a few other houses. I'd be doing drywall and installing Ikea kitchens one evening, and washing 8 loads of laundry for bed sheets and bath towels, and cleaning, vacuuming and making beds and washing dishes the next night.

A few big risks with lots of debt and pushing the envelope, betting on myself, planning the work, and then working the plan. I've fired lots of contractors, evicted lots of tenants and have a thick despise for real estate agents (and no love for mortgage brokers).

&amp;#x200B;

I've lived below my means;

* I have a tenant in the suite of my own house.
* I drive a $2000 salvage title SUV that I bought and fixed myself in a weekend. Before that I drove a 1996 Honda CRV with 350,000 kms that I got for $500. Only reason I got rid of the CRV was because someone rear ended me and it was a write off. I want to splurge on a 2019 Range Rover Sport....but then I need to put a lawn mower and weed whacker in the back, not great. Also I can't put sheets of drywall or 16' baseboard trim boards on the roof, so I'll stick with my current SUV. Also the $2000/month in depreciation knots my stomach.
* I wear Costco jeans on the weekend and normal but not fancy clothes normally.  When I go to the states, I go shopping for clothing there  (Ross/Marshalls, Nordstroms rack are my wife's favorites).
* I don't cut coupons for groceries, or use the flipp app to price match everything; the time value of money for me isn't there. But I don't eat fancy. I had BBQ Walmart chicken and salad last night for dinner. Tonight, likely BBQ Costco steak or possibly a stir fry. Haven't decided yet. I pack my own lunch to work 1/2 the time, and go to a restaurant about 1/4 the time (working lunch with subordinates or local real estate people, or contractors etc).
* I've got hobbies and vices, but they really don't cost that much. My classic car(s) go up in value at the rate of inflation or more. Vs a new BMW sports car that plummets in value.
* I've got a 3 year old phone, no contract and it's fine. I'll likely drop it on my driveway some day and go buy a new (or used?) one and keep my pay-as-you-go public mobile phone plan for $40/month.
* I've got a huge cash flow relating to rental housing, but have VERY LITTLE personal expenses.
   * I steal pens from work. I wear socks until they get too thin. I research purchases and scroll through RedFlagDeals every time I need anything out side of the routine. My latest ""big purchases"" in the last 6 months were a $120 vacuum and a $200 laser printer, and I price matched both.
   * No molly maids, no skip the dishes, no fancy watches, no lawn service. Every month I mow half a dozen lawns. No electronic gadgets.... Wemo light switches are great though and I do have an August door lock and a nest 1st gen thermostat and I also have two  digital garage ant things....so perhaps I do have lots of electronics? This is all over the span of 5 - 6 years and likely totals about $5/month in spending.
   * No pets and no $50 gucci pet collar.
   * I don't own any luxury brand anything. No rolex, no balaganciaga or Coach or what ever the Kadarshains are pushing now.
   * I spend $5/day on Tim Hortons tea and a muffin, and I've never really bought into the whole ""starving monk millionaire"" thing either. For me $5/day won't make the difference, but 20 minutes making tea will mean that's 20 minutes extra sleep I get, or can spend reading, or writing an email or talking to someone where I'll likely earn a lot more than $5.  I could spend hours on r/chruning getting the new hotness in cashback cards, or make up a spreadsheet to compare MERs of whatever the new couch potato fund is. I don't bother. I just buy stocks in companies I'm familiar with, and contribute to my TFSA and other savings in a regular **automatic basis.** I buy into the ""Pay Yourself First"" model of Rich Dad.
   * I don't have/use social media much. I have a facebook account with 62 friends and no profile picture and like 100% privacy settings. I have a linked-in profile but again, no real content.  I know that twitter/instagram exist but don't use them. I just learned what tictoc was from one of my employees.  Most of youtube is fake. I watch Meet Kevin and Grahm Stepahn on occasion. All the self help, life coach crap is crap designed to separate a fool from their money......quickly.
   * I'm 37 years old BTW, so I qualify as a millennial. I think boomers robbed my generation through tax codes, government social policy and economic policy.  BUT I also think my generation is lazy and gullible; we swallowed the false narrative that degree in ""*musical gender geography studies*"" was the key to freedom and we **can** all be special. I've had to do a lot of hiring and HR over the last 2-4 years and even when interviewing/hiring people my age many of them rub me the wrong way. Too many victims, too much entitlement. This whole ""working wage"" ""housing as a human right"" and ""stolen future"" swan song really fills my tait with dry sand. My generation popularized the life coach,  reiki healing and positive affirmations and unfortunately feels that everyone's opinion has value. Even the most special snowflake melts when winter is over and the ""summer heat"" of adulthood is too much for some.
* The biggest ROI you'll ever get is from investing in yourself.
   * I go for a run or bike ride 2-3x a week and stay fit and eat healthy. 
   * I am always reading and learning and taking a course or studying for some new designation, certification or reading the new building code, new mortgage rules or new housing policy.
   * That said, I don't chase fluff education. I'll never get an MBA because those are a dime a dozen now, and sadly so is most university education. I don't buy ""millionaire programs"" from anyone on YouTube.
* Generally I just minimize expenses and don't fall into lifestyle inflation and above all; **DON'T TRY TO GET RICH FROM A SALARY; GET RICH FROM YOUR OWN WORK. FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT.**

**TLDR; The secret is there is no secret.**",2019-11-18 10:24:38
f7x6le9,etherael,7,"The only places I'm banned from are places that are widely known for pushing the blockstream narrative despite its widely accepted false nature. And that's the problem you're going to keep running into rewriting history. It's not hard to tell when the truth is censored and only lies are allowed circulation, even for casual observers.

&gt; So you are the only one who knows this ""truth""

Everybody who has been paying attention and not allowing the censorship to affect their view of the situation knows it. You're not going to be able to go back in history and cover up the Hearn incident, the massive amount of commentary from Satoshi directly on the intended design to scale on chain, the hostile attacks on any attempt to diverge from running bitcoin core both in terms of ddos and wild political scrambling from Adam Back to keep the miners on board etc. All of this stuff is well recorded and completely invulnerable to your attempts to fuck with it.

f7umvwz,greengenerosity,7,"Most people in crypto have assumed losses. The total gained is some billions smaller than the total loss because of the mining-cost alone, currently burning up $15M of wealth every day.  


It is unlikely to happen in real life but something can be less than zero-sum and still have more people with a net gain than a net loss by having the losses being larger and concentrated while the gains are smaller and less concentrated.  


Like a game where 10 people put in $10 each, the one that draws the shortest straw has to burn $1 and give $1 to each of the 9 winners. $100 enter, only $99 comes out, and 90% of the people has a gain. Still less than zero sum with more winners than losers.  


Positive sum games can have more losers than winners, a poker tournament with sponsored prize money is the simplest example, but the more common example is traders in growing markets with bad risk management.  


Crypto is the worst of both words, the gains are extremely concentrated, a very small number of high gains (LAMBO) and the losses is widely distributed. Crypto is so bad that even if it was (magically) a positive sum game most people would still lose due to people losing their keys, fraud, theft, FOMO and exit scams.  


The True Bitcoin Believers has a vision where the increase in the world economy will translate to a increase in the purchasing power of Bitcoin if only Bitcoin becomes the world currency, which it never will. They assume that even though Bitcoin is less than zero sum it will act as a fair and equitable way for people to buy a stake in the world economy free of corruption. Some Bitcoin Believers believe that Bitcoin-World-Currency will lead to a more frugal future with less economic growth, but a world with less evil, while others think that Bitcoin-World-Currency is what will cause explosive economic growth - for some reason.",2019-11-18 03:42:38

So because we dont have the smelting industrial capacity to make that much metal (barely any furnaces), we also dont have the grid infrastructure or the power generation to to support it. All three would have to be built. And private companies hardly have the ability to raise capital for all three in the best of times (they have to work with the government) let alone in a market where everyone remembers very keenly when China flooded steel markets and took out of business many furnaces and mills world wide. It's a tough business and requires producing a highly automated and efficient smelting process to work in our economy. It would be very high tech if it ever happened.

Saying you’re into cyber security is like saying you want to be a chef.  Do you want to specialize in French, Italian, etc.  Are you wanting to work on encryption, malware, viruses, bitcoin, social engineering, networks, quantum computing, etc?

First, do your research into what you want to specialize in.  It’s ok if you don’t know exactly, but try to narrow it down to at least a few choices or know what you don’t want to do.

Second, find faculty that are doing research you’re interested in.

Third, ask to speak to them and apply to their program.

Fourth, visit those schools.  You might think it’s a good fit on paper and then show up and hate the city.

Fifth, accept the best fit for you.

There is a difference in ideology here. You can't state that as fact. Many in here think the SoV can come from its utility as cash. Most disagree outside of this forum. And we can see that the vast majority of money that found a home in the BTC ticker did it for speculative reasons because they saw BTC as digital gold. Very few (relatively speaking) care about the currency component vs the SoV component.

Hard money, that can't change without unanomous consensus is a major property of the idea of a SoV. Its what will make it succeed, not what will make it fail. Its ability to withstand forks is what gives it its value.

Thats fine. You have that opinion based on the ideology discussed above. I would suggest that by the very fact that most disagree, means it is a self fullfilling profecy that it will continue its success.

f81scov,Mosmeus,1,"A me sempre dall'Inghilterra. La cosa sta diventando stressante, visto che ormai ricevo quasi una telefonata al giorno, da circa 4 anni, da parte di un gruppo di trading online. Il problema è che io sono minorenne, e mi registrai parzialmente al loro sito un po' di anni fa, prima che scoppiassero i bitcoin. Da ragazzino ingenuo ma non troppo, avevo messo email e numero di telefono vero, poi nome e cognome falsi per poi fermarmi quando si erano messi a chiedere altri dati per completare l'iscrizione e un investimento iniziale di 50€ (🤦‍♂️). Di solito riattacco appena capisco che sono loro ma ogni tanto ci parlo e altre volte li mando a fanculo. L'operatore (gente dell'est) cambia credo sempre ma ricordo che una delle prime volte che mi chiamarono, l'operatore mi disse che più aspettavo, più avrei dovuto pagare quando fosse giunto il momento. Io, turbato, gli feci notare che ero minorenne e che quindi si potevano attaccare al cazzo. Sto ritardato mi disse che prima o poi sarei divenuto maggiorenne, e allora avrei pagato. 

Ebbene, io credo che valga meno di zero ciò a cui acconsentii da ragazzino (a maggior ragione che  avevo meno di 14 anni) ma sono ignorante in materia, e vorrei la conferma forte e chiara di qualche dotto tra di voi, poiché non nego che la questione un filino mi preoccupa: non vorrei ritrovarmi a dover pagare ingenti somme una volta maggiorenne.

The EU launch starting with Germany and Austria takes most of the time with many plans and preparations. As you could read in the other Reddit Thread about the financial license we are pretty close for a launch and we are still trying to get the first cards sent out to staff, family and friends this year to test the card and ensure a smooth launch early next year.

Several features are planned and are nearing completion. 

The Litecoin will get its full features back as well as a listing from PAY, first time without payment function is not far away anymore.

With the latest version you can now also download a transaction history, e.g. for many to use for their tax information.

We have already tested our Buy Bitcoin function with many people and are working on improving it based on the feedback for a smooth full launch.

f87njjl,jberm123,1,"To be honest, this is the most disappointingly incorrect stuff I've ever heard Andreas say.

I think you even give him too much credit. I definitely think the US government has the ability to pull off a covert operation to take over Bitcoin.

The hardware cost of a 51% attack today is [~$17.5bn](https://gobitcoin.io/tools/cost-51-attack/). The US gov is easily capable of spending (printing) at least 5x that much cash to take Bitcoin down by censoring all tx's with a sustained 51% attack. Even if you assume the US gov couldn't covertly purchase enough S9's to pull off the attack and the hardware cost would actually be much higher than $17.5bn, it's trivial to assume that with $100bn the US gov could manufacture their own chips",2019-11-21 21:07:15

This is what coders do.  They lose track of the big picture and ruin the product in the name of nerd priorities.

People who are capable of understanding the need for trade-offs without compromising the integrity of the system as a whole.

&amp;nbsp;

**🍒ABOUT ME🍒**

**Who I am:** Fiona 💁🏻‍♀️ I'm hott, I'm married, AND I like to get a little kinky with strangers on the internet. I’m super flirty once you show me you’re a serious buyer! Buuuuut I can also be flippant if you’re being an idiot or annoying me by not following my directions 🙃 I’m a pole dancer and a stripper so I’m in really good shape and I’m flexible af. I’ve been told on several occasions that I am the best experience someone has had on Reddit and that their money was very well spent! So, there’s that! 

**My Domme Personality:** I am a SENSUAL DOMME! My natural Domme style is *very* much like Ceara Lynch., but sometimes I’ll be more bitchy, sometimes I’ll be more sensual. It depends on the day!

**Vanilla/Sub Personality:** Well I’m just myself, and I am a COCK TEASE! During a session, I will tease the shit out of you using my body in all sorts of ways. If you need an example of this, just scroll through my profile and you will see what I mean by my GIFS.

&amp;nbsp;


**❗️ANNOUNCEMENTS/DO'S N DON'TS❗️**

-	I use Telegram and Skype for sessions. I will occasionally use Snapchat, but it needs to be decided upon through Telegram or Reddit message.

-	Im officially moving everything over to Telegram because it is WORLDS better than Kik. If you want to work with me for sessions, you need to get Telegram. I can send much higher quality, (not potato like kik) longer videos (more content for you, yay!) and it doesn’t crash all the time. Overall Telegram is a much better experience for everyone - seriously! Just get it.

-	DO see the best way to message me, located at the bottom. I provided samples. If you message me like that I will prioritize your session!

-	**I DO get naked, but you have to pay to see. If you don’t pay for it, I’ll wear lingerie or something sexy that shows off my body.** 

-	I DO touch, rub &amp; smack my pussy, tease my clit, moan, talk a little dirty. I don’t do *explicit* masturbation (anything penetrative). 

-	**I always show my face!** 

-	Please don’t message me asking “what is your favorite thing to do?” I really despise that question! I like to do everything that I offer and I will give a better show if you come to me with a fantasy in mind :) 

-	**I DON’T DO POOPING VIDEOS.PLEASE STOP MESSAGING ME WITH POOPING VIDEO REQUESTS.** 
-	DO NOT SEND ME REDDIT MESSAGES OR REDDIT CHATS FOR SESSIONS. I never see them come in, or if I do, I forget about them because I’m already in another session. Just send me a message directly on the app you want to use so I can see it and get back to you!

-	I don’t offer Classic Sexting with no Domination or BDSM / Roleplay involved. (For example: your cock is making me wet and I’m fingering myself thinking about you.) this type of sexting is just not my bag at all lol. 

-	🗣I do not allow screen recording of any kind! Obviously with chat sessions the videos will stay there however they are NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR POSTED ANYWHERE. My content is MY content, even if I send it to you. I KEEP RECORD of chat sessions and I WILL come for you if my content has been redistributed.

f89g205,aerrejon,1,"Sia (https://sia.tech/). Released 3 years ago and a working product since day 1.

Similar to Filecoin, it is based on a storage marketplace where ""renters"" select their ""hosts"" (what Filecoin calls miners) based on competitive pricing and other reputation parameters like uptime and age. Similar to Filecoin and unlike StorJ, it is fully decentralized, so it does not rely on an central server or ""bridge"" that can go down, censor users or deplatform them. Similar to Filecoin, it relies on ""Proofs of Storage"" submitted to the blockchain to prove that the host is meeting its storage obligations. Similar to Filecoin, it uses data redundancy schemes (10/30 Reed-Solomon in Sia). Instead of using IPFS, it works using its own renter-host communication protocol. 

Filecoin is using new developments on consensus algorithms based of ""Proofs of Space-Time"" and ""Proofs of Replication"", that makes the storage provider a miner at the same time that secures the blockchain. While it can be an elegant solution, as far as I understand it is not yet a fully implemented consensus mechanism, and it will require some additional work, research and testing. Instead, Sia uses traditional Proof of Work and Nakamoto consensus for securing the blockchain, same as Bitcoin has used for 10 years.

It currently hosts 640 TB of data stored, has a network capacity of 2.2 PB and it already has storage products and companies working on top of it. To name a few, https://pixeldrain.com/ and https://goobox.io/ for file sharing and https://s3.goobox.io/ and https://filebase.com as S3-compatible enterprise storage.",2019-11-22 06:41:09

They are market makers when it comes to the game industry. (wich is bigger than the movie industry)

They just announced their upcoming game Half-Life: Alyx. A game many many people have been hoping to come out for over a decade. The game is intented to be played via VR and will be a system seller.

Where am I going with this? Just like Nano its going to revolutionise the industry.

I'm thinking smarter people than me should have a look at ways to implement nano into their new engine.  New Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress and Day of Defeat games are a no brainer.

A 1.0 value would mean bitcoin's trajectory is going perfectly sideways in price. 

But we're at 0.76, meaning the current progress of price is down and behind what we'll normally see across a 200 day range. It doesn't promise future price but, statistically speaking, it suggests an upward price to catch up to the average trend. The lower this value, the more likely it'll pop upward soon. 

Same goes for when it's above the average 1.47. Last summer at $14k, I think the value was 2.X (I say X because ai don't remember if it was 2.2 or 2.8). And when we were going up to the ATH of $20k in 2017, I recollect the value was 4.0 then, meaning it was overpriced.

You need first a SoV and then you will get a MoE. Not visa Versa.

You mean that if Venezuala creates a good trading system all problems in the country will be solved? No they can't get a SoV system, so their current MoE system (which does work in 100+ countries) does not work.

You can do that, bitcoin dropped a bit, chances are it will go up. Nobody knows if it will drop further first, or how high it will eventually go up.

If you can afford to increase your buy, you should in my opinion. But this means you're not longer DCA'ing, you can 'restart' with a higher amount.

f8eqkhy,todayismycheatday,1,"I am biased towards Cardano, my research on Tezos doesn't come close to how much I researched Cardano by far and a lot of this tech goes way over my head but here are my 2 cents. Please correct me if I am wrong and add your ideas/research, I am also here to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

**Proofs**

Tezos uses Liquid Proof of Stake and Cardano uses Dynamic Proof of Stake which are quite similar.

Staking and delegation will work quite similar. And they both have the goal to make it more flexible and inclusive so more people can participate in the network. There are differences in how and how fast blocks are created and how fast finality is reached etc. but it gets complicated and hard to compare because I don't know that much about Tezos, both projects use different terminology (cycles vs epochs, validator vs baker, staking vs baking, etc.) and things change during development.

Here is a good article on Tezos (october 2018): [https://medium.com/cryptium/tempus-fugit-understanding-cycles-snapshots-locking-and-unlocking-periods-in-the-tezos-protocol-78b27bd6d62d](https://medium.com/cryptium/tempus-fugit-understanding-cycles-snapshots-locking-and-unlocking-periods-in-the-tezos-protocol-78b27bd6d62d)

Maybe someone with more technical know how who is smarter than me can compare them into detail.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monetary policy**

*""*[*Tezos will use a non-dilutive inflationary policy set at a rate of around 5.5%*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/6bbdzo/what_is_tez0s_emission_curve/)*.  Non-dilutive means that if 100% of the network staked, 100% of the  network would receive about 5.5% more tezzies each year, thus making the  effect of the inflation neutral. If people do not choose to stake but  you do, you will earn proportionally more than the inflation rate and  thus be rewarded on net. Conversely, if you are selected to validate  block(s) and do not for the entire year, you will not receive any  additional tezzies and your stake will proportionally shrink by about  5.5%. Delegates are likely to share some of their block rewards in a bid  to attract more delegation. This can be amended by stakeholder vote in  the future.""*

Cardano on the other hand has a very similar monetary policy to Bitcoin. There is a fixed max supply and ADA is being minted to incentivize staking. These staking rewards diminish over time (in other words, inflation decreases over time) until all ADA has been minted and then staking rewards will be paid only by transaction fees. ADA purchasing power will grow over time if demand keeps increasing.

It is pretty much inflation (Tezos) vs deflation (Cardano). There are arguments for and against both approaches. Will it keep the network secure? Will the economy stay healthy? I personally don't like the idea that my coins will depreciate in value when I don't stake but on the other hand it's a good incentive to stake and keep the network secure. We will have to see what works and what not but if Cardano manages to keep the network secure with it's monetary policy then I would prefer that over Tezos's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Progamming languages/smart contract languages**

They both have been coded with functional programming languages (OCaml and Rust/Haskell) and both their smart contracts will be created with a functional programming language (Michelson and Plutus). Cardano also has Marlowe and I don't think Tezos has anything like it. I am not a programmer so I don't know the differences but here is a thread where OCamI and Haskell are compared: [https://www.np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6didpj/to\_haskell\_or\_to\_ocaml/](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6didpj/to_haskell_or_to_ocaml/) Also this video from Philip Wadler on Plutus is interesting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REt32COgF28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REt32COgF28)

&amp;#x200B;

**Approach/quality**

Tezos smart contracts have formal verification but I can't find anything about them using formal methods building Tezos itself except a link in their whitepaper to the formal specification of their smart contract language which leads to nothing. I also can't find anything about them using academic peer review for their research, only that they use ""peer review"" for their code, but I only did a quick search. (It seems to be harder to find information about Tezos than it is to find information about Cardano... or maybe that's just me.) If Tezos hasn't used formal methods and peer review then there will be a big difference in quality between the two projects.

Tezos focused mostly on governance so that further development could be done in a decentralized manner. Conclusion in Tezos whitepaper: *""We feel we’ve built an appealing seed protocol. However, Tezos’s true potentiallies in putting the stakeholders in charge of deciding on a protocol that they feel best serves them.""* While Cardano focused on building a very solid foundation using an academic approach with peer review and formal methods to then hand over the protocol to the community for them to develop on top of this foundation. There isn't a lot known about Cardano's governance yet though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Community**

The Cardano community seems to be bigger and more active after taking a quick look at their social media and forum.

They have around 450 nodes on their network (maybe more by now). Cardano's networked testnet had over 200 without incentives.

&amp;#x200B;

Tezos Foundation has a huge warchest though of $650 million according to this article: [https://www.publish0x.com/publish0x-posts/tezos-oversight-xokjve](https://www.publish0x.com/publish0x-posts/tezos-oversight-xokjve)

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I got so far. I think they have quite some similarities but Cardano has a better approach overall.",2019-11-24 03:01:27

Paranoid much? I live in a free country and I have free money. This will not change anytime soon. You think Bitcoin which has no real monetary worth (all value is manipulated) would change this?

f8exiax,Symphonic_Rainboom,1,"Slow down a bit. Half of your points are good, half of them don't make any sense.

&gt; Why the fuck should Bitcoin even be worth $7000?

Agreed.

&gt; Who cares if there are only 21 million coins?

Scarcity drives price. This is basic supply and demand.

&gt; Who cares if someday when none of us are even alive anymore bitcoin will change from inflationary to deflationary?

Agreed. Bitcoiners yelling ""muh deflation"" when it's still inflationary, and will have major issues with fees and hashrate as the issuance lowers in the future.

&gt; Why would anyone want a global currency that becomes more and more scarce for the rest of history?

You're telling me that scarcity makes something *less* desirable? Check on real estate in San Francisco - if something you want is scarce and becoming more desirable, you buy it as soon as possible. Value of Bitcoin non-withstanding.

&gt; How would people three generations from now use Bitcoin when all of the coins have been taken or lost

The more of a resource is taken/lost out of circulation, the higher the price becomes. Again, economics 101.

&gt; and the ones that are left take 3 hours and exorbitant fees to process anything?

Agreed.

&gt; What can you even buy with this crap that isn't illegal? How is this shit more convenient than Venmo, Cash App, Zelle, Facebook Pay, etc.?

Agreed. But I don't use Venmo, PayPal or Facebook Pay because the companies running them are major dicks, and it's widely known that they are experts at dicking you around for no reason. Still, there are alternatives.",2019-11-24 03:53:45

f8o00kr,Nagosh,12,"So in the beginning of the year I had imagined us breaking 6k in the last half of 2019 and ending the year around 7-8k, around double the price. Even though we are going in the opposite direction we are still above 6k and will probably end the year around 7k. Is there anything else out there that has doubled in price in a year? Bitcoin is still one of the best investments out there. I still think we'll double again next year and be at 15k in 2020 ready to take on new ATH's in 2021, maybe even in late 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

The shoot up to 13k was a fluke, just bulls jumping the gun and getting ahead of themselves for the next bull run above ATH. That makes sense though as everyone in the bitcoin scene believes we are going to 100k or more in the next run up so 10k looked cheap, but once everyone got into the boat no on else was left to keep buying so we fell back down. It didn't help that so many people longed above 10k assuming we were about to blast off (myself included)  that all this selling pressure now is them getting liquidated. We need another long period of sideways to make sure that there is enough buy pressure to maintain this current price and it isn't just being held up by longs. If 6-7k is that price than we are looking really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in here needs to calm the fuck down. We doubled in price in one year. Hash rate is still way higher than it was in 2017 which means it is more secure now than it was before. If you guys aren't happy with the price doubling in a year than it is your greed that is the problem, not bitcoin. Bitcoin is still just as amazing today as it was when I learned about it. This is game changing tech and all you care about is getting rich as fast as possible. Do us all a favor and sell your stash and put it into weed stocks.

OP is complaining that the graphic is shit and full of lies. Seems you agree :)

&gt; Especially because:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) You didn't stick to the colours of the fork logos this is difficult to read. BSV is dark blue and BCH is dark brown?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Bitcoin Cash ABC??? Makes no sense to still label it that way.

Not just that, the ""main"" bitcoin chain gets an extra line for each implementation. At minimum this should mean the BCH split is creating 5 new lines (XT, bitprim, ABC, Classic, BU). Not just the one.
 
&gt; 3) it looks like BCH and BSV forked off from Bitcoin clashic which is not the case.

Agreed. Very creative that one.
 
&gt; 3) four Bitcoins at the end? Are you referring to the four node implementations that are compatible to each other?

Also very creative.

Here are two more;

5) SegWit fork is missing. I guess they want to sidestep them forking away from the original Bitcoin.

Sounds stupid, but in theory it could work. Though I think it would take a long time to repay the cost of the PC in what you save, so it's probably more effort than it's worth.

f8qp8yw,Alabaster2020,2,"Corruption, incompetence and sanctions have devastated Venezuela’s oil industry, the country’s main source of hard currency. But Venezuela’s economic crisis has encouraged the growth of another: the “farming” of virtual gold in the artificial worlds created by video games. Venezuelans spend hours on end playing massively multiplayer online roleplaying games (mmorpgs) to extract gold coins (the currency in RuneScape) or crystal ones (Tibia). They sell these for real money, via intermediary websites, to other gamers, who spend them on such virtual valuables as weapons, armour and magic potions.

Venezuelans playing RuneScape can earn 500,000-2m gold pieces an hour by mass-murdering dragons and mass-producing runes. At current exchange rates 1m coins are worth about 50 cents. A gold farmer can earn $40 a month, a tidy sum in a country where the minimum wage is worth $7.50 a month. Some farmers trade the coins for Bitcoin, which, though more volatile than most conventional currencies, is more stable than Venezuela’s bolívar.

Massive global war?  Nobody is going to suddenly flee to bitcoin bc they are pulling money out of way more sound investments to protect their principal, not gamble more if the entire portfolio is losing.

It's completely reasonable to think that BTC had its time, but will bleed out in the long run and be a relic, just like hard drives filled with it forever trapped and lost in dumps and landfills.  For some reason this has always bothered me. 

The government would rather be able to print TRILLIONS every year without any real accountability to markets and global stability, and sorry, but BTC isn't going to beat the US or China.  Unless the bitcoin whales amass fortunes and sovereign land + a means to protect their wealth and livelihood (which they can't and won't), it's relegated to basement dwellers who predicted it might make them wealthy.  

Is that who you want as a ruling class?  Trillby with his Mountain Dew and Cheetos at the filthy desk, big breasted anime girl posters with hentai, happily the custodian of $100M of power.  Jesus what a terrible picture.

There is probably only 1 wild of many ""Avengers: End Game"" winning combo that yields a true moon with an insane sustained ceiling for any amount of time.  I'd bet against it because there are too many ramifications if we get to moon land for world superpowers when poor people around the world have access to these level of resources.

Governments want to mine asteroids, not digital tokens.  Think about it.  Again, TRILLIONS at stake in space and people will actually do this in our lifetime.  That's tangible to Johnny layperson because he watched Armageddon 25 times on TBS after drinking a bud and it's fucking cool.  Bitcoin just isn't.  

To me, my personal moon (as of today) is a paltry 200K per bitcoin realm for a sustained period of 12 months or more.  A flash pop and pump followed by what's happened recently to reach a new ATH but not create a moon end-game at least 10x from previous ATH.

On the bullish sentiment, I am also 100% sure there will be some kind of giant pump to a crazy level no one projected over the next decade, but no idea on timing.  Maybe it's 6 months from now, or 2-3 years from now, so who knows.  There is so much downward pressure to make retail investors and traders give up and get out to set up what I would expect to be the final climb to be in the moon end-game.  After that giant climb, btc swoons and fades into perpetuity as even more degenerate gamblers catch a falling knife and lose everything.

Obvious flashes and crashes in moon land end-game with a final panic rush for the exits (or possibly even multiple panic-induced trends), so it would be even tougher to make clear decisions with a huge price that still represents a lifetime of wages and productivity for the majority of humanity living through it.

There are so many factors working against bitcoin as a fungible currency for daily commerce and activity, but I could see the 'store of value' maintain some kind of level of demand, as well as global exchanges and markets that trade it.

Just like gold bugs and silver bugs, people will always believe in bitcoin. 

My stupid ignorant projections play out over my lifetime in decades, whatever.  

Lastly, I find this sub-reddit fascinating and it's quite interesting to observe and learn from everyone willing to share their TA and opinions.

f8shfp5,fast_grammar,1,"That's not how the burden of proof works. You have to prove why you think Bitcoin will succeed, why it's better than the competition and why the thousands of red flags we've seen the last few years should be ignored. I shouldn't even have to bring any particular evidence forward for my skepticism to be valid, but I will:

* The majority of holders do not understand Bitcoin's technology, leading anyone with basic knowledge of finance to conclude that the market is 99% speculation;
* There is no clear path to transition from Bitcoin being a 'store of value' (hint: it's not a store of value either) to an actual, usable currency;
* Current distribution is absolutely horrendous and in the event of global adoption, wealth inequality would only increase;
* It's so fucking energy inefficient that it should have been forsaken years ago.

That's four arguments, but give me a few hours and I would have no problem finding you twenty. That's no an exaggeration, it's just that easy to find arguments why supporting Bitcoin in its current state is just completely nuts.",2019-11-27 00:06:32

f8shdye,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1,"You're not doing yourself favours on doubling down on this. For instance Bitcoin was worth one CNY somewhere halfway down 2010. Nobody cared. Likewise, Vechain has already been worth over $9 before the token split. Way more than  CNY.  And yet nobody cared.   

The valuation of a single token doesn't tell us much because the total circulations supply is an arbitrary number. For Bitcoin it's 21 million purely because Satoshi types that number into the protocol from the start. He could've picked any number. Just like Sunny picked any number for Vechain and then chose to multipy it by a hundred further down the line.   

So this idea that a government will intervene the moment the price of a single unit of currency approaches their national currency isn't really founded on anything.",2019-11-27 00:05:55

2) You can reuse addresses , but for privacy its better to simply use the new addresses the wallet provides with each tx, but if your plan is to use electrum with cold storage than generate a set of addresses before removing it 

3) You can setup a watch only wallet . here is a solution

4) You don't need to if you are just using cold storage , just if you are using a hot wallet

I saved a couple of bucks, around +4k during my teenage years for a car. Now i got really into biking and used 2k to buy  a new bike and a ps4. Then i went to millitary and didnt really need a car as i got free public transportation.

So i had 2k+ and got the urge to buy myself a car despite i live in my parents house, studying in an university that is literally 4 km away with my bike. I instead used the money to get a new gtx1060 and used the 2k to invest into bitcoin and stocks, 1500 into stocks and 500 into bitcoin. So far the bitcoin thing didnt pay out and i made around 30-50€ loss and i didnt bought on the bottom of the drip but about halfway trough it. As soon as my 500€ investment is worth i will continue to invest more probably, but so far only the stocks thing is really something i dig and have more controle over. I probably will either keep the 1/4 ratio bitcoin to stocks lessen it slightly depending how my stocks do(so far good) or increase it if bitcoin does really well for me.",2019-11-27 00:28:15

f8vfcht,cryptogrip,1,"People rarely get behind forms of money in a conscious effort if you study the history. They get behind Bitcoin because of the independance it offers, but this is a very small group of people. Any other project going forward will never be able to offer that because it will have some element of centralization. I don't worry at all about the distribution, that's just a by product of how early we are in Bitcoin's lifecycle. 

We may not like it, but there will always be early adopters and in the case of this new asset, early investors. What good os wealth if it's not spent eventually? In 50 years from now, if Bitcoin's layers and expanded protocol have survived, people won't be worried about distribution. 

And I'm sorry, but in my opinion we are looking at a long time before we can reach that kind of use. You don't change existing generations, you wait for future generations to adapt. For the foreseeable future, Bitcoin will be a speculative investment, a digital gold. The industry and investment around that use case is growing. I'm personally fine with that. It gives people an alternative, and it's a fun, fast moving asset to add to your risk portfolio. As easj generation passes through it all, I can see more and more gravitating to a digital asset to diversify and catch a few gains on their investment. Either way the future should be interesting to watch in this space. I think by late 2021, we'll have a better idea of how demand for Bitcoin is looking.",2019-11-28 00:21:37

Laws, which I wish were less strict in general.

&gt; in most country, you are not allowed to access some money without state permission but some do anyway

Bitcoin is a form of black market money, and the government doesn't really like it, but it's hard to stop people from using it.  As long as the government requires taxes to be paid in its official currency, I don't see why they shouldn't allow people to use other currencies.",2019-11-28 00:37:11

My whole point is that a market price is based on executed transactions, which are controlled by buyers.

This is very visible in crypto, stock or forex trading. Even if someone bids or asks for a specific price, in the end the actual price of an asset is calculated based on executed transactions. You can offer to sell a Bitcoin for 20k $ today, but that is just your offer. The actual price of bitcoin (7,2k $ today) is based on prices accepted by buyers, which triggered actual transactions. That is reality. Even if you walk away from a 7.2k offer for your bitcoin, that doesn't mean it's worth 20k. The market decides.",2019-11-28 01:35:52

The only time that you hear anything bad about Bitcoin is when it is used for illegal activities (so is fiat, duh), or when a centralized custodian gets hacked and dummies who keep their coins on an exchange lose them. 

Advances in wallet security, mining tech, and adoption will eventually reach a point where utilizing Bitcoin as a currency or store of value will be a no-brained.

3. I will be using this sub to also promote the Bethlehem, Utah chapter of the Aryan Brotherhood. We meet once a month at the Lord of Lords Baptist church basement. Full garb is mandatory upon entry.

4. AWALT must be used at a minimum of 3 times per post - Aryans Will Always Live Together. We must promote racial unity. AWALT

6. Because I anticipate traffic to this sub to be minimal, it can also be used as a message board for bitcoin trade for anyone selling or seeking methadone, Xanax, Fentanyl or street grade Heroin.

Oh, no.. I've been feeling a bit..dry lately. I think the best thing to do is get that lotion all over my soft, pale skin. Am I using too much..? But it feels ssssso good! I just can't seem to stop from putting more on! I'm definitely feeling way more wet, too. What better chance than this to cum!

This is my favorite edging video I've ever made to date! I haven't came in a few days, and really wanted to.. But when I started playing with myself, it kind of got to be an amazing edging session. I got super wet, and shaky. My clit grew so much that every time I touched it, it felt better and better. I edge myself well over 15 times here, until I absolutely cannot stop myself from an amazing, giggly orgasm!

###**Ass-bouncy orgasm** (ass, voyeur, masturbation, moaning) - [click here for preview with sound!](https://www.manyvids.com/Video/1103214/Ass-bouncy-orgasm/)
It feels SO damn good to rub my fingers against my tight, wet little pussy. I lay in my bed completely uncovered, wearing only a pink lace bralette, and you're watching me from behind. You get a perfect views of my pussy, my fingers rubbing her, and my amazing, thick ass bouncing up and down as I pleasure myself! I get quite loud as I moan and groan in pleasure as I am getting closer to cumming. Featuring an amazing, real orgasm for my pleasure. Make it yours, too! You don't want to miss this one.

f93tc7q,bitcoincams,1,"As Sunny said in latest AMA they will not increase generation rate at least until the end of the 2020 since they have other measures to keep the transaction cost stable even if the price of VTHO goes up. He also said that foundation would not have anything against high VTHO price. I dont see how can the price of VET increase if the VTHO/VET ratio drop lower from current value. Who would invest in high risk asset for 1% annual ROI?! As im seeing this, antimners for Bitcoin have value only because Bitcoin has a value. Same is with VET. Why would anyone buy a mining machine which main purpuse is to mine VTHO if the VTHO is worthless? Also as we can see now, a lot of buissnisses choose to buy VTHO instead of buying VET to produce their own VTHO.

too late for that either Bitcoins like
$275 a Bitcoin right now**. If Bitcoin becomes
