ehh8jqe,AD1AD,1,"Thanks for your thoughts.

&gt;I think the weighted voting system builds more echo chambers.

I'm not worried about echo chambers. If you're the type of person that downvotes productive discourse just because you disagree with it, you deserve to not see it, and then not have the opportunity to downvote it out of other people's feeds. Echo chambers are only a problem if your echo chamber imposes itself on someone else (like what happens as subreddits get larger). And given the option to weigh coinciding voters' votes on a continuous spectrum between ""equal"" and ""infinite"", a user can, at any time, ""de-echo-chamber-ify"" their feed to expose themselves to content posted by those with whom they tend to disagree. My top priority is to diminish the viability of disrupting productive discourse.

&gt;However, a tag based system with payment voting might be beneficial. My concern is that necessitating payments for each and every vote creates a large barrier of entry for most users on a platform. This barrier negatively impedes user growth and was the largest flaw in yours.com

I don't think that this will be too much of an issue with advancements in usability like the badger wallet plugin. And if someone isn't willing to go through the necessary steps (install badger wallet and get funds from a faucet) to participate in what I think will be, by default, higher quality discussion, then that's fine.

&gt;There is probably a better way to do this like by necessitating a social credit score where users that can prove that they are human with Bitcoin BCH. By locking Bitcoin BCH funds in a custodial wallet for long periods of time and creating a 'money captcha' where a specific and random amount of Bitcoin BCH (less than $.25) is requested and then sent back to maintain that social credit score every time an account is flagged we can increase the opportunity cost in account creation. This can also serve as a metric for weighting votes as well as a different way to punish suspicious behavior.

A system like this might have some benefits, but I'd worry about several things. Having to lock funds in a custodial wallet for long periods of time might be a bigger barrier to entry than paying to vote in the first place. The first person to figure out automating the captcha will have the opportunity to manipulate the system. It also would add a lot of complexity to what would be, without it, a potentially simple yet powerful system.",2019-03-01 00:16:11
ehh8f55,ooaauud,1,"It is easier to create a regulated and safe system with digital money, than with paper money.
And it is easier, safer and better if the digital money is an open blockchain (bitcoin), than a simple digital database inside each private bank network.
Big banks had been caught in big fraud schemes. There is no reason for modern society to depositate so much trust in the old banks COBOL mainframes... 
The beauty of bitcoin, is that it works without borders and regulations, but for anything that needs a specific control of the money, where it comes from and where it goes, blockchain is ready, out of the box. The moment a user declare a wallet, and if the user wants/need the coins from that wallet will be tracked forever. So if it is a common agreement of a specific credit system, to track the money, it will be tracket ""bit-perfect"". But even in such case, every part still has the liberty to go rogue, in case there is a major disagreement , or a government turns out to be represive (venezuela) . For the scenarios where each part need to trust each other, comes it play multisig keys, there part of the key may stay in the hands of a scrow/regulator.

My premise is actually pretty simple. There has not been any market correlation to other assets demonstrated to bitcoin, that I know of, so your math I would guess, is accurate. However, I am guessing that as a speculative asset, at this point in time, it is a risk on investment. Other risk on investments are either sold during large downturns or hedged with larger market puts (on say the S&amp;P), generally. 

I am very open to this changing or being proven wrong, since being non-correlated during a larger market downturn would be as bullish as anything else, IMO. ",2019-03-01 01:32:26

ehhgvbo,TL_endy,1,"You want to compare it to Ethereum? Let's do it, but get your facts straight.

&amp;#x200B;

ETH ICO price was 0.31 cents, and was already over 90 cents wen trading opened. So when going 35x it was already over $31 . 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, it did go x35+ again from $31 to ATH during the crazy alt season, but in the meantime bitcoin had gone x20, so it didn't outperform Bitcoin much (not even x2). 

So assuming $QNT is like ETH, then maybe, IF BTC goes x20 from current price, AND we have a crazy alt season you may see another x35 on Quant

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime (much less time actually...) many coins (Tron, Verge, Vechain, Nano, etc.) all outperformed Bitcoin by an x100 factor...

This would be absolutely unthinkable in Bitcoin, pools are fluid and miners can move freely between them or start their own pool.

In your first sentence you say ""It's easier to create a *regulated* and safe system with digital money...""

Then you say ""The beauty of bitcoin is that it works without borders or *regulations*...""

You can't have your cake and eat it too.  BTC is NOT regulated. So no, it is not in any way ""easier"" to create a ""safe system"".  Your safe system has these flaws:

1. If you lose your keys your money is gone FOREVER.  You have NO RECOURSE.

2. If you use an exchange, and that exchange collapses, you have NO RECOURSE.

3. If you make a purchase from a vendor and the vendor does not make good on the purchase, YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE.  You can show ""I paid from address X to address Y"" but you have no way to prove the vendor is the owner of that address.

4. BTC has been proven to be the victim of price manipulation.  We had another BART take place last week.  Remember the pop to $4000 and the subsequent drop?  This is happening over and over.  It's well-documented.

5.  You are doing a tiny percentage of the traffic that VISA does, yet blockchain is burning more power than the entire country of Portugal.  It's insane, inefficient and irresponsible.  BTC manages a few transactions per second.  VISA does 24000 transactions per second.  

6.  You mention COBOL and antiquated systems.  Blockchain is a LINKED LIST.  THAT is ANCIENT, horribly inefficient tech.

so this tanked the items worth harder then bitcoin. its virtually worthless now and thousands of people now have banks full of max stacks of cash (I think each stack is roughly 2 billion and a bank has a few hundred slots).

This is all garbage. You're welcome to your opinion but I draw the line at total nonsense.

On-chain will work perfectly at scale, and BCH is well on the way with CTOR, graphene, and more UTXO improvments combined with better multi-threading. IMO all that's left is a good sharding/storage schema and there's nothing out that the really fits yet.

ehoe0j2,flameylamey,1,"Every time one of these threads pops up, there's inevitably a comment like this here. The part that confuses me is how often people mindlessly upvote these types of comments. It's incredibly short-sighted and it completely misses the point of the mentality of holding.

[Let's say you're this guy here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ka3mo/its_the_perfect_time_to_buy_bitcoins/c2is0q5/). It's 2011 and you're upset that you got caught up in the hype and bought a bunch of Bitcoin on the way down from a massive bubble, watching it decline from a peak of $32 all the way down to $2 over the course of months. 

You'd be feeling pretty bummed out at this point. You just spent $1000 on this magic internet money and you've watched it decline all the way down to $160. That's pretty depressing. You're just a poor college student who was struggling to get by as it is, and now you've gone and spent a large portion of your savings on something that declined down to 16% of the price you bought it at. At this point, you're really beating yourself up over this. How could you have been so stupid?! You've been hoping over the last several months that things will turn around, but every time it looks like it's finally about to break out again, it just goes even lower. All the way along, you're mocked by people posting [charts like this](http://i.imgur.com/W1JCW.png), and you just feel like more and more of an idiot. You have hope that it might begin to recover, but you're just surrounded by people calling you ""delusional"" at every turn. ""Fuck, why couldn't I have just gotten in early while these things were still trading for a few cents?"", you ask yourself. You feel like such a fool.

Oh well. You're young, and it's not the end of the world. You figure at this point that you'd rather just accept it as a mistake and move on with your life. So you lock away your bitcoins on a flash drive somewhere and just forget about them as you finish your studies, continue working and just get on with your life.

Almost three years later, in May 2014, you see an article pop up in your feed about some kind of huge Bitcoin market crash. ""Hang on, didn't that happen years ago?"", you think. ""Why are they only just writing articles about it now?"" 

You click on the article and can't even believe what you're seeing. Bitcoin is currently trading for $400. You rub your eyes, not quite sure whether you can process it. That $1000 investment which you'd written off years ago? It's now worth $32,000. You could buy a new car with that money! But you're curious, and you decide to read into it a bit more and look at what happened recently. You discover that the price it's currently trading for is *after* it already declined from an insane run-up late last year where Bitcoin peaked at over $1100. ""$1100?! Holy shit, why couldn't I have just sold then?""

But you decide to just ride it out and see what happens. It recovered last time and went far beyond the price anyone could've dreamed. Would it happen again? You decide that you're at a point in your life and you're not particularly wanting for money. You already have a job that's paying the bills and you've got a few thousand saved. So you decide to keep your Bitcoin safely tucked away on that flash drive and see what happens.

For the next several months, you eagerly check the price each day, waiting for that recovery. And wait. And wait. But the price only continues to decline further. Finally, a year later, it's declined all the way down to $200 with still no sign of recovery. You're frustrated with yourself, knowing you could have just sold them at $400 and bought back twice the amount now. But oh well, you couldn't have known what would happen.

The market is *slow*. It's incredibly boring. But over the last few months, a bit of comradery has been forming on Reddit and other Bitcoin forums you've been reading. People with the attitude that they're just going to hold on, for better or worse. They saw what happened last time - hell, you were part of it! - and they believe the same thing might happen again. You become convinced and now you've subscribed to the hodl mentality.

But the recovery doesn't come. For almost an entire year you hold on, and throughout that time Bitcoin looks like it's about to break out several times... but, it always turns back down and settles around the $200 range. TA ""experts"" are posting about that next big breakout, keeping you hopeful, but you always just end up disappointed in the end. Lots of people are talking about how Bitcoin is done, and once again the word ""delusional"" is being thrown around for anyone who thinks the price might recover. You start to question your decision to hold. ""Am I delusional? Have I bought into a meme?""

But one day, it does start to climb. You assume it's just going to drop back down soon, but it doesn't. It keeps going. And going. Over the next few months, you watch it sustain actual growth for the first time in what feels like an eternity. It passes $400. $600. Holy shit, the thing's at $800. Wow, it's about to pass its all time high of $1100! You get ready to transfer your Bitcoin onto an exchange and sell it, extremely happy that you waited it out this long. But... you decide to hold on even longer. You can sense even greater hype building. You remember what happened last time. You decide to wait it out.

Over the next year, it climbs to levels previously thought insane. It passes $3000. $5000. Now it's $9000 and people are posting Vegeta memes all over Reddit. It's unbelievable. You're fully ready to sell right now, but now you're reading threads all over Reddit about how Thanksgiving is about to hit and this might propel Bitcoin even higher as families sit around the dinner table and spread the word. Deciding there might actually be some truth to this, you decide you're going to hang on for just a few days longer.

Bitcoin continues to ramp up to unbelievable levels. One day you wake up and you see the price at $12,500. ""This is it"", you think. Today's the day you sell. Surely it can't go much higher than this, it's due for another crash just like last time. So you sell your 80 Bitcoin and your $1000 investment is cashed out for a whopping $1,000,000. You're ecstatic. You can't even believe it. All that time when things looked bleak, but you just decided to keep holding on for all those years, and now you get to reap those rewards. Over the next few days, you watch Bitcoin climb even higher, up to over 1.5x the price you sold at... and part of you regrets not holding on just a little longer... but you can't be too upset. You may have missed the top, but you still made an amount of money you only dreamed of.

You decide to use the money to treat yourself to a nice house, and that car you always wanted ever since you were a kid. You've made it. You're so, so glad that you just hung on and kept holding your Bitcoin through those tough times. In celebration, you decide to get a custom license plate for your brand new lambo. You go with ""BTC HODL"" as a nice nostalgic reminder of all those tough, incredibly bleak times when you felt like giving up.

A year and a half later, someone spots you driving your lambo across town and posts a picture of it on Reddit.

Several people comment on this post.

""Lol, well he obviously didn't HODL if he bought that car""

""What a hypocrite. I wish people would practice what they preach""

""More like SODL, LOL""

""LMAO, holding is a sure way to get burned. I can't believe people fell for this meme""

Another approach is to simply find people who hold BTC who will trade with you (if you are trying to buy).  At your local bitcoin meetup simply share with other attendees that you have cash and are looking to do a trade, and likely you will find someone who happens to have Bitcoin and is willing to sell to you.  Since these are over-the-counter (OTC) trades, generally by HODLers who do trades on an infrequent basis, no KYC or other identity assertions will be either requested nor required.

ehq7fib,gsingh2000,1,"I see Bitcoin as Digital Gold and a store of Value. There are a lot of folks that are associating price of Bitcoin to its usage, primarily spending in BTC. This will be an imp component ONLY when we start getting paid in BTC - or make money in BTC - then we can expect to spend in BTC. Why would 'anyone' buy BTC in USD to spend BTC - why would you buy something in digital Gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the focus 'globally' should change to getting paid in BTC then the real usage/spending BTC will come into play. We should all play our part in that if we want to see BTC price to rise. Start getting paid in BTC - ask your employers etc. There are payroll systems already that would allow your employer to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTC as store of value is the most imp component. So I would never spend BTC but would do it to save on all transaction fee etc ONLY if were to start getting paid in BTC.",2019-03-04 07:27:23
ehq7h9e,fire_cheese_monster,1,"&gt;Dhume lost faith in Modi because of demonitization.

Then he is a very bad analyst. 

I understand that DeMo was done to invalidate the cash based parallel economy. And maybe there was a secondary objective to impact the UP polls a few months from DeMo. 

The pain that people had with empty ATMs and missing smaller denomination notes and the piss poor execution of the entire exercise can be blamed on Modi. 

Yet it hasn't been a single issue government. They did several things good and bad after that. He fails his role as an analyst when he lets his bias creep in and prevents an
 objective assessment of policies. 

&gt;Having similar background, I can understand how they feel - demonitization is a gross, violent attack on an individual.

I have a similar background as well. I didn't really feel that it was a violent attack. I was majorly inconvenienced by it. I normally withdraw all my cash at once and then keep on spending it for a month or two. Most of my spending is via cards. 

But people had stopped accepting card payments at several places. And I was stuck paying cash. 

I felt the pain with no Ola/Uber having change for 2000 and getting stuck late in the night. And still I would say that it will be a stretch to call it a violent attack. 


&gt;If the government can do this, what's stopping it from one day seizing my financial assets or even physical assets?


There certainly was that fear. I myself had feared a tax audit for my foreign currency accounts. 

I had bought and sold a few bitchcoins for the fuck of it during this period. I feared I would be sent a tax notice for these money deposits. 

I mean I was all clean but I did fear harassment. 


And then nothing happened. 



&gt;Because in a non-cash based economy, the government can enact negative interest rates and seize/redistribute value.. 

If it happened in US, it would have been global meltdown. 


If such a thing ever happened, shit would have already hit the fan and cash would have been mostly useless. 


I was a goldbug for a few years because of this fear. But then I grew up. 



&gt;Same thing happens if governments push for monetary expansion which is why these individuals respond negatively to any real or percieved government attack on independence of central bank.


That's always a stupid idea to print more money and should be viewed negatively. But I have never really bothered about an attack on the independence of the Fed. It is all bullshit. 



&gt;They will support crowsourced source of value - like gold or bitcoin etc though.

Pedestrian economists might, but no mainstream economist is going to go on the air and say that bitcoin is better than US dollar.

ehpw7br,lobt,1,"ANNOTATED NOTES provided by [Professor Meow](https://twitter.com/Sesame4Bitcoins/status/1102268712969658369): 

**LIGHTNING NETWORK DEVELOPMENT**

*Adam B. Levine*: How do you determine at what rate [channel capacity] should increase and who gets to decide if that should increase?

*Andreas Antonopolous*: The way lightning collaboration and interoperability happens is through a series of standards called BOLT (Basics of Lightning Technology). These are constantly under negotiation. The first iteration of BOLT standards is what created today's production Lightning Network, and allows three or four different software clients to interoperate very successfully.

*Stephanie Murphy*: Can we draw any parallels to the way that changes happen [on the Lightning Network], and in Bitcoin [base protocol layer]?

*Andreas Antonopolous*: This isn't a consensus rule. The difficulty with Bitcoin [base layer] is that everyone has to agree, because if one party doesn't agree, they can no longer maintain synchronization with the network. In Lightning, the scripts are part of the consensus because you need to be able to secure the transactions - everything else is up for negotiation. If some clients don't do big payments and other clients do big payments, it's OK, they can both coexist on the network quite happily. You don't need this rigid lockstep coordination on layer 2 as you do in layer 1. **It's one of the reasons why layer 2 can move much faster in terms of innovation, because you don't need everybody to agree on all of the changes.**

Next week is the second semi-annual meeting of the various teams that are working on Lightning development, so that they can continue the discussion on developing the BOLT standard and creating new interoperable standards. 

All of the things we are talking about: Wumbology, Eltoo, AMP, Sphinx-routing, Rendezvous-routing, etc; all of these were decided and standardized in terms of roadmap in the last semi-annual meeting of the Lightning developers. The next one is next week in Argentina. There's a lot more happening on the mailing list, and there's a lot more things in discussion that we didn't even touch on. We scratched the surface - we talked about the things that were agreed on 6 months ago, that now have names, and are proceeding towards production with specific standards. Next week in their meeting in Argentina, they're probably going to create a whole bunch of new things that we haven't even talked about. Once again this is a space that moves incredibly fast. Lightning is moving at 3 or 4 times the speed of Bitcoin’s base blockchain development, because innovation can move a lot faster at higher layers. You don't need as much coordination and conservatism because you get the security from the base layer. This is really interesting. Things are really speeding up and heating up in the Lightning development space.

**LIGHTNING NETWORK CAPACITY**

*Adam B. Levine*: Right now in the Lightning Network, you can only make transactions and hold value up to a certain size. Andreas, why is that?

*Andreas Antonopolous*: It's to discourage people from putting too much money into something that was experimental, and also trying to do payments that are too big for most routes. The limit per payment is 4 million Satoshis (0.04 Bitcoin). The channel capacity maximum is 16.7 million Satoshis. You can create a channel for 16 million Satoshis and you can transmit payments of about 1/4 its total capacity at a time in each direction. That just prevents people from trying to use Lightning today for the types of payments that are probably best kept on-chain.

*Adam B. Levine*: Do you see the Lightning Network being used for larger transactions like the traditional Bitcoin network?

*Andreas Antonopolous*: Eventually yes. **Eventually there's no reason why you wouldn't have your entire hot wallet in Lightning channels, and the only funds that are not in Lightning channels are cold storage funds.** I see it eventually having much bigger transactions - it can span the entire range from tiny to very big.

**DUAL FUNDED CHANNELS**

*Andreas Antonopolous*: Imagine that Adam and I are sitting across from a table. We have a PVC tube between us, and that PVC tube between us is our channel. Let's say this is funded entirely in peanuts. I have a bowl full of peanuts on my end. If I want to send peanuts to Adam, I can send them, but he doesn't have any on his end. I can send peanuts to him, and once he has some on his end, he can send them back to me. He can make payments in my direction once he has some peanuts on his end of the pipe. But until he does, I have all the peanuts on my end, he has nothing on his end; there's only one way they can flow, and that's from me to him. 

That's what a channel normally looks like today. Channels are these two ended things and you have two balances. You have a local balance and a remote balance. Local balance is what you have on your side of the channel. Remote balance is what the other party has put on their side of the channel. Today when I set up a node, if I open channels to other people, I put funds on my end. If they open channels to me they put funds on their end. But when we start, all of those channels have zero on one side - they're only funded in one direction. Until payments start flowing through that means they're unbalanced - they can only flow through in one direction until there's a bit of balance on both sides, then they can flow in both directions. 

The proposal here is to be able to set up a channel with another party, but rather than funding it only on your end, you negotiate in advance. You say, “hey, I'm willing to fund it on my end but only if, and only if you fund it on your end. Do we have a deal?” Sure okay, so I'll put a tenth of a Bitcoin on this end, and you put a tenth of a Bitcoin on that end. **Now we have a channel that can flow in both directions from the very beginning.**

The double funding of transactions involves us coin-joining a transaction where we spend inputs from both of our wallets in order to fund a 2-of-2 [multisig] where both of us have balance. It removes some of the risk of you blindly opening channels to other people.

*Adam B. Levine*: Do you think this [collaboratively signing with someone else] solution is becoming more prevalent? **You're effectively using coin-join as a way to create composite transactions for a purpose that goes beyond privacy.**

*Andreas Antonopolous*: Yes absolutely. I believe in the long term we're going to see the vast majority of transactions migrate to Lightning channels. **Therefore every transaction you do on-chain, you're using the opportunity to bootstrap a channel, fund a channel, increase the funding of a channel, rebalance a channel, whatever you’re doing.** We're going to see a lot more complex transactions that involve multiple different steps.

Bitcoin’s dumb contracts are dumb-as-rocks contracts, which is why they can deliver more security, as there is not much room to do fancy things. **It's really interesting how even with a simple scripting language you can build some very sophisticated operations.**

ehrrnf5,jonald_fyookball,1,"I usually don't comment on u/Hernzzzz posts, because he seems to have an agenda to malign Bitcoin Cash with no regard for intellectual honesty.

However, I will address this one.  It is true that Hal Finey suggested second layers very early, in contrast to Satoshi.  I acknowledged this in my [article](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/by-far-the-biggest-crypto-scam-ever-and-its-still-happening-a23ed102d039).

But opinions are just opinions, whether they are Satoshis or Hals or whoever.  I am aware enough to have my own informed opinion and I believe in on-chain scaling.  But more importantly, the fact of the matter is that there really haven't been good second layer proposals that keep the permissionless p2p cash nature of Bitcoin entact.  

The best way to do ""second layers"" is actually just altcoins.  

If you're going to split up the security, might as well have each coin have its own set of miners and its own value based on security and its other properties.  

The sidechain idea attempts to create federations of miners but with no clear economic model.  But at least it would be more feasible than Lightning Network, which is both highly centralized and [difficult to use even for nerds.](https://medium.com/andreas-tries-blockchain/bitcoin-lightning-network-1-can-i-compile-and-run-a-node-cd3138c68c15)",2019-03-05 00:28:07

I'm not sure but whatever it is i am focused on all my other holdings from now on as i have what i need from ETN anyway. I like ETN because they are all focused on bringing noobs into crypto and making things simple and safe for them, they focus on the bare minimum and basics. They are still amoung the worst in technology but it really dont matter because again the project is as basic as it gets. 
Many of my other holdings have far better tech for niche markets but behave like gold digging sluts essentially, bending over waiting for daddy bitcoin to pump them up their backside, whoring themselves out to any exchange with that high volume. ETN is 100% focused on its ecosystem and bringing as many noobs into cryptocurrency as possible which is what is badly needed in this space.

This is why the price now while bad is no big concern as it gives a rather healthy outlook on who is actually using the project.

Here is one example from 3rd Jan 2018:

 

&gt;\\18. The total market cap of blockchain-based digital assets will exceed **$2 trillion** U.S. dollars by January 1, 2019.  
&gt;  
&gt;“New Car, Caviar, Four Star Daydream” — Pink Floyd  
&gt;  
&gt;The **price of ether will exceed $2,000 in 2018**. Ether will continue to outperform bitcoin, and the total market cap of ether will exceed that of bitcoin in 2018. Bitcoin’s governance issues, reluctance to evolve, and extremely high fees could lead it to its demise. Bitcoin Cash has a serious chance of eclipsing Bitcoin. The market cap of Filecoin will exceed that of bitcoin by 2023.

Kind of crazy to me that $2,000/ETH seems very conservative at this point. I honestly think $500B market cap for ETH (roughly $5,000/ETH) is a pretty reasonable target for 1/1/19 given everything that's in the pipeline. Hell, confirmation of ETH futures alone could send us past $2k in the next couple of months.

ehzgl3n,igadjeed,1,"&gt;  Then it dropped by over a third

At this point it all makes sense. A 51% attack is not viable because the ""spare"" retired hashing power is not actually available  

What if the price dropped to $1?  
The economics would push the hash rate down by more than 99%, not just a third. All the 1600-watt ASIC miners would be retired, written off. The remaining miners would be buying those $10 USB erupter ASICs and mining for pennies, or mining for a loss of a few pennies. Somebody with 100 S15 Antminers (and sufficient power ready to go) would easily be able to 51% attack and double-spend  
This is where it gets to hard to speculate  
If Bitcoin is only worth $1, would there be sufficient liquidity to create transactions with high enough value to make any profit from double-spending?  

This scenario is similar to the Bitcoin Gold double-spend incident. The attack was possible because a wealthy operator had early access to new ASIC miners when the Bitcoin Gold mining hash power was 100% GPU. One person running new ASICs was easily able to overpower the existing GPU miners. There was enough liquidity to defraud exchanges for several hours, by double-spending  

To your comment about exchanges  
Not all transactions occur on exchanges  
Also, there are enough no-KYC exchanges to run a 51% attack double-spend by selling Bitcoin for Litecoin, then spending the same Bitcoin to the attacker's wallet in the parallel chain. The attacker then owns the purchased Litecoin and the self-spent Bitcoin. The exchange loses. If it's a P2P exchange, the Litecoin sellers lose",2019-03-07 19:07:03

&gt; The next halving is estimated to be May 2020, meaning that the uptrend will begin in May of this year

ei0xhnz,cm9kZW8K,1,"&gt; Your second point is semi-valid so I'll address it. Looks like Dollar Tree ($DLTR) was the best one over the past ten years, with an 845% return over that time. https://investorplace.com/2016/04/the-10-best-stocks-of-the-past-10-years/

Interestingly, that list didnt hold up well. 

While DLTR has a nice 22% annual return over the last 10 years, over the last five it has only seen 
12.8% annual.

PCLN doesnt exist any more so its hard to measure. The second best, REGN, has a nice 40% 10 year annual return, but only 5% annual return over the last five years. 

The entire list is full of stocks highly inflated as part of the run up since 2009, so its very difficult to tell what their real lasting returns will look like. 

When the stock market bubble pops, it will become increasingly clear that nothing else has bitcoin's long term stability of value. It should perform much like a whole planet index fund, ultimately. 

Some people seems to be unable to analyze or consider bitcoin unemotionally.

ei4uj5c,where-is-satoshi,1,"Bitcoin BCH 0-conf is safe. Like anything it is not *perfectly* safe. The important question is; is BCH 0-conf *safe enough* for its role? The answer is yes and 0-conf has been used effectively by Bitcoin BCH since the Genesis block. It is used effectively by every merchant I know. Thus, it doesn't need to overcome technical hurdles as you wrongly imply. That is just you being disingenuous.

Dash isn't perfectly safe but likely it is safe enough too. I could be equally as disingenuous and say that to make Dash safer will require technical hurdles that have to be overcome.

\&gt; A bch 0 conf magically doesn't need miners. And it magically doesn't  need to be spread through the network. Magic makes it faster than  lightning. LOLZ.

Again you are being disingenuous. BCH does need miners to confirm transactions but as the unconfirmed transactions are broadcast across the network they lock each node's mempool against a double spend along the way. This mechanism very quickly adds a significant degree of safety which along with easy detection of a double-spend frauds, make an unconfirmed BCH transaction quite safe for most uses.

I also stand by my statement that a BCH 0-conf transaction is faster than the lightning network transaction for the reasons stated in 2. I can safely say no crypto is faster simply because BCH TX is an unacknowledged broadcast. A Dash transaction is not faster for example. Other cryptos may *match* BCH but none can exceed it.

Bitcoin BCH is fast, cheap and reliable and designed to become the global currency. BCH is armed with the very same pre-blockstream properties that grew Bitcoin to be 96.5% of all crypto by market cap. I like that Bitcoin BCH is the whitepaper Bitcoin.",2019-03-09 20:59:10

ei4uq1p,binarygold,1,"A comment asking about which coin had a premine neglected to mention that Bitcoin Cash (aka. BCH, BAB, Bcash) also had a sort of ""premine"". Bitmain was manipulating the hashpower/difficulty after the fork so they can mine lots of blocks quickly. This is why the BCH chain is 6,700 blocks ahead of Bitcoin. That's 83,750 coins! I think that qualifies as a well masqueraded pre-mine. This will bite BCH in the proverbial ass because halving will now arrive sooner, which means profitability will be cut in half for miners, which means some miners will migrate back to mining to Bitcoin instead of BCH, which means the security will drop on BCH and thus it will be prone to attacks. More on this later.

This manipulation created wild oscillations of difficulty and block times, which made BCH unpredictable and useless, so they had to stop it and fork the chain again, so the difficulty can adjust faster to hashpower.

This created a dangerous code change for BCH, because it makes the potential spiral of death scenario possible, where falling price reduces hashpower, which reduces security, which scares investors and thus reduces price further. This cycle goes on until both the price and hashpower potentially goes to zero. Not in practice though. There are ideological coin holders who will not sell at any price, and will buy more and more as the price drops.

This scenario is less of a risk on Bitcoin because the hashrate would only drop every \~2 weeks, so the security stays high for days/weeks until markets can recover and thus the hashrate won't drop further down. On Bitcoin we have a different kind of risk, which could happen if price and thus hashrate suddenly dropped by a huge amount like \~70%. In this situation, it would take 6 weeks for the difficulty to drop, and the number of transactions processed will be only 1/3 of normal, which could create chaos with fees going stratospheric. However, such a sudden drop is very unlikely to happen, while BCH's gradual spiral of death scenario is a realistic scenario, and can be observed to be happening in the last few months already.

On top of this issue, when BCH's hashrate and price are relatively low for example $40 and &lt;1% of hashrate, some bad actors with existing or rented miners can first short BCH, and then 51% attack the chain with just 1% of hashpower for a short while. This way, they can profit from the falling prices. At this point exchanges will stop accepting withdrawals and deposits, which will reduce prices even more. This will make it increasingly unprofitable to mine BCH even for the remaining ideological miners.

This is not an unprecedented scenario. The Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) fork did this recently and the price of BCH indeed crashed drastically, and virtually all transactions seized for a long time. The creation of BSV coins at least gave some value back to BCH holders. However, a malicious attacker may not continue mining the competing forked chain, instead start multiple forked chains over and over confusing everybody about what chain to follow, destroy confidence in the BCH chain, and make it impossible to transact on BCH for the fear or replay attacks. A similar attack happened to a low hashpower coin Bitcoin Gold (BTG) in May 2018. Subsequently BTG went from $80 to $25. And it never recovered. Now it's like $12 only.

Right now, BCH holders have to trust that the two big bag holders and miners: Bitmain and Ver will protect the chain no matter how much it costs them against such attackers like they did against the BSV fork, which they failed to prevent at the end. There is no incentive for any other miners to stay on the side of these two entities to protect a dying chain. If any of the two big guys quits at any point during an attack, or more attackers come on board just for the heck of it, the BCH coin will be virtually dead within 24 hours.",2019-03-09 21:04:01

And then you enter the real world, and your employers expect a university to know certain things.... which you never learned, because “you weren’t curious about them”. 

Your projects and ideas will therefore likely either fail or have massive unintended consequences, because you were never taught about all the aspects which you have to take into account. The best way to learn this is through systematic education, not “learning things you are curious about”.

Take Bitcoin. The blockchain is a relatively clever and useful idea. But Bitcoin itself is a complete failure, in part due to the founder’s questionable philosophy and complete lack of understanding of basic economics (a deflationary currency is being used as a store of value instead of as a means of payment.... who would have thought? /s). Also, it’s doing considerable harm to our entire planet because the founder never bothered to consider that electricity use might be a factor.

&gt;	and the professors know basically everyone in berlin.

Newsflash: a few IT savvy hipsters in a co-working space is not “everyone in Berlin”. 

&gt;	A lot of students, including me, already founded their first startups (I know that sounds like a hype thing) during our studies.

Another newsflash: anyone who can fill out a form can form a startup. The trick is to actually *run* a startup, and run it *successfully*.

&gt;	The founder, thomas bachem is a cool person

When looking at the traits of a good university president, I would have gone with “able administrator”, “knows a lot about education”, and “has contacts in a broad range of sectors”. But I suppose “knows people in the Berlin startup bubble” and “is cool” will do in a pinch. /s 

I’ll be honest: CODE is not a university, as they don’t seem to teach you anything. It’s you’re essentially paying 30 grand to have a desk in an open plan office with a foosball table, where you can chat with your fellow students about your dreams and ideas. Sounds fairly pleasant (a bit like summer camp for adults) - but doesn’t actually prepare you for life in any meaningful way. Having a university degree means that you’re supposed to be able to practice a profession, and that means understanding it and all its facets. CODE is turning out a bunch of dilettantes with good ideas but little to back it up. ",2019-03-09 18:21:32

Bitcoin would be much more successful if the community had stuck together and tried to work through the problems, rather than splitting off into multiple competing currencies.

The powers that be love the divide and conquer strategy, and it worked perfectly in this case. 

It's hard to determine the true motives of the thought leaders in these movements. Quite sad actually.

ei4pn6z,Greamee,1,"&gt; You can still send non-RBF payments on Bitcoin, and they will have the same blockchain security as on BCH; none. 

That's not true. If you receive a 0conf transaction as a full node, you can see whether the UTXO is still unspent. If you wait 3 seconds before giving a client their goods, that gives you time to wait to see if a rival TX has come in.

  
If you do this, the only significant attack vector left is the miner bribe. How can you call that security ""none""?

You can't possible believe 100% of miners will collude 100% of the time to defraud merchants?

I know you want this and I want it too. I want one more good, hard fuck before I'm a married woman and if you don't do it, I'll tell your sweet wife exactly how many time I've seen you eyeing me. It turns you on to be fucking your best friend's fiancée, doesn't it? I cum really fucking hard on your cock and then demand that you cum in me as well. If you don't give me one last, big sticky creampie, I'll tell your wife everything. You fill me up with your cum and as it drips out of me, I remark that this was an awfully nice wedding present.

It's not like you're putting your dick to good use anyway, wasting all your time jerking it to weird porn online, cumming onto your grubby sheets several times a day. No, you'll be much better off under my control. At this point, no woman will want your cock anyway.

ei5vmlx,Sporklin,1,"&gt;If we want to make dogecoin develop rapidly all over the world, it is necessary to make the price rise rapidly. 

Pardon? I am curious why you think this given we already have the highest functional engagement rates in the space; and have had them for several years now. We move a higher percentage of our marketcap than any other asset in the space, and that movement unlike the majority of other assets is not going to trading/exchange platforms/speculation. Most days you have to combine several of the ""top"" assets to hit our moving percentage. At the moment we are 15% of MC moved in the past 24 with less than 50% going to markets. Bitcoin compared moved 5% of it's MC, and has had nearly 4x it's movement sent across the markets. (See these are those funny times where Bitcoin shows the actual depth of it's asset availability on the existing open market, nuking any idealized supply v demand argument into the ground.)

[Bitinfocharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/) Shows assets compared. [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) Daily market tracking.  ^(I usually do the math exact myself, but people screamed it was pretentious.)

&gt;Don't tell me any general principles.

The price has nothing to do with the functionality or the developmental function of an asset, nor has it ever. The only thing that moves the markets, is money; Dogecoin is tied to BTC for the primary pair point at the moment (we have switched between USDT, BTC, CNY, ETH)

Just as a note, given you did not want principles. Perhaps look into what happened to BTC as it's price rose. It lost vendors, merchants, usage, and functional engagement means in rather public ways. This at the basis given it has happened every time instability entered into the situation, runs counter to your premise. People accepting cryptocurrencies was stability as during market swings they have ended up on both sides of the swing in good also bad ways.

&gt;The ultimate goal of block chain technology is to let the holders obtain wealth freedom and family happiness first.

If I might ask, where did you get this ideal? Block chain technology is a ledger system, in many cases one that is slightly more resilient against data tampering. (NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.) The assets you engage with, are secondary to the system itself as the system exists still with no asset on them. If I might suggest further, look into just what the technology is because if you are diving in hoping to get wealthy you are doing to hit a brick wall like many others have.",2019-03-10 05:42:17

As somebody in the military, it was so easy to convince the new guys who showed up in the barracks to be a part of it, and then explain to them to branch out to friends and family back home, where ever that is. I got suckered into it and within a month, realized how fucking stupid it was. And then having to live with this room mate who was always talking up some bullshit on the phone with somebody whenever he had any sort of free time drove me up the fucking wall. He was addicted to it and it made me sick. So sick, that I actually moved to a different room on the other side of the barracks. The internet in our room was under my name so I figured I would move to a different room and take the internet with me as a way to fuck him because he needed to have the internet in order to do is MLM bullshit.

eia1z4c,Etovia,1,"&gt; I think it is more honest that pretending that LN routing is perfect.

No one claims it is ""perfect"".
 
&gt; It remain that there significant challenges going toward larger scale with this routing algo.
&gt; At the current scale it works.

It is a solved problem in computing, George shown the information in.:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ay8uqz/if_liquidity_and_routing_is_solved/ei0cjig/

everyone knows this. It is only /r/btc whih creates **false narrative** that it's some grand problem. Not sure are you one of the bamboozled ones, or the one working to spread such incorrect information, but either way for anyone reading this - just see above.
 
&gt;     It will be improved to work even better, and to faster find alternative routes, but it is usable today, and was in fact for months.
&gt; It depend on how much failure rate you are willing to accept.

Failure means retrying few seconds later (it waits max 10 seconds before I can try again), so yeah - no big problem - and as linked above this is not some grand problem.
 
&gt; &gt;     Look outside of this false information channel or test things.
&gt; No thank you, no.

Well, all right, keep reading false news. No wonder you might have been bamboozled too that his problem is unsolvable and therefore BCH has any use case there (but it is, so it doesn't).
 
&gt; No way I buy any BTC anymore, I don’t want to pay ten’s of $ to close a channel and cash out at the next fee event.
&gt; BTC is not for me.

BTC might not be for everyone how ever this argument, same as other ones being flown here, is just false.

&gt;     Sometimes paymen will not go through then no big deal do it again in a second, but almost always it will.
&gt; Well if the payment failed because no route was available, trying again will not help.

If there is really no route at all, this means that the recipient received maximum amount of money, so it's time for him to spend it back (send LN and receive onchain his big payout, or send to LN exchange and get fiat, or buy services for Bitcoin - or just open new channel, or cash out onchain and then open new one etc).

The original comment's content was as follows:

---

&gt; its bitcoin core with some differences, mimblewimble looks the most interesting as it allows confidential transactions and brings with it fungibility. which imo is a huge downside to btc and other payment cryptos i.e. you dont wnat people to know where your UTXO came from.
&gt; 
&gt; that said, there are plenty of coins doing this and have better privacy features e.g. monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; at the end of the day, all this means nothing unless the coin is used for its intended purpose. payment. otherwise the crypto is worthless. 
&gt; 
&gt; there are articles arguing that transaction volume for payment is declining for crypto
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/bitcoin-s-use-in-commerce-keeps-falling-even-as-volatility-eases
&gt; 
&gt; think about using crypto for general payment over a credit card. why would you?
&gt; 
&gt; pros of using a creditcard presuming you are financially prudent and pay your balance at the end of the month like i do, so no interest charge:
&gt; 
&gt; - its free to use (bar credit cards that give benefits and incur an annual fee)
&gt; - the merchant eats any fee
&gt; - if the merchant screws you over, you call up the bank and get a refund, free
&gt; - if you lose your credit card and someone spends the money, you get reimbursed and you get a new credit card
&gt; - no need to be your own bank
&gt; - instant payment
&gt; - your fiat is depreciating, so you may as well spend it for goods and services, otherwise invest it.
&gt; 
&gt; cons for using fiat over crypto:
&gt; 
&gt; - you want to buy something dodgey e.g. drugs, but fiat will be directly tied to your identity. thus the birth of darknets. 
&gt; 
&gt; - you want to hide money from the government
&gt; 
&gt; - you want to pay someone without tax (note that the recipient has to turn that money back into fiat, if they do so they could do cahs for monero for example)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; cons of using crypto for payment
&gt; - it costs money to acquire btc/ltc/bch etc lets presume 1% but often its higher
&gt; - you have to go onto an exchange, buy the crypto, move it into a hot wallet to spend 
&gt; - you have to be your own bank, securing your wallet, backing up the private key. lose your hot wallet on your phone without backing up your private key? too bad, its gone now.
&gt; - someone steals your private key, again too bad, money gone
&gt; - crypto is highly volatile, buy 100$ worth of bitcoin today, it might be worth 80$ in a few days
&gt; - merchant screws you over, youre not getting that bitcoin back
&gt; - as soon as you spend your crypto, your wallet address is known to the merchant, they can see if you are a btc millionare. if you have a cold storage wallet with the jackpot and have a few hot wallets you move money into, its easily traceable via a block explorer
&gt; 
&gt; the pros are using crypto are the same as the cons for using fiat.",2019-03-11 09:35:23
ei8l0rp,Fly115,1,"A few things mention.

1. You don't need to wait for these times to do a bitcoin transaction. Use a wallet that lets you set the fee amount, if the transaction is not urgent simply set a low fee (even 1sat/byte will do) and it will clear as soon as the backlog dies out. 
2. This is just based on mempool over the last week. You can check at any time if there is a backlog by going to [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h)

According to ZeroHedge, the blockchain-focused exchange-traded fund will include upon launch a portfolio of 48 different companies with exposer to blockchain technology.

Some given examples were that of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which supplies cryptocurrency mining machine manufacturers with chips, and the CME Group, the first regulated US exchange to launch bitcoin futures. It’ll have a 65 basis points management fee, and include other firms like Apple, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).

The head of ETF equity product management of Invesco in Europe, Chris Mellor, reportedly stated the potential for “blockchain to boost earnings was often not reflected in the share prices of companies such as Rio Tinto, the mining company that owns hydroelectric assets that could be harnessed for cryptocurrency mining. The report reads:

The ETF will initially invest in a portfolio of 48 companies based on a proprietary scoring system developed by Elwood Asset Management, a specialist crypto investment boutique backed by Alan Howard, co-founder of the Brevan Howard hedge fund.

The CEO of Elwood, Bin Ren, noted potential applications for blockchain technology go beyond cryptocurrencies, as per his words we’re “beginning to see the technology being used by financial services companies in particular, but we expect greater application of blockchain technology across a wide range of industries.”

There are other blockchain-focused ETFs on the market, although most have attracted a relatively small amount of capital. Per ZeroHdge the largest one, Amplify Transformation Data Sharing ETF, has $110 million in assets.

Notably investors have shown interest in Wall Street firms betting on cryptocurrencies and the nascent technology behind them. A group of 14 publicly listed companies with exposure to the crypto ecosystem compiled by Yahoo Finance, as covered, was outperforming the S&amp;P 500 earlier this year.

eiacwfy,MrRGnome,1,"The proliferation and creation of educational materials for Bitcoin already is some of the best in any open source community. Bitcoin is an excellent example of an open source project with unpaid educators and evangelicals.

You're right that it's incredibly difficult to educate and we aren't doing a good enough job even if we are doing such a good job that we compete with multimillion dollar advertising competitors. We need to be doing better than even the best.

I don't agree we are ""doubly doomed"" but I completely agree it could be our doom which is why I'm talking about it. Full nodes play an important security role. We need educated, technically and politically aware node runners and it will always be an uphill battle to make new ones. We saw how important node runners were during the BCH fork for both the network and individual users. 

&gt;I understand that I am not trusting anyone because I can randomly cross validate the info from multiple nodes.

You understand incorrectly. Polling nodes to come to consensus is exactly the kind of model susceptible to Sybil attacks PoW was created to avoid. It's a perfectly reasonable stop gap for many uses cases as I continue to note, but the trust model of SPV wallets are far from equivalent to full nodes.

I can't stress enough that it's not anyones fault that people don't understand this. Not only disseminating this information but getting the base technical literacy among the general population to make informed decisions using this information is possibly an impossible task. I have hope that since the once thought impossibly complex mechanisms of the internet are now broadly understood by internet using populations we might find educational success too. Even though our task may be more difficult we can achieve similar results in the coming decades. If that doesn't happen we may see the security for the average non-full node Bitcoin user degrade as we approach scale.",2019-03-12 01:56:41

I'd be all over the chance to bet that Fidelity can profit from btc. I'd bet on Bakkt. What a great way to profit on FOMO! I'd love to invest in the ASIC makers. The only people who won't be profiting are the hodlers. They're the ones who are going to be padding other pockets. All but the biggest miners are going to get screwed. You'll end up with a few big pools and then the decentralization is gone. The governance boards fighting and creating ever more forks. BTC, BTC  cash, gold, sv, abc. You need a web site to keep up with the forks.

If one of the brokerages sets up a BTC-USD ETF, I'm gonna short that damn thing so fast it'll make your head spin. I _know_ the crypto market is full of people that I can punish for my monetary gain. I'm gonna be part of teaching them a hard lesson and Ima rub their faces in it as I do. Problem is there's going to be a whole bunch of other people trying to do the same thing. I wanted an ETF last February. I missed out on a lot of cash. A _lot_. Because I wouldn't risk my money on crooked and manipulated exchanges. But give me an SEC approved ETF and we're gonna tear open a whole new can of whoop ass and short BTC down to about $100.

It's a (essentially) a zero sum game. No one is using it. You've never bought anything with a bitcoin I bet, nor your wife nor me nor anyone we know.  It isn't usable as a currency - unless you're buying drugs on the black market. It's too slow. It's too expensive. It doesn't scale. It's not green. It's manipulated. It's volatile. This isn't a currency. It's a modern day tulip. Yeah, I'd love to make money off it but not by _buying_ the tulips - I want so damn bad to be able to short them I can taste it.

&gt; Let me tell you all a story.
&gt; In 2009 bitcoin was created. It was the first digital currency and was valued at $0.001 per bitcoin. A lot of people invested in this technology and acquired a lot of coins. In 2017 the value of bitcoin rose to about $20k per bitcoin. Investors who had just 100,000 bitcoins made so much money from this. A lot of people missed this train and wished they can travel back in time to invest. If you had such a wonderful opportunity with a new coin , will you miss this wonderful opportunity?

eienur3,jstolfi,1,"&gt; what if we had some decentralized protocol, kind of like Bitcoin, that was very fast at coming to relative consensus about what transactions should be included in a block, but which takes strictly less effort to overturn than n Bitcoin confirmations for any value of n &gt; 0.  Would it make no sense to try to leverage this protocol for as of yet unconfirmed transactions to try to get some guarantees around their finality, then leverage Bitcoin itself once they've been confirmed to get stronger guarantees on their finality?

Well, that does not seem to address the problem of deciding which  of two conflicting transactions is the ""right"" one (in the sense of ""honest"").  Such pre-confirmation mechanism (PCM) would have no more information than the miners about that attribute.  

In fact, it would have less information, because it would not know what the miners have seen and what will they do.  Double-spend attacks are generally based in manipulating the miners algorithms and exploiting the lack of that information.

Which brings in a more serious problem: what happens if the miners' choice is not that of the PCM?  If the miners can disagree with the PCM, the PCM may be worse than useless, because it gives false confidence to the merchant.  If the miners are bound to agree with the PCM, then the miners and the bitcoin protocol are redundant.

Every miner wants to create blocks that are accepted by the majority of other miners.  Thus they are as motivated as they could be to agree on the choice between two conflicting transactions.   Those who end up making the minority choice will already be punished by losing their work.  Still, totally ""honest"" miners cannot avoid occasional disagreement, especially when the conflicting pair is created and submitted by a malicious client.  And -- once again -- the majority choice may not be the ""right"" one.",2019-03-13 12:47:08

&gt; Might it not, at least in principle, make sense to try to combine the two approaches?

Not sure on this. Part of Satoshi's genius was the immutability of POW. The critical point being that zero-conf transaction don't yet have any accumulated POW. Therefore, not immutable by design. If the only way to increase security of zero-conf is by decreasing security of POW (as you're suggesting), then I would stick with the staus-quo.

Why I'm optimistic: Working with regulatory agencies, they're well funded comparative to other projects of similar market cap, and consistent/quality development to name a few. The entire crypto market, even the top projects are going to have a slow grind back to previous highs or even close. At this point, anyone who wants out of Lisk is long gone.. The difference with ETH for example is that ERC20 projects were funded with ether and many are still holding and are cash poor. These projects who thought they had X in 2017 for business and product dev now have 10x less or more. ETH is going to have a hard time reaching an ATH when they have a so much more selling pressure. I hope there will be greater potential upside that buyers will recognize with Lisk when their product comes to market. We may not see consensus on a market reversal for another year or two..but Lisk will weather the storm financially and I believe they will have a shiny new product prepared when the market is ready.

Particl is specifically working on making that process of buying and selling anything online and with crypto fee-less (at least for buyers, vendors need to pay a few cents to list a product). Bonus point is you can do it in an untraceable way and not have to share your precious personal data to a marketplace operator (that will do with it god knows what).   


It's obviously early, crypto in general is early. But Particl's trying to build a solid solution and provide a missing piece of the puzzle so that crypto can thrive as something else than just a speculation asset.

BTT is probably the most interesting altcoin to me right now as far as use case goes.  Its from the BitTorrent company, but it is worth noting that the BitTorrent company was recently sold and does not have a lot of weight or love from the torrent/piracy community.  The vast majority of people downloading torrents are not using BitTorrent software, but third party torrent software.

The new owners have created a token, BTT, that will be linked to all \*.torrent files, even if the torrent file originated from a computer not using BitTorrent's newest software.  The use case of BTT is that you can increase your download speeds on your torrents by paying seeders to prioritize you over other leechers.  

Torrents are still widely used way to send files especially in piracy.  Sites like thepiratebay have been targeted by government, anti-piracy groups, and regulators and thus have become less reliable and efficient.  On public sites like thepiratebay there is no rewards for seeding files: files that are not popular often go totally unseeded despite some demand.  Also because there is no reward for seeding files, even popular files download slower than they could. BTT token could dramatically change that and thus change the entire torrent and piracy scene.

Since thepiratebay and other public sites are slow and under attack, most torrents are now hosted on private sharing sites.  Users on these sites are required to have an invite from an existing member to join.  Seeding and leeching is strictly monitored and users who do not seed are punished in order to make downloads faster.  These sites operate by taking money in exchange for leeching and their costs are extremely high.  They are taking a huge cut and acting as middle men.  For example, IPTorrents is one of the most popular private sites and an invite to iptorrents is very sought after.  But IPTorrents charges $10\~ for just 5 gb of downloading.  This forces users to choose between paying big money or having to seed from their computer, which makes them more susceptible to being caught by their ISP and anti media piracy groups.

BTT will circumvent the need for these money-hungry private torrent websites by creating a peer-to-peer economy.  It will be much cheaper and easier to use than these private torrent websites because there are so many seeders driving the supply and demand instead of one or two big sites in charge of pricing.

The only thing that remains to be seen is, does BitTorrent the company have enough talent to make a good torrent program that people will want to use and integrates BTT?

We must ask that because another company could create a torrent program that does the same thing but uses Bitcoin or another coin.  In fact I have been following JoyStream for years now because it was promising to do just that, but it has fallen flat and never created anything of substance.

I think that where JoyStream has failed, BitTorrent will succeed, but like any altcoin, investing a huge gamble.",2019-03-14 08:26:54

im all for ending un-checked capitalism, but anyone who believes that a virtual currency is ging to replace fiat  currency better be ready to fight every major developed nation in the world.  The federal banking system and the IMF would have a field day with those who would want to challenge them. like it or not, that's the fact.   


just ask china and russia how it went for them. massive inflation and massive inflation. Turns out you cant ust ignore the world market and expect other countries to still value your currency.

eiisy8i,supersystemic-ly,1,"&gt;History shows nothing like that. 100 toddlers aren't smarter than Einstein. Sure, swarm intelligence is a thing, but I see no reason to believe that it will cause a superintelligence. How could a swarm intelligence solve the Goldbach conjecture, make a movie or invent Bitcoins?

Actually, every scientist, mathematician, academic on the planet learns from others thanks to internet technologies and platforms for sharing experimental knowledge in academic settings. Did Satoshi create bitcoin or was is created by a community of libertarians and the pre-bitcoin technologies they released, tested and learned from? It seems to me Satoshi was in the right place and the right time and learned from all those other innovations. Intelligence doesn't exist in a vacuum does it? Swarm effects of intelligence have always been with us and are becoming increasingly powerful as our technologies increasingly merge. It's plausible that this will continue and lead superintelligence. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  There are many serious scientists and intellectuals who are genuinely worried about superintelligence. Calling them ""fear mongers"" is a disingenuous debate tactic. 

Yes, I read all of their arguments, including Bostrom's Superintelligence and much control/alignment academic works. And I have not heard a single, compelling argument as to how superintelligence is an existential threat. (eg. Paperclip optimizers that decimate all life. Happiness optimizers via surgical interventions.)  These sound like a potential for narrowly-focused AIs to cause some damage, but not existential threats of a superintelligence. Happy to hear from you some plausible examples. 

My ""fear mongers"" comment was for all of the media organization that fan the flames anytime an academic speaks on the subject. Do a reverse image search with a terminator or robocop image and you will find plenty of articles.

If everyone follows the honest first-seen policy, then the system will produce the desired result: robust hardness against unconfirmed doublespends for casual in-person transactions, along with (of course) increasing confidence against reversal with each block produced.

To the degree that the miners disregard the policy that is in the interests of P2P ecash, the user experience suffers, merchant adoption becomes more difficult, and ultimately coin utility and price are lower.

It is true of course that the incentive system, the way Satoshi left it, doesn't cover this edge case of dishonest miners who accept fraud RBF transactions.  Is it so distressing to you that someone would want to discuss it? ",2019-03-15 02:27:39

The reason we dont care about price is that it doesnt stabilize downward... 

The other Fiat questions and comparisons to current money... Bitcoin and Gold bugs believe that the FIAT money will have to be backed by SOMETHING again. It was backed up until the 70s by gold... there is only 8 trillion in gold supply on earth though.

This is only sideways as defined by cryptocurrency's insane volatility.

In between each spike is constant organic growth.

Those spike downs are getting more and more painful than the last for those people. I read somewhere that the last one was 2000 BTC to spike down, and it was recovered in 5 minutes to 80% of the pre-spike price with 200 BTC total. 

Nobody is selling anymore. 

That's how the next bull starts.

eim5a2s,Roxolan,1,"Last night I was having the usual nightmare where I'm back in high school for a math test and all the formulas have slipped out of my mind, so I turn to chat with a forgotten friend-

And then it struck me. I'm *back in high school!* Quick, uh, Apple shares, bitcoin, 9/11, Fukushima, I don't remember enough daily news to immediately prove foreknowledge but I do know a *startling* amount of future Magic the Gathering trivia, maybe I should get vouched for by *Wizards of the Coast*...

(Then I tried to leave the classrom and spent the rest of the dream in a pointless chase scene with the math teacher. Can't win them all.)

eiokcgu,chernobyl169,1,"&gt; Its a pretty simple concept, you don't have to explain it to me. And as I've said before, signaling in blocks is fine but in the end is meaningless. Miners can coordinate all they want, but what counts is the actual blocks mines according to those rules. And yes, it would be crazy for a miner to start mining larger blocks without concensus, and this is quite simply the reason why both xt, bu and 2x failed miserably. Not because of bad excuses like reddit moderation.

This entire comment completely misses the fact that signaling and consensus are related. You keep going on as though signaling is meaningless, even though the software that generated the signaling was designed to automatically activate upon a consensus signal. Upon activation, those blocks would have been mined immediately and with disregard for any minority chain fork - per design. This signal was not achieved due to interference by bitcoin-core.

&gt; &gt; [your] argument is hilariously wrong

&gt; you are hilariously wrong

Really? Are we middle school children in a playground here? I refuse to attempt to debate what you have to say here. I'll just re-iterate that the only thing that has rendered Bitcoin hard to change, historically, has been a single, specific, and associated subset of bitcoin enthusiasts and developers that are now completely detached from cryptocurrency users at large. They certainly didn't find it hard to change, once majority opposition had been successfully obstructed. I am only repeating these points because they are pertinent, and refuse to further debate if you continue to behave like a child.

&gt; Segwit took a year to activate with businesses and miners playing all sorts of games.

So you are not oblivious to the social manipulation, after all - therefore I am forced to conclude you are a witting participant and therefore have ill intent toward cryptocurrency.

&gt; You should learn to think for yourself. See, its that easy to sling shit at each other.

We are done here; you've proven yourself to be arguing in bad faith and with the intent to cause damage to the conversation. I will not feed you any further - misinformed people I am willing to manage, no matter how intent on being wrong they may be, but those who deliberately derail discussions with lies, obfuscation, deceit, and personal attacks are unworthy of being included in the discourse. You have been blocked so that I don't have to be exposed to your asinine drivel ever again.

I do think for myself. In fact, I think *critically* and *self-examine* all the time. It is more than just *thinking*. I'm talking about examination of assertions, verification of evidence, independent investigation to come to conclusions, and most importantly! - the ability to recognize when ones' assumptions or given information is wrong.",2019-03-17 04:40:42

eiokzeh,blacksky8192,1,"It's actually really simple. You just use your daily wallet balance that shows you daily pnl. IRS doesn't give a fuck on how you report your gains. It just has to match what you deposited and what you made in the end of the year. Upload your bitmex wallet history as a csv file on whatever tax program you are using, and use bitcoin price at the end of the year and assume you cashed out on 12/31/2018 11:59:59. You don't have to report every single transaction since bitmex handles cfd-like derivatives. You just have to make sure you report your total pnl accurately, so even if you are to be audited, you can just show them your daily wallet balance as an easy proof. I personally never got audited and I've been using Bitmex for quite a while and made a lot of money. Even if you made millions of trades a day, all you have to do is just report the total pnl for that day. For example, if you made 3 XBT on a day by doing 400 trades, you report it as 3 XBT bought with 0 USD cost basis, since you practically 'earned' the XBT. Overall you will be left with about 400 trades to report in total if you traded every single day with multiple instruments. I did it this way for years and IRS was totally okay with it.",2019-03-17 04:49:09

&gt;The thing that matters far more than any of the technical uses of Malleability is what malleability breaks.

The central aspect of this is that in its true form, it can capture other systems while remaining challenging to capture itself.

Overledger isn't just about value atomic-swaps, it:

* Enables secure data-flow across multiple-chains: Ripple, Bitcoin, Ethereum... Within a months time: IOTA, Alastria and JP Morgan Quorum.
* Serves as an off-chain oracle and interface with legacy apps.
* Offers zero-knowledge, secure, cross-chain smart-contracts known as ""Treaty-contracts"" as developed in conjunction with [Hamburg HAW university](https://www.unlock-bc.com/news/2018-01-22/quant-network-announced-new-cross-chain-treaty-contracts-partnership-with-haw-hamburg-university-at-unlock-2018-dubai).
* Enables smart-contract execution on chains that don't support smart-contracts, like Bitcoin and soon [Red Belly Blockchain](https://redbellyblockchain.io/).
* Allows private / consortium DLT's to interface with permissionless chains, so for example a decentralised marketplace could have contracts to pass orders onto wholesalers without making the commission rates known. In this example end-users would pay in a supported cryptocurrency and the treaty-contract handles executes.
* Cloud based off-chain execution allows for IOT devices to defer processing to smart-contracts.
* Allows users to get interacting with blockchains with 3 lines of code, in 8 minutes or less. No need to setup own nodes in multiple geographical zones, configure firewalls, load-balancers etc.

eioh1wd,Cthulhooo,1,"Thank you for the comprehensive answer.

&gt; The attacker must secure the required hashpower and make a payment of tens of millions of dollars for some goods; and then, after the attack he must be able to put himself and the goods beyond the reach of the victim's cops. And must be able to spend again those coins at about their original value. 

Yes, this is the biggest hurdle with double spends. You need to find a perfect outlet to defraud as much money as possible in a short period of time and at the same time you need to be both able to reap tangible rewards sufficiently big to justify the cost and be untouchable. And it's funny that double spends might be enforced not by blockchain but by JST :D

It's not easy and it might be difficult to execute again, stores might demand huge block confirmations, exchanges might halt trading, you're gonna sit on this giant pile of equipment and overhead trying to find new ways to double spend while everyone is scrambling to protect themselves or maybe even undo or stop your attack.

&gt;I may be mistaken, but Litecoin uses a different PoW formula, based scrypt rather than SHA. In that case, BTC/BCH/BSV miners cannot mine it. One would need special rigs with special chips (which I believe are sold by Bitmain too -- with an ""L"" instead of ""S"" in the model number).

I was under impression that litecoin as a bitcoin fork uses sha but funnily enough I looked it up and it really doesn't. So a better example would be digibyte, it's a rank 36 coin with less than 4% hash rate of BCH and the same algorithm as BTC or BCH and yet I never heard about any double spend attacks (and this is something you'd hear about).

There are attacks rarely like Ethereum Classic double spend attack. But it's an ethash shitcoin that has very high risk of being ""nicehashable"" with sufficient money so attack doesn't even need an equipment, just enough money for a quick heist.

But back onto the main point, this exchange basically strengthens my belief that there is an overabundance of security when it comes to hash power of prominent coins to the point it's orders of magnitude more than you'd call ridiculous.

If you notice, no one is having to go out of their way to 'on-board' Bitcoin users. People find it themselves when they need it.

BTC is compelling for only one reason, and that is that it is leaderless and works great, is reliable and secure. When people need a way to exit the legacy financial stem for whatever reason, they find the solution in BTC.

Bcash will have to build something that people who need it can easily use and trust.

&gt; You are the one who's making extraordinary claims I'm going to need extraordinary evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't need you to repeat  that Obama and the FED are not connected which is a Preposterous statement to make in the first place. As the president literally nominates the chair of the Fed, and considering that at the time the Democrats have full control over the house the Senate and the presidency, essentially meaning Obama could have chosen anyone as the head, including an actual Progressive but he chose his crony buddies instead.

eirs6k9,Bitcoin1776,1,"It works the exact same.

ETH was $300 at one point and a Redditor campaigned for 1 ETH / block at that time, but the argument was made that $300 / block was less secure than $900 / block - and we should lock in 3 ETH block.

Today ETH is paying $280 / block, and the token has devalued - this is all due to issuing FAR, far too much ETH. Had ETH moved to 1 ETH / block 18 months ago, that would have saved 6,000,000 ETH from being sold on to the market - today that looks like $1 Billion (@ $140), but a more accurate estimate is that it was closer to $3 Billion that was put onto the market unnecessarily (avg price $500).

In short, preventing the sale of $3 Bil new ETH would have lead to greater network security AND a more robust ETH ecosystem, as the token would have sustained a higher value.

We have tried the printing a whole lot of new ETH thing, and it doesn't work. You print double or triple the tokens, and the price plummets EVEN MORE.

Miners in Bitcoin have always gotten more payments AFTER inflation reductions, and it will be the same for ETH once we cross over the Bitcoin threshold.

If you destroy the value the ETH token, ETH mining becomes worthless and the rest of the ETH ecosystems dies as well. We have tried printing billions of extra tokens and it doesn't work - people don't pay more for a thing just because you make a lot of it. We tried that, and it failed.

Well, even if the transaction fees aren’t that great, at least they are still profiting, right? I highly doubt it. When you consider energy costs, GPU and other parts depreciating among other costs, I doubt many will be making a profit unless a large corporation is able to secure massive amounts of GPUs to get better prices and locate their businesses in prime areas (such as Venezuela where electricity is super cheap), then you might be able to profit consistently. However I’m still highly doubtful that Bitcoin will take off as an actual currency or that it would be supported by large corporations or government.

The default in the Bitcoin client is to reject a transaction if it tries to spend a UTXO that has already been spent (whether confirmed or just simmering in the mempool).    So pools/cartels need to explicitly make the change that follows the behavior that you describe.

Are you the same nullc described in the article ""Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.""?

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/

&gt; We believe that it is likely that /u/4n4n4 aka /u/nullc was also aware of or involved in this attack based upon the suspicious timing and similarities of [CU-2]. 

&gt; So who posted that?

&gt; We have a surprisingly large amount of evidence indicating that 4n4n4 is /u/nullc, the CTO of Blockstream.
The biggest indicator we found is that nullc has the very frequent pattern-- of writing--his sentences with two dashes separating words. This by itself is somewhat rare, though we confirmed that he uses it more times than anyone else in the CN database, the much more unusual habit is using two dashes with no spaces on either side. The CN database stored 860,000 comments for us to compare with, and very quickly confirmed the similarities between the two. His history is littered with examples, but we also used the bitcoin-dev email list to confirm the unusual habit. Like 4n4n4, nullc also has examples of using this--specific pattern twice in one sentence, which was extremely rare in our searches.
But there were many more things we noticed. We found several examples of 4n4n4 picking up nullc's conversations and continuing them. One such case was 4n4n4's third comment ever. 4n4n4 also referenced many of nullc's writings and posts. 4n4n4 referenced this code change that originated from nullc multiple times. 4n4n4's [CU-2] comment edit used the words ""rbtc playbook,"" something our database confirmed was extremely rare but is a saying nullc likes.
And that was just the beginning:
	1	Very knowledgable about Bitcoin Core development &amp; the history of the scaling conflict.
	2	4n4n4 picked up a thread after many replies by nullc arguing that low fees and empty mempools are actually a problem.
	3	Just like nullc, 4n4n4 liked BIP148 but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.
	4	Seems to know an awful lot about nullc's life.
	5	Used the phrase ""Bitcoin's creator"", a major nullc trait previously documented
	6	Talks about nullc. A lot.
	7	Somehow knows who is working on what within Blockstream.
	8	And even responded directly to nullc in support of a claim nullc had made multiple times within that thread

eite3f6,NorahTheSexplorer,1,"### Girlfriend Experiences 

I'm Norah. I'm a girl figuring out her way in life who loves bending her body into shapes, writing fiction, dancing in her underwear, collecting odds and ends to use for art projects, acrobatics, learning, and discussing all manner of topics and conversations. I'm a life-long learner and dreamer, as well as a *very* quick study 😉.

Whether you just want to oggle my body as I contort myself (don't worry, I take *lots* of pics), talk politics, watch a movie on Netflix, or just get to know me. I have something to offer for everyone.

I'm a naturally outgoing, friendly person. I'm really easy to get along with, and I follow the first rule of life: Don't be an asshole, and we'll get along :).

I am a student, so please be aware that I'm not available 24/7. However, as my virtual partner in crime and significant other, you'll be my first priority as I'm available and able to interact throughout the day.

I don't pretend to be someone I'm not in GFEs. You'll get the best of me raw, unfiltered, and sexy as hell.

### Standard GFE Package (*The Girlfriend*) 

* $100 / 1 day  
* $150 / 3 days  
* $250 / 7 days  

*Get three weeks, get the fourth one free!* Includes 15 minutes of dedicated session time each day, as well as some other naughtiness interspersed throughout. Let's get to know each other in a completely organic way!

### Explicit GFE Package (*The Vixen*)  

* $150 / 1 day  
* $250 / 3 days  
* $400 / 7 days  

*Get three weeks, get the fourth one free!* Includes up to 30 minutes of sexting (1 day) or 60 minuets of sexting per day (3 or 7 days). More explicit pictures and sexiness throughout the day, as I show you how I positively drip sensuality and allure. Focused for those of you with a higher sex drive, who want to see more of my naughty side.

**Interested in something else?** Because GFEs are such an intimate service, I am happy to build a custom plan. Please [send me a PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=NorahTheSexplorer) with some idea of what you’d like, and I can get back to you with available possibilities.

###Custom Videos  

I love making custom content, and bringing your fantasies to life! I film using professional and natural lighting and a DSLR in 1080/30. You get your suits bespoke, so why wouldn't you customize your porn? Custom videos start at $75 for 5-8 minutes, but I have lots of packages available. 
[Learn more here](/r/norahsolano/wiki/customs)

###Custom Erotica

I'm a writer by trade, if you didn't already know, and my fiction is top-notch. I'm published, and I've been writing for the majority of my life. Now you have the chance to get a peek into how dirty my mind can get. *Want to know what you're getting into first? Send me a message to read a non-sexual writing sample.*

Erotica starts at $35 for a 1,000 word story, about enough to write a quick sex scene. But I offer [many different lengths](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorahSolano/wiki/erotica), so you can get whatever you'd like. Click that link for more info!

### Cock Rates 

Let me talk about your cock! I’ll go over your pictures, appearance, size, grooming, and some fun positions for the both of us in the most thorough cock rating you’ve ever had. A kik rating is $35 and delivered in 24 hours ($50 if you want it within an hour), though I have [other options available](/r/norahsolano/wiki/rate )

eite7rw,casey8918,1,"thank you so much for reaching out! I think your input would be extremely helpful--basically, I am just trying to paint a good picture of what bitcoin miners do. The questions I have are:
--How did you first get involved in bitcoin mining and why? Also curious to know more about how long you were a miner and why you quit.
--For you, was bitcoin mining essentially your primary job, a secondary job, or a hobby?
--How many hours per week on average did you devote to mining, and where did you like to do this work?
--Would you describe the process of mining in your own words?
--I’ve heard that many bitcoin miners go out of their way to keep their identities a secret, for privacy reasons. Is this true/is that something you tried to do, as well? If so, why would you say it is important to protect your privacy as a miner?
--What would you say was your ‘goal’ as a miner? Was it just something you liked to do, was it purely to accumulate more bitcoin, etc.?
Feel free to answers whichever questions seem relevant at your earliest convenience--and if you think of anything else that would be important for me to know, that would be helpful, too!

eitdjhf,radicalwash,1,"I agree that there is some value in looking at Satoshis, but I don't think that one has to exclusively focus on it. I think your view derives from a strong premise that you make: You say that ""[t]he reason we invest in Altcoin , aside from ideology and our faith in better tech , is to gain extra return as compare to Btc."" 

This is the view of a crypto-maximalist - which is fine. But I think it's equally fine to say that one's ultimate goal is to go up in fiat value - because that is still what indicates the price of things in the world. 

Fair enough, even if one's goal is an increase in fiat, it can still be good to compare to Bitcoin: it is the strongest reference point among other cryptos. But ETH could be another sensible reference point! Sure, it's 'just' a fifth of BTC in terms of market cap, but some might argue that it will catch up eventually. Or maybe even Monero if you really believe in it. 

Also, another reason I refrain from comparing too much is that it just fills me with regret: ""Had I just XYZ"". In particular: Had I just put more in altcoins during the last bull run. And had I just switched to BTC/USDT during the bear market.",2019-03-19 02:29:45

eitdblw,Gnomish8,1,"Similar thing. Was a student in ~2009 and worked in the IT department. We each had our own issued laptops, would work a couple periods a day in tech, and got access to *way* too many systems. Heard about BitCoin, and with a friend, wrote some scripts/C# to turn every computer in the district in to a miner between 1AM and 4AM. Took about a week before our net admin caught on, and a day or two after for them to figure it out and shut it down. This was Novemberish of 2009? It was right before the difficulty went up from 1 which IIRC was Decemberish. But anyways, with the combined power of all the district computers (lol, not much...), my friend and I walked away with about 500 coins each.

But, given that, at that time, there wasn't an official exchange, and the value was less than ¢1 at the time, we didn't really pursue it more than a passing fancy and a first real whack at testing our programming skills. Come that summer, the laptops were turned back in to the department, and they were reimaged, wallet and all.

I take solace in knowing that young me would have sold that shit as soon as it was worth anything. Not a chance I would have held it until it's peak. Still a ""fun"" story in early crypto, though.",2019-03-19 02:27:21

eit518u,whuttheeperson,1,"If you're looking for a highly speculative investment with huge potential returns, I recommend looking into Ethereum, a blockchain network. 

I know, I know, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are filled with scams, and you probably think I'm shilling my investment to make more money. In my opinion it would be a mistake to dismiss it so quickly.

A lot of exciting developments are taking place, specifically with a project called Maker. Maker is a project that takes the volatile ETH token, and you lock it up and borrow against it, a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the USD called Dai. 

Dai has all the best characteristics of cryptocurrency but it's actually stable, so you can use it for transactions without worrying it will drop sharply in value, a big issue with something like Bitcoin.

This stable currency, combined with a way to loan yourself money through this system against your assets, is going to revolutionize the global financial system and making it accessible to all, even those who have poor credit or don't have access to traditional financial services.

I know I'm just a guy on reddit, so you're likely to disregard what I'm saying, but I would encourage you to at least look into what I'm saying, as it might end up well for you!

Here is a video explaining what I'm talking about, it's really interesting regardless as you get a decent overview and answering interesting questions such as ""what is money?"".

eixhhq6,thethrowaccount21,1,"&gt;You are going in circles on many things. Let's get back to the facts.

How am I going in circles? I'm responding directly to everything you're writing. 

&gt;I assume that you have no issue with 'Fact 1'.

Considering that is what I stated, that would be a good assumption. I said:

&gt;They are not. The second statement is inaccurate.

&gt; You removed them. That changes the meaning significantly. 

Splitting hairs. The point is whoever you were referring to as 'the founders', it is inaccurate to pretend that they were the only ones mining. Again, why is this important? Why are you focusing so much energy on this?

&gt;The instamine was indeed huge. Something like 10% to 15% of the total money supplied that will ever be issued.

So? It was going to be issued eventually. What is the problem you have with this?

&gt;This happened in the first 24 to 48 hrs. 

Correct, you have just recounted the instamine history. Again? What's your problem with it? You realize this happened 5 years ago right? Why are you focusing on it now? 

&gt;Saying ""everyone who knew about it"" had time to get involved in that 24hr window is ridiculous.

Why? Everyone who was participating in the bitcoin talk thread was able to participate. That is not incorrect. The ONLY issue with the instamine was that more coins were issued than expected. That had **the potential** to be an issue. But it was fixed and is not. But you're focusing on it, for some reason. Even though there are many coins with far worse issuance problems.

&gt;smooth

&gt;Re: Unveiling the truth over the major Monero scam

&gt;November 20, 2015, 12:36:04 AM

&gt;1. NoodleDoodle's commit was May 7, so the start of dga's mining was after May 7, or 19 days after launch. **We know his hash rate reached 4045%** by May 14, or 26 days after launch. i.e. during most of the first month he wasn't mining at all.

&gt;2. **Clearly his hash rate was below 50% for much of the time and only rarely (and not even with certainty) above 60%.** There is no evidence it ever reached anything close to 90%, and certainly it wasn't close to that for any consistent period.

Now, my question to you is, what do you think about this? You have refused to answer this question so far, and probably will again. Of course because you want to focus on Dash. But I tell you that's hypocritical. You are trying to make Dash a 'special case' where you just hammer away at the same issue while ignoring it in other coins. That's disingenuous and makes you a bad actor.

 &gt;but were OK missing the first few days or even weeks until they found time to get set up.

What are you talking about? You haven't even made any allegations. You're just continuing to spread fud. You're trying to create fear, uncertainty and doubt around Dash's launch, but why?? What benefit do you get from that? And why do you keep ignoring these simple questions?

&gt;The correct statement would be; ""everyone who was mining was able to mine and participate"" which is of course stating the obvious and also making your wordspin obvious too.

You're really reaching here.

&gt;Now, without changing what I said, please point out the errors in my statements.

I didn't change what you said. Even if your little screed above was accurate, I never made any implications about removing the quotes, which means your accusation is a red-herring. Calling that 'misquoting you' shows you're being malicious and attempting to project your attacks onto me.

&gt;If you can't, please concede the statements you stated are a lie, are indeed correct.

No, you lied and that statement is incorrect. I stand by my initial comments.",2019-03-20 11:22:43

I don't doubt what you say about there being mysterious charges. I have no idea what might have caused that. All I can say is that I never had that issue back when I was (foolishly) using my debit Visa to fund my account.

BUT, where you screwed up is in not trying to rectify the problem with Bovada first. OF COURSE they are going to take action against you if you commit a charge back on charges that their system believes is valid. You worked this problem exactly backwards. You should have worked with Bovada first and then disputed the charges with your bank only if Bovada refused to fix the problem. In fact, any bank employee is supposed to ask if you've tried working out the issue with the vendor before they assist you with a charge back. I don't know if they failed to ask you this, or if you told them that you did.

eix7xiu,nullc,1,"&gt; Why would you call them ""our novel crypto scheme""?

Because the scheme being pushed out by Bcash is the one we came up with, which isn't compatible with  any of Schnorr's proposals. It's a schnorr-style signature but it's distinct, and has it's own properties and advantages.  You can see deadalnix posting a description of a traditional schnorr signature and me criticising it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5u1qzk/schnorr_signatures_for_dummies/ddqumis/).

&gt; Why don't you clarify to them that a new signature scheme is pointless on its own,

They weren't ""taken"". They were unintentionally frozen, and a fix to unfreeze them will be activated in the next protocol upgrade. A protocol upgrade is just an upgrade and the old version of the software doesn't get ""killed"" or murdered or whatever ridiculously dramatic words you're using to make it sound bad. 

The rightful owners of the coins will regain access to their coins that were unintentionally and temporarily frozen due to the mistake that will be fixed. The coins were never ""taken"" by anyone.

Good so far!

&gt;So… long story short, very soon I put EVERYTHING that I had in alts. In FREAKING ALTCOINS!

Not good...you done screwed up there boy.

&gt;So, my wife didn’t know that we are in a such bad situation, also she didn’t really follow things that happened with bitcoin – she believed me and when she, once in a while asked me, how was it going, I was continuing to tell her that we are in a bit of a loss, but it is not bad, just need to wait a bit more.

Lying to spouse- SUPER-BAD Butter behavior.

&gt;In November I had like 5% from my initial investments.

Oh no.  Full-on Butter.  Maybe he can learn from this.  Maybe there is hope for him.

&gt;If you have even a dollar, that would help me. If many people will send just 1 dollar each, I could even get back what I had initially and look to my wife’s eyes without feeling guilty. You may also say that “oh, you’ll by more shitcoins and the money you’ll get will be gone”. Believe me, no. What I will do is that I will use this money to pay my bills and meanwhile continue to educate myself to find a better job in crypto. Here is my ETH address...

ej3frzv,GBerkeley1734,1,"&gt;No I can place the order before buying the bitcoin so I take zero bitcoin risk.

I have admittedly never placed an order on a darknet market but [guides](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/12/30/buy-drugs-online-from-darknetmarkets/) say you need to have cryptocurrency in the site before you can buy: 

&gt;With funds in your market wallet and being able to easily encrypt messages using a public key, you are ready to buy.
&gt;
&gt;Before you do, though, go and double check both the product page and the vendor’s profile page. Make sure you understand their instructions and their requirements, like whether they ship to your location or require FE.

Is this something about the nature of darknet markets I have misunderstood?

Anyway I think you are thinking of bitcoin like an investment. A speculator holding bitcoin for 6 weeks has to same risk profile as a drug dealer who has just received bitcoin and then starts laundering it (assuming 6 weeks to launder bitcoin). Given the same risk profiles we should treat them the same and my model should make a big deal of this. Don't start with thinking of bitcoin like an investment, think of it as a currency which lots of people use to buy drugs with everyday. Drug dealers need to pay their rent and they can't do that with bitcoin. So they exchange the bitcoin for fiat. I go into some detail about the structure of bitcoin transactions in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/8n2sk5/the_fundamentals_of_bitcoin_as_an_asset_exist_and/) which I think you will find helpful. 

Say there are $2 million drugs purchased everyday on darknets and it takes a week to launder the bitcoin. Now suppose the price of bitcoin is $2000. Each say drug buyers buy 1000 bitcoins and drug sellers sell 1000 bitcoins. 

Now suppose that the price of bitcoin collapses to $1000. Yes, drug dealers will have lost a lot of money, $7 million in total. This is a major fault of bitcoin as a currency. I don't link that to speculators and their losses. Importantly, now 2000 bitcoins are being bought a day and after some adjustment 2000 bitcoins will sold a day. Where did those extra 7000 bitcoins come from? If the price rises again where will they go? What do you think has happened here?

ej3c37z,tidefoundation,1,"It's very hard to tell between a troll and real interest so thanks for clarifying with that last sentence. I'm hoping it's a genuine one and not a cynical comment.

Most of the issues you raised have been answered elsewhere, in interviews, articles and forums - and you usually do make an effort to dig deeper, so that's quite atypical of you. Also, if you know anything about the reporter, Ron Miller, he's known to be vary critical, especially about ""unnecessary"" blockchain projects - and he dug very deep into Tide before working on this article. Look him up. He's very vocal.

Regardless, here goes:

&gt; Good luck removing anything lmfao 

Why would anyone wants to remove anything from the blockchain? No data is stored there. Tide uses the blockchain as a ledger to record assignments of permissions to access data. Neither the data or the keys is explicitly sitting on the ledger.

&gt; puts the onus of securing keys on the customer 

Yes it does - but with tools to make it extremely easy to do that. Tools which are patented and worlds first (new proprietary encryption scheme)

&gt; removes responsibility from the provider 

Yes. That's the main incentive for providers to adopt that - and an incentive to adopt the principle of privacy (very few solutions actually offer providers a reason to uphold privacy other than by threats).

&gt;  i doubt this has any forward secrecy at all 

Why doubting? Are you expecting a public article to go to that depths? Forward secrecy is most certainly addressed (not by PFS, but by other means).

&gt; Like all blockchain technology that stores information, accidental exposure of the keys means total exposure of data with no potential remediation 

Correct but what's the relevance to Tide?

&gt; Im sure grandpa knows how to keep a signing key secure 

We should use that sentence as the title for our patent. Can we, please???

&gt;  their business model  

You are aware that Tide is a not-for-profit organisation, right? The operational model is to govern the open-source protocol and incentive adoption by education and training. Funding comes from several sources, one of which is indirect proceeds of payments within the ecosystem.

&gt; client controls the encryption scheme

That's wrong. The encryption **scheme** is controlled by the foundation. The client control its own key - therefore, the access to its data. So if anyone accesses or sells it, the client has the last word. The client, btw, doesn't have to be online to do that - patent #2.

&gt; Entire article is loaded with buzzwords, this is a complete non-explanation 

That's an odd statement. Not sure what you expected from the article. The whitepaper is 79 pages long. Was that supposed to be attached?

&gt; Tide uses a closed source method...

Wrong. Fully community-driven open-source protocol.

&gt;... to manage access to clients sensitive data

Correct

&gt;they are im breach of GDPR, deleting the encryption keys does not remove data

Wrong. Compliance with GDPR is facilitated with an API request to remove said data from the database (which is up to the provider to comply or not). **In addition** to that request, the data is rendered inaccessible via the deletion of the keys.

Besides, even if the provider choose to exercise the ""right for erasure"" like that, some GDPR experts might disagree with your and claim it's a fully compliant technique:

[https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/reconciling-gdpr-rights-to-erasure-and-rectification-of-personal-data-with-blockchain](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/reconciling-gdpr-rights-to-erasure-and-rectification-of-personal-data-with-blockchain)

[https://info.townsendsecurity.com/gdpr-right-erasure-encryption-key-management](https://info.townsendsecurity.com/gdpr-right-erasure-encryption-key-management)

&gt;Given a hypothetical amount of time those keys could be recreated and the data still exists

Not sure the relevancy of this statement - but that's true. True to bitcoin as well. And anything encryption method based on... math! That ""amount of time"" would be after our sun explodes.

&gt; Blockchain tech stores it literally forever, forever is a long time, encryption does not last forever

Very true. Again, not sure about the relevancy.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that the language here is intentionally combative (one might say defensive?!) only as a mirror to yours - as I found that entertaining. I'm certain that's not how we'd converse directly as I actually hold a lot of respect to you and how you carry yourself in this subreddit (and in r/linux). I think we'd rather enjoy an intelligent conversation.

The Tide Protocol is a result of a real commercial need and R&amp;D that's been in the works for over 4 years. There's a lot to it with some big brains contributing to it. I'm sure you didn't expect all that info to be reflected in the article. I'm hopeful that whoever reads it allows for the slimmest possibility that there is a universe where (some of?) those claims may be true - and maybe get surprised for the better. Maybe even join the community driving this effort and contribute from your knowledge, experience and imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

As for more detailed explanations, we can't release the whitepaper publicly **YET** for legal reasons (complying with SEC to the full extent on blockchain-related projects is a bitch, I tell ya, and we're probably one of the only suckers that do that) but will happy to answer specific questions - so bring 'em on!",2019-03-22 12:10:47

ej3jqiv,horsebadlydrawn,1,"&gt;The same way you compare any two numbers.  I'm counting them and observing the differences.

You don't want to start doing that - remember that the BTC blocksize limit is 1MB and the BCH blocksize limit is 32MB. So according to your system BCH is 32x better. 

&gt;Nothing broke at all.  The chain continued to function as expected.  Blocks were mined, and they contained txs.  Nothing stopped working.

This is mind-boggling. Are you another one of these fanboys that doesn't use BTC?  The BTC chain was literally useless, transactions were frozen for up to two weeks with an uncertain outcome. That's literally the nightmare scenario in any payment scheme, you can't pull funds back but you can't be sure they'll send either.  The BTC fees went as high as $150 per transaction, effectively rendering 60% of UTXOs unspendable by themselves. And BTC lost a HUGE number of vendors due to the support nightmare this created. And the only thing the Core team did was toast ""champaign"". You either were living in a cave or have taken drugs to erase your brain if you don't understand this. 

&gt;Why do you think BCH usage has declined so much this year while BTC usage has *increased*? etc.

Because BCH was 51% attacked by Craig Wright, in the largest scale attack on crypto yet - Bitcoin SV. Craig and his troll team convinced exchanges to alter ticker names, they damaged investor confidence, they created some bad incentives in the mining community, and generally wreaked havoc on the entire BCH scene.

Unlike real brokerage firms like 1Broker that dealt with sophisticated traders like you guys,  most of my users are people who want to bet &lt;$100 worth of Bitcoin on a game or make a tiny speculative bet on the direction of the market. They're not well-off enough to afford the $10,000 - $20,000 minimums at major brokerage firms and they don't really understand the concept of making a market using limit orders. So generally, I try to make the market myself, provide a reasonable bid/ask spread, and if buy/sell orders get too one-sided, I hedge myself in the real commodity markets and/or sports books.

Like I said, kind of amateurish, but it works for these guys. I make enough money in the spread to cover server expenses and make a little profit but I'm not rolling in dough. Then again, I've never really advertised the site either. So as you correctly point out, sound like I've got to examine if there's enough profit potential to make this thing worthwhile.

&gt; &amp;quot;The idea that there&amp;#039;s fake volume has been rumored for a long time, we were just the first people to systematically look at which exchanges were delivering real volume,&amp;quot; Hougan told CNBC. The San Francisco-based firm compared at Coinbase Pro, which reports about $27 million in average daily volume in bitcoin.

&gt; In another stark comparison CoinBene - the biggest reported exchange on CoinMarketCap.com - has a nearly $15 spread. Hougan said they found other extreme examples of exchanges with a spread of more than $300. &amp;quot;It is surprising that an exchange with almost 18 times the volume of Coinbase Pro would have a spread that is 1,500 times larger,&amp;quot; Bitwise said in the report.

The full tweet Todd tweet you linked is

Something I didn't mention - and should have - is I think the 21 million  BTC limit is so fundamental it's more likely Bitcoin will die than  change it.

ej5bprk,todu,1,"At first the small blockers tried to rename the legitimate Bitcoin variant as ""BTU"" or ""Bitcoin Unlimited tokens"" or something like that. It was when BU started to gain popularity and an upgrade to &gt; 1 MB base blocksize limit had become so popular that some exchanges created ""BTC"" and ""BTU"" futures that people could trade. 

The small blockers of course tried to steal the name ""Bitcoin"" and tickers ""XBT"" and ""BTC"" to their small block Bitcoin variant, and to fool everyone to accept naming the big block Bitcoin variant ""BTU"" instead. That was the first renaming attack IIRC. I think this is the ""BTU altcoin"" they pretended the legitimate Bitcoin variant to be:

https://bitscreener.com/coins/bitcoin-unlimited

Bitcoin didn't split into two currencies at that time.

Then on 2017-08-01 Barry Silbert and his company DGC used their influence they had from owning shares in many Bitcoin companies including many exchanges, to force the exchanges to give the Bitcoin brand name and XBT and BTC tickers to the small block Bitcoin variant. Cobra that owns the bitcoin.org domain name is a small blocker so he agreed too. Wladimir Van Der Laan did too. Just follow the money to see why so many businesses, organizations and individuals chose to give the brand name and tickers to the small block Bitcoin variant. Who invested in what companies and who salaried who? There you'll find your answer as usual.

The exchanges accepted Barry's naming proposal and then the uninformed masses got the impression that ""everyone"" was calling the small block Bitcoin variant ""Bitcoin (BTC)"" and the big block Bitcoin variant had to be ""the altcoin"" and needed a new name.

Then the Viabtc exchange tweeted that they would start calling the big block Bitcoin variant ""Bitcoin Cash (BCC)"" and we big blockers quickly accepted that good name and good ticker.

Then the small blockers tried to cause confusion about what alternatives there were to their small block Bitcoin variant by trying to get us big blockers to agree to call our currency ""Bcash (BCH)"" instead, with the hope that it would confuse new users so much that they would be unsure what currency to buy and would consider the ""default option"" to be the ""clearly named original"" Bitcoin (BTC). The small blockers also kept creating several more Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash forks just to show new users how ""anyone can make a worthless copy and since Bcash is the copy it must therefore be worthless"".

They succeeded in fooling the big blocker community to accept a ticker change from BCC to BCH but failed at fooling it to accept a name change from Bitcoin Cash to Bcash.

We big blockers needed a new name for the illegitimate small block Bitcoin variant but were not centralized enough to agree on a new name and ticker quickly and uniformly, so for a while some people called it ""Bitcoin Segwit"" but after a while most big blockers agreed to call it ""Bitcoin Core (BTC)"". The small blockers are still trying to fool everyone to call their small block Bitcoin variant ""Bitcoin (BTC)"" instead.

Then someone funded Craig Wright to steal our Bitcoin Cash name and BCH ticker and split our community and currency in two, but that's just more of the same story.

The small blockers (and Craig Wright believers) very much want the brand name Bitcoin and the tickers BTC and XBT because otherwise they would've simply started their independent currency projects with their independent brand names and tickers. But why create something new and compete fairly when you can just pay some developers and entrepreneurs (Blockstream, DGC et al.) or rent a lot of hash power (Calvin+Craig, Nchain et al.) to steal control of the Bitcoin currency, the Bitcoin brand name and tickers. Because everyone knows that they'd be unsuccessful in competing fairly with the legitimate big block Bitcoin variant so brand name theft and hostile takeovers were their only possible options.

The small blockers and Craig Wright believers succeeded in stealing the brand name 1.5 times (""Bitcoin"" and ""BCC"") and decreasing the size our community by fooling some to ""leave and join the Satoshi currency because Craig is Satoshi"", but it seems that the actual honey badger (Bitcoin Cash (BCH)) doesn't care. It's just a flesh wound and the 10 years old legitimate Bitcoin honey badger seems to have gotten used to them.

Oh and Calvin+Craig et al are probably the ones trying to sue Bitcoin Cash (BCH) companies and developers to use the legal system to give them the Bitcoin Cash brand name and BCH ticker. That's also yet another social engineering attack on the brand name and ticker. But I expect that attack to fail just like their rented hash power attack to completely destroy BCH failed. But they will have succeeded in slowing our project down by forcing some of our most active developers et al to spend time talking to lawyers, judges and juries instead of programming and developing etc.",2019-03-23 05:48:50

The Square system is interesting because they seem like they will have their own exchange, and 0 confirm the transactions by controlling the crypto on the credit cards directly. But how good it will be will be decided by the fees, and it seems like any centralized solution run by a banklike will have bank like fees. We don't know yet, but I would be quire happy if square crypto had minimal fees, but I'm not using my crypto to pay a full credit card fee or more, so until something great comes along, I can't get excited about a POS crypto fee system, when I can just trade out on an exchange for a tenth or less the fee and just use dirty fiat for my purchases normally.",2019-03-23 05:17:43

Today, paper money only accounts for about 15% of the circulating supply. Money is already mostly a digital ledger. Just an Oracle database running on Azure operated by the banks. This accounting can now be done by software on a decentralised network with proof of work consensus enforcing the rules on each other.

Because inflation in built into bitcoin this is inevitable if this currency takes hold and it is widely used, lets say its the world reserve.  It is going to inflate daily as the economic demand for more velocity of currency will drive the price up.   This will cause wages to move farther to the right of the decimal point.   Its just like adding more currency into the system, to me it is almost no different except some early adopters are getting stinking rich, that may be the only difference here. 

Money is really about utilizing the people power, it is a concept a medium.  Sure everything about our monetary system is fucked, but that doesn't make this form much better besides its shared printing press.  

I am starting to think that the entire problem with the world is the fact that money exists at all.   I don't see any evidence of any currency per-sumarian.   You don't see Gobelgi Tepi coins are any evidence of currency at the monolithic sites around the world, not that that is proof but Im just saying money may be the limiting factor in humanity fixing its problems right now.  It may also be the promoting factor of the ""bad guys"" continuing their destruction of everything for the sake of more money and power.

ej9lpnv,durascrub,1,"I don't think you understand the Bitcoin security model...at all. It is not based on the goodwill of miners and their moral dedication to the ""one true"" chain. Honest miners are driven primarily by economic incentive. The additional computing power pointed at the BCH chain during the last hard fork was bought and paid for. Even if we assume that it was provided altruistically, I think it is silly to presume that miners (or pro-BCH benefactors) will guaranty that kind of support in the future. Source: Every single strategic alliance that has been broken throughout human history.

You also fail to consider the cost to protect the BCH chain is negligible in comparison to the cost of a sustained attack on BTC. The hash rate, which you call an ""illusion of security"", is not some esoteric concept. It represents the decentralized investment of an enormous sum of money into specialized equipment and facilities around the globe. That is the Bitcoin security model.

You say ""Attack the profits and the coin is dead"". Of course! I am glad you have some appreciation for how Bitcoin works. The evidence you have provided here proves the exact opposite of what you are claiming though. BCH is less secure because it has been proven that appreciable amounts of hash rate can be mustered at a moment's notice for one party's benefit. BTC is more secure and does not suffer from 51% attacks because the cost would be staggering and the return would be minimal.

Please keep in mind, I am not saying that small blocks are better than big blocks or SegWit and LN are the best scaling solutions. I am only commenting on your assertion that ""there's no proof that BTC has higher security"".",2019-03-24 23:15:58

So even if you have broadcast a transaction to the network, and your recipient sees the incoming tx to their wallet, you as the sender could re-send a tx to a different wallet address with a higher tx fee added to ensure that the higher fee tx is the one that get included in the Blockchain. The initial tx, although done first, would then be denied as a double-spend and would never be confirmed in the Blockchain. This exists on the legacy BTC Blockchain.  Bitcoin Cash does not have RBF, so the BCH chain is much safer for accepting a 0 confirmation tx as you know that the first tx seen by the network is the one that will be included in the next block.  Also since BCH has much higher blocksize capacity, there is always room in the blocks and there is never any mempool backlog, so you also have the assurance of seeing the tx get confirmed within 5-10 minutes, or at least in the next block, whenever that may be.

ejawvx9,R_Sholes,1,"&gt; If Craig was Satoshi and wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper, he would have understood that it was the arrival order, not block stuffing order.

Until implementation of fee-based prioritization - somewhere in 0.3.xx, I think - block builder algorithm repeatedly iterated through mempool ***in tx hash order*** until it was empty or the block was full , skipping over transactions not yet in any block (including currently built one). This resulted in a cross between CTOR and TTOR, though topological ordering was just a byproduct of building the block in direct way while avoiding the situation where child tx gets included, but block runs out of space before the parent tx, resulting in an invalid block. At no point there was arrival order used for this.

Since CTOR and v0.1 blocks are trivially interconvertible, and exactly the same in case of mempool smaller than the block size with no tx dependencies, CTOR is following the original protocol the closest amongst current implementations and should be completely uncontroversial for people aiming to keep Bitcoin as close to original as possible.

It's not my area, but my understanding is that while real finance people do have to worry about inflation, they deal with this via hedges and inflation-linked securities because that's the best way to actually address inflation risk.

The idea of gold as an inflation hedge is kind of silly since there are way bigger factors influencing the price of gold than inflation. Gold isn't a terrible thing to buy, and it will hedge against inflation a bit, but if you're looking at the big picture it's probably not the best possible thing to do.

ejf112d,pyrospade,46,"&gt; They did the same shit over 15 years ago. They were the first to do it. The point is nobody cares about that now and Steam fanboys attack every service in turn that competes with Steam even if they need to bend reality to do it.

AFAIK Steam never reached exclusivity deals with anyone. In fact they've been pretty open to devs using any channel they see fit to distribute their games, you can sell steam keys anywhere you want.

&gt; People scream about how Epic is giving user data to Tencent (which is not true and there is no proof of it happening) 

There is proof of Epic accessing Steam data for no reason at all and without consent. Whatever they do with that data we don't know, but given that Tencent has a major take on the company and how Chinese-owned companies behave I think it's safe to speculate on that  they are using the data.

&gt;  Steam sells games with RedShell, which tracks and transmits your internet browsing history along with a ton of other data. They sell spyware and everybody is fine with it now because Epic bad.

Who is fine with it? As far as I know every single time a dev has implemented user-invading DRM or stupid shit like hidden bitcoin miners there's been a large controversy. But the hate has been directed to the developer, not Steam, cause Steam doesn't check what the devs package in their games. Now whether they should do that or not is a question for another day, but I don't think they are responsible. 

&gt; Most users don't give a shit about that. They care about prices. Steam ensures that they have the lowest prices by forcing publisher contracts that stipulate they cannot sell their games cheaper on any other service compared to Steam. And yet you still see legions of fanboys screeching that Epic should sell games cheaper if they want business.

Who has said that? Most people complaining about the Epic store demand basic user features like a search box, or proper security so that your account doesn't get hacked, or consumer-friendly refunds, or letting users review and warn other users of potential issues. That's what I see in most 'epic bad' posts and I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for that.

I think you are pushing your own tailored narrative that PC gamers are some kind of fanboyist screamers when most of their requests are fairly reasonable: be consumer-friendly and provide feature parity.

This is what I wrote:

@Bitcoin account is the living proof that there exist people that once were bitcoin supporters. As real bitcoin supporters as you are now. And they saw the change that happened in the bitcoin software and the bitcoin community. And they changed their mind, not really about what the bitcoin means to them, but about what the bitcoin has become.

Nobody bought/stole the @Bitcoin account. There are many of us that changed our mind, and I can tell you, bitcoin is not what it used to be. I used to be a bitcoin supporter, I mined my first BTC in 2012, I ran the full node, I ate the burgers paid by bitcoin in 2014. And although I did all that things, and supported BTC 100%, I changed my mind when I saw the $0.5 fee, a thing that was ridiculed as impossible just a few years before. And I saw the $50 fee, and paid ~$10 fee to escape from BTC to Bitcoin Cash. And I saw the BTC to alt dominance slip from 90% to ~30%.

Let me ask you, why do you think there is only one Linux kernel? Why do you think there was 90% BTC market dominance? Answer is the same - it is not easy to do the fork. If I were to fork the BTC in 2012 (as many have), it wouldn't have any value. All alts put together had less than 5% of value of BTC market cap. If I were to fork the Linux kernel, nobody would use it. Nobody would contribute to it. I would need to do miracle to do better than existing linux community, attract more better developers, attract the users, and do all that hard work. Why would I do that, if I already have working Linux kernel, and I can freely contribute to it, and it will continue to serve my needs?! Well, the same cannot be said for bitcoin. Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is not money if I need to pay significant fraction of the transaction to the miner fees. And it is very easy for me to fork BTC, and acquire a lot of supporters that don't like the current state of bitcoin. Even those that oppose the fork will leave the bitcoin because it became unusable, and align themselves for some of the other promising altcoins.

Look up the LibreOffice, MariaDB, and stories behind them, and you will see what the Bitcoin Cash is. It's no fake copy, it's the original.

For anyone interested in the history of bitcoin, look up who Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn were, and what they did. Let me know if you think you are better supporter of BTC then they were.

### Release 4.0.0

* Privacy features have been added, most notably CashShuffle has been integrated
  strongly into the wallet. It is an optional plugin for shuffling coins
  securely with other users. Coin control and other logic has been added as
  well. The bulk of the work for this release has been this feature.
  (Clifford, cculianu, Josh Ellothorpe, Mark Lundeberg, Jonald Fyookball,
  imaginaryusername, emergent_reasons, acidsploit, and others).
* Fix #1174, #1178 - Resurrection of .onion support (requires enabling of
  non-SSL).
* Fixups for qr code image saving (cculianu), #1175
* Closing a wallet now actually closes its daemon threads. Closing a wallet
  window now also implicitly closes any tx dialog child windows it created.
  Closing the last wallet window in the app will quit the app, even if other
  child windows are still alive. (cculianu)
* Coins tab layout fixups #1180, including right click -&gt; Copy X (cculianu,
  Mark Lundeberg, SomberNight)
* Addition of Wallet -&gt; Scan beyon gap... tool #1194 (cculianu)
* Fixed #968 for the Receive tab -- when the form is unsaved it now always is
  *guaranteed* to refresh itself with a new unused address in real time.
  (cculianu)
* Tx notification systray popup was too intermittent.  It now pops up more
  frequently when reeiving or synching a new wallet. The wording used has also
  been simplified. (cculianu)
* Fix #1182 - Bad proxy can end up in config file (cculianu)
* Fix #1215 - Tabs that are not being shown are no longer refreshed in the GUI.
  They refresh themselves when you switch to them, however, if they need to.
  This should improve perception of UI responsiveness for large wallets
  especially. (cculianu)
* Fixed some bugs related to switching chains (forks) #1185 (cculianu)
* Fixed a bug where importing a private key didn't update the history until
  app restart. (cculianu)
* Fix Network Dialog layout (SomberNight)
* Fix sign message not accept rich text spesmilo#5210 (SomberNight)
* Fix #1189 - Cope better with unknown wallet formats or corrupt wallets on
  startup.  This should improve the experience for SLP users that also use
  regular Electron Cash (cculianu)
* Switch over to bitcoin-abc libsecp in preparation for Schnorr signatures.
  Libsecp is now actually bundled with the Linux ""source"" tarball. (cculianu)
* Fix to exchange rate prefs screen UI and deletion of BitcoinAverage as a
  historical rate provider (cculianu)
* If running from source, app now has an icon on all platforms (cculianu)
* Fix ubuntu installation for virtual-env (acidsploit)
* Due to phishing being a recurrent annoyance, ""Preferred servers only"" now
  defaults to ""CHECKED"" for new installs. (cculianu)
* Many performance improvements, especially for large wallets (cculianu)
* Cache address balance in memory rather than recompute each call (SomberNight)
* Various internal bugfixes (cculianu, SomberNight, ecdsa)

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple of days of swinging around, here is where I have it today.

We dropped down to the support line over the past couple of days.  Today, we’ve seen a tentative reversal.  It is tentative because it is based on the end of the day high; so if we reverse back down below $3,850 we will drop down a box instead.  It’s happened before, so lets not get too excited.

I want to take a second to talk about reversals and box movements.

My understanding of how this works is that a box is filled if the price is in that box.  For example, if the price today moved to $4,050.01, we would put an X in the 4050 box.  If the price drops to $3,849.99 we would put an O in that box.

The highs and the lows are the ONLY prices that matter.

If the price moves in the direction of the column into a new box, it doesn’t matter if it is just for a second, and the price droops $100—as soon as it moves in the direction of the column the chart is complete for the day.

Once a column is moving, the price to the $4,000 box holds, a reversal is targeted by moving one column to the right and counting down three boxes.  That would put the reversal in the $3,850 BOX.  That is where I mark the reversal.

I guess in technical terms, a price below $3,850 would trigger a “sell” signal.  I use this for trend trading, so I do not use that terms--bitcoin moves to fast it would cause an uprising against me to use ""buy"" or ""sell"" terms.

**The ""breakdown""** happens when the box below the lowest previous box is triggered.  So, using today’s chart, the Most recent low was at the $3,858 point, in the $3,850-$3,900 box.  Therefore a breakdown has to be below that box—in this case it would be any price LOWER THAN $3,850—NOT $3,850.

&amp;#x200B;

The same happens on the upside, but obviously in a positive direction.

The most common formation is the ""double top"" or double bottom.   This happens when the price movement equals the last movement in that column direction.  The breakout happens when it moved up or down past that mark.

A triple top or bottom happens when the price equals the highest for three columns in the same direction.  Double and triple bottoms are generally considered ""good"" in PnF terms.

There are other formations I will point out when I see them.  Long Poles, Short Poles, Catapaults are the ones you want to watch for.  Those formations will make you the most money the fastest.

Trends are figured from the most recent high.  You put the “+” mark in the box above the high, and move to the right column and drop one box.    The current trend line comes from back in October, about two or three days after we broke the downtrend from the all time high.  We felt good for a day or two, and then the bottom fell again.  If someone wanted to say our current trend comes from the ATH peak in 2017, I would not put up much of an argument.

I recall there used to be an anonymous way to share excel spreadsheets.  If someone can edu-ma-kate me, I would be happy to post what I have.

The chart is pretty wide—it is out to column “PH” on the current sheet.  So there is a lot of history.  Someone let me know and I will try to get it posted.

That is all for today.  Lets hope we keep going in the direction you want.

Happy birthday to my late father.  Tomorrow is his 90th birthday.  If you Dad was a good guy, tell him.  There is nothing I like hearing more is that I did a good job raising my kids.  Once they are gone for good, you will wish you did more for them.  (Unless they were jerks.)

ejhjek8,cointastical,28,"&gt; i heard it was too late for amateurs/hobbyist 

It kind of is. 

&gt; and renting some of my units to other customers

Evidence of it being ""too late"" is this dude selling shovels, rather than mining internally with his entire inventory.

Now, technically, ... it isn't too late for anyone, as long as you have access to ""free"" electricity, or else if you pay the least expensive rate tier for electricity available globally ... in the $0.02 - $0.04 per kWh, at the current exchange rate and difficulty.   Anyone paying more than that (at current difficulty and exchange rate) finds that their mining equipment becomes obsolete before it pays for itself (i.e., ""positive ROI"").

Now there has already been peaks and valleys in Bitcoin mining's past, but we are now a little over 12 months until the next halving, meaning any mining hardware will suddenly produce Bitcoin about half the rate it did before the halving.   Currently the block subsidy reward is 12.5 bitcoins.  After halving it is 6.75 bitcoins.  Fees earned will be the same, but currently fees are a minimal contribution to miner's revenues.

That being said, ... there's some chance mining could still yet be incredibly profitable.   Let's say before year-end we return to the previous all time high. $20K ... 5X the current BTC/USD.  

If the mining hashrate today is ~50,000 tH/s  (down from 2018 peak of ~60,000 tH/s)  that means either the hashrate increases 5X as well or miners see increased profit.    Well, there's no chance the hashrate can increase 5X in a timely fashion.   And many miners will be reluctant to add capacity knowing the halving is coming, .. and unsure if the exchange rate will stay that high.   So anyone with existing hardware could be in a position where they find their hardware pays for itself in a matter of months, and after that it is all gravy.

Incidentally, with Bitcoin drawing ~4,000 MW globally, ... much of the ""low cost"" electricity is already spoken for or otherwise inaccessible to those mining ops looking to expand.  That level of electricity drawn definitely cannot increase 5X without introducing problems for electric generators and electricity regulators.   So there's potentially yet a way to get a 1.0 Bitcoin investment in mining to return more than 1.0 Bitcoin in the future.  But that's a real gamble, ... a return to $20K in a year or less is not by any means something expected. ",2019-03-27 19:49:38

INTRODUCTION

K: So we are recording right now. First and foremost Vitalik thank you for coming on. For people that are new to this format, it's a community series. People have posted and voted on questions on Reddit and I have grouped them together and we will go over them today. Thank you to everybody who has submitted the questions. I will say that I couldn't include all questions from everybody, but I tried my best to group them together and have as many questions answered as possible. I will also recommend listeners and viewers to check Vitalik's latest and recent talks with Laura Shin and with Eric from into the Ether and then I particularly liked his talk with Dimitri from Hidden Forces and Tyler from Conversations with Tyler, and I will link to all of that. I'm mentioning this because many questions that were asked were actually answered in one of those conversations, especially the two more recent ones. So, let's just dive in and get started. 

V: Sure.

K: So, Vitalik can you, as an introduction, can you share a little about the place where you are sitting right now. And the reason I'm asking this is that we are in this distributed world and it's nice to get a feeling of where you are, right now. 

V: Sure, I'm just with my family in Toronto right now. 

K: For people who have never heard about you, who are you and what are your interests or what is your background? 

V: I'm the founder of the Ethereum project. Before that I was in what was then just the Bitcoin space for a few years. I co-founded Bitcoin Magazine and just generally interested in all of the related things and I get into a lot of software and program related stuff and a lot of math and economics and philosophy and just those kinds of things in general. 

K: What did you study and how is that relevant to what you do today? 

V: In (something) university I studied Computer Science for one year but then I dropped out. I guess most of my learning has like especially recently has just been on my own from talking to people and reading things on the internet. 

K: And if there is somebody, who do you go to for advice or is there somebody you look up to if it's nobody in particular? 

V: I don't know. It depends. 

K: All right. If, this is the last introductionary question, but if people want to learn more about you, where should they go and find out more about you? 

V: It depends what you want to know about me I guess. A lot of the things I've written aside from the Reddit and Twitter, I have a blog at (www.vitalik.ca) and wrote a bunch of other things on Medium. Otherwise it depends on what you want to know. The internet is a big place and the internet has a lot of things.

ejhzn82,yolotrades,91,"It's been almost a year since I posted around here. Greetings fellow degenerates! It was nice to see so many mentions and PM's when I logged into this account today for the first time in well over 6+ months. Thank you for the love. I'd say I missed you guys, but that would be a lie ;)

I still frequently read and view these threads, though I don't check in on bitcoin or bitcoin news nearly as much as I used to. I like it like that. For those that remember, I cashed out half of my decently sized stash at around $7,500 about a year and a half ago. Haven't touched the other half. Still long-term bullish on BTC. I did diversify recently and add a *small* amount of ETH to my portfolio, but nothing crazy.

Things, honestly, are going about as to be expected. Thankfully, because I cashed out half of my stash when I did, I've been able to live comfortably and just let the swings be the swings. I'm glad I sold what I did, when I did. But my plan for the other half is still the same - wait until the next bout of price appreciation / new highs before I consider selling it. Nothing had changed on that front. I'm still as long-term bullish as I've ever been.

Some of you also know I kind of only pop around these days when I see something big brewing. And I do. On the log chart, we're coming up on a pretty big decision-making time: the downtrend from this entire move. 

https://imgur.com/a/29oNCA5

A simple $50 move up at this point breaks this line (not convincingly, but still). I'm not saying that's what is going to happen, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's what *does* happen. 

Many of you are still very bearish. And I get it. After being a bear and winning for so long, it's going to be hard to notice when the temperature in the water is beginning to rise and the moods and sentiments are beginning to change. I believe we are at an inflection point at the moment. Bears make money. Bulls make money. Pigs get slaughtered. Recognize when you're being a pig. We're on 15+ months of down-swings, sell-off's and bear-raids. Trends change. They reverse. Sentiments pick up. Rallies and bubbles begin, and at some point, there *is* a bottom.

Again, not saying this is going to happen, either here, today, tomorrow, or whatever. Just saying... bears have had their fill. Like a pot of boiling water, next thing you know we're at $5k, $7k, then $10k, then etc. Don't get caught off guard. From this price, a short has a hell of a lot less upside than a long. Don't over leverage. I've always recommended 2-3x max, so you can ride out swings and don't get caught up in trading ticks, especially in a choppy market. 

Trade advice: No reason to take a long *here* and hope it spikes up, but if it moves up in any meaningful fashion, I'd get prepared to make a move. Let it spike and make sure it doesn't fake-out and then dive under that resistance line, but if we get to $4,250 for instance... in my opinion, it's on and a bottom is in, and you should reduce shorts / increase longs and hold on for the ride. 

I hope you all are doing well. I don't really plan on coming back around all that frequently, but I wanted to post this anyways since we're pretty damn close to the resistance line from this entire move down. Felt like a good time to come back and say hello at least. 

Fingers crossed that the bleeding is over and there are greener pastures ahead. But if not, I'm prepared for that, too.... and so should you. Godspeed, and don't get fucked by the market.",2019-03-28 00:00:02

K: All right. How is your relationship with Vlad changing and do you see him continuing to contribute to Ethereum long-term or moving in a different direction?

V: Vlad has always been this wonderful fun character. Like he's... on the one hand he's always just kind of off by himself and like you can't give him orders and like if you try to give him orders he's just not going to listen to you. And we never really did. On the other hand, he's just going to go off and do random things, and sometimes those are random things I agree with and sometimes those are random things that I don't agree with. On the other hand he has made really significant contributions to Ethereum research. So like for example Casper CBC. So the vision Casper CBC that Vlad has is you have like his own thing Casper and then you have like CBC flavor of sharding and then his own CBC flavor of load balancing and then all those other things. There is a lot of that vision that I don't really find super practical. Like I personally don't believe in sharded systems without a logically centralized beacon chain. I don't believe in in-protocol load balancing because I think that's just too much complexity for layer one. And I don't believe in highly activist governance where the chain ends up like having IETF committee's weekly deciding which smart contracts to burn. But at the same time, Casper CBC for example, is just brilliant, and it's brilliant on a scale where it's a multi-decade level improvement over the traditional academic VFT space in many ways. I can't find any other algorithm that allows you to avoid having in-protocol enshrined finality thresholds, that allows you to just kind of layer Consensus on top of a majority driven forktuous rule so you can have the same mechanism that would decide block by block and the same mechanism finalize. So between all of those things, like, no just Casper CBC is amazing and useful and it's something that we hope to switch over to over time. I hope Vlad comes up with more ideas and we end up continuing to help out with each others research.

K: I think /u/carlslarson who is a moderator on the Ethtrader subreddit asked this. Vitalik, are you aware that you have 82,300 donuts!? And that Reddit recently announced they are supporting a community initiative, r/donuts, to decentralize the donuts system. Do you think there is value in bringing Ethereum/web3 technologies back into web2 entities like Reddit? What would you like to see change with how Reddit communities operate?

V: Huh. So the interesting thing with donuts is that they kind of showed one of the limitations of blockchains by themselves and designing many incentive systems. So basically you can have donuts, and you can earn donuts, and you can use donuts to vote in these community polls. And then they made donuts tradeable by basically having this bridge where you could go onto and move them into Ethereum tokens and then trade them on Uniswap and then move them back. And then a lot of people started complaining and it's like ""Hey, now you can buy votes!"" and then you have people with Eth just coming in and deciding what happens in our community and then going out without having any skin in the game. And I saw that there were a lot of people just very unhappy about this and correct me if I'm wrong but they ended up suspending the convertability to ERC-20 tokens? 

K: Yeah, exactly, exactly. 

V: I thought that was kind of very interesting and instructive experiment in many ways. Like first of all, the donuts being connected to the blockchain just sort of enabled them to be used in so many different ways. On the other hand, like this just goes back to some of those collusion resistant issues. I'm actually in the middle of writing a big blog post about this. Basically if it becomes too easy to kind of prove to the outside world how you kind of behaved in a system, then you can do things like bribing with smart contracts, you can do things like individuals just buying a whole bunch of coins and using them to make votes. You can just do a whole bunch of behaviors that are just much harder to guard against. And there is a result in Game Theory. You know how like when some people talk about how politics is fundamentally broken and they mention Aro's Theorem? That's the theorem that says if there is a voting system with more than two voters and more than two outcomes or something like that then there is no way to make one that's kind of fair in every way. It's a pretty common thing in sort of rationalist pop culture but I actually think that Aro's Theorem is overrated and the theorem that's underrated is that there is this result from Cooperative Game Theory which is just this branch of game theory that introduces the possibility that if multiple subsets of agents can sort of collude with each other and act as one sub coalition. And the results basically said that the core, well the formal statement is that the core of the majority game is empty, and what that means is that if you have a game that corresponds to some kind of majority rule system, then there is no stable outcome because whatever the outcome is you can prove that there is always some group of 51%, possible some including existing privileged users, some including those outside of the ruling coalition that can just come together where that 51% gains an advantage over the status quo from kind of overturning the system to a new status quo where they're at the top. That just shows if collusion becomes this trivial then your ability to make a lot of mechanisms for a lot of cool things just end up breaking down. I know there is just so much enthusiasm in trying to make these mechanisms for like just some sort of point system on top of social media. The Ethtrader experiment is one. There is also this Chinese media thing called Behoo(?) that's recently launched a similar thing and then there is just a bunch of others. I do worry that if they design them in the wrong way, then these problems will just kind of end up eating them and they'll just have to repeatedly solve them with kind of groups of centralized moderation and that would be very sad. But if we can come up with a solution that works, that would just be really great. 

K: From my perspective, it was quite interesting to see how quickly the tokenization of the karma or the donuts, how quickly that led to discussions about buying the banner and then about advertising and you just know that implementing one thing technologically or technical solution just introduces a whole bunch of other questions to which there were no answers and it was just quite interesting to follow that from a reader perspective and to see the opinions and the motivations behind that. 

V: By the way, I think the Harberger taxing might be broken to. So like if...

K: Can you just explain to people quickly what it means in this context for people who don't know what the Harberger tax is?

V: I'm sorry. So Ethtrader has this mechanism called, well they call it the Hamburger tax, but it's an implementation of the Harberger tax which is basically, you have this billboard at the top of Ethtrader, and there is always a price that you can buy the billboard for. If you buy the billboard at that price, then that amount of money goes to the original owner, but then you have to set the price at what you're selling it, but whatever price you set it to, you have to pay 1% of that amount every day. So that kind of stops you from putting the price up close to infinity and causes the billboard to have to just keep being on the market. The way that I would attack this if I were more evil is that I would gather up 150,000 donuts. I would buy the billboard. And then I would replace the contents of the billboard with Bitcoin Maximalist propaganda. Then I would set the price up to 250,000. And then people in the community would basically have no choice but to buy it back to set the content to something more Ethereum friendly and I would walk away with a profit. Then I would just keep on doing this. 

K: But you would run out of donuts, right? To pay the tax?

V: No because if they buy it within 40 days then the amount I sell it for minus the amount I buy it minus the taxes I would still profit. 

K: I think you just gave some people some ideas. 

V: Well good it will be a playground on which the wolves should play and we should like put these things to the test and that way it's both financially and socially beneficial. Yay!

K: As we begin to possibly enter a more robust multi-chain world, what do you believe is the unique value proposition of Ethereum, in comparison to the value propositions articulated by many competing chains (often focused upon scalability, interoperability, on-chain governance, etc.)? 

V: I think Ethereum does have an opportunity to continue to position itself very uniquely in the space.

Those things have some advantages, but I think Ethereum should avoid falling into the trap of trying to compete with those things. Even though those things have their genuine fans, I would actually favor the Ethereum community just explicitly saying ""No, we're not doing that."" and instead going this direction of relatively at least post 2.0 and after 2.0 is rolled out valuing more conservatism, this more kind of decentralization and more technical decentralization, more of this kind of distributed approach to governance, more of this approach to doing things only if they satisfy multiple communities of stakeholders and things like that. So basically, having some similarities with how Bitcoin governance works, but definitely not going all the way in that direction. In terms of decentralization, for example, one example of the kind of differences that I've noticed, a lot of the proof of stake chains that I see, like I've seen launched so far, they tend to take the easy route and say ""Oh, we're only going to have 20 nodes or we're only going to have 100 or 500 nodes. And then we're going to have this small but we're going to assume everyone is part of a stake pool and we're not going to do sharding we're just going to do maybe kind of internal sharding within each node. We're going to require stake pools to have data centers. And we're going to try to improve our stake like that."" On the one hand, that has general kind of speed benefits, and that allows you to have wait and sees of one second and that allows you to process transactions per second without having to do the hard work of having to figure out how to shard anything. But it does come at a high cost, which is that those systems seem to be much more prone to centralization. Like basically because even if the cost of running a validator node is non-prohibitive, if that cost is even high, like if it's even high enough to be annoying, then that creates this kind of inexcusable centralization pressure where smaller pools just aren't able to offer competitive rates of return. Larger pools are. And so people might migrate from smaller pools to larger pools over time and then the system centralizes, and that's something that I would really like to try and avoid. Another example of this is that I think a lot of these newer projects are just fundamentally not able to have a diverse set of coinholders to the same extent that Ethereum and Bitcoin are. The reason is a lot of these projects, and first of all because the kind of legal environment has become more restrictive recently, and they can't do crowd sales and ICO's, and these projects also end up wanting to get money so they get VC investments and so we have a bunch of VC's that have this very large portion of protocol tokens early on. And I think that's something that harms the perceived legitimacy of the projects when the set of coinholders is that concentrated. It also means that it's just going to have a harder time trying to get a decentralized set of stakeholders for proof of stake, whereas in Ethereum's case the coinholder set seems to be pretty diverse and pretty distributed as far as coins go which I think is a major advantage. 

K: I know I have heard you mention implementing a supply cap and the benefits of doing so; I think many people really want to see one because to most people, finite supply triggers a value mechanism in our brains. Do you think a supply cap will be implemented? and if so when and what number? 

V: So here's an interesting tension. So supply caps seem to be popular. Issuance funding for protocol public goods seems to like, and it's definitely too early to be able to tell if it will be popular but it also doesn't seem to be getting huge condemnation. If you have ongoing issuance funding then you can't have a supply cap. This is one of the examples of a trade-off between two nice things that the community will have to navigate. Another thing about a supply cap that I think it would be personally irresponsible to try and move toward a supply cap until the proof of stake system has been running for some amount of time and we have evidence that the proof of stake can run reasonably well with low levels of issuance.

K: Just wondering, when you say for some amount of time, is that months? Years? How long is that? Just to get a perspective.

V: I'm inclined to say a couple of years. It does take time for economic equilibrium to start setting in stone. Like even if you look at Bitcoin, it took five years for centralization pressures to really start hitting them on the mining side. These days the community is much larger and the centralization pressures will start happening more quickly but it's still something that we need to watch out for. 

K: Would you, I think I saw that 140 million Ether number thrown out. Would you still stick to that as a number to achieve or is that something that we should completely forget and see how proof of stake runs for a few years?

V: I think if people want a supply cap, then 140 million is a totally acheivable number. Right now, the supply is 105 million, and when proof of stake launches, maybe the supply will be 110 million. Then at some point, we will be able to cut down the proof of work mining reward. Then at some point the proof of work chain will be retired entirely. Maybe at that point the supply will be somewhere in the high 110 millions to 120. Then when that happens, you could totally just follow the same formula I added in EIP 960 and have the issuance just taper off to 140. I think that is something that totally could be done. I think going toward 120 million as the number would be aggressive but 140 million could be achievable if people want a cap. The other thing to keep in mind though is that one of the intuitive arguments I have against caps is that I feel like projects that institute caps early on, there is something dishonest to this decreasing reward schedule concept. And the reason why I feel it's kind of dishonest is that you're basically claiming two contradictory things at once. You're using the present level of issuance of the system and the systems ability to operate under the present level of issuance as a proof that the system is safe. But then you're using the fact that it has this baked in decreasing reward schedule as a proof that it's finite supply. But then if it's finite supply then the reward schedule is going to decrease and we have no evidence that the system is going to be safe under the decreased rewards. If we want a practical example of this it would be current Bitcoin fees today are about $140,000 a day and the current Bitcoin block reward is 12.5 BTC multiplied by 144 blocks which goes up to 1800 bitcoins a day which multiplied by $4,000 which is $7.2 million dollars a day. So Bitcoin going to a fees only model would decrease rewards by a factor of 50. But if you take Bitcoins mining power and divide it by a factor of 50, that's not much stronger than what ETC has, and ETC got 51% attacked. So I think in general people should view promises of supply caps, even if they are backed by angry and ideologically excited people that are extremely attached to their selling points. I think people should view them as less credible than people generally view them now. But at the same time there is this argument that Proof of Stake can achieve the same level of security much more cheaply than proof of work, and so maybe if proof of work with a supply cap can't work, proof of stake with a supply cap can work. And if he wants to do the number on that, Ethereums current transaction fees per day are something like I think 500 Ether so if you take 500 Ether multiplied by 365 days a year, you get 180,000 Ether ever year. And 180,000 Ether every year basically means like the equivilent of 0.15% annual issuance. 0.15% annual issuance with 10% of the staking, that means 10% of the staking can get 1.5% annual reward. So it's definitely not out of the question, but it's an unproven hypothesis that 10% of Eth stakers will be willing to stake, in exchange for a 1.5% annual reward. So we'll see. I think it's almost counter-productive to argue about this too much before we have clearer numbers of how many proof of stake participants are willing to participate. Then after we have those numbers, things will get a lot more interesting.

3. A breakout would happen at a $4,100 or more.

4. A negative breakdown occurs at a price under $3,850.

5. The trend is negative, and the trend reversal occurs at a price over $4,150.

6. The formation is 3 columns wide.

There is not much more to add today.  We are in this $4,100-$3,850 channel.  Its going move--one way or the other--and probably briskly.  Probably not today or tomorrow..≥

ejlab5z,bobsburger900,31,"The Japanese crypto scene is developing at an exponential rate as friendly crypto regulations are established, banks begin to launch their own stablecoins, a slew of new Japanese crypto exchanges come into play, and so much more.

The latest development to come out of the crypto-friendly nation is from the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) who will soon enable Japanese commuters and tourists alike to pay for their journeys with a variety of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

Railway Commuters to Pay with Crypto via the Suica Smartcard

According to the Japanese news program ANN News, the cloud and internet service provider IIJ is collaborating with JR East to allow travelers to pay for train tickets with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins at station shops and kiosks.

In addition to the IIJ collaboration making this venture possible, JR East has invested in the popular Japanese cryptocurrency exchange dealer DeCurret, which was recently approved by the Japanese Financial Conduct Authority (FSA).

With these connections and collaborations, JR East wants to enable customers to pay in cryptocurrencies with their Suica smartcard, which will be made possible through the DeCurret virtual currency exchange and IIJ’s expertise in connectivity and network-related services.

According to the Japanese crypto news outlet Coinpost, Managing Executive Officer of JR East, Shinobu Noguchi, said in a statement:

“JR East’s Suica operates the same settlement business, and is in a position to invest in Dikalet, and is highly expected to develop its services to create a payment infrastructure based on transport infrastructure. We started by charging and using cash, which is a general-purpose payment method, but I think that it will change greatly as the current of ‘cashless’ flows.”
Adding to this, he said that JR East wants to cater to the needs of all their customers, including those who want to pay with digital currency, which is becoming increasingly popular.

The cryptocurrencies that are currently supported and handled by DeCurret include Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP). Ethereum (ETH) will also be supported this summer. Therefore, it’s likely that the Suica smartcards will support payments in all or some of these cryptos.

As for stablecoins that are speculated to be supported, Japanese news outlet Nikkei reports that the Japanese banking giant Mizuho Financial Group (MFG) will begin to pilot Suica payments using J Coin, the bank’s own digital token pegged 1:1 with the Japanese yen.

Suica smartcards are very popular in Japan. They are accepted at over 580,000 convenience stores throughout the country, and there are said to be around 75 million cards in circulation. Therefore, once crypto payments are supported on the card it will be huge for mass adoption.

Today we broke out into an ascending triple top breakout.  This is a series of double top breakouts that occur with each bottom being higher than the previous bottom.

The thing that has me a bit excited is that we are pushing against the trend line.  We need only print a price above $4,150 and we will reverse the trend to positive.  Today we are on the trend line, so this is a rare neutral state.

I don’t mean to be a “Debbie Downer” but keep in mind the last time we broke the trend into positive territory it was back in October when the price was about $6k.  The almost immediate reversal slammed us down to about $3,000.    A repeat of that will end around $1,200.  I am not projecting that—just trying to keep things in perspective.

The breakout, it it remains, should not one significant.  We are still in a trading range and the formation is not that wide.    The $4,100 number is nice—but I think we just keep trading in this range for a while.  Volume still needs to get behind these moves.

#Technical Incompetence

* There is no evidence he's even able to code. 
* His PhD (which he claimed to have before 2015) was awarded in 2017.

ejp32m9,psswrd12345,56,"For those pay walled:

The newest enticement in the crypto world is something traditional investors know very well: interest payments.

Coinbase, a platform where users can buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is launching a program for institutional investors that will pay them a set interest rate, likely between 5% and 8%, when they park money in its custody service. The program, called “staking,” comes with a crypto twist. The interest is earned only if customers are holding certain cryptocurrencies, and the interest will be paid in those cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies [are in the dumps](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-is-in-the-dumps-spreading-gloom-over-crypto-world-11552927208?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1&amp;mod=article_inline), with prices falling and trading volume shrinking, so Coinbase and other companies are looking for ways to expand their revenue base. Coinbase, which announced the new service Friday, plans to pitch the program as a way for investors to get a set return on notoriously volatile assets. For the crypto projects themselves, it is a way to attract new backers.

Staking is based on a concept called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum are run by interconnected but independent computers. To become part of that network, users have to buy their way in. In exchange for that capital and computer power, however, they are promised a payout in newly created tokens proportionate to their investment. Coinbase’s service will take those payouts and turn them into regular, recurring payments.

Proof of stake is less energy-intensive than [bitcoin’s version](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-turns-10-still-not-all-grown-up-1540987201?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=7&amp;mod=article_inline) of this concept, called proof of work. In that version, users are required to solve a complex math riddle, which becomes harder as more users participate. The computing power required to solve the puzzle creates the underlying value, which is why bitcoin is so energy-intensive.

The goal of both proof of stake and proof of work is to give people an incentive to participate in the network, thus ensuring it is sustained indefinitely. The strategies are also meant to protect networks from malicious actors.

Because of the difference between proof of stake and proof of work, bitcoin isn’t an option for staking. Coinbase’s staking service will start with only one cryptocurrency, called Tezos, which launched last year. Other cryptos will be added later.

Coinbase is [the largest company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-expands-with-deal-for-broker-dealer-keystone-capital-1528321468?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=20&amp;mod=article_inline) in the sector to start offering this service. A startup called Staked offers a similar service, and another one was just launched by a company called Battlestar Capital. These services are essentially cooperatives using pooled capital for the staking service. Another startup, BlockFi, accepts cryptocurrencies as deposits for interest-bearing accounts and as collateral for loans.

“The industry has to evolve from just holding these things to doing interesting stuff with them,” said Sam McIngvale, head of product at Coinbase’s custody division.

Coinbase says its custody service, which launched last summer, has about $600 million in assets. Coinbase will split the staking revenue with customers, taking 20% of the newly minted cryptocurrency. The company is also exploring other ways to monetize assets in the custody service, such as collateralized lending.

Staking is the next step in Coinbase’s goal of expanding crypto-based financial services, and clients had been asking about it, Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said in an interview.

“Our mission is to build a new financial system,” Mr. Armstrong said. “To do that, we need more and more people.”",2019-03-30 08:05:34

Bitcoin has been going up for several weeks. Many altcoins have capitulated, bottomed and uptrending on their own trajectory separate from bitcoin.

But...there hasn't been an ol' fashioned dump in a long time. And I notice that when BTC goes down the tiniest bit, altcoins pause or go down doubly so. When BTC decides to dump, altcoins are going to probably get rekt but people are in BTFD mode so some good deals may come around then and only then (wow this sounds like a 2017 strategy, LOL)

I feel like I'm the only person on this planet left (from perusing discord chats and twitter) who is still bearish. I mean, the metric for me is that if we can close above 4200 and then go up and retest it as support and keep going up, I'll see the reason for the bullishness. 

But if 95% of traders suck at trading, most are fomo-ing in right now and they might even make the price go as high as 4400 before a solid dump.

Inside the container, high-powered computers generating new units of the cryptocurrency run with hardly any human supervision; they just need power—lots of it.

In what seems a perfect marriage of supply and demand, that power is coming from natural gas with nowhere to go.


Power Couple
Natural gas has become nearly free in parts of NorthAmerica, making it appealing for the mining of bitcoin,which also has lost value.

Natural-gas prices have cratered over the past few years. The market is awash in the stuff, to the point where some North American producers are setting it on fire or paying people to take it away. In some parts of Texas, natural gas is now going for less than nothing for the first time on record. More companies are now looking at productive ways to use the natural gas right at the source.

The container sits next to an oil well owned by Black Pearl Resources Inc., near the town of Marwayne, Alberta (population around 600). Black Pearl is getting a good price for its crude these days. But for all the oil the site pumps, it also pulls natural gas out of the ground, which presents a problem.

Hauling it away to sell it isn’t economically viable for a location this remote, and it can’t just dump it either. Local governments in places like Alberta have limits on how much natural gas companies can burn or release in the air—“flare” or “vent” in oil field lingo. When that level is reached, producers may be forced to shut down oil wells to avoid a buildup of natural gas.

That has turned at least one traditional oilman into a bitcoin entrepreneur. Stephen Barbour, a consultant who helps lower costs for oil field companies, last year set up the 20-foot-wide container to mine bitcoin, with a power plant attached to convert natural gas into electricity.

Stephen Barbour set up shop in the container last year.

“I knew about all the wasted energy that goes on,” says Mr. Barbour, who until a few years ago worked as a mechanical engineer for an oil company. “Reading about bitcoin mining and how it could monetize energy through the internet, I just thought that was unbelievable,” he said.

Ryan Wartman, a production foreman for Black Pearl Resources, said that channeling about 400 cubic meters of natural gas a day to the bitcoin-mining rigs in Mr. Barbour’s container helps keep the wells operating 24 hours a day.


“It was the best option for us,” said Mr. Wartman. “We’re using it to bring ourselves below the government-regulated amount that we can vent on location and keep producing oil.”

Because bitcoin mining -- a process of solving complex equations to “make” new units of the virtual currency and earn transaction fees -- is so electricity-intensive, much of it is done in remote, chilly areas with cheap power, such as windswept parts of northwestern China. When bitcoin prices exploded in 2017, mining in North America also took off.

As the digital currency’s value has plunged over the past year, inexpensive electricity has become even more crucial for miners.

Lightspeed Hosting, which runs data centers for bitcoin mining and other uses, is building a new facility in Akron, Ohio. Chief Executive Joshua Holmes said one way to cut down on electricity costs could be to build a generator and take in cheap natural gas from Appalachia, another region with more natural gas than producers know what to do with.

This year, Lightspeed has also started submerging some mining machines in mineral oil to cool them, another way to keep energy costs down.

It’s hard to keep costs any lower than in Mr. Barbour’s shipping container. “I know for a fact that I have the lowest operating cost on the planet,” he said. “But the other side of that is the capital cost.”

Natural gas that would otherwise be disposed of powers the bitcoin-mining operation.

Buying and outfitting one shipping container to handle the high power consumption can run anywhere from $45,000 to $130,000 even before installing the bitcoin-mining equipment.

For others, such an investment just hasn’t been worth it.


Dave Perrill, which powers bitcoin mining in data centers in South Dakota and Texas, said he has had to pass up offers to team up with natural-gas producers and landowners in the Permian Basin because of the infrastructure costs involved. “It wasn’t economical for us to make it work,” he said.

The digital currency has traded near $4,000 recently, down from a high of more than $19,000 in late 2017. Mr. Perrill said bitcoin prices would have to exceed $5,000 at the current level of mining difficulty for him to consider taking on excess natural gas from the Permian. (The computing power required to create each new bitcoin has increased over the years as more miners compete to create coins–and the number of coins are finite.)

Others set the break-even benchmark much higher. Last year, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jean Ann Salisbury estimated that using free natural gas would only become profitable if bitcoin prices averaged $18,788 over the next 15 years, based on initial costs of about $700,000 for the power plant, $100,000 a year in operating costs and increasing mining difficulty as time goes on.

For now, Mr. Barbour is holding on to the cryptocurrency that he creates in Alberta, only selling bitcoin when he needs to cover operating costs.

In addition to his container on Black Pearl’s oil field, he has built and sold two other units. He is working on his fourth for a team in Texas that was drilling for oil but found only natural gas.

But he has struggled to get oil-industry veterans interested in mining cryptocurrencies. In September, he showcased a rough version of his mining container at an oil show in Lloydminster, a city on the Alberta and Saskatchewan border, to a bewildered crowd.

The faith that bitcoin doesn't plummit to zero, or become worthless when a massive solar flare wipes everyone's hard drives. Or the faith in your gold investments continuing to be valuable and the price of gold not becoming as cheap as tin after Elon Musk starts asteroid mining.

The chance of either of those things happened are extremly low, but realistically speaking so is the chance that the USD falls to zero in your lifetime.

It is difficult to get to a point where the market is strong enough to slowly creep back up to the old record high that marked the top of a speculative mania. But if it is able to, another speculative bubble is almost guaranteed because if the media hype.

The psychology of the market is crazy. For example, my dad told me I should probably sell all my bitcoins at $20 because he didn't understand why they had value. When they hit $5k and amidst the media frenzy I had to talk him out of throwing his entire IRA into it.",2019-03-31 04:56:07
