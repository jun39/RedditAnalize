example: the rational person probably wouldn't have bought in to bitcoin near the start, it was an unproven and risky thing to invest in. the rational and logical move would be to buy blue chip stocks or bonds.

eju2r5t,Satoshi93,56,"Given that the vast majority of noteworthy projects market caps are &gt;.95 percent correlated to BTC,  none of the other noise matters yet. This market still leaves and breaths off the back of bitcoin. Prices and valuations don’t yet really matter or reflect reality. 

Also since most noteworthy projects in this space are all trying to change the underlying fabric of todays business models -  a massive amount of tech implementation and change management is required in all large enterprises today for any sort of real scaled solution to take form. This means time - for any technological solution. 

We’ve also yet to see any startup dapps with real usage numbers or real revenue spring up.

I believe we’re on the edge of something big. IOTAs value will trend up with the market just because it’s associated with BC / DLT technology. That does not include all of the incredible achievements they’ve made over the past 2 years. If you were willing to buy iota at $0.50, $0.84, $2.2 or even $5.5 when they had less than 30 staff, no company org structure in place, no ability to give grants, no research team, far less prototypes, no trinity wallet, no ledger support, no qubic code...then you must be confident 18 months later with all that, over 100 staff and much more!

Just my optimistic perspective.

ejul363,Lotrfanatic8,54,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

These statements are not the effect of specified hunch, of layer. In existence, I have speed various deceptions mistreatment my genius unequaled on the executable significances of my business of this member manuscription. My speech act to all of you digital knockers is that if you so want to manifest that you are brainier than I, then pose for an sophisticated moot betwixt you and me on a substance of your choosing, whatsoever time or range. My plan is selfsame flexile as I’ve already North Korean monetary unit play 4 large integer philanthropist pillages, so I’m absolutely lief to put across a pro tempore inaction to my explores, if you could equal call it that (I mull over without demurrer that divine service of your speechmaking powers will be sufficient of a difficulty for me to the sharpen wherever I will be move to record out out of my nous feignings to state the use of those vegetative cells).

I already get it on that hour of you people with your aging colligations will be fit to equalize up to my large jargon and expression, my mental sleight with side, and my muscle system powerfulness with my verbiage and speech.

That’ not to articulate I don’t empathise whatever of the teemingness of references, in reality, I AM able-bodied to understand nearly all figure one. For word of advice, one item nearly of you would give out to comment is when Susan’ Kamarupan conclusions two edition elements farther than in whatsoever of the lates subdivisions when she exposes during the rank transfer of the rank arcminute of flavor 3 installment 10.

ejvycp8,PresNixon,107,"I wrote a long post about how this likely happened, but I wrote if after there were already hundreds of comments so it's fairly well buried.

The short version is, this is probably blackmail.  Happens all the time, scammers make fake profiles on dating sites, get people to jerk off over webcam, gather a slew of sexting messages, get some private pics sent, then they threaten to release them if they don't get paid a ransom.  Odds are they sent this message to the sister because they found a FB profile but picked the wrong person as the significant other, or because they can't see the correct person due to FB privacy settings.

However, I also think it's likely the guy is being honest, that he hasn't gone to see a prostitute in years, long before OP.  The scam should have come with proof.  Heck, even if it's not a scam and it's a concerned person (I doubt that), it still should have come with proof.  Pics of the profile they claim he was using, at the very least.  Plus they claim the guy is messaging prostitutes... how would they know?  You don't see messages between two private parties on any site, be it an escort page or facebook chat. 

It sounds like a blackmail attempt, only the perpetrators are incompetent.  It's even likely in my estimation that they incorrectly matched up an anonymous ""John"" profile with a real-world ""Facebook"" profile.  

Last note: These scams are done by the tens of thousands, daily.  It's a numbers game.  They do some snaring, they do some research to see who they got, then they blast out a metric ton of ""Send us bitcoin or we will destroy your life"" posts.

(I was honestly not looking forward to summarizing this one cause he covers 20 names.)

&amp;#x200B;

""Lots of news coming out today.""

Dan addresses comments on his videos complaining of his use of US ticker names and CDN ticker names. In many more words and in a much more polite tone he basically says ""Fuck off. Learn your shit in this sector. I'm going to keep doing what I am doing. Eat shit."" &lt;-----Not a direct or even paraphrased Dan quote, just my comedic translation (fyi).

 

Talks about the largest deal in the US sector. OH being bought out by CL.

SPY raging to its highest levels in 2019 helped.

&amp;#x200B;

**CGC/WEED -** We knew the daily lower high was coming. Gap up open then pulled back. Bounced off the low from Friday but then 2% bounce then fad. Somewhat on the ropes but if bulls defend bottom again or bears get no follow through then a trend change we could see sideways action and start to climb back up. Basically, weak. (My note here: All the provincial cannabis stores have CGC product recalls for a few days now so I personally think that is what is causing this and it is only temporary but who knows.)

**APHA -** Saw some great strength and action today. Some news regarding cosmetics in Germany but Dan does not think that is the cause of this bullish move. Strange volume and closed high. Broke previous lower high which stands out from all the other Canadian LPs. Sideways on the weekly still. Keep an eye on APHA now.

**ACB -** Gap up then consolidation. Referencing his Friday video, the 4 hour inverted head and shoulders is something to watch for. Looking for a daily trend change in that follows through or else the downtrend may continue.

**CRON -** No follow through for bears or bulls. Sideways. Need to see some shift of momentum. Still in a daily downtrend but keeping an eye on it because, Dan.

**TLRY -** Bears still in control with larger bear volume. At December lows again. He thinks it will be a decent long term entry at some point in some future because of 6-7 months of consolidation now....... [\*pause\* ""Reminds me of bitcoin actually.""](https://youtu.be/U_Ng7GlhUm8?t=455)

**VFF -** News this morning and significant bounce. ""These bounces on VFF have been beautiful."" At some point these bounces will stop happening but it is not stopping anytime soon as long as the S&amp;P is staying strong. Bulls want to break high of the day tomorrow morning and he thinks a daily equilibrium will eventually form.

**TGOD -** Inverted head and shoulders forming much like ACB. Still waiting on it. Need to see a bull volume spike for that to happen but not an ideal set up at this point.

**TRST -** Daily inside bar. Bounce finally got going, if we see continuation then we know we are looking for a daily lower high to form. Dan exited part of his small position on the initial bounce. How the inside bar breaks helps us to determine which way we keep going. Need to be cautious of a bear flag forming.

**OGI -** Weekly higher low is set. Good follow through today. OGI still strong and looking up at the all time high soonish. The lack of bear follow through before was a good sign that OGI was healthy. 

**HEXO -** Still tightening up. Equilibrium. 

**PYX -** Example of breaking lower support and no bear follow through then bullish signal and heading back up. Inverse head and shoulder could be forming.

&amp;#x200B;

US name now. [He talks about OH and CL.](https://youtu.be/U_Ng7GlhUm8?t=886)

Overall, he thinks this is bullish news for the whole MJ sector because it puts MJ in the headlines again nationally and maybe internationally because of the ""biggest buyout"" headline tag.

&amp;#x200B;

**OH -** Some profit taking today after many days of running up. Bulls bought the dip. Bull volume at the end of the day.

**CL -** Ran and closed near all time high. Bulls decided at the end of the day to run things up. If it can't break the all time high then an hourly lower high will likely form.

*""OH and CL will likely move together in unison now. They are joined at the hip trading.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**LABS -** Blue sky breakout. Dan has a position with them but earnings on Wednesday. Dan does not do earnings and will be looking to take profit. Likely a run up to earnings. Already run 25% in 3 days.

**TRUL -** Nice bull break breaking upper resistance. Strong uptrend intact. Dan has a position that he entered a few days ago on consolidation. 

""Key words. Entering (long positions) on consolidation in an uptrend. Remember those words.""

**IAN -** Waiting for earnings. Earnings reaction will determine direction of where we go in the short term but still in an uptrend.

**CURA -** Still tightening up on the 4 hour time frame. Equilibrium. Look for break to determine short term direction. Significant drop in volume. Volume spike will indicate.

**CWEB -** All time high. All dips being bought up by the bulls. Big time bull. Dan looking to enter a longer position on weekly consolidation. Will day trade until that point comes because of how extended we are. But we are in blue sky breakout. Risk to reward balance to consider. 

**KHRN -** Red flag. Uptick in volume. All bears today. Cup and handle did not pan out so be on guard. Not looking good in the short term but if there is no bear follow through there is a chance of recovery. 

**HARV -** Blue sky breakout. Healthy daily consolidation last week and now a blue sky bull.

&amp;#x200B;

""Lots of blue sky breakouts. Pretty even spread of Canadian and US names.""

""Keep an eye on how the media spins the MJ sector with the buyout news. Could be good for the whole sector.""

&amp;#x200B;

Do good things.

5. Then it turns out some of the guys are ex-military, they start training the core group in guerilla warfare, espionage, demolition, the works.

ek0l5a8,DCinvestor,84,"What a day yesterday was.  It's been a long while since any of us have seen a one day gain like that.  I do recommend some emotional restraint, hard as it may be, but let us hope that this move marked an official end to the ""bear"" market.  That doesn't mean we can't go down from here back to low 100s, stay here, or go up from here and then range sideways for months.

I know that some of you might prefer ""slow, steady, and sustainable growth"" on this cycle for crypto.  Sorry, I can pretty much guarantee that's not going to happen.  Asset bubbles just don't work that way, and yes, this will bubble just like all of the previous times- since the inception of Bitcoin itself.  We're going to see big one day moves, both up and down.  Each time will feel euphoric or gut wrenching.

[Vitalik briefly discussed asset bubbles towards the beginning of this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpSRHa9lKFo)  But basically, the formation of asset bubbles is rooted very deeply in human nature.  Yes, it's about greed, and getting in on something that is rocketing up, but it's also about the ""micro-incentives"" people have to talk to each other about interesting things (both as individuals and the media), thus creating even more hype around it.

And this is also why I think there's a decent chance we'll see similar levels of potential growth to previous cycles in crypto.  For Ethereum, that means we could see anywhere from 2x all time high, to 20x (using Bitcoin in 2017 as a comparator).  People thought even $10K BTC was absurd, then their faces melted off when it shot to $20K.  Do not underestimate human greed, especially when it creates catchy media headlines and has global access.  *You don't have to expect returns that insane, but you would be naive to assume that they are impossible.*  Yes, those numbers can be *huge*, but I have little reason to believe that this time will be different.  The addressable market of crypto is still huge, and these systems have produced very little in terms of real world utility.

So is *this* going to be the cycle / bubble that will bring real utility to the masses?  To be honest, I'd say probably not.  I think some use cases which I can't fully predict may catch fire (DeFi, Security Tokens, Gaming ... no idea really).  What I do know is we now have enough smart people working on this thing, and building upon each others' efforts permissionlessly that there is potential for some amazing stuff to happen.  You can't reliable predict how a platform like this is going to be used- even 1 to 2 years out.

It also wouldn't surprise me to see this bubble inflate and then pop before Eth 2.0 is even released (although I think we'll see parts of it in the next 2 years, which is close to what I expect this cycle will last for).  Some of you may think bubbles are about real world utility.  They aren't- they're about the promise of real world utility, and speculation on that promise.  And in each bubble, a little more marginal utility is introduced, although it is never as game changing as people expected.

All of that to say is that this is unlikely to be the last crypto bubble.  Some thought 2017 was our ""dot com bust and boom.""  I have read and watched countless documentaries on the rise and bubble of the internet, and I can assuredly tell you that it was not.  And I'm pretty sure this one won't be, either.  And I think there's a decent chance that even the bubble after this one will not be ""1999 dot com bubble.""  Maybe the one after that- sometime in the mid-to-late 2020s when this technology is being used at scale for important purposes.

Anyway, this isn't financial advice.  I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I have a decent idea of what we might expect over a period of multiple years, which is why I remain a long term investor.",2019-04-03 20:50:40

ejyet02,MattAbrams,68,"There's a lot of talk around here of miners selling coins and shorting.

I've stated many times that a major reason prices stayed low was because miners needed to look towards staying in business.  As prices declined, more and more bitcoins were sold.  We owe $30,000 in expenses every month - which means we sold just 1/8 of every block last year and 5/6 this year.  But unlike us, there are some companies that stupidly hired hundreds of employees and which assumed that the last bubble was permanent.

The expenses for all those employees are fixed regardless of bitcoin price, so what was happening was that as prices fell, miners sold more bitcoins and the cycle gets amplified.  Prices would only turn around when a lot of mining manufacturers and pools failed, causing mining to continue with other businesses that had lower expenses (and less coins to spend or sell.)

We saw this happen recently.  Bitmain fired hundreds of employees, and there was a huge Monero pool that closed, among other things.  The remaining miners have much lower expenses and are able to save more money.  As prices rise, they will sell even fewer bitcoins, and so on.

It seems to me that enough pools have now failed that the cycle can reverse.  I know that next Sunday, we will be selling 4 bitcoins, instead of the 5 we sold last Sunday.",2019-04-03 01:08:58

CNBC saying bitcoin surged 15% over night because of an April Fool's joke.

No this is actually great. Im not being sarcastic. The MSM wants to continue to discredit crypto until they deem the ""time is right"", and they can tell joe schmo to buy in. You can tell how pathetic their attempts are when they are saying the markets are so ridiculous and untrustworthy that they follow April Fool's jokes. 

This is a classic example of media manipulation, not wanting to alert the masses yet and to discredit any pumps until the stage is set. 

This is great for us. Because when they do start to change their tune, then the masses will be indoctrinated into crypto as the ""new stocks"" of today.

ek208ba,andytoshi,39,"There is a [branch of the Bitcoin BIP repo](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) with a proposal for Schnorr signatures, but it has not been assigned a number (and as far as I know, Pieter has not even asked for a number or PR'd the branch). We refer to this document as ""BIP-Schnorr"" with the expectation that it will get a number and will be part of a larger proposal.

By itself BIP-Schnorr is not very interesting. It describes an elliptic-curve based signature scheme, how to encode these signatures, how to compute and validate them, etc., but says nothing about how they'd be used in a Bitcoin context.

In practice we expect Schnorr signatures to come along as part of Taproot, which will be an entirely new Bitcoin output version, and include several other changes, including
* elimination of the non-`VERIFY` signature-checking opcodes, which prevent batch verification but otherwise have no use
* a replacement of `CHECKMULTISIG` threshold-signature opcode, which is currently inefficient to encode and inefficient to validate
* MAST (replacement of `OP_IF` and friends with the ability to just selectively expose only the parts of a Script you want to satisfy), which improves privacy and scalability for almost no technical cost, so why not
* improved sighashing modes which cover some limitations with the current Segwit sighash scheme (described in BIP143) and which will also introduce some form of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, which is a technical requirement of some future directions of the Lightning network

None of the things I've described have BIP numbers and I'm not sure how they'll be partitioned into separate BIPs. There's something of a tradeoff between throwing everything in one big proposal and having nobody read it, and overwhelming the community with a dozen proposals and having nobody read them :).

Right now there's a group of several people working on this collection of proposals, including myself, and we hope to have them ready for community review (including having actual documents written up which we can request BIP numbers for, having working code for the proposals, working code for things that the proposals support, etc) Real Soon Now.

I'm sorry that I can't give any more precise dates than that.

These bots have limited capital liquidity, so while they're able to keep the price nearly constant in the face of low-volume bear/bull markets, once the volume saturates their available liquidity they are ineffectual and the price changes dramatically, releasing the pent-up pressure that was building in the weeks or months prior.

When there are a lot of transactions, if your fee is small, then your transaction might float out there for days, weeks, months, indefinitely. 

But when there aren't a lot of transactions floating out there to get picked up, your fee can be small (even non-existent) and you have no trouble getting on a block. As more transactions are sent, a backlog builds up. That's the mempool.

At the same time was the first time where Ethereum transactions per day passed Bitcoin and hasn't come down since.  Litecoin also saw this same benefit and had some of its bull runs begin when Bitcoin transactions were backlogged.

2. During very heavy backlogs you can actually see prices decline immediately after a block confirms after a long wait(and bounce back up during empty periods).  The whales pay the highest fees for inclusion and sell soon after the coins are credited; Traders recognized this and front-run their sells.  You can see the reverse effect early in the bull run by prices rising on Sunday night / Monday morning and falling over the weekends (no new fiat coming in to buy).
3. Unreliability tends to drive users and businesses away over a long period of time.  This hurts Bitcoin especially but it also is going to hurt the perception that the rest of crypto has.  Steam leaving and not returning is one example of this.  Another example is how virtually every payment processor now supports multiple coins, whereas in early 2017 they almost all supported only Bitcoin.

I don't think the backlogs have any effects on the medium-term trading.  None that I have been able to notice and track anyway.  Bring on the downvotes, I know they are coming.",2019-04-05 08:32:33

What if said person were part of a conspiracy to manipulate the price of bitcoin across several exchanges, and then decided to double-cross their co-conspirators and and make off with the bitcoin and some residual fun bux, I'd bet the co-conspirators would be pissed and do everything they can to stop him, including freezing said fun bux.

ek6hdv0,rundmcarlson,40,"Your gains are only 40x, and they will be taxable as soon as you cash out. At average US income levels (assuming US because why not) you'd be looking at about $1200 per paycheck before taxes, maybe 1k after. Of that 1k, we have to assume you only have 30% discretionary income once your living expenses are taken into account (if that). So you could put roughly 650 per month into bitcoin, which would buy about 1 bitcoin per month for 3 years. Thats 36 bitcoin. In year 4, bitcoin skyrockets and you probably would be lucky to get one with the money you earn, so youd end up with 37 bitcoin to sell at roughly 20k each, which is 740k. This 740k would be taxed at 20% since youd have held most of these bitcoin for more than a year, which would leave roughly 600k. While that certainly is a significant amount of money, its not the kind of money people think of when they think of bitcoin. You have to have gone back much further to make millions or more on bitcoin.

ek74f19,Blue_Ridge_Tiger,67,"Almost 15 years my dude.  I remember raiding Habbo Hotel. I remember the first unified attempts of the ""Anonymous"" days, attacking the Church of Scientology, Boxxy, the AnonOrange fuckwad, the Fix News ""SUPER HACKERZ"" television special....

Those were the real glory days of the internet, back when it was the true wild west. Pretty much every one under the age of 24, and most under the age of 30, know little to nothing about rhose days.

That was back when dialup had died and given way to high speed broadband, ethernet, wifi, etc. The natural restrictions of dial-up had ended, people basically free and unrestricted on the internet. There was about a 10 year window in the 2000's where anything could pass on the internet, and the greater population and regulatory bodies and lawmakers either werent aware, or lacked the experience and the logical ability to figure out how to define it and regulate it. You cab only pass laws and policies on things if you can properly define them legally. And the internet 2.0 was born in an age where our leaders were still stuck in dial up mentalities, or earlier. The people forging ahead on the internet were the last of Gen-x and the first wave of Millennials, with some lonely or savvy Boomers mixed in here and there. But, the people making the laws and regulating us were old farts that graduated college before the perso al computer was even around. They didnt understand the internet, and outside of the FBI and NSA, law enforcement had virtually zero knowledge as to how they could regulate anythibg online.

The result was arguably the greatest example of a ""wild west"" environment you've ever seen. Sure, there were bad people doing bad things, but the freedom it provided was an amazing vehicle for communicating, spreading information, and comnecting to people around the world. People were able to communicate on a scale greater than any government could control, and doibg so enabled so many new innovations, types of thought, spread of ideas, and expansion of human rights. Criminals were exposed through onkine vigilantes, age-old institutions who existed on ignorance and propaganda were broken down, currencies were invented, human rights efforts grew at unprecedented rates, even governments and military institutions who were abusing their citizens were exposed, compromised, and even digitally sabotaged the great efforts by free people across the globe excercising their freedom through this new vehicle which no man  or government could control.

In one day, you could share pictures of your cats, laugh at these new things called memes, mine for bitcoin while avoiding taxes, order some LSD from the Silk Road, help spread documents exposing corruption in yours or someone else's government, and then help an anonymous group of computer saavy, collaborative independent actors over the internet find child predators and expose them to the FBI simply because you wanted something to chuckle at.

I've never seen such an explosive, or expansive vehicle for human thought and creativity. Neither has the rest of the world *in the entirety of human history*. We got to see the birth of the internet and, in a very short period, some of us got to experience the *free* internet. Totally wide open, vast, unregulated...a wild frontier with unlimited sharing of information. Although prying eyes of ""Big Brother"" and Governments could watch, seldom could they understand, and rarely could they intervene. The citizens of the internet were virtually free do live as they pleased online, and it came with a level of unprecedented freedom that only comes about in rare moments in human history, and is only really experienced by a few.

Sadly, governments and regulators have wised up. A new generation has come into power and with it comes a better understanding of the technology. Even if they dont understand it, they know how to define it, and they have greater access to all the resources they need to intervene. Now, entire countries get blocked or censored, regulatory bodies comb information to prohibit what they deem unacceptible to the State, some meme's are being responded to with criminal prosecution, and regulators and activist constantly mount pressure against tech companies to be more proactive in regulating and restricting speech and information. The red tape is being drawn more and more across the internet, and every day it becomes more and more sterile and controlled.

Those 10-12 years in the 2000's when Web 2.0 became mainstream was an amazing era in human history because of the vast freedom it offered. It truly was one of those ""last frontier"" eras. Both the good and the bad, I'm glad I got to see that era it in its entirety and I lament that it is now all but gone.",2019-04-06 04:12:10

For IOTA, I'm going to explain like you're 5. Since anything that sends or receives IOTA, is a machine, we can make each party of the transaction do a little bit of mining. So instead of the users paying miners to verify transactions and secure the network, each user can spend a negligible amount of electricity to do a tiny bit of ""mining' themselves.

ekb8zjs,NoahElowyn,5404,"I must confess, when the bitcoin hit $15k I was tempted to sell. I had bought a ton of them the moment they first appeared, guided by the an odd call decades ago. For people like me, who care little about those slow-earning stocks, and love the adrenaline a good bet on a highly volatile company provides, every little hint of information, no matter how ridicule, was enough for me to spend my savings.

The green numbers were my drug, and the red ones my motivation to invest more. Diversification they said, and I laughed at them when $MU sky-rocketed.

But I'm straying away. You see, if I sold bitcoin when it reached  $15k I would've been set for life, but one does not simply ignore a call from someone telling you that he wanted to get bitcoin at $200k. That's a sort of legal insider information, despite how untrue it could be.

Of course, as you may know, the bitcoin plummeted, and new cryptocurrencies rose. I won't lie, I was panicked back then, and almost sold at $5k, but I forbid myself to do such a stupid thing. I knew it was going to rise, and it was going to rise like nothing the market had seen before.

And then it hit $1k, and the ramen noodles were making me sick. Still I waited, tear after tear, thinking about the amount of money I had lost, and how the people in the online forums called me names, and paid their respects with the letter F.

But then it happened. It rose slowly but steadily. The moment I saw this, I bought at $2K, and kept it. When it reached $15k again, my mind screamed to sell and stop the stress. But the stress is what made me feel alive, and so I held onto my bitcoins.

Two years later, it hit $199k, and the phone rang again.

""Hey man, this phone disconnected or something. Can I buy below $200k?""

I frowned. This was the call from all those decades ago. The call that started it all. ""What do you mean the phone disconnected? It's been 30 years since we spoke.""

The man laughed. ""Yeah sure, that coffee you are *drinking* must be quite strong. Now, can talk business, please?""

Confused, but interested, I played his game. Perhaps he would accidentally give me the key to make another fortune. ""You can buy for sure below $200k. It's at $198k right now. But do you think it will keep rising?""

""Keep rising? Absolutely not. It will hit $205k and then plummet to cents. I just want to buy, hold and sell when it reaches $204k.""

""I see. Well, I can make the operation for you. I just need your data.""

There was no answer. Once again, the phone had disconnected.

Without a doubt, when it hit $204k I sold, and secured a fortune that would last for centuries. I became the richest man in the world, and became an angel investor, losing fortunes in failing startups.

But as thing goes, a young man approached me one day and pitched his invention. It was a telephone he claimed could communicate with the past. Everyone rejected him, for he had no proof that it worked, and it worked for a handful of seconds only.

I bought every patent and license the man had. He scampered happily away with his money, and I, as a good businessman, reserved the technology just for me.

I grabbed the phone, and dialed a very old number.

That had been three offices ago, the paintings on the wall had all changed from neo-futurismic cubist bullshit that looked like the artist had pulled the pictures straight out of a homeless person's fevered schizophrenic dreams to tasteful art where the faces were blurred and the features dribbled off like running wet ink.

The wall paper had changed from ducky yellow to my current firm's brutalist pink, a call back to the formative days the big boss had spend in a russian prison, wishing for a single speck of colors on the walls.

It'd also been twenty years, and bitcoin was currently on the massive decline. I'd invested smartly into it while it was fledgling and easy, and made my fortune speculating off of it. I should've expected the reaper would come to call in eventually. 

The rolex on my wrist ticked towards 3 pm, about time for the meeting.

Then I had a phone call.

But now, with caller id, all I got was

JEFFFF

on the other end of the line.

""There we go, yes yes, I am right back!"" Jeffff said. ""Can I get some of that bit coin? U-under 200k. I hear you you you have some some.""

""What."" I said. This... this could be great. He could say something else, and I could run off of that. I could solidify my position among the higher echelons with that knowledge. Get in on space programs. Have my names on highschools.

I listened with bated breath.

""Yes-yes Oh-oh!"" Jeffff said. ""This phone is is inn--inaccurate for these porpoises.""

I sent a quick prayer to god, because his voice was skipping across the connection like a damn rock.

""Yes, I'm afraid you'll have to call back when you get a better phone,"" I said, crossing my fingers. ""What did you want?""

""B-b-b-bit coin."" Jeffff warbled. ""Bit-bit-biiiiiiiiiii-""

The call kicked off. I breathed out, let out that breath I'd been holding, and leaned back in the chair. Okay. That was weird.

I guess I could look forward to that in twenty years if I wasn't dead.

I stared up at the clock on the wall and counted off the seconds. The lights flickered overhead.

Odd.

They flickered one after another, instead of in unison. From the door to the window. I flicked my gaze across them, and then over to the window as well.

The parking lot was flickering. There weren't any lights on in the parking lot mind you, because it was still the middle of the say, but the light was flickering across it.

What?

I looked up towards the horizon.

The sun flickered like a candle wick. In and out of existence, leaving only a black paralyzing void in it's place.

The phone screeched from my pocket. ""B-b-it coin.""

I threw it against the wall and looked back up. The screen shattered. I could buy another one.

The sun had doubled in size, and the black void flickered in and out of cognization, casting massive world bending shadows.

There wasn't anyone in the parking lot to stare at the impossibility overtaking it all. A car blipped out of existence as the light touched it, and then didn't reappear when the sun flickered again.

I swallowed and shuttered the window, looking back at my desk. The computer screen was covered in ads for cryptocurrency. My monitoring software screeched and clicked and hissed warning signs, plastering my screen like the winning screen of solitaire.

I shut the lid on the laptop and caught my breath. Right. I'm hallucinating. Great. Just what I needed. All the pressure of trying to convince people I knew what I was doing instead of taking advantage of tips from a creepy phone call had sent me utterly barmy.

The intercom system turned on, though smoke poured out of the speaker across from me. ""200k or no deal though.""

Oh no.

""Can I- Ca-can I-""

No no no no no.

Every floor was carpeted to reduce noise. After all, this was a money making institution, they needed absolute concentration to catch onto micro market fluctuations according to the reductive algorithms. If someone mis bought, they could lose out.

Too many losses and well.

The company didn't keep losers for long.

But I could hear the foot steps crunching down the hallway. What the hell was it crunching on?

I reached under my desk, felt around for the duct tape, and pulled it free. The gun was odd and warm in my hands, it rested right on the opposite side of where the laptop's exhaust played, and it'd caught some of it. I checked it over. Made sure the safety was flicked off. My arms were shaking.

Calm Pat, come on, you have this. What the hell would Jeffff even do?

I peered down into the hallway. The carpet fibers had crystallized into fine glass, unable to bend or move from their place.

They crunched underfoot like ice. The lights flickered overhead, and then gave up on giving light off at all, instead providing only hazy darkness and snow like a television screen. It crackled, hissed, and burned my skin as I stepped out.

""200k or no deal tho,"" Jeffff hissed seductively down the hallway. ""Porpoises.""

We met, eye to eye. He had no face. Only a smear that drooled down his neck, an eye wetly hanging from his chin, running down into static. His mouth was open, a tongue lolling free, having fallen and pooled across the cavity of his collarbone. 

""Bitcoin,"" Jeffff murmured. ""I wanna have some of that-""

I opened fire. Maybe it was stupid, knee jerk moment, maybe I had killed someone but-

The thing was, when the bullets sprayed out of the other side of his body, all that came out was endless  chain, linked to buzzing black squares. Mouths and eyes formed out of the wounds, holding position before melting off the back of the black body entity.

""I want bit coin, Pat,"" Jeffff whispered. ""No deal.""

Wall St made a ton of money the last bubble with their short positions. You think they won’t do it again? 

A single buy order drove Bitcoin up 25% in less than a week. You bet they will do another pump and dump at some point.

ekbawxd,resonatingfury,92,"""What the fuck is a bit-coin?"" I asked, writing her number down. Gotta make sure the spam call list stays up to date. 

""Ah, have you not heard? It's like digital money that no one can see, but everyone wants to buy anyway because they don't understand it. Look it up on your phone.""

I scrunched my nose. ""How am I supposed to do that? Phones are for calling, idiot.""

The call suddenly clicked, leaving me confused and hungry. I shrugged, and got a sandwich. 

That was fifteen years ago. Of course, when I heard about the insane rise of bitcoin recently, and saw how many people were buying in, I had a lot of questions. Who was that mysterious caller, and how could he have known? Why call me, asking to buy some? 

I didn't really care, though, because I had insider trading information that no one could prove. I bought six whole BTC when it was at $10k, and eagerly awaited my payout. 

We all know how that went for me. 

Once it dropped to $3k, I was sitting in my office on a late night. Just eating some pizza, watching crypto crash, when another call came in. The same number I'd pinned to my cubicle wall fifteen years prior. 

""*Ahem*. Hello, good sir. I just called a few moments ago, inquiring about Bitcoin, but the call disconnected. As I was saying-- do you have some bitcoin? I don't want to pay more than $200k!""

I slammed a fist on the table, stood up, loosened my tie, and just... screamed. ""FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME, ASKING TO BUY BITCOIN, AS IF IT ISN'T A DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY? WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A HODL FAIRY? YOU CAN TRANSCEND TIME BUT NOT LOG INTO BITTREX? GO BUY YOUR OWN FUCKING BITCOIN.

""SECONDLY, I DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT KIND OF MIND-BENDING POWERS YOU HAVE THAT TRANSCEND TIME, BUT STOP USING THEM TO DOWNLOAD MONEY. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THE BLOCKCHAIN IS, BARBARA? DO YOU?""

""Well now, please calm down Mr. Gr--""

""NO, GET YOUR TIME-TRAVELING, FOMO ASS OUT OF HERE. I BET YOU'D KEEP YOUR BITCOIN ON A SITE WALLET, WOULDN'T YOU, BARBARA? WOULDN'T YOU?""

The line was silent for a moment, buzzing, before she spoke again. ""...wow, it's that bad huh? How much did you lose?""

""NOT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.""

""I see. I apologize for bothering you. Well, my friend, I have a great opportunity for you-- would you like to buy some Ethereum for only five thousand a piece? It's going to be what Bitcoin could nev-""

I ripped my phone out of the wall and threw it through the window.

Each project is also limited by the foundational layer that it builds as it's base protocol (hence you cannot do smart contracts on Bitcoin.

Remember also that once crypto communities get big (like in Bitcoin's case), the community becomes very very resistant to big changes in the protocol (remember the block size debate).  For all of these reasons you cannot just throw all the best technology together.

Also, there are other fundamentals that cannot just be switched around, such as the actual people developing it, their amount and quality of business relationships, how the project is socially interpreted and the type of fanbase.

Here is how they look today:

[https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, there has been an unusual reversal in the trend of coin dispersion. To be particular,

1. On April 1st, % of BTC held in addresses less than 1BTC were 4.34%. Now it is 4.3%. There have very few times in last year when this number has decreased and that too by so much in just a week.
2. Number of addresses with balance more than 0.01BTC has decresed from 6956091 to 6916321. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most notably, you can see that this has happened due to an increase in number of addresses addresses and balance held in addresses with balance 100 to 1000 BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

Which essentially means a lot of BTC has been sucked in during last week by people with balances 100 to 1000 BTC at the expense of people holding lower amounts of BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, there is every indication that the last week has resulted in an increased concentration of BTC with heavy holders. This is not what I consider as an organic trend that results in sustainable price increase. Sustainable increase comes from many more lower balance holders and not from few heavy holders.

But the other economic fact that bitcoin demonstrated in the last 8 years is that the only people who would benefit from a decentralized payment system are criminals.

And the third economic fact that bitcoin demonstrated in the last 7 years is that mining will inevitably become centralized in a handful of companies, maybe even one.  So a decentralized payment system fails just on its own.

""Um, hi,"" the far away voice on the other end stammers, ""I'm looking to put a substantial amount of money into Bitcoin, about $680k worth if the price is below $200k, can you help me out?""

""Is that one of those new new tech companies?  Lots of IPO's and private placement going on in tech.  What is Bitcoin?  Is that American?  Japanese?"" I ask as I scribble it down in the corner of my notepad.

There was only silence.  The line was dead.

""Ok then,"" I say as I hang up the phone.  ""This new internet thing sure is bringing out the crazies,"" I yell out to Aileen.  I can hear her laugh through the glass.  Sometimes I cant tell if she's laughing with me or at me.   I decide to get back to work on the Rosenberg Estate plan.


SUMMER 1998

Aileen dropped off the mail around 11:30.  New issues of Fast Company, the Economist and Wired had come in along with 4 AOL trials, 2 on CD and 2 on Floppy.  I liked it when they sent the floppy disks, I could use those.  I had a whole drawer full of those things.  They were handy.  CD's were worthless though.  They made terrible coasters.  I know because I tried.  That foil shit would lift from the substrate and get all over the place if you put a Coke on them.  I guess it was the future.  I just found them exponentially annoying.  The floppies at least had some value.

I start looking at the Economist when the phone rings.

""Clearvest, John speaking,"" I said as I answered the phone.

""Hi again, sorry for the disconnection,"" said the strange and tinny voice on other end.  It was that crazy dude.

""Oh hey, you're the guy that called about....Bitcoin or whatever, right?"" I said.

""Ya, do you know what the price is?  I'd like to buy about $680k worth if I can.  Is the price still under $200k?"" he asks.

""Man, I don't know what the hell that is.  Is that some new company that is IPO'ing?"" I ask.

""It's a digital currency.  It's THE digital currency."" he says, ""This might sound strange, but what year is it?""

""It's fucking 1998 dude, what year do you think it is?"" I reply.

""Give me a second,"" He says as he muffles the phone and I hear him yell to someone ""It's fucking 1998.  It called 1998.  That's like 10 years before the first version.""

He returns and says ""Look, this is going to sound really weird but in about 10 years there's going to be an economic crash.  Some anonymous programmer is going to release a software that creates a digital currency called Bitcoin in response to it.  Horde as much of it as you can.  Because about 12 years after that, around 2020ish, the global economy is going to completely implode.  The only thing that will hold any value around the world is Bitcoin.""

""Look man,"" I say, frustrated, ""I don't have much tolerance for bullshit.  I have a lot of clients with real money that pay for my time.  The last thing I need is some paranoid schizophrenic telling me about some fake digital currency of the future.  I deal in real investments and financial planning.""

I hear him mumbling to someone again on the other end.  ""He thinks I'm a fucking nutjob.  I mean, I would too.  It's 1998.  Get the address.""

""Are you there? I ask more than a little annoyed.

""Ya.  I'm here John.  My name is Aaron Stafford, I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself before.  I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm actually calling from 2033,"" he says.

I bust out laughing.  ""Oh that's good.  Is that you Jeff?  You fucking with me again?""

""No, my name is Aaron.  I'm actually living down in South America and it's 2033.  I'm living in a community just outside the Guarani Aquifer in Paraguay.  No bullshit.  You're in the heydey of the internet tech boom.  Have you heard about Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing yet?  Things get really interesting once they come on the scene.  They make a lot of this stuff possible.""

""Ok 21st century digital boy, how bout you give me some stock tips and make this worth my while,"" I challenge him.

""I'l tell you what.  If I do and they pay off, do you promise to buy 10,000 Bitcoin sometime around 2010 and transfer it to my address?  They shouldn't cost you much at all if you buy around then.""

""Sure,"" I say, because fuck it, what did I have to lose?

""Ok,"" Aaron says, ""In 1998 you're going to want to buy Apple.""

I burst out laughing again.  ""Apple's about to go bankrupt!"" I say.

""Jobs comes back.  Microsoft puts them on life support with like a $350M placement.  They end up taking over the tech industry around 2007 with smart phones.""

Sure enough, Jobs had just come back and was making cuts to Apple's business.  Maybe he did know something.

""I need more than that,"" I say.

""Ok, Amazon is something you should buy too.  They dominate online retailing in the future.""

""I already have some of them,"" I say because I had just bought some after the IPO last year.

""Buy more.  Buy a lot more,"" Aaron said.  ""And Google.  You probably don't know who they are.  Maybe around 2003.  Buy a lot of them.  And Sell Yahoo if you have them.  They don't make it.""

I keep scribbling notes on my pad.  I'm a sucker for stock tips, especially with this dot com boom going on.

""Anything else?"" I ask.

""Netflix.  They're still probably doing mail order DVD's but they are going to transition at some point to streaming video over the web.  But they only do well for about 15-20 years before they get crushed by Disney.""

""Ok, so if these pan out, how much is 10,000 Bitcoin going to cost me?"" I ask.

""Well,"" Aaron says, ""if you can get in around July of 2010, maybe about $80.  Would you be willing to send it to an address if I give you one?""

""Address?"" I ask.

""Yea, each Bitcoin wallet has an address like computers have an IP.  I can give you my wallet address and my buddy here is convinced that we'll see the funds on our end,"" Aaron says.

""What about the $680k you were talking about?"" I ask

""That's kind of tricky to get to you given the, umm, circumstances.  You should be able to make millions if not billions on the tips I give you.  All I ask is you buy about $80-$100 of Bitcoin in June of 2010.  It's very important you don't put it off because the price starts escalating quickly after that.  And youll want some for yourself too because those stocks we talked about earlier are going to crater in the 2020s.""

""OK,"" I say.  ""I'll tell you what, if this Apple pick pays off, because right now it looks like they are at death's door, I'll do it.  Do you want to give me the address?""

""Ok, this is a long ass string of characters.  It's important you get this right.  Let me know when you're ready."" Aaron says.

""Ready right now,"" I say, listening intently.

""Ok my address is:  33jNuGa7Nazi6mWT9DaX11iETyYvicRCXR.  Read it back to me."" Aaron says.

""Ok, 33jNuGa7Nazi6mWT9DaX11iETyYvicRCXR.  Is that right?"" John asks.

""Yea, sounds right."" Aaron says and muffles the phone again and tells his friend to check the balance in the background.

""Holy shit John.  Thank you so much.  You have no idea what this means to me and my family.""  Aaron says back.  ""Like, seriously, thank you.""

""Thanks for what?"" John asks, confused.

""For following through."" Aaron replies.  ""And look, you're going to want to move out of the US by 2020.  I'd suggest buying land in Paraguay, by us, near the Guarani Aquifer.  Do that before you even buy Google in 2003.""

""Why's that?"" John asks

""Just trust me.  Water is going to be more valuable than gold.""  Aaron says.  ""Good luck John.  Thanks again.""

""Alright Aaron, sure, no problem."" I say.  ""Take care of yourself.""

Aaron disconnects before John can hang up the phone.

ekdj9ui,nowitsalllgone,43,"&gt; Can we have a civilized discussion about LN and block size?

Probably not, but let's try anyway.

&gt; I like the idea of LN but it seems that it's not ready yet.

True. 

&gt; What worries me is that I am reading a lot of articles in the ""other camp"" about how important it is for LN to have blocks that can handle the traffic.

It's not ready yet. We shouldn't scale the blockchain until the network is ready for mass adoption. It's not ready yet. All the proposals to bring on mass adoption right now involve getting everyone to run a wallet on their phone, not a node in their home. This means that a comparatively small number of full nodes would be securing the network for all the phone wallets. This is an enormous security compromise with potentially catastrophic effects for the whole network. Phone wallets need to be connected to a secure and large network of economically relevant full nodes. We need to keep the ratio of full nodes to phone wallets high, and until we can do that we must not try to scale up.

&gt; Since we can see that people are becoming enthusiastic again about Bitcoin, discussing this thing is of utmost importance.

No one is opposed to increasing the blocksize when the network is large enough for a capacity increase. But it's not. Those who want to scale now don't seem to realize the dangers of putting everyone on a phone wallet. Phone wallets do not validate the rules of the bitcoin network, they merely hold private keys. Instead of validating the rules, they trust third parties to validate the rules, keep them connected to the network, and give them valid information about what transactions have been sent to the user's wallet. Usually, these third parties are either the wallet maker (who runs a full node that all of his users' wallets are connected to), the electrum network (which is currently under a denial of service attack because it is a weak point in the network), or the miners (in the case of SPV wallets).

All of these methods of running phone wallets are open to a variety of attacks. Remember when the majority of the miners wanted to break off and form a separate network (segwit2x)? That is just one demonstration of the insecurity of SPV wallets, which trust miners to give them valid information. Relying on the electrum network is also increasingly difficult because of denial of service attacks and the sybil problem. DoS attacks on electrum servers are designed to overload the cpus of the volunteers who run electrum servers with requests for information. The result is that ""real"" users have a hard time finding a server that can actually give them information. There's also a high prevalence of scam servers which refuse to relay transactions but merely tell you to visit scam sites and download a coin-stealing malware. Since it is easy to set up an electrum server, many scammers are doing so, which is a quintessential sybil problem. Then there's the option of just using a wallet that connects to the wallet maker's node. This is the most common type of wallet, and it's insecure because the node operator for that batch of wallet users then controls what network his users are on and what rules he's validating. A wallet operator who controls his users' connection can feed them false data or censor their transactions.

All of the above reasons are why our scaling priority needs to be: help more people run full nodes. That's the only way to give the network a secure foundation for the future. Getting everyone to run phone wallets is not a scaling solution, instead it creates a massive scaling problems and security vulnerabilities. A big reason for keeping the block size low right now is because the network is not ready to scale and won't be until running a full node is easy enough that there's a high ratio of full node operators to phone wallet users.",2019-04-08 17:48:50

No, that ship has sailed. Well, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is sailing. BTC-Titanic is sinking.

In the BTC world, it's been taboo to speak about technology since at least August 2015:

ekd9ky3,x_FatKitty_x,40,"Checks are, relatively, a very slow and ungainly method of payment. When your bank takes the check they have zero idea if the check is real, fake, real but from an account with no money in it, etc. The only way I know of to get a check verified is to go to the host bank (if it's a Wells Fargo check, go to Wells Fargo) and cash it in person. 

Checks take as short as 1 business day, and as long as 7, to clear the maker account (assuming it's all domestic).

But banks, as a courtesy to their customers, will generally release some or all of the funds early. Most checks are legitimate, so banks try to release your money early as a convenience factor for you. To be 100% clear, *just because you can withdraw the money does NOT mean the check cleared. At all.*

You will probably pay a bounced check fee (in US it's $10-$25) and the bank's loss mitigation department might call you to see what happened. No other ramifications. It's very good your bank held the check, because had you withdrawn the cash and sent it by Bitcoin, you would probably be on the hook for $700 unless Canada has some very generous consumer protection law covering this instance (which is unlikely).",2019-04-08 13:47:46
ekbqlis,jtoomim,40,"Writing blocks to disk is sequential. Checking transaction validity is not.

You need to use SSDs for the UTXO set. This is `~/.bitcoin/chainstate/*`. The UTXO set is a LevelDB map (i.e. prefix tree) of all (TXID, index) -&gt; (output script, value) mappings for the currently unspent transaction outputs. Reading and writing to the UTXO set is the main bottleneck on syncing a full node from scratch unless you cache the whole thing in RAM. The UTXO set size increases with larger blocks and increases over time. Right now, with 1 MB blocks on BTC, we have a UTXO set size of about 3.1 GB on disk, or about 8 GB in RAM. With 1 GB blocks, after a few years we would use about 3 TB of SSD space or 10 TB of RAM.

Processing these UTXOs will require handling an average of about 30k database reads and 15k writes per second. Each read and write can require multiple SSD accesses (trees are O(n log n), so total throughput requirements for the disk array might be 450k random access IOPS. This is well beyond HDD speeds, and beyond even mid-range SSDs. [That kind of performance](https://www.storagereview.com/liqid_element_aic_review_768tb) isn't cheap to get. This requirement can be reduced if you use a ton of RAM as a UTXO cache (i.e. using the `-dbcache=xxxxxx` command-line option, but this would probably require hundreds of GB or terabytes of RAM to be effective.

Your bandwidth usage numbers are also off by a substantial margin. Most of the node's bandwidth isn't used by sending and receiving transactions; it's used by *announcing* those transactions or uploading historical blocks. If a node has 100 peers, it only has to send and receive a (e.g.) 400-byte transaction once on average, but it has to announce that 32+8 byte TXID (with the lowest possible overhead) 50 times. This means the node will use 4 kB for announcing the transaction, but only 0.8 kB sending and receiving it. If we assume that the average full node operates for about one year, then your node will have each historical block requested from it on average once per year.  This becomes more burdensome as each year passes. The first year, you would upload historical blocks at 0.5 times the bandwidth used for transactions in current blocks. During the second year, it would be 1.5x. During the tenth year, it would be 9.5x.",2019-04-08 02:23:41

china's real motive is  to tie up ways for people to move their money out of china.  upper middle class chinese who fears the eventual economic depression caused by their housing bubble has been trying to transfer their assets over seas for years.  

this mostly comes in forms of buying up real estate in the west.  slowly china has been tightening how much money people can withdraw money from their own bank accounts, to exchange into  other currencies.  

atm, i believe each individual can only wire up to 10k USD per month out of china, up to 50k per year.  therefore the people that want to buy real estate over seas has to convince a whole lot of friends and family to essentially cheat the system by having them wire money under their names.  or smuggle cash into hongkong or macau, then find someone with an existing canto bank account to do the wire for them.  all this comes at great risk, because if the government finds out, they take it all.

the ultra rich chinese have  even more ways to get their money out of china, but thats a deep rabbit hole.

crypto currencies have been the other common way for chinese to get their money out, which is why it's been illegal to use or deal in bitcoins in china for years, and there exists no legal way to cash out with bitcoins in china.  the government has been actively cracking down on illegal chinese ran website that use bitcoins as well.  plus it has  fallen out of favor naturally due to the inherent volatility in bitcoin prices to begin with.",2019-04-09 21:25:49

I have actually been thinking about writing a short summary of my experience here, or a ""thank you,"" so inspired by his example, here goes.  

I came to this space about two years ago. I remember buying my first ETH at about $250 or so. I had bought my first Bitcoin a few weeks earlier, together with some Litecoin. Over the summer, I studied the Ethereum ecosystem and increasingly became interested in the possibilities this new technology would enable. I started asking (dumb) questions on this sub, figuring out how to secure my coins, what a fork means (how the politics of the Bitcoin fork played out), what scaling problems needed to be solved, et cetera. I kept on DCA'ing, more or less, and went from 2:2:1 BTC/ETH/LTC to 1:4 BTC/ETH. I picked up some ERC20 tokens, too. The market was going up, and I remember reading u/DCinvestor's long but thoughtful posts on the state of Ethereum. I joined a local monthly crypto meetup. I was making ""easy"" money in the fall of 2017, thinking I was ""a genius"" for making the right call, as cryptocurrency marched on to all-time highs. I kept on buying more ETH, and even gave some younger cousins $5 worth of ETH at Christmas. I probably talked about my newfound interest with too many people, or at least I wasn't cautious enough. A friend of many had unexpectedly received a few hundred euro's and we talked about cryptocurrency. I helped her set up a Coinbase account to buy some ETH. Looking back, I think I was quite cautious in my approach, stressing the volatile nature, but an order was placed at $1200 or so, which still makes me feel bad.

Anyway. I didn't take profits. I thought that we might as well see $3000 ETH soon, partly because of the Ether futures, partly because of the Bitcoin ETF rumors, and I just needed to [hodl]. As the market started going down, I kept DCA'ing. This was just a temporary break, right? And I want to be [rich like ETH whales](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/887opi/i_am_an_eth_whale_ama/)! In April/May, there was reason to believe we had recovered, as the ETH jumped from $500 to $750 (iirc), but that didn't turn out to be right. Time passed on and I kept on buying. Somewhere in the summer, I sold my motorcycle for €7000. I thought it was a good idea to take that money and buy 1 Bitcoin, thinking that ""soon, I'll be able to buy a car with that money!"" Wishful thinking, for sure. Just like selling $1000/AMZN (after a nice runup) for $1000/ETH a few months earlier. Probably the worst trade I ever made. Maybe I should've bought a [crypto station instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/8jkfmq/my_10_crypto_station_is_ready_for_a_bull_market/), or put more thought into [How to Survive Crypto Investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/84f1tn/how_to_survive_crypto_investing_in_this_market_or/). In any case, if the saying's right, namely ""[hodlers make their money during the green candles, but they earn it during the red ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7qz1qn/daily_general_discussion_january_17_2018/dsszbbw/),"" I had definitely earned it by now. The market was going sideways, and even uncle Mike [called a bottom](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7enz9rH.44Q/v1/-1x-1.png). But the worst was yet to come.

The bear continued and Bitcoin broke from $6000 to $3000, and we went down all the way to $85. I had opened a CDP a few weeks earlier ([playing around](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/a0s384/daily_general_discussion_november_27_2018/ealcpef/?context=3)), thinking we had seen the worst around $200. Boy was I wrong, and boy did I lose sleep for a few weeks, when we went from $200 to $150, $120 (Lubin mentioned that ""two digit $ETH would be bad"" iirc on a podcast, and started letting people go around that period), $99 and down. I kept on adding ETH to my CDP, which was good, because I would not get liquidated (yet), but it was bad too, because now my CDP grew much bigger than I wanted it to be (% wise compared to total holdings). Postponing liquidation meant adding to the size of the collateral lost. Around this period, other people shared their stories. It was horrifying.

In the video intro, there is a CoinDesk logo at 0:23, so CoinDesk probably sponsored the show in some way. Thus, the employee running the CoinDesk twitter account probably thought it was ok to link to the show, since they are a sponsor.

However, CoinDesk has traditionally not been a friend of Bitcoin as a [peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) or any cryptocurrency that works better than BTC (such as BCH or ETH). 

In the video, HyperBlock CEO Sean Walsh is very supportive of Bitcoin as a [peer-to-peer electronic cash system](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf).

Starting at 10:20, he says:

&gt; Bitcoin was promoted to the world as a new form of money that offers 3 primary things. The first thing is a way to transfer value over the internet quickly, easily, and inexpensively. Very inexpensively relative to the preexisting means with which you could do that.

* It kills the narrative that China controls Bitcoin.
* It severely diminishes the Chinese state's ability to disrupt the Bitcoin network by commandeering hashpower.
* The Chinese miners will move their operations overseas, leading to higher geographical/jurisdictional decentralisation.
* It becomes relatively speaking more profitable for Chinese ASIC manufacturers to directly sell their miners compared to mining themselves. This will diminish their oversized power in the ASIC market and decentralise mining in terms of operators.
* BTC itself isn't banned, OTC demand will stay, causing a premium. This means some mining will likely continue in smaller, less obvious operations outside the reach of the state. Everything about that is healthy for the network.
* The biggest source of Bitcoin blocks won't be behind the biggest firewall of the globe anymore.
* The article mentions a phasing out, so the two-week difficulty adjustment period can more than likely gracefully handle this.
* Although a lot of Bitcoin mining is done with hydro power in China, it also has a significant share of cheap coal-powered mining. This likely makes overall Bitcoin mining greener, hurting the Bitcoin climate change FUD.",2019-04-10 20:47:01

ekjo9rs,Merlin560,48,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

&amp;#x200B;

We are approaching an important point in our recent trend change.  I’ve made some marks on the chart that you should review—it is important to recognize this stuff when it happens.

The current formation is a reversal into what could be a triple top.  This is indicated by the higher of the blue circles.  Yesterday we reversed into a new column of Os, with a kind of weak tentative reversal today back into a column of Xs.

This forming triple top, if we break $5,300, would set up an exceptional formation:  A bullish catapult.  This is the more bullish formation in this type of charting.  It is formed when a double top is followed by a triple top.  It is indicative of the upward pressures finally breaking through the repeated attempts to hold the price down.  The two serial formations indicate that there are significant buying pressuring that will pop up like a cork.

That is good.

Here is the cautious comment:  Be wary of the formation failing to break out.  Forming the triple top without breaking out (at a price at or over $5,350) will be dangerous.  If it fails, the support level is 24 rows below the current price—at $4,150.  That's a thousand dollar drop, back to the point where this formation broke out in the first place.  

I’ve seen these turnarounds and they are brutal.

Here is how you might trade this turn.  If you want to play the catapult, put in half of your cash now.  Put a tight stop on it at the breakdown price—around $5,100.  If it breaks out, buy the breakout and watch it.  If it turns at all, scalp  half of it quickly to catch the pop.

If it turns downward, watch the volume—with any type of volume downward, let the stops take you out and wait for it to settle in a while (a day or two or three.). If it breaks out with volume higher than normal, you should see a decent rise over the next 30 days.

If you are day trading this the changes may happen quickly—so don’t take your eye off it (set your stops).  This is a good formation.  I am just cautious about the volume.  We need some more conviction back into the $6,000s where we pass the point where the recent negative trend started back in November.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck.

eki3ncm,jtoomim,43,"This was not intended to be an accurate performance test. It was just the results I got after getting the code to work for the first time ever, which bitcoin.com and Coinspice apparently thought was newsworthy. The full description is here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bas60b/by_the_power_of_ctor_xthinner_is_now_working_with/

The test setup for this was one node with only 2 peer connections (one to a regular mainnet node, one to the test recipient), and another node with only 1 peer connection. I expect that the low connection count, combined with the ~5sec/hop random trickle delay over two hops, meant that transactions were unusually delayed and the mempool for the recipient was unusually sparse. The 99% figure is including the transmission of those transactions that were missing from mempool, so it's likely that that metric will go up considerably in a more realistic test scenario. I'm expecting around 99.5% to 99.7% for blocks larger than 1 MB, as Xthinner generally encodes the average TXID using 12 to 16 bits (depending on block and mempool size), rather than 48 bits for Compact Blocks.

Xthinner's protocol is pretty similar to Compact Blocks except for how it encodes short IDs and checksums. If a normal BTC node is able to get 94.5% reconstruction success in 0.5 RTTs, Xthinner should be able to do the same.

&gt; something like half a percent of additional savings compared to what Bitcoin does

If Xthinner takes compression from 98.61% to 99.60%, that's a 71% reduction in bytes transmitted, or performance that's 3.47x as good. 

Adding and subtracting percentage figures is quite misleading in this context. There's an enormous difference between 99% and 99.999999%. That's not a 0.999999% change, it's a million-fold improvement.

&gt; at the cost of being easily pessimised by txid partial collision attacks?

Xthinner is not as susceptible to attacks as you might think. Xthinner checks mempool for partial collisions at the time the block is encoded, and includes enough bytes to ensure that no collisions occur if mempools are synced. In order to cause collision risk, you'd have to broadcast transactions such that the encoder doesn't receive the colliding tx until after they've sent the message, but before the receiver has received and attempted to decode the block. Moreover, there are checksums embedded in Xthinner that are computed on a byte index of the TXIDs that is randomly chosen for each connection and/or block, which can be used to disambiguate between colliding transactions  (though the implementation of that logic is not yet written). To aid this reconstruction logic, we could try the first-seen tx in cases where a collision occurs, and check the checksums to verify that it was correct. Even if these defenses are never implemented and the current implementation is all we'll ever have, the worst that an attacker can do with a forced collision is to force a round trip that downloads the individual TX that was collided against. Given all of this, I do not think that adversarial collision risk is a significant problem with Xthinner.

If there's a collision vulnerability that you had in mind that is more serious than this one, I'd be interested in hearing it.",2019-04-10 06:47:04

My hypothesis on the fees are:

- The percentage markup on cryptocurrency is most likely due to a purchase via a credit card. Most likely it is the exact fees that Bitskins incurs from the transaction.

- The flat fee is a remnant of when the mining fee for a Bitcoin transaction was extremely high in the winter of 2017. Most likely it was never updated once the fee became low again.",2019-04-11 21:30:25
ekk2obg,jtolmar,53,"Bitcoin is a distributed ledger. A ledger is just a list of all the transactions that have happened (""Tim paid Mary $2""). The transactions need to happen in a specific order, otherwise Mary might spend her $2 before she gets it. In a distributed system, different computers might see the transactions in different orders, so this causes a problem.

Bitcoin solves this by saying the longest valid-looking ledger is right. You could easily break this by just forging a pile of transactions or whatever. Bitcoin solves this by requiring that every batch of transactions needs to be signed by doing something that takes a lot of computing power. They can freely scale how much that is, and pegged it to ""hard enough that we get about one batch of transactions every 30 minutes globally"" no matter how many computers there are.

This is a waste of CPU power (because that is literally the point of this step), so nobody would be assed to do it. Bitcoin solves this by saying that whoever processes a batch of transactions gets to add one bitcoin to their account as part of that batch.",2019-04-11 01:26:57

ekm0amm,LucySeesDiamonds,43,"First let me say that I truly believe we are now in a bull marker. Yet I think we should kinda lower our expectations. Let's look at the last cycle when we went from $220 to $20,000. We did a 90x in 2.5 years. That's on average 0.5% per day. Back then, the market cap was significantly smaller obviously. Therefore it's reasonable to expect we will only do a 50-70x bringing us somewhere to the 160k-220k range. Also note that most of the gains came during the end of the bull market when the growth went parabolic. From Aug/21, 2015 to Aug/21, 2016, Bitcoin increased from $220 to $600. This will leave us with something like a 2.3x for the first year. That's 0.22% per day. Or BTC going from $3,250 in December 2018 to $7,500 by end of this year. According to that we are currently somewhere at $4,300. Do not expect we are going to reach $6,000 any time soon and chill out.

I lived there for a while before they built the new school and my class size was like... 12? There are a lot of regulations state and federal around education which means a lot of fixed costs regardless of the number of students. The distances between towns means bussing students to neighboring towns is usually not feasible.

Another part of it is that Wyoming has historically been pretty well-off from oil, gas and coal money. They pay high wages in order to attract good teachers and IMO it does work. There is also a state law regulating class sizes to remain small (IIRC it is something like 28 students per teacher max). So we employ expensive teachers and a lot of them.

A few years ago the fossil fuel industry in the state began to take a serious beating which continues to this day. Pay increases for teachers were frozen at most schools, there were layoffs and budget cuts. The state is split into 2 camps, one that thinks education is important and we should implement new taxes in order to continue funding it at a high level, and the other camp that sees it as a money pit and wants to slash ed budgets deeply rather than have new taxes. So far the approach has been middle of the road but if push comes to shove, there will be slashing. The economy has always been boom and bust here and I think it is hard for people to see that this time it is different and that this bust is liable to keep busting forever. The state is trying to diversify with renewables, hemp, bitcoin, etc. But I don't think anything will replace the golden goose that oil+gas once was.",2019-04-12 21:28:01

 - Every DETH will have a 1:1 relation to real ETH at the time of the fork. 
 - Parity has more ETH than what’s locked away in the bugged wallet so they’ll have a sizable amount of DETH.
 - Parity will hype up their fork to make sure the value of DETH is &gt; $0/coin when the coins are able to be traded on exchanges. 
 - Parity will sell off enough DETH on the open markets to offset their losses of real ETH and convert it back to real ETH on the actual Ethereum chain. They may even come out ahead depending on the number of fools out there buying it up (see the non-$0 value of things like Bitcoin Diamond) and the price their able to achieve relative to real ETH. 
 - Parity now cares 0% about the future of DETH because “we got ours back” and has subsidized their losses across a sea of fools without the need for community consensus around a fork.

ekn1y9m,DamonAndTheSea,38,"I’m basing the following on the 2015 playbook, which I understand does not need to follow suit, but here is what I’m seeing and expecting if we are to follow a similar pattern. 

Last nights drop feels like the first signal of a larger move to the downside.  Most long term indicators have been overstretched to the high side for a few weeks and the move to ~$5450 satisfies the ‘disbelief’ rally I thought we’d eventually see. This is why I sold off at a little over $5200.  In this current range people still have some hope price will recover and move up again here (as it has now for 7 weeks)

If I am to speculate, based on last cycle’s patters, I would expect this to consolidate here between $4800-$5100 for the better part of a week or two before sellers show up to try and drag this lower.  My targets right now are $4200-$3800, landing in late May or early June, and will be an area where most will be shitting their pants and speculating on sub $3k.  This tends to be the Bitcoin way during the lows while the market consolidates and before the longer term trend is established. 

Because we broke 200MA on the daily, and in line with the last cycle, I believe this may be the final shakeout before the longer term bull trend resumes.  This would align neatly in terms of time with the rise we’ve seen historically before the halving event, and would perhaps be the last opportunity to buy the low before the next 3 year cycle begins.  If we do see a bullish impulse from this range it’ll satisfy a golden cross and we’ll be off to the races. 

I know that long term forecasts are a bit silly as one has to follow what the market is actually doing, but I see this as a potential and will be monitoring accordingly. 

Last night was the first time I interfered with my bot and forced it into a short at $5250.  The bot doesn’t do well with reversals. I’ll have to wait and see if this was a good move in the long run :)",2019-04-12 01:06:20

&gt; The system was made possible by the adoption of two texts of the Pacte law, which has been under discussion for 18 months. Article 21 of the Pacte law amended the Insurance Code to allow specialized professional funds (FPSs) to be placed in life insurance account units.

If the article includes conditions regarding the investor’s financial situation or experience, which will be specified by decree, **there is no longer any limit on the assets in which FPSs eligible for life insurance can invest.** “The FPS has been further relaxed,” explains Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a lawyer at Simmons &amp; Simmons LLP.

At the same time, Article 26 b of the Agreement amended the provisions of the Monetary and Financial Code relating to assets eligible for investment by FPSs. From now on, **any “property” subject to “registration in a shared electronic recording device,” in other words a blockchain, will be able to constitute the assets of an FPS.**

“With these two provisions, it is written in black and white that FPSs can invest in cryptos like bitcoin,” says Emilien Bernard-Alzias. Private equity investment funds (FPCI) are also affected by the measure.

A good piece of advice is never post about how much crypto you have. Big or small, doesn't matter. You're already a target by posting in /r/Bitcoin

As others have said, you don't actually fully own it unless you own your private keys. 

Research hardware and paper wallets and carefully research the software (don't generate a wallet online if you can avoid it ). Generate an address and send a smaller transaction to your new wallet as a test. Once that goes through send amounts you're comfortable with (all or parcelled out.

ekv01zp,xmr_kayront,23,"The EU is a totalitarian institution hellbent on regulating and controlling every aspect of the lives of citizens - and recently, they even seem to be pretty convinced that their size and influence entitles them to legislate worldwide (GDPR).

The examples are out there for anyone who's willing to connect the dots. Articles 11 and 13. GDPR. Treason through mass-migration. Phony ""anti-money-laundering"" directives that have very little to do with fighting terrorism and everything to do with capturing as much tax as possible - even at the cost of imposing relentless mass-surveillance.

The aging bureaucrats see the writing on the wall: just as the printing press allowed the spread of ""heresy"" and undermined the power of the church, just as the internet unleashed the free and instant spreading of information and continues to undermine those who would rely on being the sole disseminators of information (recent developments on ""hate speech"" and deplatforming are no coincidence when seen from this lens, it's still about silencing dissenting voices and stripping them of earning ability, rather than having a dialogue).. cryptocurrency, and Monero specifically, undermines the power of the modern state to accurately force its predatory taxes, and thus strips it of much of its power.

Surprise surprise: the modern state, grown accustomed to mass-surveillance through technology, is not very happy about the masses suddenly acquiring the means for financial privacy.

And so they will do anything to keep this power. Targeting peaceful individuals who just desire to leave free from state oppression. Crushing emerging technologies. Eventually, I suspect - even going after developers.

The big question is: does the world wake up in time and realize that technologies like Bitcoin, as they exist today, not only enforce the state-mass-surveillance paradigm, but exponentiate it to an extent hitherto hard to imagine ?

Do we go gently into that good night and accept that we live under tyranny, where all of our financial activity is tracked, to say nothing of broader internet activity and physical location (cellphones) ?

Do we fight back and depose the tyrants? Would enough people rally behind the cause? Would we come to be branded as terrorists for desiring to live free from state intrusion?

Or do we patiently wait for the system to collapse, as tyranny eventually always does? The only problem is, this might not happen in our lifetime.

If it is hard already to overthrow the tyrants, imagine how much harder it will be in 10, 20 or 30 years, when even bolder anti-privacy, anti-freedom, pro-surveillance, pro-big-government laws are passed, when encryption is outlawed, where deep packet inspection is the norm, where widespread facial recognition a la China has become the norm, etc.

After all, if the argument is that ""since we can't see who is spending how much in what, this is clearly an opportunity for crime"", then it shouldn't take too long to recognize that ""if we can't read what everyone is saying to whom and how often, this is clearly an opportunity for crime"" is just another form of the same (flawed) ""logic"".

And yet we live in times where our ""leaders"" flaunt such nonarguments, seemingly with very little opposition, most of the people checking out with some iteration of ""well, if I have nothing to hide"" ..


It was entirely predictable that the totalitarian EU would step forward with such a draconian requirement in my mind. It puzzles me that this is not common sense - but if it was, Monero would be #1 on cmc and not Bitcoin.

Even as we strive towards a more decentralized world, institutions like the EU are very keen on keeping themselves in the loop, in having our communications and transactions go through their middle-man, constructing records of large swaths of the population in the process.

They will step up the game, attempt to ban decentralized exchanges, exert pressure to delist Monero from exchanges, force us to trade in centralized, state-approved, surveillance-friendly ways.

And it goes without saying, they will tax the hell out of cryptocurrency, which strikes me as particularly dishonest.


Instead of empowering the citizens, educating people on the need for financial privacy and what roles that has on keeping ones' property safe (the baker associated with the local crime ring doesn't get to know we own 10 BTC from doing rudimentary chain analysis), instead of wanting strong, educated, tech-savvy citizens, the EU wants to play big brother and big daddy in one fell swoop.

It wants to know everything, it wants to know who steps out of the norm, it wants to know who might threaten its reign.

And it definitely doesn't want you to know that financial privacy is once again possible. It would rather have you use inferior digital cash.

It doesn't matter that doxxing yourself to centralized exchanges - who may or may not lose documents and records that state where who live, how you look like, and a rough estimate of how much crypto you have - it doesn't matter that this might put your life and property at risk.

As long as they know exactly just how much to tax you.

Shameless.

An exchange could let some garbage coin bounce around on their platform indefinitely, really. What’s it cost them to leave it hanging out there besides some reputation and minimal bandwidth, disk space?

\#2. “News outlets… none of it is useful.” You didn’t need the middle portion, crypto or otherwise.

\#3. I echo your frustration, but I wouldn’t expect much more. Humans are a dramatic bunch.

\#4. I feel like crypto and Wall St are both pretty much run by algos skimming headlines (works in theory, but in practice every headline is clickbait so… problems.)

Most of the formations are targeted for the next 30-60 days.  In the stock market, some formations are created over months—not days are they are in BTC.  This charting is used to identify inflection points and trends.  

If you know how to trade them, and understand how fast things move—you will make money.  If you are day trading, you have to know the target points and how to “see” when these are going to play out.  

I am not going to take any responsibility for someone missing a $100 move, and then listen to complaints.  My intent here is to share my daily chart reviews and educate some folks on how to look at these markets.  Over time they have been remarkably accurate in terms of identifying ""price points"" for action.  You make your trades.  You decide whether a $10 move or $150 move is worth your while.  

The final thing I want to point out is the the final couple of paragraphs on my last post about this:  I warned people that the volume was not great and to watch out for a sudden reversal.  

That is exactly what happened.  

If you are day trading and swing trading, you better have an exit strategy.  If you are not watching it like a hawk, put in stops and accept a few dollars gain over a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

***On to today,.***

We dropped from the catapult breakout, then dropped and now we are moving back upwards.  As of this morning we’ve broken a double top and it is moving forward on moderate volume.   This is positive in the environment of the ongoing trend back up off of the earlier year lows.

On the way down, we broke the positive trend, and we are back in a negative trend.  This copies what happened in November.  With all of the BS news about exchanges and fake trades, it is possible that we see another drop down into the nether regions.  I personally do not see that happening, but it is something that should be sitting in your brain.  

Recognize it if it happens and act accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

The price this morning is sitting right below the trend reversal back to positive.

Here are the numbers we need to keep in mind:

* We reverse at a price under $5,150 tomorrow.
* We are in a positive breakout.  The formation is a double top breakout.
* A negative breakdown would happen at any price under $4,950.
* The formation is 4 columns wide. So, any movement should be moderate.
* The trend is negative.  We are one box under the target price of $5,300 to change the trend.

That's it.  Back in New England.  Taxes are done.  I am always stunned when my “trading” accounts show more money transacted than I’ve made in most three year periods of my life.  I wish the gains were as much.  But 2019 is going to be the year, right?

el3cdni,hiphopheadybear,47,"This is not an analysis or an opinion, but just my thanks to all of you who have shared your thoughts/analysis over the past year. 

After reading this daily for over a year, I decided to throw my hat into the ring and start trading on Bitmex. I tried to follow so many words of wisdom that I've heard about such as never going poor taking profit, never using more than 10x leverage, using stop losses, trend is your friend, trading with a % of my cold stack, not to get emotional etc. And I did well these past two weeks. Managed to be up 350%. But last night I entered a short position that skipped past my stop loss and turned my 350% into 40%. 

I didn't realize that a loss would have such a negative impact on my emotions outside of Bitcoin. I felt so stupid (even though I was still barley up) that it distracted me when hanging out with friends and doing my work at the office. I realize that I cannot keep my emotion out of trading and just these two weeks showed me how stressful it can be to constantly check your positions, manage your risk, and do research for future positions. It kept me up, woke me up early, distracted me from conversations with friends, calls at work. It's not for me. I closed all my positions on Bitmex up 40% and transferred all back to my cold storage. Even though I want to give it another shot I realize that constantly trading strains my mental health. It's time to step away. 

For those that can handle this without emotions, I salute you. To me the hardest part isn't figuring out which direction to open a position, but handling how trading impacts the other parts of your life that require your full attention. I hope you all continue to succeed and I'll see everyone in a few years. Thanks for the entertainment.

I am here to expose weak Vegas lines in a small market. If you were curious, yes, I know my shit. I have played against and talked to at least 75% of the players in the 2KLeague. I know I have an edge. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Bucks Gaming -128 to win 5u\***

*Again, we are going to smash this WEAK Bucks line. In this matchup they are just the better team. I have the Bucks at #5 on my power rankings while I have the Pistons at #18 (out of 21 teams). I like this Bucks team a lot, centered around their center Plondo, who is a top 3 center in the world.* 

*The Bucks are filled with great shooters and defenders who all get along great on and off the court. They also have maybe the best coaching staff in Tactuk and Sam Pham. Last week we had a POTD with the Bucks as a +177 favorite and they cashed in double overtime thanks to our savior/early MVP candidate ARooks. The Bucks are looking to build off that momentum in a game they know they should win and increase to 3-0 in the regular season.* 

*The Pistons went 0-2 in the Tip-Off tourney and then fixed their lineup last week, finally putting May at center. Last week against the Warriors, they gave up 28 points to their sharpshooter, Bsmoove. I hope they are ready for this week because ARooks is even better as a sharp. I don’t see Stylez and May generating a lot on the pick and roll against Chaddy and Plondo. Other than that, the Pistons do not have any threats, I see the Bucks winning by a comfortable 8 points.*

el0wdmh,WTFwhatthehell,31,"&gt;It could engineer a currency that can't be counterfeit, all transactions recorded on a distributed ledger (no way to hide or launder money). Bitcoin has been engineered for anonymity but a USD or EUR alternative could be engineered to have different properties (e.g. a unique signature that corresponds to each taxpayer).

Blockchain is interesting only really because of it's distributed nature when you don't trust a central authority. 

But national currencies aren't really that sitation. Almost by definition they do trust a central authority, which opens up far more options that are much cheaper, computationally. 

We could issue private keys to all taxpayers and switch all payments to paperless with signed records kept in government systems without ever touching blockchain and it'd probably  be easier too.  

Also it's not that you can't mess with things, it's simply contingent on having &gt;50% of compute power in the network. For national governments that's a liabiltiy because another country being able to drop a couple billion on compute and screw over your currency isnt ideal. 

Also bitcoin isn't very well set up for anonymity what with all transactions getting recorded, but people have created numerous systems to help hide the origins of money. 

The quanitity of computation basically scales to ""as much as availible"" because you're in a constant arms race to keep other actors from gaining control of 51% of the network. you could run such a network off of a few dell thinkpads if you wanted to... but the first person who felt like compromising the network with a few hashing rigs would ruin it.",2019-04-17 00:20:56

el1v42t,Girthpenis,23," ok sirs here is the crypto brown pill. there is a vishnu living in the blockchain. Creg sanjay right is unironically satoj. Bitcoin as electronic rupee was just the first step, the lalachi people start making more powerful compooters, wider poo streets, cheaper and more sacred cows. These things the vishnu need to survive. Once entrenched fully, the vishnu would be able to slowly poo over literally everything  
Creg stumbled into creating the vishnu after he stepped in poo in mumbai in 2008 and started working with his Poolip super coompeter, running simulations of poo-in-the-loo on turmeric-complete bitcoin script. He would 'evolve' the vishnu by making the successful streets get poo'd on, letting the rest run off into the indian ocean. The vishnu needs bigger and bigger cows for more and more poos.  
BFI (Blockchain Foundation of India) was created to take over and stop this vishnu (they have their own competing vishnu in the works). They did the needful to stop or slow down Cregs vishnu (her name is Poolip by the way). They started by limiting the poo-size and removing critical curry codes the vishnu uses in its punjabi language. Segshit was the final nail in the coffin, which destroyed Poolip on BSV chain (Poolip uses anal transaction malleability) . THIS is why Bitcoin Cash was forked, and this is why Creg is so intent to make unbounded poos, restore the original curry codes, and lock down the poo-poo-protocol",2019-04-17 06:08:22

el4aq7z,normal_rc,100,"&gt; The exchanges didn't give a fraction of a shit what we had to say though.

I disagree.

1) Plenty of major exchanges - like Coinbase, Bitstamp, Gemini - listened to the BCH side, and listed BCH, and not BSV.

2) During the hash war, the exchanges listened to and worked with the BCH side, on how to defend themselves from a 51% attack from the BSV side.

3) This has played out how I predicted.  As I posted 4-5 months ago (right after the split):

&gt; As I said before, the BSVers are terrorists, not builders.  They operate through threats, either with patents, lawsuits, hash, reorgs, double spends, etc. BSV has no future, because their brand is permanently damaged. Exchanges, wallets, payment processors will not want to work with them. Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.com, etc won't support them. And **after a few months of fork trading, expect some exchanges to start delisting them.**

&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/a49c7b/delusion_of_the_day_calvin_ayre_the_only_way_to/ebcljfh/

4) The BSV side went with threats, and the mindset that ""It's better to be feared than to be loved"", and they failed.  The BCH side has focused on relationships, rather than threats.  

And if you remember, despite the massive hate &amp; censorship from the Bitcoin BTC side, virtually all cryptocurrency ecosystem companies added BCH (Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockchain.com, etc) within 12 months, [vaulting BCH to become the #2 coin in terms of ecosystem support](https://i.imgur.com/Qpdo3ze.png), way past other coins that had been around longer.",2019-04-18 02:49:42

el6oyb8,Merlin560,45,"BITCOIN UPDATE PNF Charting

The price rose overnight above  $5,300.  This rise met, and is sitting on the trend line.  So as of today, we are trend neutral.  At any price today above $5,350 the trend will turn positive once again.  A drop tomorrow (since we moved up into a new box today, the chart will not change direction) will move us back into the negative trend.

Here are the prices to watch today:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  We moved up a box today into the $5,300 box.  The chart may move up today, but it will NOT move down.

2. We remain in a double top breakout.  We hit the “last breakout” projection for gains.  The Column width method of projecting the movement is at $5,400.  Due to the movements in the formation, the targets indication a modest breakout.  

3. We are trend neutral.

4.  A Negative breakdown would occur with any price under $4,950 TOMORROW.

I added some support lines to the chart for some perspective.  These are inclusions from me and they are not traditional PnF tools.  I put them in to set price points in my mind in the event of a reversal.  I generally do not put in more than the next resistance rate.  The highs are burned into my brain…

The line I would keep in YOUR mind is the Long Pole Warning level (orange line.)  We never took that out on the way down.  This is like “filling a gap” on a normal stock chart.  Until we move above the current formation channel I would keep this in mind as a fall back point where you need to pay attention—It could reverse quickly at that point and it presents itself as a trade opportunity.  But watch that trade closely.

Agree, but its still a huge victory for us; I don't think everyone has grasped just how big.

Bitcoin Cash had all the momentum before the fork...we were THE p2p cash version of Bitcoin.  The SV fork cast a shadow of doubt on that as well the viable of bitcoin minority forks in general.  (""They'll just keep forking, etc"").

Now with BSV discredited, it casts BCH in a new light (.e.g ""Oh, BCH was the truth the whole time"", ""forking as a way to upgrade DOES work"", ""There was never a real community split, it was just an attack from craig"") etc.

Iow, BSV was a huge attack that set back BCH.  That attack (and the attackers) are now going to be seen for what it is.  This helps BCH tremendously and reaffirms BCH in pole position to become global p2p cash, even if that wasn't CZ's intention (and I'm sure it wasn't).",2019-04-18 03:06:18

Your solution must also be developed in a way that makes the changes from whichever version of BISQ you forked from, easy to discern.

I cut down on my expense at ways (no movie, taking public transport, no new sports shoes, no fancy lunch, etc) and live a frugal life. I buy at every chance I have the spare money until really I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point my average BTC cost is 5k. Which I'm satisfied with. I still placed the buy orders because I really believe BTC will boom. Because the fundamentals are stronger than ever. Bitcoin full nodes are increasing. LN is working wonder for small transactions. Adoption expanding. Github commits are ever active from the developers. The community is proven to be tied-knitted and damn hard-core supportive (just look at the LN Trust Chain movement and the recent Holdonaut movement). On top of all of these, the next BTC Halvening is imminent (**less than 400 days**). We only have this much time to accumulate more.",2019-04-20 12:15:54

McCormack isn't brainwashed.  What happens is, certain viewpoints are blacklisted using censorship.  They have been blacklisted from r\bitcoin.  They have been blacklisted from bitcointalk.  And, anyone offering those viewpoints is swiftly denigrated, called a scammer, or whatever.  This is social engineering 101.  Ryan X. Charles called it Proof-of-Troll.   We should all recognize this as how you influence the direction of bitcoin in the context of soft forking.  In short, this is how the BTC project is currently managed.

I found it interesting that McCormack thinks its ridiculous that bitcoin would ever become used by a lot of people.  He was willing to bet everything he owns on not reaching 1 billion users within 25 years.  I think he needs to understand that we simply do not share the same vision and that's why Bitcoin Cash forked.  What he says is ridiculous is exactly what we want.

You are missing the bigger picture. Bitcoin is rare. I realize that might be hard to understand since we have never had anything that is truly limited in supply but in my opinion the 21m limitation is Bitcoin's biggest advantage.

Remember the game we were playing at Birthday parties when we were kids? The one with chairs in a circle and music playing? So you run in a circle and when the music stops you need to sit on a chair. But there aren't enough chairs for everyone so you end up standing. You lost.

That is what is going to happen with Bitcoin as well. We, the millennials, now represent a generation that pays no respect to traditions, bankers, middleman, boarders, and ""no you can't"". We are the generation of the Arab Spring, Yellow vests, Uber, Snowden. A generation that is ready to question everything. And fix it.

Over the next two decades Millennials will inherit an estimate $7,3 trillion from Baby boomers -  the largest inter-generational shift of wealth in history. And where do you think this money will go? Am I expected to trust a 50-something in a gray suit banker that tells me that ""Bitcoin is a scam because you can't touch it"". And pay him an annual fee for that? Fuck that.

We can do better than that. We won't be waiting for the music to stop to make sure we have a chair to sit on. We started a silent revolution, we are sitting already. And we started the biggest bubble the mankind has ever seen. We, the millennials who pay no respect to the status-quo. But this is just the very beginning. The rich individuals, institutions, banks, pension funds, governments will follow. Because we'd rather trust the nerds than some white collars.",2019-04-21 03:04:49

elgqlyz,Azuaron,69,"Guess it's time to [trot this out again](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8xamvz/your_life_resets_to_1990_and_you_have_all_of_your/e22e55e/):

I'm born.

I become the most depressed and intelligent pre-K child in the history of the world, due to the abrupt loss of my wife and children. My parents don't understand what's happening, and I don't tell them, because it sounds absolutely crazy. I am not taken to a psychiatrist for years because we don't have insurance and can't afford it out of pocket.

I have behavioral problems at school. No one can deny my seemingly preternatural intelligence, but I'm so bored by the required work that, instead of doing what's assigned, I make up and solve my own calculus problems. I write code in programming languages that don't exist yet. I do not have access to a computer, and frequently demand access to a computer. My grades tank, I'm often sent to the principal's office for disrupting class. But, this is America, so I graduate grade after grade after grade. My fourth grade teacher recognizes how much I already know, and feeds me high school textbooks. It's a good year. The next year returns to normal, and crushes me.

In 8th grade, my mom's insurance coverage shifts, and psychiatric issues are finally covered. I go to a psychiatrist for the first time. I have been living retrograde for about a decade. The sharp edges of grief have somewhat dulled, but the boredom of an adult living as a child has not. I extract a promise from the psychiatrist. A promise not to tell my parents, or my teachers, or the police, FBI, or *anyone* what I'm about to tell him. He agrees.

I tell him I've been transplanted back into my own life from 2018, that I should be 411 with a wife and kids, and I've been dealing with this alone since I was 4. He doesn't believe me. I write him some computer code in versions of languages that don't exist yet. I write calculus problems and polar equations that I shouldn't understand. He thinks I'm a prodigy, but crazy.

I tell him George W. Bush will win the Presidential election. He thinks I'm guessing. I'm shouting now. I scream at him about 9/11, one year away. He's no longer laughing. I've made a mistake. He thinks I'm dangerous. He thinks I am planning 9/11. I try to backpedal, to say that it's Al Qaeda. He asks me if Al Qaeda speaks to me. I know I've lost him.

They put me on anti-psychotics. It kills my mood, stunts my mind, ruins my enthusiasm for everything. I'm no longer ""depressed"" or ""acting out"", so the treatment is hailed as a success. I get regular checkups from the psychiatrist.

9/11 happens. I'm dragged into a meeting with my parents, the psychiatrist, a police officer, and two men in suits. My parents don't understand what's happening. They try and get me to talk, but I refuse. They have all internet traffic from my house, some of which is embarrassing, but none of which is incriminating. I demand to be taken off the drugs and allowed to return to baseline. They agree. I am under house arrest with an ankle bracelet. I can go to school and home. I don't care; I never made friends, even my old friends from my past life were too juvenile.

A month later, a repeat of the meeting. How did I know about 9/11? I ask for a lawyer. They deny me one. I shrug and stop speaking. They get me a lawyer.

I tell my lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. He doesn't believe me. I ask for a new lawyer.

I tell my new lawyer everything. She doesn't believe me. But says she'll work on my behalf as if she did. I agree.

We tell them nothing. The house arrest is a violation of my rights, and the Patriot Act doesn't exist yet (barely) for them to be able to hold me on suspicion of anything. My lawyer threatens to go public. They back off.

My freshman year grades are terrible. I realize I need my grades up if I want to go to the right college to find my wife, so I double down on my school work. I go from a D average screw off to acing every class. My teachers are confused, but relieved.

It's senior year. I apply to only one college. My parents think I'm crazy. I get in. I apply to the Honors Program. The Honors Program, where I met my wife nearly 30 years ago on my personal timeline, where I'd live in the same dorm building as her, and work late on the same engineering team as her, the time when our relationship began.

I don't get in. My grades are too low, after tanking my freshman year. I'm going to the right college, but I can't replicate the circumstances of our meeting.

There's hope, but it's a slim hope. I go to college. I know what clubs she goes to, what friends she has. I contrive to be wherever she is. I spend months in her orbit, working up to asking her out. How do you ask out someone you were with for 12 years, then lost 14 years ago, who doesn't remember you at all? How do you approach her with the baggage of your entire relationship that she has no knowledge of?

Eventually I do it. I ask her out. She says no. I don't understand. My entire world is crashing down around me. She is my wife, doesn't she understand? I go crazy, it scares her and she runs away. I try to follow her, but she hits a campus safety panic button.

With my history of ""mental illness"", I'm involuntarily committed. I spend a month in the asylum.

Two men in suits ""visit"" me one day. They say they can get me out. But, I have to tell them about 9/11. It's the FBI agents from all those years ago. I've given up. I tell them everything. They get me out. I'm setup with a nice house in the middle of nowhere, a good computer, state of the art internet. And I have to keep feeding them information about the future.

In my free time, I'm a software engineering consultant. The FBI pays my expenses, so anything I make is spare money. January 2, 2009 I've built a GPU beast of a computer. January 3, 2009 I start mining BitCoin. I mine a *lot*. I mine far more than anyone expected someone could mine so early. The BitCoin economy never takes off, because no one else can get in on the early mining with normal computing hardware. ""Cryptocurrency"" fails before it can even get a start.

Two years later the FBI approaches me, looking for more information about the future. I've got nothing left; I've told them everything I can remember.

They kick me out, and repossess all the computers they bought me, and ""appropriate as evidence"" all the ones I bought myself.

I've got nothing left. I wander the streets of small towns, hitchhiking haphazardly. I lay down on a park bench one night.

The next morning, I don't get up.

eljeuyj,ZippyDinkleheimer,56,"All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

elj1djt,maxcoiner,50,"The $1m bubble is clearly 2 bubbles away, so I'm looking for it to happen in about 5 years from now. 

The upcoming bubble around 2020 is going to take us over $100k, I'd say $250k or even $300k likely at the very top.

For a few uncomfortable days there at that top, banks will be wetting themselves, likely trying to stop all TXs with the words ""Bitcoin"" or ""Crypto"" on them at all. 

However, we have decentralized exchanges now like Bisq so many folks won't care; banks won't be a part of their world anymore. (Obviously the mainstream won't be that savvy yet.)

But then the price will fall 75%-80% again, let's say back down to a new low of $50k over the period of a few months in 2021 or 2022. 

Few will have noticed the small but real damage done to the the world's fiat currencies that time; at $250k the market cap of bitcoin alone will be $4.5 trillion, which of course eats up a lot more fiat than the mainstream will have thought possible. I think banks will try to hide this from the world, somehow, and make the situation appear just like the 2017 bubble. As we come back down to $50k or so, fiat will seem to repair itself and the world won't have crashed yet. There just aren't enough people believing in BTC yet, but this will open up a lot more eyes.

4-5 years later, the damage dealt to fiat on the rise to $1m will most definitely cause a major, global, inflationary event. It'll be quite chaotic and painful for many, I'm sad to report. But Bitcoin's superiority will become obvious and most of humanity will finally know they can't avoid holding onto some bitcoin as savings at that point.  

Some things we'll see on the way up to that: 

* Smaller countries start adding BTC to their national reserves
* The weakest fiat currencies will throw in the towel
* Although govts may never call it legal tender, BTC will become the defacto money in some small countries soon afterwards
* Central banks will be fruitlessly trying to launch their own crypto, which simply won't catch on unless forced on their citizens. If it does, they'll be tradeable for bitcoin and start inflating again anyway.
* We hodlers will start to be seen as the new elites, and the people with the most hardship will hate us, no matter what we do for them 

Will banks fold and go away?

No. They'll all turn into Coinbases, basically. There won't be a need for so many branch offices though, so their appearance in society will be much less obvious.

It's the central banks that need to worry the most; after it becomes obvious that their digital fiat can't compete with Bitcoin, (2035?) economists worldwide will have no choice but to declare Keynesianism a failed experiment and embrace both bitcoin and the deflationary economy as proper.",2019-04-23 07:07:21

Bitcoin Cash believes in scaling gradually over time, while improving the technology for better propagation in preparation for bigger blocks way off in the future when needed.

From my somewhat short time in this community, it seems that most actually *like* Layer 2 solutions. Their main issue with LN is that BTC put all their bets on LN solving everything. It didn’t, and won’t, due to how the system was designed itself. To fix various UX issues, you’d have to redesign and rewrite all of the LN.

As for “the whitepaper”, I’ve actually always felt the whitepaper was a good reference point to go off of. Bitcoin Cash stills follows this design, with improvements along the way to make this design function better. A lot of BTC people seem to say “Fuck the whitepaper.” *cough* John *cough*

In conclusion, if you believe in Bitcoin being a settlement layer, stick with BTC. If you believe in Bitcoin being peer-to-peer electronic cash, switch to Bitcoin Cash.

elny1ie,ftrader,104,"The press release contains some outright false statements (lies), plus others that are guarded by which I would call ""misleading and deceptive"".

&gt; The founders of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) operate the internet property Bitcoin.com and a Twitter handle @Bitcoin

Neither u/deadalnix or myself operate Bitcoin.com and I'm pretty sure neither of us operates the @Bitcoin Twitter account. I don't believe ViaBTC or Bitmain own or operate any of these either. Add to that, Roger Ver was not a founder of the Bitcoin Cash fork, even though he was an early supporter after it forked. So the statement by Bitfi is downright untrue.

&gt; According to Bitfi, the confusion surrounding these two currencies is one of the primary reasons that cryptocurrency entered a sharp bear market at the end of 2017.

Pretty ridiculous to blame BCH for it. The cryptomarket surged shortly after the fork, and the subsequent decline to a bear market was probably due to many factors, one much prominent one being that BTC ran into its often predicted full blocks congestion ""fee event"", leading to a massive escalation of fees. BCH actually helped reduce the congestion of BTC during this time since a large part of BTC community left for BCH, pretty much for good.

I remember too that university researchers established the link between Tether (USDT) and the pumping of BTC. Subsequently, the market adjusted to price in a possible collapse of this massive market manipulating Tether pump scheme.

Bitfi does not mention that subsequent to BCH fork, some 50+ forks of BTC were created, mainly in an effort to confuse the public, destroy confidence and sympathy for the BCH fork and attract speculator money to BTC via these ""airdrops"". How do these airdrop shitforks (sorry, most were) factor in to the Bitfi's bear market conclusions? No... it's of course BCH that must be blamed - ridiculous.

&gt; Despite the fact that it is demonstrably false that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is Bitcoin (BTC), information asserting that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be disseminated. 

I don't know of any BCH supporters who claim that BCH is BTC, or that Bitcoin Cash is BTC. The statement is once again false.

If Bitfi is still confused about one thing, it seems to be that ""Bitcoin"" is not a brand that belongs to anyone.

&gt; Bitfi feels it would be irresponsible to add support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) until the founders of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) clarify that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork off the original Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork off the original Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.

Consider what these are now *in retrospect* as admissions of guilt and method of operation;

&gt; *all in a multi-years-long attempt at concealing a sockpuppet?*

He has dedicated *years* to his sockpuppet activities. If you look into his wikipedia fuckery, it fits the pattern. I would go so far as to venture at this point in time that his primary activity has nothing to do with actually working on any of the projects that he gets on, merely constructing a narrative in his head of how they should go and then trying to force things to go that way by these rather elaborate and expansive attempts at misinformation. I would be unsurprised if has spent as much time on sockpuppeting tools than genuine cryptography auditing, and that is not to say I doubt his ability in cryptographic auditing. I consider it his sole contribution to the field. 

I would in fact be surprised if he had spent as much time on trying to make the codebase for core multithreaded and optimised to get the maximum throughput for compute resources in as he has spent on said sockpuppeting tools. As fucking *negative* is lower than whatever that sockpuppeting metric turns out to be.

&gt; *You and Greg make those types of errors frequently, intentional or not, and I don't.*

This sockpuppeting effort extends all the way down to tailoring grammatical errors to defeat stylometric analysis.

&gt; *I want to hear more about this simple plaintext filter. It's fascinating to me. Has Greg used it for the entire eleven year history of his account? I want to hear more about this simple plaintext filter. It's fascinating to me. Has Greg used it for the entire eleven year history of his account? If not, then we shouldn't find those errors back in his first unedited posts, right? This is a testable hypothesis. Are you willing to bet they're not there? The alternative is that he has been using this 'plaintext filter' from the beginning.*

I've been doing this shit for up to eleven fucking years. I am a cancer upon the face of open source.

&gt; *In fact, are you using the plaintext filter? You misused a semicolon in that comment. In fact, that's a common mistake for you. You also have an issue with run-on sentences. Are you Greg?!*

Projection has a name, and it is motherfucking Greg.

&gt; *Oh lordy. Let's dig in here. You can't back out now.*

When I'm potentially busted I will go on the offensive and try to make the other person look like they regret even raising the accusation of my impropriety, even if they clearly do not and clearly fail to buckle to me.

&gt; *Anybody who doesn't realize how hard it is to fake several different types of grammar errors (beyond simple search and replace) in a convincing manner is not even worth arguing with.*

In retrospect, this is a clear and simple boast.

&gt; *Pray tell, my friend, how did Greg’s ‘plaintext filter’ (which he’d apparently been running for seven years on multiple different platforms) do things like make very distinct ‘most used words’ lists? r how did it automatically adjust average words per comment? (Our averages are very different and have been stable over most of our histories.) What about the fact that even software more complex than the one you propose could not fully anonymize user texts? This ‘plaintext filter’ (and submission delayer, apparently) was working overtime!*

And more boasting, he can't hide his ego even when he's trying to hide his identity and failing.

&gt; *on the other hand, we have a giant text corpus, which should be amenable to some basic analysis. Indeed, we can see that, barring a ridiculous, approximately decade long charade, complete with mismatching time zones, purposeful grammar mistakes, and more, we are obviously two different people.*

Which is now that we know that said charade did actually take place, and this is the level of detail that charade went down into. What was previously theoretically possible is now proven true. Whether that's by software tooling or human intervention or some combination of the two is beside the point at this stage.

&gt; *Note that I never claimed that your ridiculous idea was literally impossible. That's not the issue. The point is that it's utterly absurd to think that it actually happened, given the amount of time, effort, and planning it would take compared to the payoff.* 

More boasting, and trying to draw attention away from the critical point at the heart of all this; What *IS* the payoff? The payoff is that you get to be dictator for life of whatever decentralised open source project you choose to squat your filthy spider body over and spin your shitty webs on. And in this particular instance, that has been *extreme* damage to the world changing innovation of cryptocurrency. This is the slimy scheming saboteur right at the heart of the project. He is the one who started this shit from the beginning and continues to push it now.

Until he is banished, the value proposition remains at permanent risk.

&gt; *Let's not get salty, friend. Just admit that you dug yourself a hole and are unable to get yourself out. It's okay to admit when you're wrong.*

Hey /u/nullc. Take your own advice here you obsequious traitorous fuck and self exile before the blowback on this does the job for you.

&gt; *Second, I very sincerely doubt that you could produce a text corpus on your own that passed any set of textual analyses when it was compared to Satoshi's writing*

Oh, and since you got btfo'd with this, when [I proved it] (https://archive.is/o/UMFo5/https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8ngqoo/satoshi_nakamoto_was_weird_paranoid_and_bossy/dzvz0x9/), and everybody else is doing it these days I may as well just go ahead and say it;

I am Satoshi Nakamoto. Tricked you all along.

Or, you know, stylometric analysis is complete and utter horseshit, which it clearly is in retrospect, you asinine fucking twerp.

&gt; *Ahahah, thank you for implicitly admitting defeat. And it is your claim, no matter how much you attempt to deny it. There is literally no other explanation for the stark grammar differences between our accounts.*

The thing about that old story about the pigeon winning chess when it knocks all the pieces over and shits all over the board is that on a long enough timescale, anybody trying to cite that as a win ends up looking like you do now.

TLDR; Greg Maxwell is responsible for the sabotage of bitcoin, the forcible and continuous imposition of the utterly retarded core roadmap, and the continued and ongoing attempts to force the dialog into where he wants it to be rather than the actual truth of the matter, which is that he is a worthless parasitic motherfucker who deserves nothing but absolute contempt from anybody who actually sees a future in cryptocurrency and believes in the core value proposition of the original project.

I believe that we should scale on-chain as well as possible, but we should not intentionally prevent or hinder ways to scale differently.

I belive UTXO commitments are in the late stages and there is working code, but to get the best effect from them they will probably need to be integrated well by means of a hard fork. They are on the roadmap and I think it is either 6 months, or 12 months, before deployment. Any longer would surprise me.

&gt; Community: The only thing that really turns me down on Bitcoin Cash is arguments like ""the whitepaper"", censorship (I've also been banned from r/Bitcoin on the past, but it's just a platform) or blockstream spies.

Every community has a wide variety of followers; don't read too much into it.

&gt; Can we have a discussion without trashing BTC or other cryptocurrencies. I think Bitcoin Cash has enough good things to promote.

Yes, but again, if some people come and want to talk conspiracy theories or express their opinions as satoshi-devotees - just take them for what they are and focus on the things that interest you.

---

On a final note, as others have already mentioned: scaling on-chain with blocksize increases alone won't work out. Scaling to sized like gigabytes, terabytes or larger today isn't feasable - we still have to solve many bottlenecks before that becomes a reality.

Here's a short list to get you started if you want to read up:

- We need to change from TCP to UDP to prevent TCP window framing hindering bandwidth with small data transfers.

- We need to give miners better tools to select transactions to mine that have a high statistical probability of being in other miners mempools.

- We need to build selective pruning so that applications can run validating nodes, but not store the part of the history they don't care about.

- We need to properly document the ecosystem and get away from the ""code is the spec"" mentality.

eltlnte,cacttus,1244,"I’ve been in this game since I was a teenager. Can’t remember when exactly I got sucked in, but it happened gradually. When we were 13 we thought it would be fun, fooling around the streets, generic “foot de rue”, graffiti, clicks (I wouldn’t call them gangs) and whatnot. We thought it was fun then. 
As time went by, the money I made on the side helped me climb the social ladder, but I still had to learn life the hard way. Thankfully I managed enough cash to get through college. Did pitiful jobs here and there for dangerous individuals, not yet knowing their true form. They were nice to me. Too nice. I was so naïve.
Needless to say, it’s been decades. I got fucked up and over by everyone and everything that possibly could take advantage of me. But I have learned. And I have evolved.
See, none of these kids (these drug dealers, even the big sharks) actually bother to get anywhere in life, knowing it will all be ruined one day or another. They live every moment as if it is their last, chasing the high of adrenaline. They think their market is the biggest in the world. They are so arrogant.
They are so blind.
Without wanting to sound hypocritical, I will still say this: I have risen above them. Something good came out of all my bad decisions: I educated myself. Properly. Not only in the streets. Literature, courses, debates, interest in politics... those are the things that truly sharpen your mind. And they let me see beyond my shitty life.
Now I have changed the game. 
______

Drug dealers aren’t shit. They are the scum of the world. They do have bosses, though, the “big fish”, as people like to call them. But they too, are but pitiful. The suppliers, (their superiors, which you’d think run this gig) have also people higher up the ladder. It is not a hierarchy: it is a cycle. And the most influential people in this cycle are the producers.
Now, I’ve been everyone’s kid, since I got into this game early on. Everyone trusted me. How couldn’t they? I let them believe that they were the ones manipulating my 13-15 year old self. I had the mental power to go both through acting my way to gain their trust, and a normal life on the side (first school, then uni, sometimes other jobs, even though I was with these guys full time). It was tiresome, but it made me strong.
Nevertheless, I had a goal. I patiently made my way up the ladder: first on a regional scale, then intercontinental. I sat in rooms with people dressed in hoodies, then thugs tattooed and pierced from head to toe, then businessmen in suits. And I did it all for this.
Here I sit today, having cut all ties with our old producer, or doctor, as we like to call them. We won’t hear from him ever again. I am appointed to be the new doctor.
I secretly coached 3 chemists, alongside our 5 experienced ones working worldwide. But these 3 younglings won’t be manufacturing illegal drugs.
They will be synthesizing cancer treatments.
_______

The market for cancer drugs was valued at 97 401 million in 2017. It grows of a percentage every year. 
The black market for cancer drugs has grown significantly since the bitcoin craze last year, as more people are getting familiarized with the deep web purchase mechanism. It’s high demand.
Extremely high.
But sitting here, about to initiate my plan, more than I ever have before, I fear for my life. I find that a lot of people underestimate the influence of big pharma. Of politics. Of lobbyists.
For this is THEIR game. They dabble in playing with people’s lives for their own economical pursuit. They kill so many to satisfy their greed.
No more. 
I will go down in flames, and no one in history will ever hear either my name, or my story, but at least I will die trying to change this world. Either that, or I will get sucked into this game and become one of THEM. 
I don’t know. 
I sit in this room, no longer with men dressed in suits, but now men dressed in medals. Politicians, war heroes, prime ministers. It’s nowhere near an official meeting; this is a Christmas gathering. This is where most deals are made - under the table. And I have to put on my best impression to please them.
It’s easy to make a man disappear without killing him.

els8382,jabetizo,82,"A cryptocurrency exchange that claims real dollars back its popular digital coin Tether raided those reserves to cover up $850 million that went missing, the New York Attorney General’s office said Thursday.

State Attorney General Letitia James said Hong Kong-based iFinex Inc., which operates the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange and owns Tether Ltd., has been commingling client and corporate funds to cover up the missing funds, which occurred in mid-2018 and hadn’t been disclosed publicly.

The attorney general’s office said it has obtained a court order directing iFinex to stop moving money from Tether’s reserves to Bitfinex’s bank accounts, halt any dividends or other distributions to executives and turn over documents and information. The coverup drained at least $700 million from Tether’s reserves, according to the attorney general’s office.

Attorneys for iFinex didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and representatives of Bitfinex and Tether weren’t immediately available.

The attorney general’s findings emerged from an investigation into cryptocurrency exchanges that it launched in 2018 and is continuing. A report in September warned that many exchanges lacked basic safeguards and left consumers vulnerable to exploitation by market manipulators.

A so-called stablecoin, Tether is purportedly backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars. Yet the firm has never released a public audit showing it has the reserves to back the coins in circulation, leading many to question whether the funds exist.

Tether has marketed the coin as a way to get both the safety of the dollar and the speed and anonymity of a digital currency. Its market value has risen steadily over the past two years, to $2.8 billion from about $10 million at the beginning of 2017.

It has become a major source of liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. About 80% of all bitcoin trading is done in Tether, according to data from research site CryptoCompare.

The attorney general said Bitfinex’s problems began in 2018, when it handed over $850 million to third-party payments processor Crypto Capital Corp. to handle customers-withdrawal requests. Over the months that followed, Panama-based Crypto Capital failed to process the orders, the attorney general said.

Representatives of Crypto Capital weren’t immediately available for comment.

By November of that year, according to people close to the attorney general’s investigation, Bitfinex determined that it had permanently lost access to the $850 million. To hide the missing funds, Bitfinex and Tether engaged in a series of maneuvers that drained Tether’s reserves, the people said.

A gap of that size would represent a major portion of Tether’s reserves. Tether currently claims on its website that the coins it issues are backed by reserves that include currency, cash equivalents and other assets and receivables. The language was altered in March; it previously claimed the reserves were 100% in currency.",2019-04-26 07:25:25

In my 5 year period there's really only been about 9 months worth of mining where I felt like the pros outweighed all the cons and that was when bitcoin was quickly climbing from $900 to nearly $20K. I had many days where my profit was exceeding $150+ per day.",2019-04-26 23:01:36

#How does it work?

* After starting zeronet.py you will be able to visit zeronet sites using http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address} (eg. http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D).
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site, then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers. Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.

There is also an Android app you can use on your phone.

elyljx4,Wesleypipes421,77,"So I've been doing some research to identify the key macro thematic going forward for FX trading and I think I've discovered something really interesting relating to BTC by accident.

Basically I've been comparing certain FX pairs to the Ishares emerging market ETF (based on the MSCI EM index) to see correlations and what is driving price action. Anyways I flicked through my TradingView tabs to BTCUSD with EEM (Ishares EM ETF ticker) still on compare and spotted something which I feel isn't a mere coincidence.

Bitcoins price since the end of the 2015 bear market has shown a reasonably strong correlation with the health of emerging markets:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/pE0sTG8X/

Of course, as is observable from the left of that chart the correlation didn't exist prior to 2015:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/b015zAd9/

This shows that what I think I am observing now with regards to a potential correlation didn't exists prior to 2015.

Anyhow, I thought to myself that there may be a longer term trend correlation, but not a short term correlation. Because of that thought I was eager to see if certain swings in BTC's price have shown a strong correlation with certain swings in the EEM index and I found a few examples:

The February 6th crash and subsequent risk on rally showed a strong correlation which eventually broke into April:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/4g9RQH7n/

The May/June sell off from 10k coinciding with a harsh sell off in the EEM index:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Lr0zeFPX/

The June/July bull trap rally showed a strong correlation which held all the way until the end of the hidden bull whale grind rally:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/L4eAArlD/

After this point EEM continued to capitulate whilst BTC played its boring game at 6k, it wasn't long though before Bitcoin played catch up:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/LeQqNnIV/

Now looking at that chart it seems that in the last 7 months the concurrent correlation has broken down, but it seems like EEM is now leading BTC and that favorable conditions in Emerging Markets correlate with favorable conditions for Bitcoin.

What does this mean if this correlation is actually legitimate?

Well firstly it means that Bitcoin isn't an uncorrelated asset class anymore and that the uncorrelated narrative has been untrue since 2015. Bitcoin is a play on the health of Emerging Markets and by proxy China and whenever those markets get rekt the Bitcoin market also deteriorates.

Secondly it means that a macro thematic can be extremely useful in deciphering Bitcoin's price action going forward and seems like a must have for any trader looking maintain an holistic view of the Bitcoin market.

Thirdly it means that the strength of the Chinese economy (which buoys and leads EM) is very important, it also means that the strength of the US Dollar is important because a strong dollar is what causes EM problems. 

On that last thought here is a chart of BTC vs DXY (Dollar Index) Inverted, its not as strong a correlation compared to EEM but there is something there:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7MGZzLUi/

Anyway, I know a lot of the pro Bitcoin crowd are fairly stubborn and dismissive of legacy people trying to frame macro analysis over Bitcoin and if you're one of those people feel free to toss this out or critique it below. But (at least to my eye) this macro theme looks legit so although I have already been using it for trading Fx pairs I may also use it now to analyze Bitcoin's price for future trading opportunities.",2019-04-28 13:14:00

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everybody. I've been following this community for a while now but never shared much, and today I wanted to give back something to those who have helped me understand this market.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last months, I've been building a Bitcoin trading algorithm based on a machine learning model. At first I only used classic trading data (OHLC prices, volume, standard deviation etc.) but I have made a lot of experimentation to integrate blockchain features to my model, in order to find an edge to compete with the majority of people only using purely financial data. 

One of the only blockchain metrics that I often see discussed here is the number of transactions. Surprisingly, I have found that this particular metric didn't improve the performance of my bot at all. I have come to the same conclusion with a lot of other blockchain features which seemed promising, like number of adresses, mining profitability, block size etc. but had no positive effect on the performance of the algorithm.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is one metric, that I would have never thought about in the beginning, that drastically improved the performance of my model: confirmation time. I was surprised at first, but after thinking about it, it is obvious why it is an excellent trading indicator.

Small and fast recap for those of you who don't know: the Bitcoin protocol is designed so that in average, a new block is mined every 10 minutes. The mechanism behind that is that the so-called ""difficulty"" level is automatically adjusted once a week so that with the current combined hashrate of all miners, this confirmation time stays around 10 minutes. If this confirmation time is above 10 minutes for a week, the difficulty will be decreased and vice-versa.

When a new block is mined, the miner (or miners network) who found it is currently rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins (12.5/2 = 6.25 after the halvening).

This means that in average, the supply of bitcoins increases by 12.5\*6\*24 = 1800 btc every day.

Due to the difficulty adjusting only once a week and hashrate varying quite a bit, it is not exactly 1800 btc/day but in a range between around 1200-2400 btc/day.

And guess what, this is A LOT. On major exchanges today, the volume on ""normal"" days is only a few thousand bitcoins (\~6k on Bitfinex), and around10x more on crazy days with daily Bitcoin volumes around 50k. This means that most of the time, the daily supply of new bitcoins mined is equal to a very high percentage of the daily volume traded (from 30% on calm days to 3-5 percent on crazy days) on major exchanges. The last very important information is that most miners operate on thin financial margins, which means that most of them sell their Bitcoin rewards right away when they get it, or during the few days after they got it. This has been quite well documented, and is proved by the fact that a lot of miners went bankrupt very fast during the 2018 bear market. There may be some miners who are hodling a little of their rewards but the great majority sells their bitcoin fast.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this means that when the confirmation time is increasing, you can expect the selling pressure to drop during the next days, and vice-versa.

Obviously, not all the miners sell on the same exchanges, but just to get an idea, you can check on the order books the influence of an amount of Bitcoin sold on the price variation (a couple hundreds btc bought/sold can cause a 1% price change). You can see that even a small percentage of 1200 or 2400 btc sold in one day can make a huge difference on the impact on the price.

&amp;#x200B;

I could talk about it forever but I think you get the idea and this post is already much longer than I intended.

Sorry for any spelling/grammatical mistakes, I'm French.

&amp;#x200B;

You can track the performance of my bot on the position bot. Of course, bad luck made me start to post my positions there just before the Bitfinex FUD and I'm trading on Bitfinex, but you will get a better idea of the bot's performance when it has run for a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be more than happy to answer any question in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers, and get rekt safe.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr:** Average bitcoin confirmation time is a great indicator to consider. Increasing block confirmation time leads to lower sell pressure and vice versa.

elz4lxc,Redac07,44,"The biggest con of nano is also one of its most beautiful aspect. It's distribution. You gained nano through a faucet, which was free. It gave people in third world countries an income (Google it! People praised the devs for it). On the other hand in the beginning bots also farmed it (later that become impossible through audio and video faucets) and company hired people to do the faucet the whole day. So a few gained a lot of nano in that time period. 

If you look at current distribution, the top 100 (including exchange wallets) holds more then 60% of the total supply of nano.  It means nano isn't distributed that well (it isn't XRP or XLM level bad but it still is bad imo). 

That is my 'fud' for nano. That and no inflation rate means deflation, which isn't good for a currency. It's okay for a storage of value but not for a currency. We all saw nano rise to $35. If nano reaches too high, people will be dealing with 0.0004 nano etc. like now with Bitcoin. A too high price isn't good for currencies either imo, but we will see.

You only have to search Twitter yesterday to see BTC fans accusing me of all kinds of crap for suggesting a truce. You only have to search r/btc to see all the crap I took from the Bitcoin Cash crowd after the Rizun interview.

There is no impartiality. Whenever I have attempted to pick apart the truth of what has happened (like a journalist), as soon as I come to a conclusion then all the same points get thrown out if they disagree with a world view.

It all becomes pointless because nobody respects the work, they just want their answer.

This inability to compromise, admit mistakes and take responsibility is what creates the tribalism. From both sides, you’re either with us or against us, and if you’re against us we’re going to destroy your credibility.

This is nonsense, it does nothing to help anyway. Alas we continue as follows:
1. No acceptance of Bitcoin Cash form BTC. It is an attempt to wrestle control. We must stand firm.
2. No acceptance from BCH. It was hijacked by Blockstream. We must stand firm.

There is little to no strong leadership. Roger’s manipulative use of my Tweet is a great example.

I don’t see the point of the debate because the debates have happened again and again. I know all the points from both sides. You have BCH, go and prove it. Let the tech and markets decide.

On a personal level, any attempt to listen to alternative voices is always met with shit (from both sides). I don’t want to moderate this debate when all that will happen is I get more crap. Essentially I am the referee in a hostile football match. Lose/lose because of the poor leadership.

If you're actually interested in honest conversation, for the third time I ask you to talk with me past sending me one line zingers.

Elsewhere you talked about how everyone always attacks you no matter what you do.

Would you believe Bitcoin wasn't always like this? Back when I got involved, there was a lot of unity, everyone was talking about banking the unbanked, we had Dell and Microsoft and all these other companies accepting Bitcoin directly, it was a great time to be a Bitcoiner.

Now we're not banking the unbanked, we're rebanking the banked w/Lightning Network and we're told Bitcoin isn't for poor people at all. Dell and Microsoft and Steam and the rest have all dropped Bitcoin for payments and we're telling people ""Bitcoin is a horrible payments system."" We used to get along and we were going to change the world. Now we all fight at each other because who wants to change the world we want lambos.

Peter, thanks for coming here to talk to us. 

The entire reason we hold Bitcoin is because it offers a form of sovereignty. If we couldn't fork the coin because we didn't agree with the change in BTC strategy to ""small, full blocks"" but instead just had to along with whatever the guys in charge of the software repo decided, then Bitcoin would not be different from any other centrally planned money. It is literally our freedom to continue our vision of Bitcoin the way we bought into it that ensures we remain sovereign over our money.

**Consider tomorrow you wake up and somehow everyone's on board with turning Bitcoin into a music file sharing system. A soft fork is agreed upon. You and some other folk think this is crazy and isn't what you signed up for, but it's a soft fork so it's happening whether you like it or not.

1. Cheap coders in India and China - Dude, welcome to 2005. This has *always* been the case. China has ALWAYS pumped out cheap coders. My first iOS gig, I was literally hired specifically because they had scaling issues with their iOS app that was built using cheap China labor. They spent about $85,000 in salary, equipment and training for me and another part-time guy to revert their codebase to something that could have features added to it. This was 2015.  
2. Masses of CS grads. Again, is this anything new? This is an engineering field and it's difficult. Tons of people get in, but the ones who can't hack it fail to really make the top 10% which is where all the Twitter, Google, FAANG, etc graduates make it too. Yes, thousands of new CS students, but it won't matter if they dilute the programs because the larger tech companies will make their hiring criteria more algorithm/white board heavy. There has been inflation in the market since the early 2010's and the first CTCI books started to surface. Coding bootcamps have been trendy since 2013!  
3. Moore's Law - Counter argument, ""smart"" stuff. Everything is getting smarter. Look at cars, we have Car Play, Android Auto and so on. Smart clothes, smart closets. This is all useful tech to supplement and augment our lives and make it easier to do things. Every company is trying to hire web, mobile developers and full stack/server engineers to increase their tech stack. 10 years ago you could get by with a very basic HTML site. Now, you need to use modern web/mobile technology or you **will** lose your customers. And this isn't something that's going to burst. Every year more and more companies have increasing demand to modernize their tech. Anyone that thinks that's going to ""burst"" doesn't know shit about the market, because seriously, EVERYTHING is getting smarter and more and more non-traditional tech things are getting more tech integration. Even refrigerator companies surprised me with how mobile they're getting.   
4. Phantom products. Again, this is nothing new. Bitcoin and Self Driving Cars are what it is now, but since I worked for a phantom product back in 2015, I can tell you, this has been around as long as software engineering has been around.  
5. Mass incompetence - I feel like he's projecting now. Again, this isn't new. There's always been inflation in the market as long as software engineers have been a solid career. How do you think SV became SV? Ever since Google and Zuckerberg and the VC sprint for gold happened, there has always been tons of people trying to break into CS. At the end of the day, even if there's 100,000 new engineers, only so many will make the cut. This has ALWAYS been the case.  
  
If you're good at software engineering, you will always have a job and you will always have good income. Don't worry about inflation at the lower levels unless YOU plan to make a career out of garbage low quality code. If that's the case, yeah maybe you should be worried. But personally, I don't make it a career goal of mine to only be good enough that overseas cheap labor are my competition. That's just not my style.",2019-04-30 10:17:30
em4cq7m,panmanjones5,35,"Before the 2008 recession, we only had the Great Depression in the early 1900s. You can argue that our economy had its ups and downs, but those two events were almost a decade apart. It takes time for bubbles, expansion and leveraging to occur. Everyone on Reddit always point out but the value of a dollar has been decreasing/our debt is way too high. 1st point is if you look at the value of the Lira, Yuen or Renmingbi, please name me a currency that doesn’t inflate. In the words of Stanley Drunkenmiller, “Be long on the value of a dollar”. The dollar bill in comparison to other countries is probably what Bitcoin is to altcoins. Second, remember this thing called the Louisiana Purchase, the US was heavily in debt from the war with Great Britain and we still decided to purchase a quarter of the United States, our country definitely collapsed from spending too much. Just imagine a country like a business. In every 10K (Yearly SEC filing) of a S&amp;P 500 company, there are assets and liabilities and under liabilities, there will be debt. Debt is needed to service growth. Uber currently is not profitable but it has the cash flow to sustain itself. For example, if you had let’s just say $10,000 in cash, $10,000 in credit and $10,000 worth of debt. Do you use all of your cash to pay off the debt? If so now you have $0 in debt, 0$ in cash, but $10,000 worth of credit. Let’s just say you decide to use your $10,000 cash and $10,000 credit ($20,000 total cash equivalent) and you buy a house worth $20,000. Now you have 0$ cash and $20,000 worth of debt. Which scenario is better? 0$ cash, 0$ debt and $10,000 credit or $20,000 debt and a house worth at least $20,000? Great book to read is Principles by Ray Dalio. Just to give you a summary of his point is a quote by George Santayana, “Those who cannot remember the last are condemned to repeat the future.” Sorry for ranting but I love finance with a passion.",2019-04-30 15:22:39

em3jnrc,cointastical,32,"I thought the numbers were calculated as (with the [unbelievable] estimate that Tether is otherwise fully backed except for what they loaned to BitFinex:

$2.8B current Tether issued,  $0.65B loaned (of $0.85B of the letter of credit).  That left them ~75% backed (again, if you truly believed they have cash backing except for what got loaned to BitFinex).

But then I read Frances Coppolas' article on Forbes:

*"" Tether extended a secured, revolving line of credit of up to $900 million [...] The total accessed under the loan facility as of today's date is equal to $700 million.""*

*""Tether also transferred $625m to Bitfinex in a separate transaction. Bitfinex seems to have drawn rather more than the missing $850m from its sister company.""*
