f97mf2r,Zectro,2,"&gt;what a fucking dumb argument.

How's it a dumb argument? There are a lot of people in BSV who hold Craig Wright, a court-certified liar and fraud, in the same light as a Scientologist holds up L. Ron Hubbard. They unironically say things [like this](https://twitter.com/frogking69/status/1179847589681872901?s=09) about him. On r/bitcoincashsv almost any valid criticism of BSV or Craig eventually or immediately leads to a ban, often for content not even posted on the sub itself. This r/pyongyang level bullshit. /u/Annuit-bitscoin was banned from r/bitcoincashsv, a sub he hasn't posted on in 9 months for [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/bsv/comments/e2280a/in_which_craig_lies_yes_again/) made on r/bsv.

Just take a look at the sort of eery cultish misstatements that go wholly unchecked on r/bitcoincashsv:

* [This recent thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/e3948t/the_bsv_society_stands_strong_and_wins_crypt0s/) implies BSV ""won"" a poll to have BSV talked about on a channel when the vast majority of voters voted not to discuss BSV. Only one commentor in the thread seems to have realised BSV lost that poll. 
* Or look at this thread titled [
U.S. Copyright Office: Craig Wright Authored Bitcoin White Paper And Is Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/bra1cm/us_copyright_office_craig_wright_authored_bitcoin/): misinformation so egregious [the USCO literally made a press release page](https://www.copyright.gov/press-media-info/press-updates.html) just to address the aggressive shilling that was coming out of the pro-BSV camp.
* [
Today a judge ruled that Craig Wright is the last living person who can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin. That same judge ordered Craig to fork over ~$5 billion in bitcoin. I just got off the phone with Craig. This story is INSANE.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/cvytaj/today_a_judge_ruled_that_craig_wright_is_the_last/) Again. Misinformation, the judge literally went out of his way to clarify that the court was not required to make a decision on the matter, and did not make any decision.

Misinformation about BSV runs rampant on rbitcoincashsv because of over-enthusiastic religious zealots and censorship. This is not the case on r/bsv where both pro-BSV people and anti-BSV people are allowed to post given lax moderation policies. The desire of the people from r/bitcoincashsv is to take-over the subreddit and ban all the active posters, as [cryptorebel, rbitcoincashsv's moderator makes clear here](https://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/e31djl/rbsv_being_squatted_by_nefarious_bad_actors_who/f93rsaw/).

r/BSV as it exists right now is a necessary counterpoint to the aggressive shilling and misinformation that is spread in all the pro-BSV spaces, in the same way that it's positive that r/Scientology presents anti-Scientology arguments and a counterpoint to the shilling and misinformation of pro-Scientology spaces.",2019-12-01 11:32:25

&gt;Advises:

&gt;If you have a physical server always use UPS power supply to prevent power fails.

&gt;If you wanna force-close channels, always do it manually, one-by-one when your node is FULLY SYNCED.

&gt;Create SCBs (static channel backups) every time after opening a new channel and keep your 24 words seed.

&gt;After pressing the ""RETRUN"" button, don't panic, WAIT and don't press Ctrl + C (like me) instantly after that.

f9bfa3y,Capt_Roger_Murdock,2,"&gt;It‚Äôs only bullrun when feees get high that‚Äôs quite normal due to transactions volume

Sorry, but this is an incredibly dense thing to say.  Bitcoin should be experiencing continued exponential growth in terms of its adoption and usage. At this point in time, it's still very tiny in the grand scheme of things, and certainly  compared to its potential (assuming you're someone who thinks it could one day become the true ""money of the world""). Bitcoin has a current market cap of around $135 billion compared to a global M2 fiat money supply of around $70 *trillion*.  The Bitcoin network in its current configuration can handle, at most, around half a million transactions per day. At that rate, it would take the world's 7.7 billion people about 42 years to make a single transaction each.  Bitcoin is currently in a position where as it becomes a better money along one essential dimension (thanks to increased adoption / network effect) it simultaneously becomes a worse money along another essential dimension (as rising congestion causes transacting to be increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable).  Bitcoin's crippled capacity is a collar around its neck that turns into a noose as the network (attempts to) grow.

In late 2017 we saw what happens when a rightward-shifting demand curve for transactions slams into the vertical line of an increasingly-inadequate supply quota on block space.  The network's performance degraded quickly and severely with $30+ fees and insane confirmation delays. Yes, transaction fees subsequently came down when transactional demand declined, and some of that decline was the natural result of a receding hype cycle.  Unfortunately, some of that decline was due to [demand destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_destruction), i.e., some users and use cases abandoning the Bitcoin network because of its terrible user experience, and other users and use cases never adopting it in the first place. Of course, that kind of negative and non-adoption is absolute poison for something that's attempting to become money, a good whose utility is derived almost entirely from its network effect.

To give you a personal example of this phenomenon, I used to frequently introduce newbies to Bitcoin by having them download a phone wallet and then sending them a dollar or two's worth to play around with. I stopped doing that when the median fee got to around the $0.10 mark. I didn't resume even when fees (temporarily) fell below that level. In early 2018, I consolidated all of the BTC I planned to hold for the long-term into a single wallet where it still sits. 

As far as BCH goes, that was launched as a rebranded (new ticker, new name), minority hash-rate spinoff that made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm. In doing so, it sacrificed a *huge* chunk of its network effect (reflected not only by its substantially lower price but also by its still rather anemic transaction count).  In the short term at least, network effect is almost everything.  The bottom line though is that for any crypto to ""take over the world,"" it will need to achieve what I call the ""monetary trifecta,"" combining (1) a massive network effect; (2) high transactability (i.e., the ability to transact quickly, cheaply, and reliably); and (3) a reliably-scarce supply.",2019-12-01 23:57:42

f9behlk,bitusher,2,"&gt;Is is considered safe to connect the Nano S to an everyday-use PC?

Yes, The private keys and transaction signing occur within the ledger so even if your computer  is compromised the private key generation and wallet use is secure as long as you verify the tx address on your HW screen 

&gt; Also, same question for running Ledger Live.

This is fine to use or you can use  electrum for more features

&gt;In other words, how to avoid being pwned right from the start.

Do not keep your HW wallet in the same location as your backup words
The HW wallet itself doesn't need to be hidden except if you are trying to limit the amount of people who know you have Bitcoin in the first place because it protected by a pin and or passphrase where wrong entries delay retries exponentially and/or reset the HW wallet after a while.
Thus the focus should be on securing the BIP39 backup words .

1) Do not store these digitally

2) Never write down the pin or passphrase together with the 12/18/24 words

3) At minimum secure the backup 12/18/24 words on paper in a sealed plastic bag to protect against moisture or flooding. Do not laminate as certain adhesives can damage the ink.

4) If you can afford , upgrade to a metal backup (steel , copper brass... but aluminum is unacceptable)

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test/

https://blog.lopp.net/metal-bitcoin-seed-storage-stress-test--part-ii-/

5) Keep backup private and secure , whoever gets a hold of this can steal your BTC!

6) Pin you will just store in memory as that is not needed to restore a backup, but if you use the advanced passphrase feature you will need to back this up in memory and best to backup written down as well (paper or metal) . Passphrase should be kept separate than your backup 12/18/24 words

However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity‚Äôs smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù think about the all the times you‚Äôve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That‚Äôs right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we‚Äôre using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I‚Äôve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I‚Äôm perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don‚Äôt want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I‚Äôve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you‚Äôll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don‚Äôt need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you‚Äôve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it‚Äôs difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan‚Äôs chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters‚Äô lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I‚Äôm talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have ‚Äúdelusions of grandeur‚Äù are due to my being ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. ‚ÄúToo long; Did not read‚Äù: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

f9cipie,JohnnyLingoMusic,10,"If Bitcoin went all the way back to 1k the entire crypto market cap would be like 30 billion.  Is that even realistic at this point?  Supposedly on the linear scale we haven't even capitulated yet which is hard to believe considering that the drop from 6k to 3200 looks like capitulation and then it went up 400% from there.  Also at this point in the real world bitcoin is pretty much dead.  I still talk about it but nobody is really interested. If anything i would think the market will just be uninteresting for awhile.  And this article claims that bulls still need to get destroyed but the drop from 20k to 3k wasn't enough?  Its also interesting to note that the rise from 3200 up to 13k this year was not at all like 2017.  Retail had no part in it.  So who were all the players?Greed will come again, its clearly still there.  There's more money to be made by breaking ATH's than this industry collapsing down to 1k.  If we can go from 3200 to 14k with no mainstream mania, than there are way too many buyers/players for it to collapse.

f9eoxc5,AlanArtemisa,9,"I'd try to badly explain it (and I will below), but I suppose Lightning Labs has a better simple [explanation](https://lightning.engineering/technology.html). After reading this, imagine if not only ""Alice"" and ""Bob"" are involved, but Bob also has a channel with ""Charlie"". Now Alice can send BTC to Charlie by sending BTC to Bob if he proves he has sent BTC to Charlie. You can theoretically scale this up *ad infinitum*.

So.. The Lightning Network consists of nodes (entities with a private key) and channels (2-signature wallets shared between two nodes). Nodes that share a channel always have a pre-signed transaction by the other party dividing up the funds in it as has been agreed upon. The only thing they need to do is sign the transaction themselves and broadcast it to the regular Bitcoin network to get it mined and incorporated into the blockchain.  
Now, say Alice and Bob have a channel open between them. They have both put in 10 BTC, so their channel has a total capacity of 20 BTC. If Alice wants to pay Bob 1 BTC she creates a new transaction dividing up the funds in their channel, one wherein Bob receives 11 BTC and Alice receives 9. She sends this to Bob and Bob returns the same transaction, only signed by himself. Bob and Alice can continually change how they divide the channel balance, allowing them to make infinite transactions at the cost of only two transactions (opening and closing the channel).  
The cool things is that if Bob has a channel open to Charlie Alice can pay Charlie by paying Bob if he can prove he has paid Charlie. And you can scale this up a lot more, allowing for payments to anyone anywhere, at the speed that it takes the participating nodes to confirm the new transactions.

So... That's kind of how it works. For any of the more knowledgeable people who has spotted horrible mistakes: Please correct me where I'm wrong!",2019-12-02 09:49:32

f9giyam,bitusher,1,"&gt;Can one exhaust all wallet combinations 

No. Watch this video to understand why - 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZloHVKk7DHk

&gt;Also, how does cold wallet storage works? Only storing the private key and public key and thats it?

cold storage simply means your private keys are secured in such a way that they never contact directly with a network connected device. 

This means that Hardware wallet technically are not cold storage devices if you connect them to your internet connected laptop or phone but they are quasi  cold storage insomuch as the private keys never leave the device and all tx signing occurs in the hardware wallet.

The exception to this is  hardware wallets like cold card which  allow you true cold storage with PSBTs -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kocEpndQcsg

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8dBNrlwJ0k

Otherwise cold storage is just a backup on paper or metal waiting to be imported or sweeps later on . In the past people used to copy down a private key and address on paper for cold storage but this is an obsolete way to secure your Bitcoin and never should be used. 

These days you should store 12 /18 / 24 words for cold storage or use a multisig or SSS(although multisig  is better) for these reasons -

f9giimk,tradebiz,1,"Bitcoin is here to stay, and there are online a limited number of them. Not everyone will have a bitcoin.

Just imagine that you can store millions of dollars or just a dollar or two, on a blockchain, carrying it all over the world without anyone knowing. Its really simple. You just have a hardware wallet or a wallet in your phone. Just cross the borders ans no one knows what you have. Its your cash. You shouldnt have to tell anyone about it, as long as its legit and hard earned money in legal ways.

I am bullish on bitcoin and I am holding bitcoin because I know that many people will need it sooner or later, for different purposes. Such as storage, gateway from fiat, speculation and much more.

Bitcoin is opening up so many closed gates in economics and finances. Just imagine when the middle class in rich or developing countries will rush to buy bitcoin because of hundreds if not thousand reasons.",2019-12-03 00:18:11

f9gl5i8,Egon_1,1,"&gt;Hmm you say censorship-free but isn't the biased of bashing core a form of censorship?

It is apparent you are not familiar with the term censorship. Censorship means there are no traces anymore to verify myself. 

What you consider censorship is the inconvenient truth. You have **the choice** to read it or ignore it. 

r/bitcoin mods, on the other hand,  are robbing the community to have **the choice** in the first place, as they interfere what you should read. In other words, brainwashing.

Something like 1,000 people control 40% of the supply of Bitcoin. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future, but until then it's a big risk. On the plus side, Bitcoin could surge if the economy crashes next year like many people are saying. Plus, there's a halving event coming up next year. What I'm basically saying is: it might be useful to think of Bitcoin like gold. It might not be a good idea to put all your savings into it, but it is probably a good way to hedge against an economic slump. (Just my opinion, not CoinTracking's) Also: tax season is coming up, so if you need help with taxes you can create a free account with us and generate tax reports for free if you have 200 trades or less.

Not free, in fact a comparison of the costs of bitcoin transactions to banking transaction will quickly show you this is very unfree, but if you want to believe it is free you are free to believe that, although that is untrue to suggest.

&gt; tells me they are shysters looking for a free buck

Right, so that is why they have labored to remain, since 2011, one of the few exchanges never to be hacked.  Because Kraken are ""looking for a free buck?""

f9jz9s6,Smackberry,1,"So, rental market bubbles don‚Äôt act like stock bubbles. Generally, rents don‚Äôt all come crashing down at once because rents are governed by leases which can have months or even years of term left... but you‚Äôre right, this is a risk. 

Thing is though, there generally aren‚Äôt massive swings in housing demand in large cities with diversified economies‚Äî again, the ‚Äúbubble‚Äù isn‚Äôt like stocks where all of a sudden everyone sells/ stops renting. 

My point is, the run up in price is probably more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù and due to demand/ lack of supply than some kind of irrational exuberance as is typical with other bubbles (like bitcoin)

I think the market is probably undersupplied... and 9 time out of 10, when the market is undersupplied, and rents continue to rise, and companies aren‚Äôt building, there‚Äôs some form of restrictive regulation making building too costly/ risky.",2019-12-04 01:08:16

&gt; We don‚Äôt know who the whale is. TMI on youtube does videos about crypto news for btc, eth, xrp and then a couple of the other top 15 or so coins. 
&gt; 
&gt; In one of his videos, maybe around early Oct, he found an article about someone who was in the art industry who had a client that was trying to accumulate 25% of all btc. I don‚Äôt have the link to the video but a quick google search and I found the article he referenced.

&gt;  Its an asset that only 10 years ago was worth pennies but is now worth thousands and that‚Äôs deflationary, thats why. 
&gt; 
&gt; And a bank allowing people to buy crypto IS adoption. What do you think the 50+ generation would rather do - go through the concept of learning coinbase and other exchanges to buy this digital asset and potentially losing their value because they left their funds on an exchange or lost their keys? Or would they be more likely to adopt if they just went to the central banking system they‚Äôve been using for the past 30 years and not have to worry about the safety and security of their money?
&gt; 
&gt; Its not the best kind of adoption where people would be using it on a daily basis to buy w/e they want but now people have a means of acquiring btc. Now they need a means to use it daily and that‚Äôs happening now.",2019-12-05 03:36:14

https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/6vopfa/spoiler_s2e12_show_us_the_money_aka_what_happened/

Also I believe he owned ecoin in s3 (while telling us he was doing other stuff) and intends to lock it up, like we saw happen with Ray's site hot/cold wallets in s2.  Think he also did that with bitcoin this season as we saw part of that on a screen in s4.  If Elliot did those things, so that no one has any actual money access anymore (since the world is basically dependent on cryptocurrency by s4), then he could incite civil unrest that spurs to revolution and have all the control.  

At this point I'm not sure what he'll do, but I have always believed the ""I don't give a shit about money"" line would have a different connotation by the end of the show.  Cheers RCC!  :D",2019-12-05 03:12:16

I said in 2013 that AMD was a very strong stock to buy due to the current situation, and got laughed at a lot. Just type in AMD stock and look at the span since 2013.

When Bitcoin was around 16k, there were a few of us trying to say that you should really get out soon, and that it was clearly a prospective bubble with all of these people jumping in. And the few of us got met with ""You're an idiot, it's going to continue to rise, this is the future. It'll be 30k soon enough"" and all this shit. It didn't totally plummet, but... Yeah. A little less than a year ago, I said Bitcoin would actually be good to jump in and out of for a short span if you were willing to risk it. Again, same response, just the opposite. And sure enough it went up again for a bit.

f9nh94r,axzelezxa,1,"Thx for the reply

I agree with you that they must be having a hot wallet in their back-office where they transfer funds from an exchange account depending on whether an ATM client buys or sells then they probably do a trade with the opposite operation on the exchange account and transfer that value to the end client as you said. 

Even if they do use this hot wallet with small balance as you mentioned, is this the only risk they have ? I guess whether or not they can recover their lost value from the hot wallet only from the fees, when a big price drop happens in bitcoin, depends on whether they have a high or low number of transactions per day. Because if it's low volume transactions with small amounts then probably that's where the risk is of operating an ATM ...",2019-12-05 03:34:29

A lot of people take issue with early Bitcoin miners getting hold of a lot of the supply and this creating a skewed distribution. It is a fact though that Bitcoin was available to buy for less than $1 for more than first 2 years (infact it was possible to buy hundreds for $1 in first year).

Why take issue that one did not get the opportunity to mine when the same people couldn't even be bothered to buy from the free market for cheap? I mean where is the lost opportunity for those who think early miners somehow benefited unduly?",2019-12-06 08:26:04

It has evolved to also have significant value in its security. No one is taking down Bitcoin by force. 51% attack is not only infeasible at this point, but the damage done would be temporary and repairable (don't read ""reversible"" that's not what I mean, what I mean is BTC will live on and people will still trust and use it even if there were a successful 51% attack).

Ethereum is different. It has a figurehead, moving to POS has pretty different ""governance"", and makes smart contracts and dApps accessible.

The future is bright, but don't be fooled into thinking either of these are disappearing overnight, or even in 20 years. Software isn't a technology in the same way physical inventions are, like the lightbulb or batteries where they just become obsolete. Software is free to evolve. The moment Libra, Ripple or Dogecoin implements an innovative new feature, Bitcoin is free to incorporate it or not, as is any other project. The big difference is there is a giant pool of BTC holders and their holdings amount to a lot of cash. You don't convince people very easily to jump ship to something else, especially hodlers waiting for another pop / bubble.

f9v0i4m,jp_flynn,1,"I am learning this right this minute as well. jeez..you're correct as far as I am concerned.  Since learning the very basics of bitcoin listening to one of the early adopters and promoters talk about the origin the breakdown of value and mining and what had recently happened with the online exchange bitcoin used almost exclusively.  it was a magic the gathering online exchange and it was hacked and crashed and a small group of people made off with a shit ton of bitcoin.  Many millions.  That guy got paid in bitcoin, he explained the wallet, he tried to make it sound simple and transparent and he also couldn't help making it sound like he was a ringer.  when i say i learned the basics i mean all those terms i rattled off probably sounded like i know a little something when in reality if you pressed me with questions that expand upward you'd figure out i just blew my entire load of knowledge back there.  

Dude is right this seems traplike as hell. You tube is purging content creators for their stated reasons we should have heard their side by now and know that they are cutting the truth channels and the channels and communities that are using the reverse subversion tactics examining the government and acting as watchdog on the dark nature or technology and every other topic that is involved in the battle of Master vs Puppets.  This post ended up going places i hadn't planned but it does tie up nicely at the end. There are a couple stops on the route to the original topic but we will arrive. You deserve a warning and explanation having made it this far.  

The reverse subversion is when a society is under subversion tactics and has been for a generation or more and that society members who at some point learned about the lies and brainwashing and general mass mind control and they first break free and some then endeavor to get their message out and free those close to them and eventually that trend widens enough that the master class has to develop new more advanced disinformation tactics.  Reverse Subversion is literally when harmful mass lies and deception are countered with the actual truth and the majority which hear the truth turn their back on the chance to escape and be an agent for the truth or in the least be aware. Those who reject the truth fall under even deeper mind control and they can be convinced to reject truth tellers(whom they call liars and mentally ill and worse) persecute them.  Members of the puppet class in this example aka sheep aka steeple aka the sleeping class are fed propaganda and lied to so much that it actually takes much effort and carries a mental cost to break free.  The break isn't clean and comes with ridicule from family and friends, you may be able to figure out an outline of my worldview by now.

Reality is the United States has been under subversion of some kind since its creation but in the preceding 50-70 years those programs have expanded as the society has expanded. every man woman and child not part of the master ""Class"" have all been subjected to this stuff and an individual ultimately makes the choice alone.  He will experience anger and elation and satisfaction.  He will at some point experience superiority to those still ""asleep."" To a person meaning each and every man or woman, will experience some level of depression. Dude, you got played.  you were lied to about so much that you have verified and your curious  mind has don the math and expanded and exponentially the results are too gnarly. yeah depression.  You bout to spend a lot of time researching and falling away from real life and probably most worldly entertainment like movies and music preferring to re confirm over and over that this and that entertainer sold their souls and they are all making these fucking hand symbols? add to that the debate raging about who's trans gender  and your ability to suspend disbelief and now disgust is gone. Don't be that guy and maybe the ""last"" movie you should watch is Conspiracy Theory or at least watch clipped scenes of mel gibson playing the role of asshole conspiracy theorist blabbing talking points from 2001 to everyone he meets.  Watch and learn and add this to that list including politics and religion in mixed company.  You need to learn some stuff first.  The mind awakening is reading articles exploring youtube rabbit holes discovering different creators and their catalogs is a promise of new knowledge and hours of entertainment. There is a structure, I NEED to know i need to be able to sound intelligent about this. 

At some point newness wears off.  The pink cloud that was at your feet is gone and what's left?  You have the knowledge but is it worth the loss of blissful ignorance?  Friends and family won't talk about this stuff, laugh at me, I laugh at them too but I am laughing to myself and a comment section of sympathetic people but sometimes being back in the Matrix sounds nice. That steak looks fucking tasty when dude bites it and chews.  Yeah he is fine knowing.  

at pill I have been through all of this.  I ran back to the matrix and even upped my rank in the years i went back.  The program of the matrix is strong but phantom gremlin like flashes occur but they are just flashes.  Years later and being present during someones realization that something that was like this, actually is something else and holy shit she never looked back.  I didn't either.  One thing completes the circuit at least for me it did.  To avoid the feedback loop and backsliding  i went through there is but one...hmm...basically one person who is actually waiting for you was the missing piece to all of it.  If you know what i am saying you really know.  If you don't I pray you figure it out because honestly it was better for me to remain asleep without that final piece.  that piece should have been first and foremost to everything but I wouldn't change anything.  Figuring something this important and feeling the change, trying the truth pill and still doing it all MY WAY led to confusion, self righteousness that disguised fear and nihilism.  That pill had too many side effects.  The same pill,  years later, the movement had made progress. Sort of.  People connected to certain political dynastic figures seemed to always be shooting themselves in the head multiple times.  Our FBI told us these aids and reporters were robbed, they were overworked or on some anti depressant.  the name ""truth movement"" was a new thing to me.  At the same time anti conspiracy investigators had developed a rhetoric to galvanize their useful idiots.  This was a good time to jump back in with brand new armor and new eyes and ears as well.  The fear and confusion was cleared up and the self righteousness and frustration with family who just won't look with open eyes is in check.  When waking your people up leading with the illuminati or transvestigation: Pink, or how EZ-E was GIVEN AIDS in a syringe by his Lawyer and business manager, last name ""type of flower"" Berg.  If you lead every meeting with your family or friends with a story you read written by your dam Boyz Matt, and Mark and Luke and John.  

So in conclusion, bitcoin blah blah... Like Ron ""Tater Salad"" White has to do sometimes I told that story to tell this one. The people involved with Youtube are the ones tied to the truth movement and nowadays they are literally ENEMIES OF THE STATE.  DOMESTIC TERRORIST WHO HAVE THEIR OWN LIST.  This isn't your daddy's Infowars.  Alex Jones aint got SHIT on this its time to break glass release William ""Bill"" Cooper.  The people out front creating the content that us loyal subscribers disseminate to the best of our abilities.  All of us on both sides of the curtain are heading to Bitchute DLive or any other platform touting freedom of speech.  That one or more require users to have bitcoin wallets goes against the free nebulous untraceable model of bitcoin.  This is what the bankers were supposedly against and scared of.  There was always equal chance the banking families would either use bitcoin subversively and identify their enemies or blow up the world.  Either way the four horses would ride and who is shocked that it appears that most are going to flame out with a whimper?  Creators using the platforms are heading for trouble.  This currency that potentially would overthrow foreign governments and become an underground path for the right hand to battle the left. You are all missing the JoshWho",2019-12-07 04:36:24
f9v0oo2,dedragon40,1,"Do you really need one? It‚Äôs pretty known that men are more involved in technology and exhibit more interest in the field. Especially when it comes to bitcoin, as men are more inclined to believe doomsday scenarios and speculations that the world economy is on the brink of collapse.

Disregarding that, it‚Äôs easy to see why men are more involved in bitcoins. It has evolved from being a way to purchase drugs on the internet; of course the field of bitcoin will be more attractive to men, there‚Äôs no general appeal to women. Women are underrepresented in technology, and they‚Äôre underrepresented in wild libertarian beliefs that the economy will collapse and tax is theft.",2019-12-07 04:37:53
f9v1557,harda,1,"&gt; in reality it's the recipient who cares about confirmation times not the sender

I think this is debatable.  The receiver certainly cares about transaction being *confirmed*, since that's how they're protected against double spends.  They often don't care as much about how long it takes the transaction to be confirmed.  This is seen by having a simple policy of ""until your transaction has *n* confirmations, we don't take any action (e.g. let you use it as money on our platform).""  By having a policy like that, they make it so that only the sender cares about confirmation speed.

Given that it's the standard in Bitcoin for spenders to pay fees, I think that policy makes sense.

&gt; RBF is also not really compatible to multisig and timelocked contracts.

Why not?  I'm guessing you're thinking about multiple rounds of interaction being a pain, but (1) the participants had to coordinate initially somehow, so it doesn't seem implausible that they can do so again, and (2) they can always pre-sign a series of fee bumps (e.g. original tx with no nLockTime; fee bump 1 with nLockTime set to 10 blocks from now; fee bump 2 with nLockTime set to 20 blocks from now; etc...)

&gt; RBF breaks chains of transactions by double spending outputs, whereas CPFP behaves nicely and doesn't change the original transaction.

(No argument here.  This can indeed be a pain.)

&gt; we realized offering CPFP has more value for users.

IMO, I think both techniques are useful independently of each other and it's cool when wallets implement both.  /u/whitslack describes several advantages of RBF above (although I'd note that RBF also typically leaks privacy by deducting any additional fees from the change output in a way that can be observed by anyone monitoring transaction relay / mempool).",2019-12-07 04:41:43
f9uxyo8,brianddk,1,"&gt; Checked the local bitcoin atms in London using radar map and I must say buying is a rip off

Yes... consider it a privacy tax.  If you don't care about privacy, use an exchange and you can get fees down below 1%.

&gt; but how about selling? 

They will take a cut on both sides.  Buying and selling.  Same same...  Privacy Tax

&gt; I need to convert my 200&gt; quid worth of bitcoin into cash (am not interested in the holding part).

&gt; Tried localbitcoins

There are many many more... see list linked earlier.  Mycellium is popular as well. 

&gt; Someone has suggested attending bitcoin meetings, literally I have no idea how I am going to tell people that I am selling bitcoins. 

+1 this is the best choice.  You determine who the group organizer is.  If your using meetup.com this will be the group admin or whatever.  Find the organizer and when the meeting concludes tell them that ""I got some bitcoin recently, but I'm interested in selling.  I'll offering 5% discount off spot.  Know anyone who would be insterested?""",2019-12-07 04:14:57
f9uz041,NeedntBe,1,"So basically they act as a Bitcoin bank? And the contract is something like a Certificate of Deposit?

I actually wonder if there's a sort of market for this kind of long-term bitcoin holding by 3rd party. The company would have to have a lot of trust, though, or be able to crypographically prove the integrity of the system.

The profit would be in charging folks a % for breaking the contract and withdrawing early.",2019-12-07 04:23:47

i neither support not don't support bitcoin being used as a currency.

i could care less whether or not people use it.  The ONLY thing i care about, in regard to bitcoin, is the price (and i hope the price goes up)

I was simply saying that people your house on the open market, and then selling it in bitcoin is not smart.

f9v17bo,King_Yautja,1,"I don't worry about government regulation in the long term. Governments are incapable of effective cooperation there could never be a real coordinated global crackdown it'll always be fragmented and if one country is hostile to it another will be welcoming, if for no other reason than to undermine some other country it considers a rival.

Also truly oppressive regimes do not last. They are inherently self destructive. So over the very long term (100 years say) I expect regulatory attitude to ebb and flow, and because bitcoin really is unstoppable code it always stays one step ahead.

That's actually a major reason I have that last 3rd set aside even though I'll be long dead the idea is that if things really did get too hairy on Earth for whatever reason (oppressive totalitarian regimes, World War 3, The Church of Greta Tromberg) my descendants would have enough money they could just bug out.

f9uvotu,brianddk,1,"&gt; Obviously Coinbase and the govt will be able to see that funds went from Coinbase -&gt; Wallets A &amp; B

No... the whole universe knows this, not just Coinbase and govt.  Every TXN is stored in the blockchain which is public to everyone... everywhere.  Coinbase hot wallets are well known and it will not be hard for anyone to scan the blockchain and determine which TXNs are Coinbase TXNs.

&gt; how would they be able to determine who is owner of C?

You need to read some books on big-data and data-mining.  The way most of these things work is by collecting as many unique pieces of data and seeing what unique identifiers are related to each other.  For example u/WeakHands_Trader has a post history, is there anything in that post history that will shed light on their country, timezone, native language, gender-identity?  Any other social media have a @WeakHands_Trader userid?  Same process on all the other social media sites.  Next you can check leaked password databases.  These can be used to associate userid with emails.  If an email is found for u/WeakHands_Trader, then perhaps it is of the form Joe.Smith@purdue.edu.

Now I know that WeakHands_Trader is Joe Smith and he attends or teaches at Predue.  This is iterative and each new connection triggers a new scan to get more information.  Eventually bitcoin addresses could get pulled in as the mining determines what likely IP addresses WeakHands_Trader has used.

You can avoid this... but it is very, very, very difficult to live the type of lifestyle that doesn't leak a lot of this data.",2019-12-07 03:55:38

fa03yu1,stubz_gm,4,"Nearly finished and would certainly recommend it.

The author asserts BTC's value is derived from the finite quantity, strict issuance, cryptographic authenticity, resistance to updates, and salability. The book illustrates the hugely negative effects of using unbacked, government controlled, depreciating fiat and has Bitcoin as the antidote to it all.

&gt;Bitcoin's immutable monetary supply makes it the best medium to store the value produced from the limited human time, thus making it arguably the best store of value humanity has ever invented. (p.198).

What you really need to know as a Nano enthusiast is this:

&gt;Around the year 2140 there will be no new supply of Bitcoin, and the stock-to-flow ratio becomes infinite, the first time any commodity or good has achieved this. (p.199).  
&gt;  
&gt;As Bitcoin continues to evolve in the direction of having a higher market value with higher transaction fees, it starts to look more and more like a reserve currency than a currency for everyday trading and transactions. (p.206).  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin's advantage, rather, is that by bringing the finality of cash settlement to the digital world, it has created the fastest method for final settlement of large payments across long distances and national borders. (p.207).  
&gt;  
&gt;The number of transactions in a Bitcoin economy can still be as large as it is today, but the settlement of these transactions will not happen on Bitcoin's ledger, whose immutability and restlessness is far too valuable for individual consumer payments. (p.210).

Trouble is with bigger blocks those tighter timings are liable to produce more orphans because its just not enough time to propagate the whole network, and I suppose spark more re-orgs since nodes late to the party might have a different opinion to broadcast.

fa70dsz,VictorCobra,30,"Hey everyone, I know it's been a long time since I posted, but it's good to see that some of the same people are still lurking in here. I've kept up with the market, and have continued to post on TradingView, but crypto Reddit sentiment has really gone down the tube. I suppose I could have continued to post here regularly despite this, but I've also started working again and am in the midst of applying to grad school. That and being in a serious relationship has eaten up a lot of my time. You guys would probably say that's a good thing ; ) 

In any case, [my most recent Bitcoin analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/FTual2W1-The-Last-Bullish-Setup-BTC-USD/) is about the 50w/100w MA cross that should happen very soon. More people are talking about it now, which makes me worried about whether or not it'll actually have any effect. But so far, price is moving slowly up on low volume which is exactly what happened from January-March of this year, as some of you guys are noticing. This is what happens when natural demand starts to outpace supply. Before that post, I tried to call at least a [short term reversal,](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/b6P4SBf9-Looking-For-A-Reversal-Bitcoin-Prints-A-Failed-Breakdown/) when Bitcoin failed to break below the bearish channel support.

On the negative side of things, I wrote an [extensive post](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/CR9fGGU8-Reasons-To-Be-Bearish-On-Crypto-Why-The-Market-May-Be-Dying/) about why I think cryptocurrencies aren't quite ready to solve certain economic inequities, and why this could be a short term downfall for the market. I wrote it to counter my own belief that cryptocurrencies could actually play a role in creating more financial inclusion. I think it's always important to be skeptical. In order to help myself stay positive about crypto though, I've taken to recording some TA videos in a [silly accent.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL2/SbGcF1AZ-Injecting-Some-Fun-Into-A-Boring-Market-VC-s-Crypto-Update/) 

In terms of alts (those who know me know I'm an alt guy who likes doing analysis on Bitcoin), many are actually still looking very [similar to Bitcoin in 2015.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/iIi9C7jA-Many-Alts-Resemble-Bitcoin-s-Bottom-From-2015-Part-2/) Others have continued to die out, and I made a [post](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VETUSDT/tQWKwchc-Good-Alts-VS-Dead-Alts/) yesterday about comparing those that have tried to form a floor and those that are still in freefall. I've also been keeping an eye on dominance. Many maximalists will assume that most alts will continue to make new lows against Bitcoin. While that may be the case, dominance is still *technically* in a long term downtrend. I suppose a lot of this depends on picking the ""right alts,"" since it's clear that they are not all created equal. Many are still decently up from their September/August 2019 lows. I did also try to call the bottom for ETH/BTC this summer. So far, so good, but I'm aware that things can shift on a dime, particularly if Bitcoin pumps.  It would be extremely bullish for alts if they started to pump massively [here.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTC.D/JhF597u6-Bitcoin-Dominance-Mirror-Wedges-The-Long-Term-Downtrend/) It would confirm higher lows on a multi-year timeframe for many ratios. This is particularly important because ETH is at a critical juncture in terms of development. In addition, the altcoin market as a whole is very closely resembling the second bottom for the 2015 bear market. Even if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, there could be some great opportunities to accumulate Bitcoin with alts, if you can time it right. 

The overall market seems to be confirming [a slower growth scenario](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/AGUoHeZX-Slower-Growth-For-Cryptos-Becomes-More-Likely/) I talked about a while ago. Based on the market behavior from this year, and how manipulated things are, I'm not expecting a break of the ATH for quite a while. Even if crypto [followed what Amazon did post-dotcom bubble](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/dIZQvrFT-What-Would-Happen-If-Crypto-Followed-Amazon/),  we may not see any ATH's for at least 2-3 years. This would be a great opportunity for some short term growth towards the $500B mark, to prove that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Then we can have a large accumulation period for buyers to hop on board. On the other hand, if we do happen to break the $14K area sooner rather than later, we can see accelerated growth. I really have my doubts about this happening though. 

I know these are a lot of thoughts, and it may not seem entirely clear. I'm just showing that I'm still actively analyzing this crazy market and that I haven't dropped off the face of the Earth. Things have been confusing for a while, particularly for active traders. But that doesn't stop me :P I do also have a Twitter account. I think I follow a couple of you guys on there now, but it's ""thevictorcobra"" if you feel so inclined. It's hard for me to actively post on Reddit these days, but I'll do my best to participate a little more. 

Hope everyone is doing well and taking care of themselves.

Take a 30,000 foot view down on the entire crypto space as a whole. Where is 99% of the action happening? On Ethereum. Why?

THE DEVELOPERS. Ethereum has far more developers than any other project. Nothing makes Ethereum valuable except for the idea + the developers. Once crypto truly becomes mainstream, the Network Effect is going to happen &amp; we'll see 99% of these other projects disappear.

The Great Depression happened while the US was on the gold standard.

And you have the additional problem of a static amount of wealth which can lead to stagnation or even deflation. You want to know why bitcoin and other cryptos didn't replace regular money? Because it was more valuable to not spend it.

On top of that, if suddenly a large supply of the commodity your currency is based on suddenly shows up, well, *get fucked*. See what happened to the Spaniards after they looted South America. You also run into trade issues where you effectively run out of reserves (see Britain when they ran out of silver to trade for tea and resorted to opium).

Fiat currency works because it isn't a real thing and you can grow the total supply to grow with a growing economy AND a growing population. The problems with it come when some idiot thinks they can just print more money to make their problems go away, but that typically happens when the economy is already completely fucked for a different reason (or when the state is a failure and they print money to pay off the military or whatever).

The disadvantages of a commodity currency *far* outweigh its benefits and the benefits of fiat currency outweigh its problems. If you have a problem with government mishandling of fiat currency, you have a problem with the government/state, not with the currency itself. Governments can mishandle anything, including commodity currency (see examples above).

Why would any rational person *want* to replicate gold as money in digital form? It was actually a pretty terrible form of cash. Heavy, cumbersome, dangerous to carry, hard to divide on the spot...

Then someone invented paper receipts for this gold that sits in a vault *to make it easier* to transact. Eventually gold became a purely speculative metal of limited industrial use that people only hoard for their doomsday pepper fantasy world.

Its nothing short of lunacy to act like being slow and bad are *positives* for BTC. There is are no technical reasons for this, its just poor central planning by mongs like Gmax that turned Bitcoin into the exact opposite of what it as built to fight back against.",2019-12-10 09:38:25

faazt5f,bitjson,2,"This is a request for comments on a draft specification for a new Bitcoin Cash opcode, `OP_PUSHSTATE`, which is now [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bitjson/op-pushstate). This opcode would allow for significant size optimization to ‚Äúcovenant‚Äù transactions.

While transaction sizes are less important on BCH than on BTC, `OP_PUSHSTATE` saves around half the size of covenant transactions, reducing transactions fees (\~0.1 cents USD per transaction), simplifying wallet implementations, and eliminating wasted block space from duplication.

For example, [CashChannel](https://blog.bitjson.com/cashchannels-recurring-payments-for-bitcoin-cash-3b274fbfa6e2) transactions currently require \~900 bytes on average. With `OP_PUSHSTATE`, these transactions can be optimized to \~500 bytes, about the size of an equivalent multi-signature transaction.

I‚Äôd love to see this opcode deployed in the November 2020 BCH network upgrade. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing, please [join the working group on Telegram](https://t.me/pushstate) or [share your feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/bitjson/op-pushstate).

Like I said, at this point I mostly feel like I just repeat the same stuff over and over again, and that makes it hard to stay as engaged. And frankly, it's hard not to be depressed about the state of the Bitcoin experiment. BTC remains crippled by its lack of capacity and BCH remains crippled by its lack of adoption.  The latter's price and transaction volume are both pretty dismal.  The fact that BCH was even created as a minority hash rate spinoff speaks to a failure of Bitcoin's governance model and fundamental security assumption (i.e., that a majority of the hash rate could be trusted to protect the network's integrity).",2019-12-10 03:53:56

fae6v8m,bruisesarentenough,1,"Thanks for all the info!

I think it's pretty obvious, based on what I've seen at this point, that the price isn't tied to energy consumption. 

I still wonder, on a more abstract level, what the energy consumption means and if we've ever seen something similar with means of exchange. Gold, as I mentioned, has always had intrinsic value. People have always been singularly obsessed with the substance itself. So that's a partial but definite explanation for mining of gold throughout history. It seems to me, so far, that the energy used for Bitcoin could be compared to the energy used to mine gold--though the motivations don't exactly match up, and I don't know that the use of energy exactly matches either. 

Fiat currency doesn't seem to have a similar production cost. Beads, for example, had a not insignificant production cost, and can be said to be objects with their own value. (Worn as jewelry, appreciated aesthetically, etc.)

I don't like to say ""perfect,"" but with Bitcoin it looks like we have a *very* good method of exchange and we're willing to pay for electricity in order to use it. On a very deep level, the implications of this are important. It exists entirely in cyberspace, and we're putting exchanging billions of dollars for some space on this electronic ledger. The energy consumption up to now could be a careless side effect of the bubble I mentioned--making a few cents wherever possible--or it will be an ongoing core aspect of Bitcoin as it grows.",2019-12-11 01:23:05

1.) Anyone can buy the hat / merch from [yang2020.com](https://yang2020.com)

3.) Ask the same buyer for a ""Christmas present"", or a ""communication service fee"" (via harder to trace electronic payment methods, like Bitcoin, paypal, e-gift card, wire transfer, etc) .

4) the ""present"", or ""fee"" would be the same price as the hat (+ tax + shipping).

Not if you can't get any. Look at it this way: Whenever current-Bitcoin collapses and gets replaced by future-Bitcoin-with-inflation, there will be 21 million current-Bitcoins in existence, and they will have collectively lost however much value that used to represent. The loss will be spread across many people, but the loss is unavoidable.

Separately, holders of future-Bitcoin will have gained that same amount of value. Now, how do you ensure that value is distributed to the people who lost it on the current-Bitcoin chain, instead of being distributed uniformly or randomly?",2019-12-12 04:25:54

When is leveraged trading complicated enough to be ""advanced""? I agree using a HELOC is not advanced at all. But if we're talking stock options, when does the topic switch from ""intermediate"" to ""advanced""? What if I'm investing in stock options, BUT I'm only investing with $5K, and it's 100% within my TFSA so there are no tax implications. Is that advanced? What about a post that says ""I just turned 18 so I decided to take the $5K I earned from my summer job and invest in stock options, please give me feedback"".

There are issues with this with other unconventional investments, like cryptocurrencies. Clearly cryptocurrencies can be a highly advanced topic - but when does that threshold get crossed? If I post ""I just bought $10K of Ethereum, so excited!"", is that post allowed? Does the fact that it's about cryptocurrencies make it sufficiently ""advanced?"" What if I post about needing advice about tracking an ACB for my cryptocurrencies? Is that advanced enough? What if my niche is more obscure cryptocurrencies outside of the well-known ones like BitCoin/Ethereum? Or what about conversations about blockchain technology - when do they become ""advanced""?",2019-12-12 04:27:17
fahr9ie,BaWro,1,"It is not possible to know what will happen with Bitcoin. We can see BTC grew after the halving in the last two halvings. Bitcoin will need a shock of demand in order to grow, which would have a larger impact on BTC if rewards are lower for miners. 

There may not be higher fees. Fees are decided by the users. If the network is not congested, there is no reason for fees to increase. 

With lower rewards and with the same USD price per BTC, only the best miners will remain competitive and those that cannot keep a few weeks registering losses will have to shut down their miners. If that happens, hashrate will fall and difficulty will follow, allowing new miners to enter the space. There is no such a thing as 'death spiral.'  


Bitcoin will eventually become more valuable in the long term because the demand for the asset will be larger than its supply, as it already is. The higher the number of buyers, the more bullish this is for Bitcoin. With a reward reduction of 50% and a large increase in demand, the prices should grow.",2019-12-12 04:16:57

fal66fr,Thelochnesscumslut,1,"Hey there, I'm Nessie! Don't let my outward quiet, sweet and nerdy appearance fool you. Deep down I'm your sex loving, cock worshipping and cum craving kinkster! In my down time I play video games, play with my animals, read books and learn programming, but what I really want is to fulfill all your deepest desires!

#Sneezing

* First Time Sneezing Powder

Oh boy I loved making myself sneeze a while ago and so I ordered some sneezing powder. This is my first attempt at using it, not even on my own at first! I take 2 doses of it during the video and see how I react to different amounts. Man oh man does it make you sneeze hard!

8:35 | $9.99

* Making Myself Sneeze - I've been feeling the itch to make myself to sneeze and I hear you like to watch... I do a great collection of sneezes, some from tickling my left nostril and some from my right one! I use a tiny plastic piece and tickle my nose, getting myself into sneezing. Sometimes I even manage to get two right in a row!

5:33 | $5.99

#WEDGIES

* Wedgies, wedgies, wedgies! - First I want to show you how much I enjoy giving myself a wedgie with even my yoga pants on. I cycle through a few pairs of panties, some thongs, some full back ones and give myself back and front wedgies over and over. When I get to my boyshorts, I manage to pull the tops all the way up to my bra!! When I get to my second thong, I even manage to get the side of it pulled up and over my tits. Haha, so much fun!

9:09 | $10.99

* Atomic Wedgie - Hahaha, you're such a fool, letting me grab hold of your underwear! Now it's time for me to give you a massive wedgie!! Do you think I can manage to accomplish the biggest feat, getting them over your head?? Well, I'm going to try my hardest to give you a big atomic wedgie!

AUDIO ONLY

10:02 | $9.99

* Wedgie Questions - Ever wanted to know how I feel about wedgies? Here's your chance to hear me talk all about them! I have a nice list of questions that are super fun and amusing to talk about. Things from what doe front wedgies feel like, do I ever pick wedgies and even talking about the famed Atomic wedgie!

AUDIO ONLY

 15:43 | $12.99

#OTHER

* Watersports/Peeing Compilation!  - I looooove Watersports!! You get to watch 10 shorter clips of me relieving myself outdoors at various times and I enjoyed the risk of each and ever one of them! Finally, you get to finish the video by watching me play with myself, talk about how much I love watersports and then relieving myself into the bathtub with a fantastic view of the golden stream!

5:33 | $6.99

* Expanding Giantess - I'm your teacher and invited you to my house to discuss your coursework one evening. The thing is, I'm fed up with being a teacher, with the low pay and the annoying students... So I want to take matters into my own hands, and I'm willing to go to great lengths to change my circumstances! I've researched some witchcraft, found a recipe for an elixir and created it. There's only one missing ingredient: I need to have sex. I drink it right in front of you, as you watch. I can already feel the affects: warm tingles, increased libido. Now I just need your cock!!

It ends after I grow so big and sexy, that I burst out of the room! A massive, giant woman! I hold you to my gigantic breasts, thanking you and telling you that you did a good job.

AUDIO ONLY

15:13 | $13.99

* Stolen Clothes - All I wanted was a nice, hot, relaxing shower and I finally got to take one. But, while I was doing it, my clothes were stolen!! When I get out of the shower, all I have to cover myself with is this teeny tiny towel!! So I have to sneak out of the bathroom, past my roommate's doors and get to my own room, oh dear! It's so tricky to keep myself covered, that I end up doing boob and pussy flashes...

fakeoku,sq66,1,"&gt;&gt; LN is just not mature enough for production use yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, early adopters will get it there. It certainly won't get there if nobody ever uses it.

You are right someone has to use and test things before they mature.

&gt;&gt; You may fiddle around with it yes, but don't rely on getting all your transactions through
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't had a failed transaction since around May 2018. Hundreds of successful transactions up to this point.

Nice. Still I'd be guessing you have chosen wisely what kind of sums you try to send and maybe where.

&gt; Other altcoins than BTC are off topic
&gt; 
&gt; But I though this forum 'fosters free speech'? Also, bch is an altcoin by definition.

For the context of this discussion it is offtopic. Also, I was pulling your leg. We can discuss the definition of altcoin, fork and the likes all day. Probably won't find common ground on that one. No worries, we don't have to.

&gt;&gt; How small is a bech32 transaction?
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming 1 input, 2 outputs, bech32 to bech32 transactions are 141 bytes. So @ 1 sat/byte = 141 sats.
&gt; 
&gt; For bch, 1 input, 2 outputs = 226 bytes (as far as I can make out looking through some bch transactions at a block explorer). So @ 1 sat/byte = 226 sats.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, Bitcoin with segwit allows for 37.6% reduction in transaction fees compared to bch assuming the framework above. These savings would be further amplified with multi input/output or batched transactions.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It is fair to assume 10-20 sat/b on BTC and 1 sat/b on BCH?
&gt; 
&gt; What does that have to do with transaction size in bytes?

You said ""So @ 1 sat/byte = 226 sats"", while I was asking if you'd think it is fair to assume 10-20 sat/b for BTC. I.e 10 sat/b for bech32's 141 byte transaction would yield 1410 sats vs BCH 226 sats.

&gt;&gt; I'm quite confident it is not particularly false, but let's see.
&gt; 
&gt; Going by the above, I'm confident that I was correct

If you are willing to accept a mere 2 sats/b for BTC your assumption falls apart.

&gt; unless bch has deployed some transaction compression tech

There is no compression on BCH. Schnorr signatures, yes, but that will only drop a few bytes from a regular transaction.

&gt; similar to Bitcoin &amp; segwit that I'm unaware of.

but segwit does not reduce the byte size of a transaction.",2019-12-13 00:50:43

zBTC mint/burn, on the other hand, is completely permissionless and the funds are held in a trustless/decentralized network (RenVM). Anyone (dApps included) can mint and burn any amount, at any time.

faosidu,gdmfsobtc,1,You can buy pizza with Bitcoin.,2019-12-14 06:13:13
faos8yk,aaj094,1,"What paper contracts and associated lack of scarcity do is that it can prevent the growth in price that is only due to speculative demand (cause this sort of demand doesn't care whether they get their speculation via paper on real bitcoin that is secured by keys).

So then the real scarcity game plays out due to those you really care about holding bitcoin with their keys and this is where the correlation of price with wallet count becomes key. 

So let's say that from now onwards, speculation doesn't help contribute to price growth at all. Then just by looking at the rate at which wallet count has grown over past year (about 23%) and assuming that this growth continues and the square law of network value applies, you can expect a sedate 50% growth in price each year. 

In this way, you get ATH in mid 2023 and 100K in 2027.

If paper contracts don't have the drastic impact of cutting out all speculative demand as I have assumed above then you can get these milestones much earlier. 

It might be just me but even these drastically conservative time frames appear quite attractive for anyone who has low time preference.",2019-12-14 06:10:19

faopds5,Lisfin,1,"&gt;No you‚Äôre right. No coin is 100% safe yet. My point is that Bitcoins coveted ‚Äúsafest crypto‚Äù status turns out to be bullshit.

So far and currently it still is. There is more money securing BTC than any other network. 54% hashing in China does not mean all 54% can be utilized in a single attack.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And I specifically stated that this particular attack mechanism  (hashrate) does not work on other coins, because it‚Äôs not used as a  protection. 

51% attacks can and do happen on other coins. Yes, there are many coins that don't have this problem, however they have their own disadvantages that can be exploited just the same.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Don‚Äôt make that into a blanket statement for the security of other coins. 

I think you are the one making blanket statements by saying 

""this particular attack mechanism  (hashrate) does not work on other coins""

When we both know, ""other"" coins can and do suffer from the same problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  It was a specific answer to some rhetoric going into the ‚Äúif Bitcoin  isn‚Äôt safe, nothing is‚Äù. Because while not completely wrong is such a  generalization it‚Äôs nothing more than liquid cow dung. 

So you think China ""stealing"" all the BTC miners in the country and using them to attack bitcoin is more likely than China hacking and attacking other coins?

Ok...",2019-12-14 05:38:55
faos8ea,YouEnjoyMyPosts,1,"Over the past few months, we have been designing and building the easiest, production-ready version of Atomic Swap technology the industry has seen thus far.

Divi's Atomic Swap implementation is a granular API that allows developers and users to have full control over the transaction process via CLI or gRPC. This factor is a critical difference between what we have built and what is currently available today.

To ensure a better developer (and user) experience, we digest the entire process into a simplified REST API server.

This REST API enables us to create a user-friendly ""light client"" interface for users to quickly and easily swap between DIVI and BTC (and later, many other coins) in a decentralized and peer-to-peer manner.

For those looking for even more control and decentralization, they can manage and maintain their servers and daemons individually.

Developers can begin utilizing Divi Atomic Swaps now on the Bitcoin and Divi 2.0 Testnets. To get started, [follow this link](https://atomic-swaps.diviproject.org/) and start reading through the documentation. We're even providing a succinct and [easy-to-follow guide](https://github.com/DiviProject/deployment-guide) for deploying your own Bitcoin network.

Ready to test? Developers can get some free Test Divi using our [faucet](https://faucet.diviproject.org/) now.

In the coming weeks, light client nodes will be running, allowing developers who want a more hands-off experience to begin building.

Additionally, a block explorer that illustrates the comings and goings of funds before, during, and after Atomic Swaps take place will be available.",2019-12-14 06:10:09

faox1oo,Sporklin,1,"&gt;Why hasn't there ever been one? 

Cost - The costs for a Super Bowl commercial range between 2m and over 5m depending on the length, spot placement and inclusion of it in PR done before, after, during. In total that would be a figure that is well beyond anything Dogecoin done, further in combining that figure puts it well beyond by x100 of the combined figure raised for **everything**. 

Advertising rules in relation - The NFL itself has heavy guidelines and matrix used to define ""Risk Analysis"". The Super Bowl is an extension of the NFL in ways that impacts *their* brand fairly heavily in the eyes of public perception, anything that could possibly harshly impact their parent brand gets a pass. 2018 Super Bowl had [TD Ameritrade - direct from NBC](https://www.nbcsports.com/video/super-bowl-td-ameritrade-lionel-ritchie-ad) or [Youtube maybe not geoblocked for some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpiDPaWdxtE). Catch the last few seconds of the ad, it mentions Bitcoin trading. NBC also has advertising rules which they must adhere to, relating to content being served up. Financial can get rather grey area, crypto falls into the nearly untouchable area.

A few years back there were conversations relating to things, where one of the PR groups poked at the ""what ifs, how could we"" ideal to this. The cost alone puts it far above, beyond and out of the realm of anything in relation to what we could afford. The regulatory questions around cryptocurrency still remain which makes getting through those hurdles even tougher.",2019-12-14 07:02:21

**‚ùóÔ∏èANNOUNCEMENTS/DO'S N DON'TS‚ùóÔ∏è**

-	I use Telegram, Kik and Skype for sessions. I will occasionally use Snapchat, but it needs to be decided upon through Telegram or Reddit message.

-	Kik sucks and I hate using it so I HIGHLY prefer Telegram, but if it‚Äôs honestly your only option I will use it. On Telegram I can send high quality, hands free, longer videos... no ads, and it doesn‚Äôt crash all the time. Overall Telegram is a much better experience for everyone - seriously! So if you can get it, that would be great. 

-	DO see the best way to message me, located at the bottom. I provided samples. If you message me with just ‚Äúhey‚Äù, I will ignore you or delete your message. 

-	**I DO get naked, but you have to pay to see. If you don‚Äôt pay for it, I‚Äôll wear lingerie or something sexy that shows off my body.** 

-	I DO touch, rub &amp; smack my pussy, tease my clit, moan, talk a little dirty. I don‚Äôt do *explicit* masturbation (anything penetrative). 

-	**I always show my face!** 

-	Please don‚Äôt message me asking ‚Äúwhat is your favorite thing to do?‚Äù I really despise that question! I like to do everything that I offer and I will give a better show if you come to me with a fantasy in mind :) 

-	**I DON‚ÄôT DO POOPING VIDEOS.PLEASE STOP MESSAGING ME WITH POOPING VIDEO REQUESTS.** 

-	I do offer Vanilla ‚ÄúDirty‚Äù sexting (ex: oh you wanna lick this asshole? How do u think this perfect pussy tastes? I bet you wanna beat your cock on my phat pussy huh? I like how hard u are for me, stroke your thick cock while xyz...Etc.) 

-	I do not offer Vanilla ‚Äúromantic‚Äù style sexting! (Ex: your cock is making me wet and I‚Äôm fingering myself thinking about you, you‚Äôre so hott, i want you so bad, i want to fuck you, kiss my neck baby... etc) Romantic sexting like that honestly makes me wanna barf ü§Æ 

-	üó£I do not allow screen recording of any kind! Obviously with chat sessions the videos will stay there however they are NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR POSTED ANYWHERE. My content is MY content, even if I send it to you. I KEEP RECORD of chat sessions and I WILL come for you if my content has been redistributed.

favxfxs,Dazbuzz,14,"The majority of this isnt fact, its your opinion on how you think Tarkov should be played. That would be fine, if not for the fact you are pushing for harsh changes to the game.

Think of this a different way. If someone lacks the ability to make much money in this game, how do you expect this change to encourage them to bring gear? Removing the container lowers the amount of money they can make. That makes gear fear worse. That makes players resort to money farming MORE not less. 

You say you want players to actually play the game instead of farming money. So how, in your eyes, does removing a source of income for a lot of players suddenly make them farm less money?

Now, when players find good loot, they will sneak to extract. They wont PvP more. They wont take more risks. Before, i would find some decent loot &amp; container it. Then i would continue killing scavs or chasing down gunshots for a fight. Now? I will find good loot, then extract, because there is no value in taking a PvP risk with my subpar skills.

Hatchet runs needs to be addressed. This is true. However, it can be done without changing the container in a way that hurts everyone.

**Add more Scav spawns to specific areas** - Right now people just rush to specific loot spots, for the chance at 100k+ value items. Most commonly Resort locked rooms, Techlight, Labs Ledx spawns, western Rezerve buildings etc. Add Scavs that almost always spawn in these areas at the start of the raid. Whilst you can just kill them with a pistol, it still slows down the hatchet runs, and forces them to make a lot of noise. Slow reactions mean blackened limbs, or even death.

**Dynamic loot, or just more Static spawns** - Dynamic loot mechanics for loose loot is the dream, however this may require a lot of work, so an alternate. Just add more static spawns for the high-value loose loot. For example, give the Red Keycard 10 more spawn locations around Resort. Same for Ledx &amp; Tetriz/Bitcoin spawns. Force hatchet runners to search many rooms to find the good loot. Once again, slowing them down, allowing others to catch up &amp; kill them

**Add an animation when placing items into your Secure Container** - This one hurts everyone, but a 10-20 second immobile, loud animation is a much better alternative to removing it. The goal being to slow down hatchet runners even more, and together with the above two changes, you have a pretty good chance of catching them before they pocket all the loot.

**Lock the Secure Container for the first 10 minutes of the raid** - Most hatchet running happens within the first 10 minutes of the raid. Naked player rush to high value loot spots and pocket the valuables before geared players can stop them. This would completely stop that style of play. There is no spot on any map that you cannot get to within 10 minutes, no matter wear you spawn, even if you bring heavy gear.


Those changes alone i believe would reduce the effectiveness of hatchet runs, whilst hurting everyone else relatively little. At the very least, i believe we should give these changes a chance before removing the container completely. Neither these changes, nor removing the SC, will completely stop hatchet runs. All we can do is make them inefficient to the point that the more popular methods involve more gear.

Some other changes i believe are worth some consideration...

**Gearscore** - A pretty hated change, but listen. I am not saying you should be required to bring in a full kit. However i do think that at least bringing in a pistol should be required. Its a very, very small cost. Yes, players can just insure &amp; drop the pistol. Its not a perfect solution. Its not meant to be. However the push to encourage players to bring a ranged weapon might be enough to get them fighting scavs, rather than avoiding everything &amp; everyone.

**Container items cannot be sold on the Flea Market** - If you extract with an item in your container, you cannot sell it on the Flea Market. This helps prevent hatchet runners flooding the economy. You can still turn the item in for quests/hideout upgrades, and still sell it to vendors(mostly so newer players are able to continue upgrading their traders).",2019-12-15 07:41:26
favdpac,TwoFoxSix,12,"This is a relatively old image, I believe I saw it on /r/masterhacker or something similar.

The scammer is just showing that he uses what looks like Coinbase and has a couple bucks in Bitcoin Cash. Unfortunately for the scammer, the market doesn't go up in his favor that quickly (insert bubble has burst joke here) but people not involved with the market weren't really sure at the time on how it worked.

* Current version of Python is 3.5.9

* (PHP) 7.0.1 was released in December of 2015, but has nothing to do with anything in this context

* Bypassing VPNs are not things a skid (Script Kiddie) would be able to do or even come remotely close to doing it  - There are vulnerabilities with corporate VPNs, but still difficult to pull off.

Whoever was responding to Lil Tyrese had a pretty good sense of humor when it comes to screwing with him. Usually you can throw a lot of technical jargon at someone who claims to be a hacker and they will just agree with it because they have no clue and have done minimal research. Sadly it does work from time to time because people freak out when they hear they are either hacked or are being hacked, even when nothing is happening.",2019-12-15 06:11:47
favfc3f,PerpetualCamel,12,"1 year ago today was one of the darkest days in ETH history. It's good to remember moments like that, to see how the community feels when things are at their bleakest.

Here's how /u/jtnichol felt:
&gt;Another gig tonight. Another dollar that goes into crypto. Rinse and repeat. Down or up I don't give a shit. Everybody talkin their books. Amazing all of the comments that just get automatically downvoted trying to sway you out of why you joined the space in the first place. If you join for quick gains over the course of months then strap in and enjoy the ride. It's just the way it goes right now. Every dollar I've spent over the course of the year is underwater. Until it isn't 2 years from now pending no Black Swan of course. Just throw in what you think is the right amount and enjoy the memes. Plain and fucking simple. Nobody in this room knows anything. Not me. Not DC. Or whoever else you think has a pulse on things. The fact that you're here in this amazing bear Market is the shit that becomes the lore we all love to look back on. Either this shit goes to zero or it goes to the moon. If you have invested accordingly then have some fun god dammit.

And here's what /u/DCinvestor said the year before, in 2017:
&gt;Back in May / June, people at work literally thought I was crazy for talking so much about blockchain (not just as an investment, but as a technology). I bought BTC back in 2013 (and sold in 2014), but once I understood what Ethereum represented, I literally could not sleep. I bought ETH heavily in April / May and couldn't contain my excitement as the price exploded to $300.

&gt;Many of the people I spoke with at work thought I was crazy. I still remember the looks I got and what they said. ""You mean like Bitcoin, isn't that for criminals? You think this is the future of our business? And no one controls it? Sorry, this makes no sense."" One Partner I work with at my firm actually made fun of me for it every chance he had over the next 3 months, in his own good-natured way.

&gt;They were curious, but thought it was a fad. A flash in the pan. An object of ridicule.

&gt;Guess what? They're not laughing anymore. Now, they're all asking me what this technology will really mean for our business...and if they they are too late to invest. I'm now the blockchain guru at work and helping to plot our strategy for how we will deliver blockchain solutions to our clients. 

&gt;I bet some of you have similar stories. Don't ever let people make you feel like you are crazy because you understand what is coming next. What a difference 6 months can make.

Perspective is a beautiful thing. Here's hoping Dec. 14, 2020 marks another year of growth, improvement, and development.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-2-years-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers ‚ÄúPaid with Bitcoin‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/?lang=en

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew‚Äôs Bomb Threats against American Jews are ‚ÄúWhite Hate‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. 

There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse?

 What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here is an American Rabbi openly preaching to his congregation that God commands Jews to commit genocide of America, and most of Europe (white majority countries).

https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/b49q26/american_rabbi_says_that_jews_must_commit/

Of course, this rabbi pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jews express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) [was created in order to free a Jewish child rapist/killer,](https://www.ancreport.com/report/adl-is-mafia-connected-and-defended-pedophile-rapist-and-murderer-leon-frank/).

The ADL is a [Jewish Supremacy group masquerading as a civil rights group.](http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-adl-in-american-society/)

And now the ADL telling social media giants [what content should be censored and which people should be banned?](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/10/no_author/anti-defamation-league-facebook-google-youtube-appoint-themselves-as-official-internet-censor/)",2019-12-15 07:21:54

So just like in scav mode, you should at least survive and extract to get any reward.

Atm as hatchling your reward is guaranteed, you just go for whatever you have a topspawn for, gamma and then disconnect. All while occupying a playerspot that was meant for multiplayer gameplay. So you not only circumvent the core ideas of risk-reward and having to escape and survive (which is coincidentally even the name of the game), your actions also cause other people to have a worse experience due to less multiplayer interactions.

Note that I don't blame hatchling players, it makes total sense to abuse this if you don't want to take risks at all. It's just poor game design.

Safe containers come from a time when there was no scav mode and no flea market. They were a bandaid to make sure people don't go broke too fast. Their mechanics never made any sense logically, and by now they are redundant. I mean, you can even build a bitcoin farm and get stuff for free right now.

All that's keeping the safe containers alive is the fact that players have gotten used to making profits from raids even when they die. And have a hard time letting that go, despite it would make for better gameplay.",2019-12-15 06:37:21

# Overall Impressions

## CannaBudPost

I enjoyed their large selection and mix and match deals. You‚Äôre able to try a lot of different strains here of various quality at a reasonable discount. I opted to try a mix and match OZ of their AAA and one of their AAAA. The quality was good and everything was accurately graded for the most part.

My order was shipped out same day and was received as quickly as it could have been. Everything was packaged well in heat sealed zips and labelled with the strain name, grade, effects, etc. There was a slight issue with my payment but that was handled very promptly via their customer support (who had reached out to me) and they had even included a free sample to make up for any troubles.

Overall I found Canna Bud Post to be awesome and I would use them again. Access to a variety of craft bud at a reasonable price is huge for me personally. My only complaint would be that some of their AAA graded stuff varied widely in quality but that is very minor in the greater aspect of things and fairly subjective as well. I‚Äôll personally be trying out their mix and match AAAA ozs from time to time.

## Kush Station

Kush Station also offers a wide menu and allows you to mix and match. I tried their mix and max AAAA as well as their welcome kit and a few more strains to get a feel for the menu. Ordering and payment were simple enough and everything was processed same day.

Shipment was received as quickly as possible. Every strain was individually zipped and labelled with strain name and effects. I was impressed with the quality of everything that arrived - they are very fair with their ratings imo.
I also had a slight issue with payment that was quickly resolved by Kush Station (they reached out to me within minutes). They were able to resolve the issue and get the package shipped out on the same day which is very impressive - they clearly value customer service.

Overall I found Kush Station to have a well curated and honest menu. They don‚Äôt seem to bullshit you with their ratings and everything is priced fairly in my opinion. Their craft offerings were well received by myself and others seem to enjoy them as well. I‚Äôll definitely be ordering their AAAA/craft mix and match regularly.

## Kootenay Craft

I had minimal communication with Kootenay Craft and that isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. Ordering was easy enough and everything shipped out very quickly. A little bit on the pricier side but they had a coupon for new customers that made ordering a no brainer.

I opted to try out a few of their platinum offerings with selection being slim due to stock. Everything arrived quickly from Alberta and the packaging did not disappointed. Every strain was individually jarred in a plastic container. The strain name and details were also labelled on the front.

All of the flower received was beautiful and did not disappoint the senses. Everything was reasonably potent as well and burned extremely smooth (especially the living soil organic stuff). I found their site pictures to be quite accurate as well.

Overall a great spot to find some quality flower. Their first time customer coupon makes it well worth trying them out imo. I‚Äôll be trying out some of their drops from time to time.

## Supreme BC Buds

Decided to take a leap of faith with these guys as they carried a strain I always wanted to try &amp; they ship out of Ontario (which is great for me). I ordered a QP of the AAAA Cereal Milk and it arrived the next day.

Unfortunately, the QP received was a nightmare. I was skeptical of the quality of quads I would receive for $600/QP but this was pretty bad. Most of it was small poorly trimmed buds and shake. Luckily I was able to get in touch with them via Discord (they reached out to me after seeing the picture).

Their customer service was very apologetic about the bag I received and even seemed like they were willing to replace the shake. Unfortunately I did not have a scale so they agreed to offer me an oz of a different AAAA strain.

A few days later the oz shows up (Pink Rockstar). Large buds and decent smoke, miles of difference from what I had received previously. Would have been content with a $600 QP of this stuff. Overall I ended up with a weak QP and an OZ of decent bud, a far cry away from the AAAA QP advertised. I have to give credit to their customer service guy though, he seemed genuinely disappointed in the pack that went out and was very quick to ship out something else and explain the situation etc. 

## Ghost Drops

Had to see what the hype is about. I‚Äôm always hunting for quads and if they ship out of Ontario that is even better. I ordered a few things off of the menu to try and the process was very simple. The custom art gets you very pumped.

My order had arrived the next day. Everything was packaged individually in small plastic jars with the strain artwork labelled on the outside. Great packaging I must say. The bud itself did indeed live up to the hype for the most part. Beautiful nugs that smoked well and were very potent.

Overall I really like what is going on here. Big hype, custom artwork and craft bud that is tasked to live up to it. Definitely isn‚Äôt for budget buyers but I enjoy the experience. I‚Äôll certainly be trying drops on the regular.

## ACMedical

Only came here to try one thing. The African Red Congolese. It was enticing for me as a first time buyer, as I was able to pick up an oz for only ~$200 with the first time buyer discount. Ordering was simple enough. My order was left processing for a few days but it eventually shipped out.

The package arrived, a small zip encased in various vac seals. The oz I received was beautiful and was pretty close to what was pictured on the website. I was very pleased with the product received and there isn‚Äôt too much else to say about it.

Overall I didn‚Äôt have much interaction with ACMedical, nor did I try much of their menu. That being said, the red congo they carry is one of my absolute favourite strains and I will always be keeping it in stock.

## Carly‚Äôs Garden

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of pics over at /r/mompics showing the $99 ozs from Carly‚Äôs Garden. It looked like there was some great value so I decided to give them a try. I figured the Carly‚Äôs Cupcakes would be a good introduction to what they have to offer. A little bit pricey considering the rest of the menu at $230/oz but maybe it is worth it.
Placed my order and everything was shipped the next day. The oz arrived vac sealed, inside of a pink zip. No complaints about the product received. It is a very unique offering them I am happy to have in my collection.

I probably wouldn‚Äôt use Carly‚Äôs Garden again, though that is just because the menu doesn‚Äôt appeal to me as much. They were absolutely flawless in terms of the service they provided me and I think they would probably be a great option for budget deals.

## Blowout 420

Hard to believe that these guys are offering bud so cheap, I had to give it a go. Ordering was super easy and shipped out same day. Tried both their AAAA and $99 oz to get a feel for the menu.

The order arrived as quickly as possible from BC to Ontario. Everything was packaged in cans with a pull tab and boveda pack inside. There was also resealable lids. This was a nice touch, especially considering the price.

Everything was packed pretty tightly in to the cans which impacted the visuals a bit, but it was so cheap and free container so who cares. Everything received was a great value for the price paid. There was also a few samples included.

Overall I found Blowout420 to offer amazing value. I‚Äôd definitely order again if they had a strain I was looking to try. I‚Äôll pony up the extra cash and get my quads elsewhere though.

## Prince‚Äôs Private Reserve

A well received spot to find quads. I am always looking for quads so I had to order. There was a baller bags deal going on which was a great way to try the menu.

Very easy ordering and my shipment was received very quickly. Strains were individually packaged in branded zips. I was very pleased with the quality of everything upon inspection. There was a lot of hype skewing my first impressions and I was not disappointed.

Large, beautiful nugs. No shake/smalls. There was even a free sample included. All of the quality markers were met.

I really like this service. It is a small curated menu of no bullshit quads at a very reasonable price. Definitely something I will use regularly.

## Bud Express Now

They are not really discussed here and also have a massive menu. There are a few things on their menu that I know to be bullshit products which is a red flag. I decided to try their most expensive bud as well as their THC e-juice.

Ordering was very easy, their site is actually good and had automated processing of Bitcoin orders. They shipped out the next day.

I received my bud in a small plastic medicine container and the e-liquids were loose. The e-liquid didn‚Äôt really have any effect for me and the quality of the buds were grossly overstated.

Overall I‚Äôd avoid this place. Super sketchy menu.",2019-12-15 10:20:08

fb1dkf1,A_Soporific,18,"A Ponzi Scheme is any scam that is sold as investment that pays out the original investors with money collected from later investors rather than doing the actual investing activity.

Charles Ponzi, the originator of the modern scheme, had a plan to buy foreign stamps and ship it to the US where they could be sold to immigrants for dollars and collect the difference in a currency arbitrage play. Ponzi got investors but didn't actually buy the stamps, which might have actually worked and made him rich. Instead, he embezzled most of the money and used the rest to recruit new investors. When the original investors were due he paid them out of new investor money and things rolled until he was unable to recruit enough new investors to pay off the old ones and everything collapsed.

Modern schemes are usually run by actual investment companies when the management staff are unwilling or unable to admit that they didn't hit projections. They lie and say they did, but now they need to come up with ""dividends"" from somewhere else, which sets them on an inevitable spiral to destruction.

Careful management and a *LOT* of money coming in can lead to long running scams like that of Madoff, but the math of the thing is inescapable. You can only have so many cycles before you run out of people who can invest and the whole thing come tumbling down.

Crypto isn't in and of itself a Ponzi Scheme, but it does lend itself to financial chicanery. The actual value of these currencies as currencies rather than as investment vehicles would have the price significantly lower. It's gotten itself to the point where the hype-based valuation bubble is actually working against its utility as an actual currency. Generally, ever-rising valuations are very bad for a currency, which benefits most from no or a small, predictable drift in value over time. Bitcoin as money would be far better off with way less hype, but it's clear that Bitcoin as commodity is firmly in the driver's seat.",2019-12-16 03:42:45

2. Hex uses a referral system which allows you to get bonuses by referring another Etheruem address before claiming. Richard sends most people to an alternative site which redirects to the HEX website. However if you use this alternative link it places a cookie in your browser which replaces your referral address with his own address. He blocks anyone who points this out.
3. Richard Heart used to be a Bitcoin Maximalist and publicly criticised Ethereum. HEX runs on the Etheruem network.  He now publicly states he was only critical of Ethereum at the time because he saw it going up in value faster than Bitcoin and he didn't own any Ethereum. - He tries to use his influence to move markets for his personal profit only.

1. To get Hex at any significant quantity you have to send ETH to a 'smart contract' which gives you HEX tokens in return. You cannot get your ETH back. The ETH obviously goes to Richard Heart (founder) though he has not confirmed who has the keys to this address or what the funds will be used for. 
2. Hex uses a referral system which allows you to get bonuses by referring another Etheruem address before claiming. Richard directs most people to an alternative site which redirects to the HEX website. However if you use this alternative link it places a cookie in your browser which replaces your referral address with his own address. He blocks anyone who points this out. 
3. Richard Heart used to be a Bitcoin Maximalist and publicly criticised Ethereum. HEX runs off the Etheruem network.  He now claims he was only critical of Ethereum at the time because he saw it going up in value faster than Bitcoin and he didn't own any Ethereum. - He tries to use his influence to move markets for his personal profit only.

fb4huo8,Capt_Roger_Murdock,1,"&gt;And its not absurdly small, thats your opinion, one I disagree with

500,000 tx / day is absurdly small relative to the network's actual current technological capacity. And it's even more absurdly small relative to Bitcoin's future technological capacity which should be expected to continue increasing dramatically over time as a result of general technological improvements in storage, bandwidth, processing speed, etc. as well as Bitcoin-specific optimizations like Xthin / Compact Blocks.  And the current transaction limit is also absurdly small relative to the future transactional demand that we hope to see (i.e., mass global adoption from billions of users).

&gt;It doesn't undermine transactional convenience.

Of course it does.  The effect of a too-small artificial supply quota on block space combined with rising transactional demand is that transacting becomes increasingly slow, expensive, and unreliable.  

&gt;It encourages other more sensible methods of scaling. The single worst way of scaling is on chain

The *only* way to actually scale Bitcoin is to scale Bitcoin. Second-layer networks built on top of the actual Bitcoin network are banking, not scaling. They're necessarily imperfect substitutes for Bitcoin proper that become progressively more imperfect as they grow larger relative to the tiny base that supports them.  

&gt;Yes, it got very popular due to people fomoing in due to the SoV properties of bitcoin.

FOMOing due to the Bitcoin's use as a *speculative asset*. But Bitcoin's value as a speculative asset is ultimately based on its potential to become money.

&gt;That encouraged the adoption of Segwit and batching which got us to where we are today with more manageable fees.

SegWit provides a one-time, slow-motion, and extremely tiny bump in the effective block size limit that's only fully realized as people convert their existing UTXO‚Äôs to SegWit UTXOs *and then begin spending from those SegWit UTXOs*.  Even with 100% adoption, you only end up with an effective increase of something like 70-100%. That's nothing for a network that *should* be experiencing continued exponential growth in terms of usage. And SegWit's modest benefits are greatly outweighed by its irreversible technical debt (the result of doing what was really a ""hard fork""-style change via a hacky soft fork).

The fee crisis inducing greater use of ""batching"" by exchanges is certainly one of the least pernicious forms of demand destruction that occurred, but it's not some unqualified good. If, for example, exchanges would previously process certain withdrawal requests with immediate individualized transactions, and they are now waiting several hours so they can send a single batched transaction to handle a large number of withdrawals, that obviously means a worse user experience for the people waiting on their funds. And in any case, greater use of ""batching"" by exchanges also only buys Bitcoin a little more time before the next crisis hits.

&gt;Seamless with L2.

No, for reasons already explained to you.

&gt;You are asking me to describe tech in deatil that doesn't exist yet (apart from lightning which is up and running).

So you can't counter my arguments that Lightning is an imperfect substitute  for on-chain payments, and one that becomes progressively more imperfect as it grows larger relative to the tiny base it operates atop? Nor are you aware of any alternative ""L2"" solutions that would not have a similar problem?

fb4mejn,Complex_Imposter,1,"International customs in Australia is extremely well resourced because of the added focus on bio-security with seeds and such, so they have the resources to search for drugs. But I would think your risks when ordering domestically are pretty low.  

One up side to Australia is there is no central registry of who lives where, so you can just order using a fake name, if it gets intercepted then you have never heard of that person and don't know why their mail is coming to your address. One caution when doing this is that you shouldn't use registered delivery and never sign for anything, and be suspicious if you are suddenly asked to.  Also it's good practice that even if your package arrives, you should leave it unopened for two or three days so that you have plausible deniability should the police show up looking for the package (very unlikely if it has arrived), and so they can't do you for opening someone else's mail. Finally, keep your order amounts under the ""personal"" use thresholds, it is both harder to detect and less worth pursuing for prosecution. And of course, proper IT-related precautions (TOR/Bitcoin/etc) are should also be taken.   If you are buying for resale then you are into a different ball game and need much better operational security if you don't want to get caught.

fb4olcg,Dazbuzz,1,"imo all this would be enough...

**Add more Scav spawns to specific areas** - Right now people just rush to specific loot spots, for the chance at 100k+ value items. Most commonly Resort locked rooms, Techlight, Labs Ledx spawns, western Rezerve buildings etc. Add Scavs that almost always spawn in these areas at the start of the raid. Whilst you can just kill them with a pistol, it still slows down the hatchet runs, and forces them to make a lot of noise. Slow reactions mean blackened limbs, or even death.

**Dynamic loot, or just more Static spawns** - Dynamic loot mechanics for loose loot is the dream, however this may require a lot of work, so an alternate. Just add more static spawns for the high-value loose loot. For example, give the Red Keycard 10 more spawn locations around Resort. Same for Ledx &amp; Tetriz/Bitcoin spawns. Force hatchet runners to search many rooms to find the good loot. Once again, slowing them down, allowing others to catch up &amp; kill them

**Add an animation when placing items into your Secure Container** - This one hurts everyone, but a 10-20 second immobile, loud animation is a much better alternative to removing it. The goal being to slow down hatchet runners even more, and together with the above two changes, you have a pretty good chance of catching them before they pocket all the loot.

**Lock the Secure Container for the first 10 minutes of the raid** - Most hatchet running happens within the first 10 minutes of the raid. Naked player rush to high value loot spots and pocket the valuables before geared players can stop them. This would completely stop that style of play. There is no spot on any map that you cannot get to within 10 minutes, no matter wear you spawn, even if you bring heavy gear.


Those changes alone i believe would reduce the effectiveness of hatchet runs, whilst hurting everyone else relatively little. At the very least, i believe we should give these changes a chance before removing the container completely. Neither these changes, nor removing the SC, will completely stop hatchet runs. All we can do is make them inefficient to the point that the more popular methods involve more gear.

Some other changes i believe are worth some consideration...

**Gearscore** - A pretty hated change, but listen. I am not saying you should be required to bring in a full kit. However i do think that at least bringing in a pistol should be required. Its a very, very small cost. Yes, players can just insure &amp; drop the pistol. Its not a perfect solution. Its not meant to be. However the push to encourage players to bring a ranged weapon might be enough to get them fighting scavs, rather than avoiding everything &amp; everyone.

**Container items cannot be sold on the Flea Market** - If you extract with an item in your container, you cannot sell it on the Flea Market. This helps prevent hatchet runners flooding the economy. You can still turn the item in for quests/hideout upgrades, and still sell it to vendors(mostly so newer players are able to continue upgrading their traders).",2019-12-17 01:12:47

Yeah, I play geared, or at minimum with a pistol, backpack, and rig for loot space, rarely hatchling run (I do if I'm tired of dying and I want a zero stress raid or two), and I can guarantee that everyone in this game has done a hatchling run at least once... even if it was in Factory to do the repair quest for Mechanic or the quest item dropoffs.

fb4lwpm,fast_grammar,1,"&gt; Bitcoin's purpose is to behave like digital gold.

Right away, first sentence and you're peddling propaganda crafted by those with the most to lose from Bitcoin's downfall: top miners and manipulators who have been extracting a ridiculous amount of money from this kangaroo market. Bitcoin isn't gold. Gold is a useful commodity, while Bitcoin is a shitty digital asset with basically no redeeming qualities. The fact that it was decentralized (it is not anymore), while allowing for quick, cheap transfers for value made it an awesome currency for the internet, but it has long since lost everything that gave it value.

&gt; Gold can be exchanged for hundreds of currencies across the world.

...is not even close to what gives gold value. If I had to break it down, the source of the demand for gold (and, as such, the driving force behind its value as supply is actually limited (unlike Bitcoin's artificial limit)) would look like this:

1. Providing economic stability by serving as *de facto* precious metal in central bank reserves: **5% of value**
2. Very useful physical properties, such as being a great conductor, medical properties, etc.: **10% of value**
3. Global cultural significance developed over millenia: **50% of value**
4. Speculation: **35% of value**

&gt; Bitcoin can be exchanged with hundreds of alt-coins.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value looks like this:

1. Speculation: **100% of value**

People buy Bitcoin because they expect the price to go up. That's it. They're not even close to being in the same league as a financial product, not just because Bitcoin is 'young', but because Bitcoin is extremely unstable due to being virtually useless and insanely overvalued.

&gt; Bitcoin is a platform for accessing other cryptocurrenies rather than it attempting to be all cryptocurrenies at once.

That's just a misleading words salad. Bitcoin isn't a platform any more than it is a valid currency. Bitcoin is a brand: people talk about it, hype it up, buy it for the name and expect some kind of return. There is nothing more to it, which is why there's such a fierce battle between BSV, BCH and BTC supporters. They are fighting so hard because the only thing any of them have is a name. If the illusion crumbles, they're left with nothing.

&gt; In the future, there will be potentially hundreds of thousands of cryptocurrenies. Some will survive while many will be worthless. Bitcoin is to behave as a highway for accessing those cryptocurrenies. An example would be Google behaving as a highway for accessing the world wide web.

I just... I want you to re-read your own paragraph and tell me with a straight face you mean all of this. Google exists because it's useful. Google is like a free butler who will guide you within the ridiculously huge mansion that is the Internet and show you where everything you might need is. In contrast, Bitcoin is nothing more than a toll booth operator charging you to enter the run-down hut that is the current world of cryptocurrencies.

Let's consider what is revealed to the outsider if you were to send Bitcoin from wallet X cluster to a Wasabi wallet you may own. On the blockchain, it would be clear that cluster of wallet X sent coins to an address, which then participated in a coinjoin. This means that the wallet X cluster has interacted with a Wasabi wallet user. Now suppose you are bad at privacy and all of your transactions in your Wallet X cluster are clustered together, and let's say you continue to send to a wasabi wallet. In this case, an outsider can say - wallet cluster X repeatedly sends funds to a wasabi wallet user (which could be the same person or a different person). If you never re-use a wasabi address, the analysis ends there mostly, and at best there is just speculation about why your cluster is sending to Wasabi.

fb4lug3,LotLizard55,1,"Gen Z here checking in. I've shilled bitcoin over the years to my friends in high school and college and less than a handful have even a basic understanding of what btc is and even less own it. My concern is I feel kids my age should understand why btc is valuable because we've grown up with the internet and now we have the value layer with btc. Maybe I'm ignorant or in a bubble of my own. At the same time I know most kids aren't thinking about what money is or how it affects them they just want mint juul pods and clout. Either way I will be hodling and hopefully my generation wakes tf up. I also find it funny kids my age spend $40,000+ a year at private colleges and they look at me sideways when I say I own bitcoin.",2019-12-17 00:49:25

It's a lot of work, and I've deliberately left out what you might buy and sell, but whatever you're thinking, it's probably not that.  For instance, it's not Bitcoin.

Moral of his story; Like Mandela, someday he might be President of the USA but in retrospect it is not okay for governments to spy on you only for Snowden to do it as a hacker himself. He got rich off it and while one can pray he loose his bitcoin passwords, he is a force in today's world that not even the CIA/FBI has been able to handle.

##**Dick Ratings**

My very thorough cock ratings have become one of my most popular ([and best reviewed!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarabelle_Says/wiki/ratings#wiki_reviews.3A)) services and for good reason - I have a lot of opinions about dicks. I'm honest and constructive by default and touch on size, shape, grooming, photography skills, cumshot and how compatible we'd be in bed. Make sure to give me your name up front if you'd like me to use it and to specify if you'd like an honest or a SPH-themed Femdom cock rating. HD ratings are delivered within 72 hours, Spark Notes within 24! **For expedited delivery, add $10**.

####SPARK NOTES KIK COCK RATING
**$25** | A single ~2 minute video sent via kik/Telegram that gives you a brief assessment of your schlong.

####GOLD STANDARD HD COCK RATING
**$85** | Clocking in at 10-15 minutes in length, this video tells you everything you've ever wondered about my thoughts on your cock.

####EXTRA SEXY HD COCK RATING
**$115** | Similar to the above, but towards the end, I'll add in some tailored JOI and spend more time focusing on what what kind of sex I think we'd have. If your package really gets me going, I may even touch myself as well!

**[Pay here via ManyVids tip](http://ClarabelleWoods.manyvids.com/tip)** and then message me on Reddit or kik (xoclarabelle) with 3-5 well-lit pictures of your cock.

##Skype Shows

It's been a while since I offered cam shows, but for a limited time only I will be available for live cam shows done over Skype!!!! Each show is subject to individual pricing, but the general pricing is as follows:

* Topless JOI - $6/min
* Nude JOI - $8/min

In order to setup the show in a timely manner it is important that you send **ALL** of the required information. 

**All Skype shows must be a minimum of 15 minutes!**

--------------

##Kik Sessions
Pricing for kik sessions is always subject to change based on availability, compatibility, and the nature of the request. Fetish requests or highly involved sessions will have a higher rate than listed. I show full face!

As a general guideline my base prices are as follows:

Session|Rate
:--|:-:
Text Only|$1.5/min
Text and Photo|$2.5/min
Video Heavy Basic JOI (non-streamed)|$3/min
Fetish Requests|$4+/min

Kik sessions are 1:1 sexting sessions. Unless otherwise negotiated, I will start clothed and strip to topless during the session while interacting with whatever content you decide to send me! Once the session has started, I will not pause or delay the session. I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, sending excessive (or especially abusive) content or being rude. A second infraction will terminate any service immediately without refund, and may result in being blocked on Snapchat/Kik. I am willing to do a session on Kik or Snapchat, but it is my preference to use Kik- and it allows you to have my content to look at again later! üòâ

###All kik sessions MUST be a minimum of 20 minutes to ensure we have enough time to have fun

For credit card or other online payments, the transparency is not clear. You pay a credit card fee (like 2%-3%) as a merchant, and you have to trust the receiver that they are handling the funds correctly. The sender can also keep records to show they submitted a donation.

With the fiat, I had to onramp it to BTC on GDAX (Coinbase Pro) which again is not public.

All funds were converted to Bitcoin (BTC) and the total fund was split to the respective charities. That is also public so you can see the funds were actually sent. There's also no conversion or foreign exchange fees. The one charity is in Cameroon (Africa) and the other in the Philippines so trying to coordinate and send in the native fiat would add more time and fees. This makes the giving less efficient.

From all this experience, blockchain helps transparency to a degree, but having to convert to crypto (fiat to crypto, or crypto to crypto) you lose visibility.

Finally, you have to trust that even though the funds are sent to the charities, you have to trust that they are actually using the funds correctly. You have no way to know publically how the funds are used. But again, this is no different from how it is today and you need good accounting and trust to keep working with the charities.

If you want to see more details, I wrote my experience here:

fbe4ilp,MostBoringStan,1,"I mean, I don't know the guy personally so I guess it could have been an insult, I just don't think it is because there are a ton of scammers in the crypto world who rely on newbies who don't know exactly how things work. The scammers don't go after people who have been around for a while because those ones know all the scams to look out for.

So if you do get into buying some bitcoin, be careful. Basically any sort of bitcoin investing is going to be a scam. They will tell you about great profits whether it has to do with mining or trading, but it's all bs. Only legit thing is to buy and sell on a legit exchange doing the work yourself.",2019-12-20 02:53:35

The claim to this was that political parties were hoarding illegal unreported cash in large denomination bills. But... Ironically they released a larger 2000 rupee denomination soon after that increased the hoarding ability, and it was found that many politicians found proxies to illegally  exchange their cash into new notes. The ruling party also was given early warning by its head and a lot of bitcoin purchases and shady real estate deals took place  just before demonetisation.

1) most services and wallets did not implement segwit in 2017 which changed the block capacity from 1MB of txs to 4 million units of weight. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/cqw1ks/determining_the_weight_of_my_transaction/ex04mue/

20 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max, or basically doubling the tx capacity 

Now most wallets and services have upgraded to this capacity and even to this day not all of its being used leaving room to grow.

2) Lightning was not on mainent that allows people to transact with instant transactions , network capacity of millions of transactions per second, and fees at a fraction of a penny. Now many stores accept lightning transactions and many wallets support it. 

https://lightningnetworkstores.com

https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets

3) Many businesses weren't batching in 2017 and now more are .

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/cqw1ks/determining_the_weight_of_my_transaction/ex04mue/

53.76 TPS for 10 minute average blocks max for maximum batching in a block for onchain 

4) Sidechains like RSK and liquid were not in use in 2017 , and now are 

Going Forward -

Schnorr sigs and MAST will be soft forked in increasing scalability and onchain capacity. https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki

Future hardforks are still planned to dynamically increase the blocksize as discussed here- https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html

I'm gonna go ahead and reccomended using OpenBazaar, as at least ONE of your e-commerce platforms. It is legitimately completely free, but the catch is that they only work in crypto currency. Therefore all you would pay for are transaction fees as they relate to actually selling and withdrawing Bitcoin. This would certainly add a unique edge to your repoire, as definitely the first cobbler but very well maybe the first sartorial producer of any kind that takes cryptocurrency.

They then liaise with the user to post that user's payment details - PayPal, Bitcoin, whatever. Then its up to the rest of the users of the sub to (completely voluntarily) send a dollar (or whatever) to the winning user.

fbqq9fb,SolidResponsibility3,18,"Yes. This is not new. This is the ""asset bubble of everything"" idea.

But [TINA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tina-there-no-alternative.asp) \- there is no alternative.

Central banks have purchased the safe debts to keep yield on safe assets low to force those with obligations or goals (pensions, retirees, FIRE seekers, funds, etc.) to move assets into more risky but potentially higher yielding assets to have a hope of meeting their required returns in the future. The result is the prices of those assets have been bid up.

Everything is 'overvalued'. Stocks, bonds, houses, bitcoin, [scotch](https://qz.com/quartzy/1566972/high-end-scotch-whisky-was-a-winning-investment-last-year/) and [fine spirits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/why-the-best-investment-vehicle-is-one-you-can-drink), [luxury cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/culture/article-theres-good-money-to-be-made-collecting-cars/), [art](https://www.tewealth.com/buying-beauty-the-pros-and-cons-of-investing-in-art/), **all** risk assets are 'overvalued'.

But we are all participants in this paramutualized betting system (stock and all other markets collectively) where because of TINA, the only way to outpace inflation is with risk assets so we continue bidding them up.

I do not know how this ends. Buffett says if the current regime of 3% inflation and 3% US unemployment and money printing is stable on the 30+ year time frame, then the markets [are exceptionally undervalued](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/warren-buffett-says-stocks-are-ridiculously-cheap-if-interest-rates-stay-at-these-levels.html).

fbs8z1s,MakerOfMillionaires,15,"**Explanation!**

The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.

If a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.

You are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.

**Awareness for Fairness:**

*This comment will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.

To verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #49, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator, or upload one of the three trial runs. The output you receive should be the same as what is listed here.

If you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MM49\Drawing\OfficialMM49IDs.txt*

**Warnings:**

**In the event a user who has commented twice has been selected,** the second comment (deleted or not) of the user will have its ID grabbed, and searched in the text file. If there is a match, the winner will be disregarded and there will be a waiting period of five blocks before the next winner is selected. If there is not a match, a community vote may take place if further questionable activity is seen.

Additionally, a selection of the winner is only valid when the entrant matches that listed in the **Drawing Information**, as seen below.

fbrqoa4,Happy_Pizza_,11,"A couple of days ago, I made a post about [how we are possibly in a descending triangle](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ed4s6u/daily_discussion_friday_december_20_2019/fbicaa4/) situation.

I still think the descending triangle situation is quite viable.  See chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/mUPumckf/

See those black circles on the chart?  Those black circles represent retests of our previous ascending trendline (the gold line).  Since we previously dumped from that trendline and got rejected from it before, I don't think this pump is going anywhere.

Anyway, the purple lines on the above chart are the descending triangle.  As you can see, the formation resolves by late January.  Let's look at the price target on the zoomed out chart.  

https://www.tradingview.com/x/N9BffPZQ/

As we see, price target for the descending triangle is in the lower 5ks.  This lines up with both the bottom trendline of the descending channel and our most shallow ascending trendline from the 3k bottom.  It's also an area of horizonal support from the beginning of our pump, although I didn't draw that on the chart.

EDIT:  u/aaj094 had some interesting things to say about the possibility of lower 5ks being the ultimate bottom:  https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ee07ir/daily_discussion_sunday_december_22_2019/fbpq8h5/

Historically, January has been a rough month for bitcoin and has almost always been red.  So a big dump at the middle/end of January is quite a plausible scenario.",2019-12-23 05:10:07

Although I know you can purchase it incrementally, in small amounts at a time, it‚Äôs just too scary to see the little savings go for the risk. We have 3 kids to take care of and all it would take is one medical emergency to any one of us to completely wipe us out, even a simple trip to the ER, even with my insurance, is over $1K out of pocket. That‚Äôs what I mean when I say I‚Äôm ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of the investment. Being a teacher is truly amazing, I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world, but it certainly has its drawbacks. 
Investing is a long term thing I realize, but also, I really started looking at crypto when it really boomed a few years ago, bought a few coins that were climbing like crazy and then basically ended up with crypto‚Äôs that didn‚Äôt hold nearly their value. It sucked, ate up a bunch of our savings, wife and I basically decided we couldn‚Äôt do that to ourselves again with such an up and down marketplace. I don‚Äôt pretend to be an incredibly knowledgeable investor, we did our research, felt good about our investments, spent around $1k and they are worth fractions of that now.

Only reason i posted today was because I was looking at an item on Craigslist (dream bike I‚Äôd only have to save for 53 weeks for lol) and the guy selling it said he was willing to accept crypto in his post, I thought that was a really cool but risky way to sell things, just because his return could be absolutely amazing or crushing in the long run.

I tend to think that all of the SoV properties can be conferred onto Eth as Ethereum gains traction with actual usage. Not to mention all the actual issues with Bitcoin (block reward, PoW waste etc.)

It's important to remember that these narrative assumptions are dangerous as they have so much room to not be true. I would certainly place my bet on the token with the most widely used network to accrue the most value.

fbukasl,lapingvino,1,"Define what you see as decentralized. The problem is that there are different parts of the project that should be more or less decentralized. Development is a particularly hard position, because you influence how the system works. If you hijack development, the decentralization of the rest doesn't matter as much. Which is what Blockstream did. Linking the essence of Bitcoin up to the existing systems in such a way that universal participation is in no way accomplishable.

I am not sure what the real solution to this is, but so far ironically to me it seems IOTA does this best. But they don't have as much infrastructure in place yet for it to be useful, and there is still a distribution issue. No crypto has any decentralization so far other than infrastructural decentralization, which is a great first step but not enough on its own. Scalability is another important part of universal participation, where this community received a lot of promises but less and less actual return. Without the possibility for everyone to take part you don't get any actual security you want from decentralization, because the pals needed will just be cut off, as happened with the Core development.",2019-12-24 00:44:11
fbuiz88,kustonoy,1,"The question whether active traders believe it's priced in or not is irrelevant because for every buy volume there is respective sell volume, so the crowd is ALWAYS divided in half. Half is bears, half is bulls. This means that you need to look at sentiment to get a decent educated guess.
Concerning sentiment, we are only at ~54% of last year's high and futures is only trading at a slight discount less than five months before the biggest fundamental event for Bitcoin, let that sink in. Also, on perpetual contracts funding is barely positive, so there is little incentive to close longs right here.

I believe that, given the deterministic event of the halving in the near future, the crowd is too pessimistic about the price. This might change if I see enthusiasm here, but for now I think there is more upside in the next weeks.",2019-12-24 00:33:28

fbvofjt,TheRealestGaben,1,"The U.S. Dollar is backed by the entire US government and economy which is arguable the strongest economy in the world. Without them printing money it would be impossible to grow companies and the economy would collapse (if there is $100 and 10 people eventually one person is going to have all of the money and there will be nobody to buy his products because nobody has enough money, now scale that up and you get printing money). What is the steam currency backed by, well that is an easy question it is backed by every currency in the world you dumbass those kids that use there parents credit cards that uses USD and if they are in England it might use pounds maybe it uses EUROS any currency they deposited on, they can also withdraw through sites like skinbaron in USD, granted it isnt completely backed by all the currencies because if steam were to overnight collapse the currency would be worthless so I would say it is more backed by steam. Of course cash is used more than bitcoin do you want to know why because bitcoin is ass at being a stable currency which is part of the reason it will never be a good currency. If I were to have my life savings in bitcoin I would sell all of it because I dont want it to be cut in half in a few months like it did 2 years ago. You clearly do not have the slightest understanding of basic economics seeing as you dont know what the USD is backed by and dont even know why every government in the world prints money. Your final point of the decade of it going up 9m% that is just stupid as fuck. Yes it was likely the best investment somebody could have made but just because it went up that much last decade doesnt mean it will in the next decade for you to think the past justifies the future is absurdly stupid. Im not saying it wont double in the next two years and im not saying it will collapse to $10 in the next few years nobody cant tell you because it is backed by nothing and it has not statistics to show it will go up in price like the stock market it has no experience during an economic crisis. Sure go ahead and invest in it but you could get the same odds ""investing"" in black at the roulette table. There is a huge difference than investing where you research and look at the numbers to justify the risk to rewards than just saying hey I use bitcoin that sounds cool lets invest in it.",2019-12-24 05:42:29

fbvqdp4,Venij,1,"Transaction confirmation is a scale that reflects risks and incentives of having different behaviors.  Truly, Bitcoin is a system of trustlessness not because of policy, but because self-serving behavior is aligned with group interest - relying on others to have dependable behaviors.

A single confirmation would seem to indicate that the transaction is complete and won't be reversed.  But truthfully, we know that is not entirely correct and blocks can be orphaned or transactions put back in a nodes' mempool in any case.  Miners are directly competing with each other for block rewards - block transmission time allows for some discrepancy in communication and the entire network doesn't have a complete view at any instant in time.  But behavior should follow, such that the transaction goes back into node mempools and is then included in another block at a later time.

First-seen behavior is how the network is expected to behave when blocks are allowed to vary in size.  Miner behavior best serves its own purpose when they store and relay only first-seen transactions (else they are expending resources on actions that do not provide reward).

Smart BCH merchants should employ varied risk-management processes.  Validate the transactions for observed node policies of minimum fees / fee rates, dust limits, etc.  Confirm network transmission from other peered nodes on the network.  Do that for some time after the transaction is seen to ensure there is no simultaneous, competing transaction.  Wait for confirmations if the transaction value warrants it.

Zero-conf can be reasonably secure in many cases.",2019-12-24 05:55:52
fbvpppc,jessquit,1,"You're right no doubt. Since the internet totally failed at disrupting print, music, and films, surely the banking industry knows there's nothing to fear.

Because we always hear about how the CIA pushed Peter Todd and Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen but we never hear about the CIA approaching Greg Maxwell or Pieter Wiulle or Adam Back. They probably just quit worrying about Bitcoin.

Spend and replace was working out perfectly fine before. We had places like Humble Bundle, Steam, Expedia, Microsoft and MANY more large retailers accepting it. 

And then blocks got full, which caused price volatility and extremely high fees, and caused confirmation times to skyrocket. That‚Äôs when we started to see merchants drop it.

the banks love to offer overdraft services, because it's a cash cow. the poors have no choice but to use it from time to time. just like back in the 2005-2008 US housing bubble, when Wall St banks were all selling ""Liar Loans"", running ads and encouraging poor people with minimum wage incomes to lie about their incomes on the bank loan form, and then get approved for a ""Jumbo"" $600,000 Loan, with the flawed logic being it didn't matter if people obviously could never repay the loan, since ""This Time It's Different"" and ""all the Experts know"" the value of houses only goes up, so the house can just be repossed by the bank and re-sold for more than the value of the defaulted Jumbo Loan.

so yet again, the technical restrictions imposed by Bitcoin serves another greater Moral Good--it is impossible to spend Bitcoins that you don't own, and nobody will seel ""micro-loans"" of Bitcoin, so there will never be any overdraft fees on the Blockchain.",2019-12-25 12:12:49

fbzzx5k,jstolfi,1,"Greg was convinced that bitcoin would fail because of insufficient miner reward, and had a ""bright"" idea about how to fix it: let the network become congested, to drive the fees up, and divert most of the traffic to a ""layer 2"" network that he had devised.   

The developers in charge at he time explained to him why his idea would not work, but he did not accept the explanation.

The proper way for him to proceed then would have been to fork the project and create his Gregcoin, forking the blockchain or starting a new one from scratch.  But then it would take years for Gregcoin to get to the same level of use as Bitcoin; and Greg must have realized that no one would freely choose to use Gregcoin instead of Bitcoin.  The current bitcoin users and miners had to be *forced* to use Gregcoin.

Unfortunately for Bitcoin users, some rich but not so bright VC investors believed him. and poured some 100 million USD into Blockstream and a few other companies like Ciphrex and Chaincode Labs that were willing to support  his plan.  With that money, it was easy to push Gavin and Mike out, become the de facto ""CEO of Bitcoin"", and implement the first half of his plan -- let the network become congested.

fc00u3n,crypto_deus,1,"**How does Stellar protect digital assets?**

Digital assets (= money, but better) on Stellar are protected by a decentralized (= no mommy or daddy to tell you what to do) global (= as in whole world) network (= imagine all the people holding hands together) of computers (= the thing you use to get on reddit) running Stellar‚Äôs open source software (= free to all). These computers cooperate to confirm legitimate transactions and prevent malicious ones.

**What is consensus?**

Key to decentralized ledger technology is achieving consensus (= something that we all can agree). 

Unlike a bank‚Äôs centralized, single ledger of account balances, the validators  in a network must all agree on each ledger every several seconds to  minutes and update each of their ledgers to reflect the state of the  network - which transactions just happened and how they change account  balances.

The network must also be able to tolerate validators that lie or send incorrect messages.

This  process of coming to agreement is called consensus, and it should solve the classic double spend problem - preventing someone from spending  their money twice.

**FBA**

Professor David Mazieres, introduced the Stellar Consensus Protocol, or Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA), a decentralized alternative to PBFT.

In FBA, there is no single, master validator list chosen by a centralized authority. Rather,  each validator decides which other validators they trust, and their  list of trusted validators is called their quorum slice. The quorum slices of each validator overlap to form a quorum, or network-wide consensus on a transaction.

Without  the need for one centralized authority to decide on the validator list,  you create an open membership network. Anyone can spin up a validator  and participate in consensus if any other participating validator adds  you to their quorum slice. Because there is no one master  authority deciding which nodes get to participate in consensus, the  network exhibits decentralization.

So to summarize this feature, quorum slices allow for open membership and therefore decentralization.

**Safety**

Safety is a guarantee that something bad will never  happen. That bad thing is an accidental fork. This means that if the  network cannot agree on the ledger, it will not fork and the validators  will not create two different ledgers.

Instead, the network will stop making progress. You‚Äôll manually have to go in and figure out what is going on.

Put in the context of a legal system, a legal system prefers ‚Äúsafety‚Äù if it  errors on the side of making sure no innocent people will be jailed,  but, as a result, some guilty people will escape justice.

**Liveness**

Liveness  is a guarantee that something good will happen. That good thing is  ledgers closing. This means that the network will always close a ledger  to be live, responsive, and accepting future transactions. 

This  means that validators may diverge on different ledgers, causing an  accidental fork. Network participants won‚Äôt know which ledger the network will ultimately decide to take, exposing the network to  double-spend risks.

Another legal system analogy: a legal system  that errors on the side of jailing criminals instead of never jailing  innocent people prefers ‚Äúliveness‚Äù, meaning that sometimes the system  may fail and jail an innocent.

To boil down the difference between  safety and liveness: You can‚Äôt be sure that a distributed system both  won‚Äôt accidentally fork (safety) and that it will keep making progress  (liveness). So you have to chose which of those options you want to forgo.

To close out the legal system analogy: It‚Äôs incredibly  difficult for a legal system to guarantee that both no innocents will be  jailed (safety) and all criminals will be jailed (liveness). A legal  system cannot achieve both, so its construction must favor one or the other. 

**Asymptotic security**

The final feature is asymptotic security. This means no amount of computing power can overtake the network. 

Proof-of-Work (PoW) (see Bitcoin network)  does not exhibit asymptotic security, as some irrational attacker or  someone with outside incentives could defeat PoW consensus with what is  called a 51% attack. Miner‚Äôs computing power performs consensus  in PoW, and if you have 51% of the computing power on the network, you  dictate consensus. If the top few miners in the Bitcoin network colluded, or a large government felt threatened by Bitcoin and invested  large amounts of resources into mining rigs, the network could be  overtaken.

**To recap, FBA (and the Stellar implementation of FBA called the Stellar Consensus Protocol):**

1. **provides an open membership (decentralized)**
2. **That closes transactions in 3-5 seconds (low latency)**
3. **prefers safety over liveness (safety)**
4. **and is not susceptible to the 51% attacks of PoW (asymptotic security)**

In the case of PSBT, parties can collaborate to sign bitcoin transactions. Imagine you are one of several owners in a business that stores its funds in a multisignature wallet. Each of the N owners has one private key required to spend the UTXO; M of you are required to sign a transaction for it to be finalized. By using PSBT, each owner can use the wallet that he/she likes best as long as it implements the PSBT standard. One can use Wasabi, one Coldcard, while yet another may use Bitcoin Core directly.

It is widely known that bitcoin isn‚Äôt the only crypto.  It has already been shown that it is possible to create a stablecoin pegged against a crypto (DAI) that runs entirely on a smart contract with no exchange involved.  We can also surmise that DEX and cross chain atomic swaps will allow for the seamless transport of fiat VALUE in and out of inflationary and deflationary assets entirely via smart contracts without ever needing to go through any regulatory body. 

Furthermore this can be done anonymously. 

By extension then all goods can remain priced in whatever local fiat and merchants can accept payment in whatever form they want and the buyer can send payment in whatever form they want. The wallets will negotiate the exchange in real time and debit/credit the corresponding accounts as needed. 

The exchange gets baked into the background. 

Smart contracts allow for inflationary assets or deflationary as whatever each party desires. 

I can pay you in BTC and you can receive payment in whatever currency (virtual or otherwise) you desire. Neither party needs to know anything about the other, nor the type of conversion that happened.

This is exactly the point. Logarithmic regression only really applies if there is exponential growth in the data.

In practice this means that the only way to increase the block size is by using a hardfork. This is why some people are arguing that the only way to increase the blocksize is by using a hardfork (or asicboost) as this is the only way to achieve a hardfork. This is a dangerous precedent since it could make Bitcoin more vulnerable to 51% attack, which would only serve to weaken Bitcoin.

The disadvantage of seeding is that a block that isn't seeded will still be considered orphaned, which makes it harder for miners to find a block which is orphaned and thus harder for others to find a block which is orphaned.

This is what most miners will avoid doing, as it's possible for them to be orphaned when they're not seeding and thus they'll continue to mine blocks which are too big to orphan them.",2019-12-28 07:31:33
fc6pdlh,chile8888,1,"Well, whatever it does, enjoy.
I really dont see Bitcoin hitting anything lower than $6k any time soon but lord knows Bitcoin doesn't like me anyway, so I wouldnt be surprised to see it do exactly the opposite of what I think.

Either way I wont be trading it. The only 2 ways I'll get back into this market is if:
1) I can actually have a conversation with the people who have been watching me. (And this wont happen for obvious reasons.) 
OR
2) Bitcoin finally fucking plummets WELL below $3.1k. There are a lot of reasons that it can and will, but I'm pretty sure this will take many years. 

There is an argument to be made that $3.1k was NOT our bottom just due to EWT. It's entirely possible that $3.1k was just a 3rd wave down but a 5th wave failed due to FOMO. At this point the only valid counts I see are this being a new ATH or this being a correctional 2nd wave ABC impulse upwards. Technically speaking, as far as my limited knowledge is concerned, an ABC upwards COULD have already completed. Due to FOMO though, I don't think so. 

It is of my very amateur opinion that this asset is going to go parabolic at least one more time. Whether that's ATH (lol) or $16k/$18k, IDK.

All I really believe at this point is that Bitcoin is not going to hit $5k any time soon, but I could always be wrong. It is at this point that I would normally say 'who knows' but I'm more than positive more than a few do. It just ain't me. :-)",2019-12-28 07:35:20

fcfkej8,arockhardkeg,2,"I think you are forgetting the reason why the markets have crashed in the past. It wasn‚Äôt a simple ‚Äúoverbought market‚Äù, it was borderline criminal activity in investment banks where they were creating junk debt and selling them as safe investments. 

Your argument may apply to highly speculative markets like bitcoin, but you can‚Äôt apply that kind of thinking to ‚Äúreal‚Äù markets. Unless you provide more evidence in how the system will implode, I don‚Äôt think you are going to convince many people.",2019-12-29 23:47:26
fcfhbdw,FracturedKnees,2,"I would definitely say that ¬£500 is a healthy amount to ""speculate"". In the bitcoin space ""invest"" is not usually the right word, as no one truly knows if the bitcoin price is going to boom.

I would reccommend that you only put in what you can afford to loose. If in a months time you think you'll really need ¬£400 from that bitcoin you bought, then only buy ¬£100 instead.

As to when is the best time to buy, no one can honestly answer that question with regards to what the price is going to do. There are many youtube channels that are dedicated to showing charts, looking at the trends, and yes some of them get it right, but some of them get it wrong. Alot of them sell packages and courses so ""you can be just as good as they are and make lots of money"", but they always start the video with ""this is not financial addvice"". So be sceptical. If you decide to buy bitcoin, you are an early adopter, I bet most of your friends don't own bitcoin. So if you feel comfortable parting with your cash, try it. Buy some, and tell yourself that you wont sell it for at least 6 months to a year.",2019-12-29 23:32:00

The idea is that if you know the supply is going to be reduced (or you think it is, since miners probably aren‚Äôt selling 100% of their coins, and non miners are selling), it would make sense to buy now while supply is (theoretically) still high. Rather than buy 1 BTC for $1 and then at halvening, 0.5 for $1 (since miners can‚Äôt sell for less), the idea is that you could buy 1 for $1 and maybe 0.5 at that $1 price point, and another 0.5 at a $1.50 point. At this point, the market is at $1.50/BTC, and the halvening is ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù to some degree.

You seem to be ignoring what everyone is saying and instead trying to figure out how it‚Äôs actually happening. I don‚Äôt think anyone here is saying it *is* happening, just the idea of what it‚Äôs doing *if* it were to happen.",2019-12-29 01:01:08

fcj14yt,Menumber1,44,"I watched/listened to it over a couple gym/sauna/steamroom/etc sessions since he's back to streaming at ungodly hours of the night. Quick recap from what I rememer

Generally enjoyable. I really like Thump.  Thought it was interesting that chap said a few things he's historically been pretty quiet about.

I remember he said Vivid and Him are not confirmed duos if duos is announced for FCS. Was not happy with how they finished WR. Which isn't shocking, don't think they cracked top 300 any day except the first session on EU.

The Arab hate is real.  Arab may not hate chap, but chap despises Arab. Spent a good 10 minutes ranting about him and his squad.

Lot of talk about org's/salaries. Mentioned that Liquid/TSM offer way lower salaries because they're liquid/TSM. His contract has twice been redone to improve it for him, which gave me the impression that the contracts were all pretty bad early on. All of liquid have youtube/ad incentives in their contracts. Him and Tom are the only two that ever hit them. Chap's 2 year contract expires really soon with liquid.

LG pays insane salaries. Mentioned that Sceptic is potentially getting 15k per month

Talks about youtube and youtube ad revenue, how it works, etc

Talks about his aim trainer a bit, shows it off

Merch/Clothing lines

They discuss the boxfighting meta. How it came to be, it's relevance to comp fortnite. How chap has no desire to practice it because he doesn't think it's relevant to his game. (For what it's worth I think this is a pretty stupid take chap has, some of the reasons he struggles in duos and solos is because he is almost completely incapable of ending fights early/killing people and geting picks that refresh his mats)

Egirls and Sym/Brooke

Different streaming platforms, what it would take to switch, and so on

Twitch Bans, Dellor, Thump's ban for his chat spamming penis' in somebody's chat

Fortnite, the potential for a fortnite league in the same style as Cod or OWL has now. And how epic just has no interest in something like that, as cool as it would be

Apparently Calc has an incredibly good contract with vanguard

Natural talent both in real sports and esports, Apex competetive, older BR's/games.

Cryptocurrency, how chap gambled on bitcoin and lost out on 300k (he only invested 5k initially, but that was it's value)

Wagers/Gambling and whether or not it's against Epic/Twitch TOS. Clix taking 8 year old's parents money.

**Big one I forgot:** Cheating in fortnite/stream sniping. Thinks Xxif/jarvis should have a lifetime ban.  Thump pretty much came out and said Zayt stream snipes in tournaments. Which most of us could guess at this point.  Chap didn't deny it either. He actually said he was inches away from stream sniping Arab in squad finals but didn't end up doing it. Believes that if you stream tourney's it's fair game since it's unenforcable.  (really don't love this take from chap... but everyone is certainly entitled to their opinions)

There's more I really don't remember because it lasted 5 hours I think, or something like that.  But that was a lot of it. Don't think his vod's are sub only so probably worth a watch/listen if you've got the free time. I just treated it as a podcast, didn't watch anything

fyuy1cl,Lodgik,865,"Dear 13 year old me,

Hello from the future!  I'm your 35 years old self.  Hello!

I write this to you to warn you of several things, including bad choices you make that have major repercussions for the future.

First, you currently have undiagnosed ADD.  I know you think you are just lazy because that's what everyone is telling you, but it's ADD.  Bug your mother to see a psychiatrist.  Get some meds.  Things will go much easier for you if you do, instead of waiting to find out until your 30.  It'll make future bosses happier as well.  Hell, you might not get kicked out of your first high school because you didn't pass any of the classes and couldn't actually be bothered to go!

Second, lose some god damn weight.  Start working out some more.  It's much easier at the age your at then waiting until your older like I did.  I know your mother makes some delicious meals, and you can still have them, just eat... less.

Third, take better care of your god damn teeth.  Trust me.

Fourth, get some speech therapy.  Sooner the better.  I know this is unimaginable to you right now, since you are really ashamed of your stutter.  You don't even want to admit that you have a problem, because that would be admitting there's something *wrong* with you.  While you will get over that in your early twenties, that attitude will make your teenage years hell.  Because you didn't go until you were twenty, you had to deal with all the emotional baggage that came with it.  It made your teenage years very lonely.  Don't make that mistake again.

5th, in a few years, you might meet a girl named Jenny.  She will seem really friendly, and you will just be happy to have a close friend again.  You will even develop a crush on her.  When you do meet her, run away.  Run away as fast as you can as far as you can.  She is Satan incarnate and that friendship will turn slowly more and more emotionally abusive as the years go on.  She will slowly demolish any form of self-confidence you have and convince you that all of your other friends don't really like you, that no one really likes you and they find you annoying, and all you have is her.  She will have you wrapped around her finger as her substitute boyfriend and she will fuck you over again and again.  She will ruin years of your life.

6th, so there's this thing called bitcoin in the future...",2020-07-22 19:26:28

fypygwa,Goldeniccarus,737,"Bitcoin is generated through using computers to solve complex math equations in order to generate small quantities of Bitcoin through the process of mining. 

Miners worldwide use more energy than Belgium in order to produce Bitcoin, and a lot of these mining operations are in China where electricity is very cheap, but a lot of that power is produced using coal. 

Bitcoin has two purposes essentially, speculation with expectations that price will rise, and black market dealings because it's supposedly ""untraceable"".

g5eghuq,TalShar,696,"&gt;""So you‚Äôre mad. I get it. I promise you: I get it. You feel betrayed. You may even be wondering how the party that you so believed in could do something like this. But, odds are, you‚Äôre blaming me. Most people are probably angry at me, and blaming me for all this. That‚Äôs silly. I was always upfront about who I am. The good man in Rindge who looked into me found out everything he needed to know with a simple Google search. There it was, plain as day:  
&gt;  
&gt;Anarchist. (derogatory terms redacted because I don't want Reddit to hate me) Libertarian. ‚ÄúFuck the police.‚Äù Free Talk Live. Bitcoin. Reformed Satanic Church. Black Lives Matter ‚Ä¶ I went into it expecting that I would lose the primary to a write-in candidate, because I didn‚Äôt think that so many voters were just‚Ä¶ completely and totally oblivious about who they are voting for.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the fact is that you didn‚Äôt bother. You trusted the system. You trusted the establishment. You trusted the party. You felt safe. You were sure that there must be some mechanisms in place to prevent from occurring exactly what just occurred. Your anger is misplaced if you direct it at me‚Ä¶Really, whose fault is all this? You don‚Äôt know anything about the people you‚Äôre voting for. You‚Äôre just blindly voting for them because you trust in the party, you trust in the system. Well, the party is broken, and the system is broken. It‚Äôs all broken.More than 4,000 people went into the voting booth on September 8 this week, and they all filled in the circle by my name despite knowing absolutely nothing about the person they were nominating to the most powerful law enforcement position in the county. That‚Äôs a level of recklessness of which any decent human being should be ashamed.""

fn9rrjk,FaustianBargainHunt,524,"I'm exhausted and don't know what to do. Last week my dad, who's in his late sixties, apparently spent $10,000 to buy bitcoin from some guy who phoned and claimed to work at a bitcoin brokerage firm. He didn't tell my mum until a few days later, and was sure he was going to make like $50k in profit from it. My mum was furious and they had a big argument, and he promised he would never do it again. The 'broker' phoned back today and my dad spent three hours on the phone with him and ended up buying another $10,000 worth of bitcoin. And it's money my parents really don't have - it came out of their mortgage.

My mum called me in tears this afternoon about it, saying she didn't know what to do. I called my dad and tried to reason with him, and he was sure he would get rich from it and I told him that even if bitcoin went back to an all time high, at most he would make $5k. So he agreed to try cancel the second purchase.

Then as I was getting ready for bed I decided to look up the company and it turns out it's a big scam. Some guy based in Hungary (who lied and said he was based in the UK). So I called my dad and told him and he doesn't know what to do. And so I called his bank, and it's too late to reverse the second transaction, and the best they can do is try get the funds back if the receiving bank will cooperate. But now it seems hopeless and I'm scared for my parents, and for the sake of their relationship, and for my dad's mental health going through this. But what hurts the most is my sister and I had been saving money to try give them $10k as an anniversary/birthday present to help pay down the mortgage, and we both have decent jobs but hardly earn a lot. And it makes it so hard to justify saving money for them when dad just gets these stupid ideas and impulsively spends $20k on apparent bitcoin from some guy on the phone, without even checking that it's real. I just don't know what to do and I'm furious with him but also just need to help them and don't know how.",2020-04-13 22:01:36
