I've already showed you what metrics I used in a valuation: that is supply and a working product for starter. And Solana has no working product or users and supply will increased come Jan 2021, so price will drop by then. Im not assigning a value since it is nothing but an idea at this point.

Go google every secondary offering in any market history and you never see price pump on such announcements. At least my metrics rely on statistics of regular and crypto market unlike yours which is just pulled out of thin air. You can say whatever you want on Reddit about your fictitious title. Heck, I'm a DLT hedge fund manager.

&gt;You might have answered it already, apologize if I missed it. When you did buy Bitcoin, did you realize at the time that Bitcoin is a mechanism for redistributing, that the gains can only come at the losses of someone else?

I didn't, but doesn't the same apply for buying shares on the stock market? Anyway, I guess if that is the case, and if I had known at the time, I'd still have bought into it because I was under the impression that a deflationary currency would increase in value until everyone uses it; so no one loses in the long run.

fsgmzj2,pcvcolin,2,"This, though everyone's understood this is Democratic policy in a nutshell since 2009-2010, if you weren't already aware of it, it should be obvious now.

Also, just by the way, the S&amp;P 500 has been net increasing since mid February. Exactly what the Free Shit Army will do once most states reopen is beyond me, besides try to get more free TVs.  Or maybe they'll beg Pres. Trump, who they are now trying to overrun by crashing the gates on the White House lawn (that won't end well), that they deserve more endless money printing and free USD dumped in their bank accounts so they can pay for more bus tickets to new locations to burn and pillage?

We saw this in 1992 (in a Maxine Waters ""led"" area in Los Angeles), it is the same thing all over again now, but this time the people looting have a more obviously pro-Democratic slant:  they don't care about solving problems of systemic racism, they just want free shit, and a monopoly on violence (taking away all means of self defense, and only allowing government or a political party the ability to have use of firearms).  The timing is interesting too, just days after many businesses were given relief from the COVID orders, now we see them targeted and burnt to the ground - kind of like that church that recently opened in defiance of a COVID order, and got burned down by an arsonist in response.

The great effort of the Dems now is to decrease the growth of the economy just before the election in hopes that Pres. Trump won't be re-elected. They've pulled everything out of their toolkit: China, Newsom and other governors inclined to shutdown things forever, then when states reopen as they are now, Dems' last gasp and really last weapon in their toolkit is basically the same as what Maxine Waters tried out in LA in 92: encourage looting, call it ""peaceful protest,"" and keep business destruction going as long as possible.

Interestingly though, many market participants appear to interpret this as a more short term impact as you can see from looking at S&amp;P 500 (net increase since mid-February), as well as growing confidence in bitcoin and gold. In other words, ""we've seen it before, we're still investing, not a big thing, moving along.""

Keep stealing TVs, looters. Ought to get you in jail or maybe you can exchange that for several loaves of bread and a few packs of waters. When that's gone, what do you have? A destroyed city - markets continue to grow and rebound - and Pres. Trump is re-elected. Go back to work.

-----

Note:  in full disclosure, I consider myself something of a hybrid of crypto-anarchist and Constitutionalist, because I believe forms of economic interaction (like System D off-the-books participation and counter-economics, which is seen across most of the world, and typical government, which people also commonly participate in) will continue to coexist albeit with obvious tensions.  I personally chose to support Pres. Trump in the last election and see it as logical for 2020 also though I despair of there not being third party inclusion in USA political process.  

People should be defending Constitutional rights for all persons. We don't give them up because of a Seattle mayor or a California governor... or a Minneapolis cop.

People don't want to take responsibility for helping to manage their own communities more which is a big part of why the endless reliance on police continues and periodically results in needless death.",2020-06-01 06:35:01

So is this mostly because:

2.There's a lot more and possibly better development on ethereum?

3.I'm comparing apples and oranges and lightning is more secure or something like that?

fsk6yp4,DrupeDave,13,"1 - Ethereum is easier to build on.

It's not that it's easier to build on, it's that it's the only one of your two choices that is possible to build on at any meaningful rate.  Bitcoin was pioneering but Vitalik brought blockchain to the next level by making it general purpose and programmable.

Think of Bitcoin as an arcade machine in the early 90's, people could play cool games on it but if you wanted a new game you had to build a lot of low level hardware / circuits to make the next game. This was just not scaleable from a productivity point of view so people made consoles where you could make a new game just by writing some code and sending it out on a tape / disk to someone. Ethereum is the programmable tape machine, Bitcoin is the arcade machine.

2 -  There's a lot more and possibly better development on ethereum?

Yes, developers imaginations have been sparked by Ethereum and they will build everything you can possibly imagine, just like when the first programmable computer came out everybody built everything they could imagine on it even tho it was a limited machine, people used to build insane programs and even flew people to the moon on them. Etheruem is that machine. It's the Amiga computer of the 90's.

3.I'm comparing apples and oranges and lightning is more secure or something like that?

You are comparing apples and oranges unfortunately, Bitcoin and the lightning network are not very interesting to anyone that knows how to develop and that's a lot of people in todays world. It's kinda like setting a simple simon machine or a scientific calculator down beside a child, sure simple simon and flashing lights (and knows what order transactions were in) are cool but they won't hold attention for long especially once the child realises they can spell BoobLess in numbers on the calculator.

4 -  If 2, wouldn't this mean that these solutions can be applied to bitcoin too with some tweaking?

Nope, this one is a bit technical but it's a UTXO model with no concept of state other than adding transactions inputs and outputs to work out a balance. There is no programmable aspect to it at all, it's pretty much a technical antique. Antiques are cool tho and it will defo still haev value in the future :)",2020-06-02 05:09:40

fslduho,BobsBarker12,9,"Identity Evropa were some of the MAGA hats involved in the Unite the Right nazi rally. They specifically served as a conduit for individual fundraisers for people attending using a right wing fund raising platform called Rootbocks. This was not apparent though immediately as the website they used posed as a neutral ""free speech"" alternative to sites like Patreon.

After the terrorist ramming attack of Heather Heyer by some Trump loving Assad fanboy I kinda lost my nerve and spent a few days detailing the website, it's users and their social media presence. I contacted the domain registrars and hosts they used, their financial presence on Paypal and other ""mainstream"" services. Systematically they were purged from major services and providers.

Their howls of pain on Twitter were delicious, [I archived them](https://web.archive.org/web/20170818023844/https:/twitter.com/RootbocksDotCom). 

After some time they resorted to Bitcoin, this was great since donations were now visible and could be traced. Eventually the admin of the site showed himself to be the founder of Identity Evropa Nathan Damigo.  Nathan, using the fundraising site's Twitter, linked to the P.O. box used by Identity Evropa. [Here is a leaked log from the group with one of them touting P.O. box usage for OPSEC](https://unicornriot.ninja/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/AmIM_5_15_19_weekly_address.pdf), whoops that didn't work out huh?

There was never any doubt of who was behind the rally, but actually proving it in detail matters. What with people like Trump trying their best to disguise these elements as just random people and not regular attendants of his campaign rallies, like Matthew Heimbach. 

After the site was obliterated they moved onto ""goyfundme"" a short lived replacement with the same shtick but more blatant. Finally they moved to Hatreon, which was publicly organized by Andrew Anglin. These names should ring some bells for those tracking the hilarious merging of 4chan/gamergate/pepe meme/incel/white nationalist/Nazi/Putin fanboy communities into one giant MAGA hat wearing clusterfuck. Remember weev? Remember 'oops didn't mean to be so racist it's just a joke' racist humor being pumped into the right before 2016? 

All that was funded and organized on purpose and current right wing Nazi groups literally marching through the streets are the product of it. OK I'm done ranting now.

edit: While I'm digging through my trash for logs, [here is an archive of the founder's Twitter profile before it's suspension](https://web.archive.org/web/20170222131156/https:/twitter.com/NathanDamigo).

I think it largely comes from Chinese miners who are quick to accept authority over them, they're taught not to disagree by the CCP, so they just rolled over when it was obviously time to make a stand.

All I know is that if I'm repeatedly purposefully deceived, lied to, bait and switched, etc etc, then I'd personally take a stand. But I'm not a miner, so I can only stop using/holding Core and remain hopeful that bitcoin can eventually succeed regardless.",2020-06-02 12:44:08

These specific details are not mentioned because it's a generic scam letter sent to thousands of people in different countries, it's not tailored specifically to you.
2. The letter is basically proposing that you help commit multi-million dollar fraud, so that you won't contact the bank to verify any of this. Also so that when you get scammed out of a couple thousand dollars, you won't try to contact the authorities or dispute the fraud.
3. This is a pretty standard [Advance-Fee Scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If you actually contacted the email address listed in the letter, you would be asked to provide an up-front payment of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, telling you that they need that money to prepare the legal documents so that they can get you the millions of dollars. They'll ask you to send the money in some way that is hard to track and impossible to reverse, like a Western Union wire transfer or a Bitcoin payment or something.

Expect the mainnet to be more decentralized than this. Running a node requires some technical skill but not that much. You don't have to commit a single ADA to run one, and you or anyone can start 1000 at any time.

If Charles goes RIGHT NOW the project will have a PR problem, however note that he is not actively developing and researching. That's the job of the PHDs and almost 300 people that work for him. 

The idea is that by the end of the year voting will be working, which will enable the community to vote on who develops what and when.

From an investment standpoint, ADA has a real chance to return you 10x your investment in the short term (one year). A 10x on bitcoin would mean BTC market cap would be almost 2 trillion dollars - which is really really hard as there's nothing in it to attract new money to come in. A 10X on ADA would mean the token reaching $0.80 and becoming the Top 3 crypto currency around. It's not inconceivable after everything is released until the end of the year.

If the community votes to make IELE happen and allow Ethereum smart contracts to be simply copied over to cardano, expect it to overtake ETH and the token price to go over 2 bucks at least (also note it could probably be used to import contracts from other platforms such as tezos). If ADA were to have the same market cap as Bitcoin today, one ADA would be worth 10 dollars. We can't know how much ""new"" money will be attracted into this crypto, but once Hydra is ready (allowing 1M TPS which is more throughput than VISA/Mastercard have) Cardano will be very ready to actually become the ""financial operating system of the world"" and it won't be inconceivable for its market cap to reach 1 trillion dollars (1 ADA = 50 dollars).

fssgoet,Elean0rZ,13,"The idea originated with proof of work coins (like BTC, LTC, etc.) that are mined. At the start of the chain of blocks (= the blockchain) that is mined, there's a genesis block, which, pretty much by definition, gets mined by the developers of the coin (because they're the only ones that know when they're going to press the 'on' switch, so to speak).

* In a true pre-mine, the developers might have coded things so that that first block just happens to offer a much larger reward than all the subsequent blocks, resulting in a nice little bonus for themselves. 
* There are also 'effective' pre-mines, where a developer might just neglect to tell anyone they're starting the chain, so that they (or their cronies) mine by themselves for a while 'for free' before anyone else starts to compete for blocks. Just like the previous case, this results in an unfair advantage for a small group of people, and also in a poor distribution of tokens in general.
* Things changed when ICOs became common. In that model, proof of work became less popular, and regardless, the ICO model required that many/all of the tokens had to exist in order to be sold in the ICO (as opposed to being mined slowly over time). So, you just code 100 million tokens (or whatever number) into existence, and sell them for $X each, and that's your ICO. This is often also called a 'premine', even though it occurs quite differently vs. old-school premines.

The whole 'scam' thing is often framed in black and white by certain people, especially Bitcoin maximalists, but it really isn't. Basically, premines in the original sense were often associated with scams, because developers would hide the fact that they were doing this, when in fact their plan all along was to pump the price and then dump their premined bags on the market. However, there are also legitimate reasons for premining--for example, the project might premine a certain number of coins to create a development fund that can only be used to advance the project.

Meanwhile, many ICOs were crappy ideas (not actually scams, but a lot of folks here like calling things scams), and some were indeed scams that took the money from the ICO and ran. It's certainly a risky thing for investors, in that you're throwing a bunch of money at an idea with no guarantees. But, again, there is no intrinsic reason why a coin that used an ICO 'premine' model is definitely a scam\*. Some were just 'honestly shitty', if that makes sense--like, the idea just failed or the team made poor decisions with the money or whatever. And there are plenty of totally not-scammy, successful projects that emerged from that model too.

The bottom line is that there's nothing inherently wrong with a premine if it's clearly advertised in advance and investors know what they're getting into. That honesty/transparency piece is pretty much the key here.

\*  We're getting into the weeds a little now, but this issue also gets intertwined in the proof-of-work vs. other consensus mechanisms debate. The argument (oversimplified) is that a blockchain is only as secure, and therefore only as valuable, as the extent and distribution of hashpower on the network. Most ICO projects rely on consensus mechanisms other than PoW, which are much more power efficient, and often more efficient at achieving consensus, but they also tend to be more centralized and don't create the same 'arms race' found in PoW, which (PoW enthusiasts argue) means there isn't the same incentive to protect the network. The argument--again, mostly from PoW enthusiasts which in practice shares a lot of overlap in the Venn diagram with Bitcoin maximalists--is that any project using such a system is selling something intrinsically inferior and less valuable to naive investors, and is thus a scam by definition. They cite as evidence the fact that most coins that ICO'd have since failed or lost value (never mind that the same was true about the huge explosion of non-ICO's PoW coins in 2013/2014).

We're not going to settle that debate here, but suffice to say that it's not that simple. PoW has advantages and disadvantages; non-PoW options have different advantages and disadvantages; and there are various defensible concepts of what a blockchain 'should' be, depending on its intended use and the tradeoffs you are willing to make between speed and decentralization. In practice, what makes a project a scam or not is based on factors unrelated to the consensus mechanism. Correlation doesn't equal causation.

So, TL;DR, many pre-mined coins are crap; some are scams; but being premined doesn't equal 'scam' by definition.",2020-06-04 06:17:37
fst7xl8,IdrinkandIknwothings,12,"Le co√ªt de l'immobilier est reli√© au nombre de gens qui cherchent √† acheter, √©videmment, le probl√®me c'est qu'une bonne partie de gens qui cherchent √† acheter le font pour investir, pas pour habiter dedans.

La raison principale pourquoi l'immobilier part ne fou c'est que c'est √† peu pr√®s le seul type d'investissement qui est assez gros pour absorber toute l'argent qui se cherche un investissement. Le but c'est de prot√©ger la valeur de l'argent en cas de crise √©conomique et de la mettre √† l'abris de l'inflation.

**Quand le p√©trole est mont√© √† $150 US le baril**

La fois que le p√©trole est parti en fou, √ßa avait rien √† voir avec la demande sur le march√©, c'est juste qu'un paquet d'investisseurs ont achet√© la ""commodit√©""... Donc √ßa avait aucun autre rapport que l'achat de commodit√© en bourse.

**Le probl√®me de l'investissement**

Si on comptabilise toutes les actions de compagnies disponibles avec toute les commodit√©s (Or, p√©trole, cuivre, uranium, bl√©, bananes) et tous les obligations, le montant de ces chose n'est pas aussi grand que le montant d'argent qui se cherche un investissement.

√áa a r√©sult√© dans la sur√©valuation de compagnies ([La Bulle des .Com](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulle_sp%C3%A9culative_(Internet))), √† la sur√©valuation du p√©trole (Baril √† $150), √† la bulle du Bitcoin et √† toute sorte d'augmentation de prix √† la consommation.

Mais comme il y a toujours plus d'argent que de choses √† acheter, √† un moment donn√© les investisseurs r√©alisent que le march√© est sur√©valu√© et ils arr√™tent d'acheter... Ce qui fait tomber le prix de ces choses comme durant le crash des .Com (Dot com), le crash du Bitcoin et le crash actuel du p√©trole.

C'est la raison pourquoi les investisseurs se tournent vers l'immobilier car, diff√©remment pour le p√©trole ou le bitcoin, le march√© de l'immobilier est sp√©cial car c'est un produit absolument n√©cessaire, les gens ont besoin d'un endroit pour vivre et dormir.

**Comment r√©gler le probl√®me?**

Facile, il faut multiplier la construction d'habitation... Sauf que les entrepreneurs ne vont pas construire si'ils ne sont pas certain de pouvoir vendre.

Il faut donc se tourner vers le gouvernement pour qu'il aide les gens √† se construire une nouvelle demeure...

**L'autre probl√®me c'est les terrains**

Plus il va y avoir du monde pour b√¢tir une maison neuve, plus √ßa va prendre des terrains et plus les terrains vont co√ªter cher... Ensuite personne ne veut vivre √† 2 heures de route du travail ce qui veut dire que certains terrains vont devenir hors de prix... **La solution?** B√¢tir en hauteur comme des tours √† condos ou √† appartement √† haute densit√©.

**Le probl√®me avec la haute densit√©**

Deux choses: Qualit√© de vie et les promoteurs ne veulent b√¢tir que des condos pour riches parce-que c'est plus payant. Il va donc falloir que les gouvernements des villes et le provincial subventionnent ou qu'ils deviennent carr√©ment des promoteurs pour b√¢tir des logement abordables (on parle pas de logements sociaux) pour les gens de la classe moyenne en prenant soin de m√©langer quelques riches, beaucoup de classe moyenne et une quantit√© moindre de logements sociaux pour bien balancer les choses. Certains pourront √™tre vendus, d'autre mis en location.

**Mais il y a une autre composante**

Pour g√©rer le prix des terrains, il faut permettre l'√©talement urbain, mais l'√©talement urbain est mauvais car il occupe des terres agricoles et force les gens √† utiliser leur voitures, demandant plus de routes...

La solution c'est un transport en commun rapide, confortable, √† passage fr√©quents et abordable... Le REM, l'extension du m√©tro et l'achat de trains de banlieue plus modernes et plus rapides.

**Donc les prix montent car il y a moins d'habitations que d'acheteurs. L'immobilier est le nouveau refuge des investisseurs. Pour r√©gler le cas il faut b√¢tir des centaines de milliers de nouvelles demeures mais √ßa cause l'√©talement urbain. Il faut donc augmenter la densit√© et si les promoteurs ne s'int√©ressent qu'aux riches acheteurs, il faut que le gouvernement s'en m√™le et en m√™me temps, augmenter l'offre de transport en commun efficaces.**",2020-06-04 10:11:14

______________________________________________________________________________________

When I first got into Crypto ""seriously"" was back in April 2017. I bought some Bitcoin, I was mining with 2 antminers for a while.

I got some altcoins with my mined Bitcoin. Now, I had zero idea what I was doing back then, so I put some Bitcoin into some... interesting picks.

One was [Pepecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/memetic/).  (Now called MEME) I also used to do a bunch of trading with the ""Potcoins"", my first alt exchange was Bittrex. 

So, I put a decent chunk of change into Pepecoin at like, $0.02, along with a whole bunch of other weird shit (POT Coin, all those janky things on Bittrex you'd laugh at now). Went back to my Bitcoin mining, started discovering ETH, so on and so forth.


Got into trading BCH for a long time when it started to exist and had these HUGE fluctuations - Discovered Binance and a couple of other alt exchanges up until September, when I remembered I had originally bought some garbage on Bittrex. I wondered if it was worth anything.

Pepecoin was worth like, $0.14. I was amazed, but didn't really want to sell it as I was seeing huge fluctuations in Crypto's price, so I resolved to watch it. One day, it was all the way up to $0.24, which was **ten times** my original price, so I turned it all into BTC and bought some stuff on other exchanges with the profits. 

One of these things was IOTA - Which when I sold Pepecoin, was $0.50.  It looked cool, and while still watching the Crypto markets, got into a bunch of other things. IOTA in the madness period went up to **$5.00**. So, in keeping with my original plan, I sold half of my IOTA in the beginning of December and looked into other things. Some of that became LINK, some became XRB, some became BNB.

**However**:

Some of that also became utter trash that was pure speculation.  Stuff like [Publica](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/publica/) which no longer exists, or [RVR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/revolutionvr/) which used to be VOX - Some of those ""investments"" are just $0 sums now.



______________________________________________________________________________________

So, Crypto is a funny place. As long as you treat it as entirely speculative, and understand your money can either explode or disappear, you should be fine.

But if I look back, a lot of the fun I had in Crypto was betting on totally unknown horses - I'd say the vast majority of the original gains I had was from trading a fucking meme coin into random other things and getting lucky on some others afterwards. :)",2020-06-05 04:49:39

* Nearly **80%** of quarterly inflows were attributed to investors converting tokens into shares of Grayscale products, also known as ‚Äúin-kind‚Äù share creations.
* The majority of investment capital came from institutions with **84%** of inflows coming primarily from hedge funds. This has been a consistent long-term trend, which has continued to gain momentum throughout 2019.",2020-06-06 02:59:43

ft3whe3,Happy_Pizza_,10,"So, a long time ago, in 2018, [I made a prediction that bitcoin would break down from the 6k meme](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/9ix8ct/prediction_bitcoin_will_break_its_long_term/) triangle.  The logic behind that (correct) prediction, was that bitcoin was unlikely to rise as fast as the long term trendline was predicting, therefore we would break down from the descending triangle.

What if we use that logic for today's situation?

Weekly chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/mp8jjqtC/

Daily chart:  https://www.tradingview.com/x/77ZBLMSf/

As you can see, we are currently at a **very** pivotal point.  The current uptrend we are in is bumping up against the macro descending trendline.  We either break down from our current uptrend or we break up in a big way.  

We should also note how steep the uptrend is.  If we continue the current rate of growth, we'll see 15k by end of 3rd quarter and **at minimum** breach our all time high by December.

So, does that mean our current uptrend is unsustainable?  Well..... I'm not so sure.  We shouldn't be intimated by the steepness of the slope on the weekly chart.  The previous expansions also had extremely steep growth rates relative to what came before them (EDIT: I didn't use lograthimic numbers for those charts.  That was a mistake.).  The growth rate implied by our current trend could still be unsustainable but the fundmentals for a massive run are here unlike in 2018.

This isn't a prediction post.  I'm not sure if we're going to break up or down and I don't think anyone else knows either.  

The more interesting observation is that this is a really big test for [Plan B's Stock to Flow model](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).  His model predicts an end of year price of 30k **which is actually in line with our current trendline holding.**  So if our current trendline holds, that would provide some early validation for his model and vice versa if it breaks down.

The two trends intersect around June 16th.  In a week and a half, we'll know.",2020-06-06 20:53:16

ft3t06k,__heimdall,8,"Well I was curious.  I haven't kept up with changes in real time over the last 5 years, and as a dev I figured I might as well dig through their change log and see what bubbles up.

I see 29 released going back 5 years, starting with 0.11.0 on July 12, 2015.  My notes from reviewing all the changes:

\- There's honestly a worrying series of versions (especially recently) that add then later remove features, APIs, parameters, etc.  Though I'm only going off changelogs and don't have  full details, it reads like the devs are shooting from the hip and aren't thinking far enough ahead.

\- BIP 174 added partially signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT) in version 0.17.0.  I'd count that as a big improvement, very much needed for security enhancements on hardware wallets

\- BIP 173 added full segwit support in 0.16.0 (after the softfork in 0.13.1).  Contentious feature for sure, but it is a big feature none the less.  Questionable for a scaling solution long term, but BCH does have basically the same feature

\-  BIP 32 added Hierarchical Deterministic wallets - another one that's really beneficial for security and privacy, especially combined with PSBT and hardware wallets

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there's some I missed, but it was a bit disappointing to not find more!  There's plenty of bug fixes, security patches, etc. but over the scale of 5 years, or roughly half of bitcoin's existence, that's a bit disappointing to see for sure",2020-06-06 20:28:28

CTO of brave commented : 
&gt; Similar to top site suggestions, we'd like to add Crypto Widgets and Binance related suggestions based on what a user types in the URL bar. This is mostly an experiment to see if it's useful. It could be expanded in the future to involve BAT or even be used if the user has Brave ads turned on.

Then they tested, verified and added that in.


#### 2. https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/9782 : **Add top site and brave suggested site suggestion settings on Android #9782**

&gt; It is needed for 1.9.x, Basically there are some new suggestions that we populate for brave suggested sites like ""Bitcoin"" to give a link to buy bitcoin on Binance with a referral code.

This is where it was added to Android.


#### 3. https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/5567 : **Added new autocomplete options to privacy settings #5567**

This is where the toggle was added to settings. Note that it was left enabled by default.

ft8qlgg,Value-form,15,"&gt; The Zbellion plot was a small part of JLASS 2018, which also featured scenarios involving Islamist militants in Africa, anti-capitalist extremists, and ISIS successors. The war game was conducted by students and faculty from the U.S. military‚Äôs war colleges, the training grounds for prospective generals and admirals. While it is explicitly not a national intelligence estimate, the war game, which covers the future through early 2028, is ‚Äúintended to reflect a plausible depiction of major trends and influences in the world regions,‚Äù according to the more than 200 pages of documents.

&gt; According to the scenario, many members of Gen Z ‚Äî psychologically scarred in their youth by 9/11 and the Great Recession, crushed by college debt, and disenchanted with their employment options ‚Äî have given up on their hopes for a good life and believe the system is rigged against them. Here‚Äôs how the origins of the uprising are described:

&gt; Both the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Great Recession greatly influenced the attitudes of this generation in the United states, and resulted in a feeling of unsettlement and insecurity among Gen Z. Although Millennials experienced these events during their coming of age, Gen Z lived through them as part of their childhood, affecting their realism and world view ‚Ä¶ many found themselves stuck with excessive college debt when they discovered employment options did not meet their expectations. Gen Z are often described as seeking independence and opportunity but are also among the least likely to believe there is such a thing as the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream,‚Äù and that the ‚Äúsystem is rigged‚Äù against them. Frequently seeing themselves as agents for social change, they crave fulfillment and excitement in their job to help ‚Äúmove the world forward.‚Äù Despite the technological proficiency they possess, Gen Z actually prefer person-to-person contact as opposed to online interaction. They describe themselves as being involved in their virtual and physical communities, and as having rejected excessive consumerism.

&gt; In early 2025, a cadre of these disaffected Zoomers launch a protest movement. Beginning in ‚Äúparks, rallies, protests, and coffee shops‚Äù ‚Äî first in Seattle; then New York City; Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles; Las Vegas; and Austin ‚Äî a group known as Zbellion begins a ‚Äúglobal cyber campaign to expose injustice and corruption and to support causes it deem[s] beneficial.‚Äù

&gt; During face-to-face recruitment, would-be members of Zbellion are given instructions for going to sites on the dark web that allow them to access sophisticated malware to siphon funds from corporations, financial institutions, and nonprofits that support ‚Äúthe establishment.‚Äù The gains are then converted to Bitcoin and distributed to ‚Äúworthy recipients‚Äù including fellow Zbellion members who claim financial need. Zbellion leadership, says the scenario, assures its members that their Robin Hood-esque wealth redistribution is not only untraceable by law enforcement but ‚Äúultimately justifiable,‚Äù as targets are selected based on ‚Äúsecure polling‚Äù of ‚Äúnetwork delegates.‚Äù Although its origins are American, by the latter 2020s, Zbellion activities are also occurring across Europe and cities throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, including Nairobi, Kenya; Hanoi, Vietnam; and Amman, Jordan.

The United Nations adopts Security Council Resolution No. 86-1949, establishing a new regulatory body with absolute authority over the Internet, known simply as the Internet Authority. The IA has the authority to order the deletion or censorship of any content on the Internet, using vast server farms and computer botnets located in six continents to knock non-compliant websites offline. Anyone under the age of 18 may submit a Purge Request to the IA to have any pictures of or references to them permanently removed from the Internet.

For the first few years, the IA works tirelessly to fight cybercrime, terrorism, and human trafficking by scouring the Internet for evidence and serving hundreds of digital search warrants a month from its office in the Hague.

Eventually, they are frustrated with how encryption is hindering their efforts and keeping their targets' communications secret. The IA issues an order for all encryption to include a backdoor that IA investigators can access to read the encrypted information. Politicians across the world praise this as a great step towards ensuring public security.

Despite this, people are still building their own encryption programs that ignore IA rules and ensure perfect privacy in communications. The IA responds by setting up firewall servers in every country to filter out and block all encrypted data that's not compliant with IA rules. Countries that don't cooperate are disconnected from the global Internet.

To combat money laundering, all cryptocurrencies are now hereby prohibited and their packets will be filtered. Without a reliable way to broadcast blocks and transactions, the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains grind to a halt, slowly being abandoned, much to the detriment of Internet libertarians everywhere.

In addition, on the request of several undisclosed heads of government, any communication that threatens the national security of a state will be filtered out and blocked. Any government may simply submit a Request to Suppress to the IA to block any information they deem to be detrimental to state security. Within weeks, the websites of several prominent Russian opposition political groups all mysteriously go offline.

The Government of China, seeing a tremendous opportunity, uses this as a chance to further tighten their grip over the flow of information. The websites of pan-democratic political parties in Hong Kong are taken offline, as is the entire Taiwanese Government's computer system, as fhs UN recognises the Peoples' Republic of China as the legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan. With government programs all being reset to 70s technology in Taiwan, internal unrest ensues and the island's government quickly implodes, allowing Beijing to realise their 100 year-long dream of reunifying China. 

Without any voice in traditional media not any way to connect with voters, the pan-democrats in Hong Kong lose almost all their seats in the legislature, and the new strongly pro-Beijing majority immediately proposes dissolving the devolved Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in favour of letting the central Chinese government directly administer the city ""for efficiency's sake"".

In the United States, the NSA secret submits Orders to Suppress against several news agencies because fake news is harmful to national security and public discourse. The IA honours these requests, declaring that it is not their place to interpret the US Constitution. Now, only Government-approved news agencies will be able to stay online.

Several large tech companies manage to avoid this fate through multi-million dollar campaign donations.

ftcllcm,nullc,11,"Liquid isn't particularly censorship resistant. If someone tells you it is they're confused.

Back when I worked at blockstream there was thought in the design to mitigate some of the risks: make transactions difficult to identify, even the peg outs use a ring signature to authorize them, and blockstream should have no ability to change the software in use (instead, they'd have to convince each of the functionaries to run replacement software if they wanted it deployed-- and the software is open source). At some point engineering made a tool that would analyze a proposed membership and work out the implications of geopolitical correlated failures. The system was designed to hide the operating locations from the functionaries from each other. But like other multiparty system's its still centralized even though the centralization is distributed, so countermeasures can only go so far.  The reason it has them is because the centralization makes them all the more important, but it doesn't make it non-centeralized.  [To be clear, I have absolutely no operating knowledge about Liquid-- I left blockstream before it was in production and things could have changed after I left.]

For Bitcoin liquid is an alternative to straight up exchange custody and has some potentially useful security trade-offs compared to that.  But if you wouldn't leave bitcoins with an exchange then they probably shouldn't be in liquid either, because even though there are probably countermeasures it's probably impossible for any of us to validate that they're actually in place and working or reason about their implications.

One of the things that frustrates me about this space though is that some of the same people who go on about liquid not being censorship resistant are happy to promote extremely centralized altcoins or single point exchanges which are no better.",2020-06-08 16:50:48

Also for some insight into why I think Bitcoin is useful - 

1) **Save money** -  I like to save money with various services like lolli.com, ln.pizza ,foldapp.com,purse.io, or bitrefill.com

2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha

3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools 

4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value

5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure

6) **Soverignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking 

7) **Micro txs** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet

8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth

9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet

11)	**Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily

11) **Interesting and fun** It is fascinating mixture of technology, game theory, security, mathematics, politics, and economics that never bores me


If you want an investment viewpoint of Bitcoin - 

I believe Bitcoin is going to be over 1 million USD per BTC in value in the future. When this will occur , I have no idea.  Around 2-4 million BTC have been permanently lost or burnt. This means that you have around 14 million to 16 million BTC will be fought over in the next few years , but many Bitcoin users are long term hodlers so at least half of those BTC are trapped in their savings. Thus you have a situation where 7-8 million BTC could potentially be purchased with ~2100 Billionaires in the world and at least ~36 million millionaires. If even a small percentage of these wealthy investors wanted to hedge 1-5% of their portfolio in Bitcoin they couldn't without dramatically increasing the value of Bitcoin. These days it is actually dangerous not to have at least 5% exposure to Bitcoin because it is an uncorrelated asset class and one needs a balanced portfolio. This is how scarce Bitcoin is. 
 
 
I have no plans on taking any profits(I am just going to spend and replace while keep increasing my BTC savings every year) for at least 8 years due to this. -
 
Why?
 
There is a generational change occurring with not only investing but preference in banking and currency usage. 
 
millennial's and Generation Z grew up in the digital world and have little interest in investing in gold or silver and don't trust banks. People investing in gold and silver(or gold mining companies) I meet are typically in their late 40s or older. What is interesting about this shift is the key aspect of gold that these older gold bugs appreciate about their investment , being tangible and physical commodity that can be used and held physically , is the same thing that these 2 last generations reject and see as a burden or something that takes up space or inconvenient to store or secure.
 
Generation Y or Millennial's (born ~1982 to 2002) are now 37 to 17 and will begin to replace generation X as the new group with the greatest investing and spending capital (ages 45-54). This means in as little as 8 years you are going to start to see the transition of millennial into peak spending/investing ages and start to push out gen X who is more ambivalent/mixed to digital era. Baby boomers will be well into retirement and not be investing/spending and more living off their IRAs and pensions and their lack of familiarity and confidence of cryptocurrency will have little consequence. Thus in 8 years you will have gen Y enter their peak spending and investing and gen Z fill the next greatest category of spenders/investors(early career).
 
The other key takeaway is that these age groups also shift from not only spending more but investing more which is critical. Let‚Äôs look at the breakdown averages in the USA-
 
1) Less than 25 Years Old ‚Äì $31,102 in spending (94.6%% of total income)
 
2) Between 25-34 Years ‚Äì $48,928 in spending (**70.8%** of total income)
 
3) Between 45-54 Years ‚Äì $64,781 in spending (**64.6%** of total income)
 
4) Over 75 Years Old ‚Äì $40,211 in spending (95.6% of total income)

These numbers represent spending and investing habits of different age demographics in the USA from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-americans-make-and-spend-their-money-by-age-group/


 
Notice from 25 to 54 these individuals have the most money not only to spend but also to invest. Baby boomers retiring are spending almost all their income surviving (healthcare) and/or vacationing and no longer investing as much. Once gen Y and gen Z dominate these 2 age brackets than a heavy bias towards Bitcoin will occur.
 
Another issue is people and countries will start to transition away from gold in the future as a hedge 
 
In 2026 Psyche will start reporting back to NASA the expected reality that there will a sudden hyper-inflationary spike in the volume of gold being mined in the near future
https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/
Since psyche 16 asteroid represents an example of an asteroid that is a core of an early planet thus metallic and estimated to contain around $700 quintillion dollars of precious metals (gold, platinum, etc..) or 93 billion dollars of precious metals per person.
While mining will not start immediately, the markets will start pricing in the expectation of mining and nation states will start to slowly sell their gold reserves if they are wise enough flooding the market with cheap gold.
Nation states will need an alternative asset to hedge against.

The first thing I look for in any whitepaper is how it differentiates itself from what Ethereum is doing. If it ignores Ethereum it's safe to say it's a scam. Ethereum isn't the first to showcase blockchain technology. It's currently still in the shadow of Bitcoin which was the first blockchain technology. It's only a matter of time before enough people realize the use of Ethereum vs Bitcoin. 

I would without a shred of doubt bet my life on what the prevailing blockchain technology will be in 50 years from now. It will not be bitcoin.

ftfcxcy,AJ-Smiles,19,"Hey man, few thoughts from someone who knows his IT pretty well..  
  
The article says there is a 'server' farm in the basement and attaches a photo. I am pretty certain it is actually a bitcoin/cryto-coin farm:  
  
https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/fr/cp0/e15/q65/15675674_583537358503424_902927555886293395_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_sid=dd9801&amp;_nc_ohc=JJrZphG3rOoAX_KvQ1F&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lht6-1.xx&amp;_nc_tp=14&amp;oh=db79af6b6a60a7dd1c4c5dd3f65f0a92&amp;oe=5F04CA90  
  
All those racks are graphics cards. Notice the giant fans against the racks in the back room in the photo in the article, cryto mining farms require a ton of airflow because the gfx cards are essentially running at 100% 24/7, getting ridiculously hot and would literally melt the boards if there was no cooling.    
  
Take a look also at the fake roof where they apparently found 'the evidence'. Those components are clearly routers and USB hubs. Not hard drives. If they were running a server farm there would be a LOT more ethernet cables.

This is an incredibly messy server rack, but you get the idea.  
  
I think you might be on to something with the connection to the German Maddy guy though, and now apparently the prosecutor has evidence that proves she's dead, but not one single reason why they think that, or even a clue to where a body would be.  
  
I think she is alive, these stories are seeds for what's to come, plant seeds in people's head that she is dead but never actually confirm it with any evidence. In about a month or 2, when it has been cemented as fact in the minds of the masses that she's dead, and when the masses need to be distracted from some other shady bullshit, she will return. It will blow people's minds.  
  
She will be a teenager and she will be the biggest celebrity in the world for a while, interviews left right and center, constantly on TV, a best selling book will come out, probably a film too, everyone's attention and focus will be on her, while some other shady bullshit is going on elsewhere in the world.",2020-06-09 09:26:30

ftoau5d,yeahdave4,15,"The same thing that happened just before the last run to $1400 is about to start.  It is an essential and critical indicator:  The complaining.  

Here's a relatively shallow post meant to illustrate a point:

.




**Background:**

Eth is doing what it did last run: the price is starting to lag and become even more absurdly detached from underlying fundamentals (the impatient 
 will call it ""under performing"").  It is stuck waiting for BTC while ""everything else goes up"".  There is no fundamental reason for Eth to stick around under 250.  Everything else with far less potential and fundamental value is in ""risk on"" mode.  I anticipate the complaining will start soon.

**Data:**

Let's use some examples from the current flavors of the month to illustrate this gap.

From the Black Thursday low (lets say $100), Eth has gone up 250% (lets say its $250 right now).

However if Eth kept up with:

Kyber it would be $314

Nano it would be $353

Cardano it would be $354

Vechain it would be $423 

That's a pretty big difference.

**Conclusion:**

Either:

Eth sucks and ""those lazy devs keep delaying making me rich"" and ""waa where my moon"" 


or 

Eth hasn't even **remotely** begun to move.  

Choose now and plan accordingly because I promise you this lag will happen again (is already happening).  Choose which project has more potential, provides more value to the human race, and is more likely to exist years from now (or you know... diversify).  



Oh and don't give me that ""but look at the market cap"" nonsense.  We all know that's a pretty meaningless metric when XRP, Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin SV, and EOS are ""the top 10"".

ftmaq7p,decibels42,14,"My counter to this is that if you think eth2 will arrive over the next 1-3 years, now is the absolute best time to bet on it.

Imo, ETH enters the SOV market/narrative once eth2 arrives, which will have about a 0.5% issuance rate + gas fee burning + a 5% return/bond-like function (for conservative returns if you participate as a staker; though in the beginning this can be closer to 20%). 

If BTC does succeed with its SOV narrative pitch (it‚Äôs only remaining use case), it will have 100% of that market share. With eth2, Ethereum will begin to attract some of the people who own crypto for the SOV purpose. After factoring in ETHs more diverse and versatile use cases (that create real demand for ETH and act as insurance for ETHs SOV argument), it‚Äôs pretty fair to say that ETH will have a strong narrative for taking at least some of BTCs SOV market share.

Looking at the hard numbers, Bitcoin‚Äôs issuance is 2% today, 1% in 2024, 0.5% in 2028, while Ethereum‚Äôs will drop from 4% today to 0.5% as soon as 2021, and could be potentially negative when gas fees are burned. This would ensure ETHs issuance to be less than Bitcoin‚Äôs for at least two halvings (potentially until 2032), and the security mechanism to ensure the chain is based on a model that‚Äôs more sustainable (POS as opposed to Bitcoin which relies on decreasing block rewards/increasing fees).",2020-06-11 04:58:11

What exactly that possibility is, no one really knows. It‚Äôll hit that, if ever, based on too many factors to know, quantify, and weigh right now.

I think the talk stems from things like 10k (a 1T market cap) not being *that* crazy of a valuation when compared to other multi-trillion dollar asset classes like metals, real estate, bonds, derivatives, etc. (and when considering how influential and useful Ethereum can be)‚Äîheck even some individual stocks have gotten to the elusive 1T market cap, and stocks just give you a dividend, at best (the equivalent of ETH staking rewards), while ETH has oh so much more utility.

Pentagon Documents Reveal The U.S. Has Planned For A Bitcoin Rebellion

BILLY BAMBROUGH JUNE 11, 2020

Bitcoin has struggled to find support in the U.S. government, with president Donald Trump, along with Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, leading the criticism.

Now, it's been revealed the U.S. Department of Defense has wargamed scenarios involving a Generation Z rebellion that uses bitcoin to undermine and evade ""the establishment.""

In the Pentagon war game, young people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s use cyber attacks to steal money and convert it to bitcoin, documents published by investigative news site The Intercept revealed.

Called the 2018 Joint Land, Air and Sea Strategic Special Program (JLASS), the war game is set in 2025 and is ""intended to reflect a plausible depiction of major trends and influences in the world regions.""

The scenario, which echoes recent protests in the U.S. and around the world against racial injustice, involves some members of Gen Z, who see themselves ""as agents for social change"" and believe the ""system is rigged"" against them, begin a ""global cyber campaign to expose injustice and corruption and to support causes it deem[s] beneficial.""

The group, called Zbellion, encourages cyber attacks against organizations that support ""the establishment,"" funnelling stolen cash into bitcoin to make ""small, below the threshold donations"" to ""worthy recipients"" and Zbellion members.

The program, which also reportedly wargamed scenarios involving Islamist militants and anti-capitalist extremists, was conducted by students and faculty from the U.S. military‚Äôs war colleges, the training ground for prospective generals and admirals.

Bitcoin has increasingly been adopted by Wall Street and the world's biggest financial institutions since its 2017 price explosion but remains a tool to fight government control.

The Pentagon war game documents have been revealed after Florida Republican Representative Matt Gaetz called for the government to ""freeze"" the money of demonstrators after country-wide protests over the killing of George Floyd turned violent this month.

""One of the most important tools in the authoritarian toolkit is the ability to freeze the funding of legitimate political dissent,"" Nathaniel Whittemore, a bitcoin and cryptocurrency consultant and strategist, said previously.

""By separating the infrastructure of money from the infrastructure of state power, bitcoin makes it that much harder for this type of politically motivated confiscation.""

Bitcoin has seen a surge of interest in recent months due to the coronavirus pandemic and never-before-seen levels of government borrowing.

""In the wake of unprecedented central bank action around the Covid-19 crisis, it seemed like the most relevant narrative of bitcoin in 2020 was as a hedge against inflation,"" Whittemore said.

""It appears, however, that its capacity for censorship resistance might be just as relevant.""",2020-06-12 03:21:48

In those systems, transactions are confirmed by a large number of other users who must stake coins of their own. They can't create fake transactions, and having to stake their own coins means if they try to censor other people's transactions the network gets a bad reputation and so goes down in price - meaning their stake they had to put up goes down in value too.

There are a *lot* of cryptocurrencies out there competing, trying to become a 'standard' or just widely used for different use cases. I like crypto and think it's cool to watch it develop.

fupsaf2,Sinity,1,"&gt; I don't think you can solve a political and social problem like this with technology, unless it's some indistinguishable-from-magic levels of overpowered.

Scott has a great blogpost aligned with my position on this; it probably argues for it better than I could: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/10/society-is-fixed-biology-is-mutable/

&gt; See, my terrible lecture on ADHD suggested several reasons for the increasing prevalence of the disease. Of these I remember two: the spiritual desert of modern adolescence, and insufficient iron in the diet. And I remember thinking ‚ÄúMan, I hope it‚Äôs the iron one, because that seems a lot easier to fix.‚Äù

&gt; Society is really hard to change. We figured drug use was ‚Äújust‚Äù a social problem, and it‚Äôs obvious how to solve social problems, so we gave kids nice little lessons in school about how you should Just Say No. There were advertisements in sports and video games about how Winners Don‚Äôt Do Drugs. And just in case that didn‚Äôt work, the cherry on the social engineering sundae was putting all the drug users in jail, where they would have a lot of time to think about what they‚Äôd done and be so moved by the prospect of further punishment that they would come clean.

&gt; And that is why, even to this day, nobody uses drugs.

----

&gt; Even assuming you somehow manage to interest a significant enough percent of the population in using decentralised and encrypted networks, all it would take from the government is to ban it and assign heavy enough penalties for violation

All it takes is users *ignoring the ban*. ""Looking"" at the government like it's grown a second head. I mean, if US government outlawed
*the Internet*, people wouldn't do anything.

And government won't straight-up ban it. They didn't even ban *Tor* yet, and there's Drug Markets &amp; CP &amp; stolen data just *lying there*. They didn't ban Bitcoin - and there's even an excuse for doing that (other than making a competing currency which is illegal): there's CP encoded in the blockchain apparently. Which simply can't be deleted without ""deleting"" whatever-current-market-cap-of-BTC-is of value.

&gt; And AFAIK, contents and destination of an encrypted protocol traffic may stay hidden, but the traffic itself is easily visible to the provider.

Yes, but then you have ways around this. Nothing *impossible* to break. There's some dependence on geopolitics I think. But basically, Russia/China doesn't like US. Will they turn in traffic logs from the server in their territory? I doubt. So, use a VPN located in Russia.

All the government can see is that you communicate with a server in Russia.

You could do multiple steps even. Pay for VPN with bitcoin, which you buy locally. Have a VPN service in Russia, and in China, and in Switzerland, and *in the US*. Chain them together.

Or use Tor, which is free &amp; works about the same (but is terribly slow). Tor allows you to host a *service* anonymously. Through fucking-up and deanonymizing yourself  *somehow* is possible (like Ross Ulbricht, eh).

These are just *easiest* ways. And not really about decentralization. *Tech is not a problem, only willingness*. Main disadvantage of these technologies is... slowness. But that should be possible to improve with more users.",2020-06-14 01:47:07

fuptvvv,fresheneesz,1,"A trezor will warn you if the firmware isn't signed, so unless you're blindly pressing go, it shouldn't receive unsigned firmware. However if someone (or ones) who can sign the firmware and can put it up on the website produce malicious firmware, then yes it's possible. 

It's also possible for someone who produces parts for trezor, assembles the device, or ships the device to modify it. The only way to significantly reduce that trust is to use two devices from two completely separate companies to create a multisig wallet. That way you'd know that both those two companies would have to collude or be compromised by the same thief in order for you funds to be stolen.

However, if there is a malicious firmware update out there, the thief is being incredibly careful. A usual thief would want to steal as much as possible as quick as possible to reduce the window of discovery and reduce their chances of getting caught. Since the thousands of people who have trezors aren't all on here yelling about losing coins, this obviously isn't the case. 

So either way, you're probably pretty safe as long as you follow good security practices.

fuxq8an,bitusher,11,"This is Possible, but extremely unlikely in the USA due to the following reasons 

1) The Trendon Shavers gave legal precedent that Bitcoin is not an illegal security according to the Howey test

2) The IRS has already formalized how it treats Bitcoin (as an asset)

3) Many wealthy and highly connected individuals have personally invested in Bitcoin and they wont be too happy if their peers in politics make Bitcoin illegal

4) Traditional Fintech in the USA like ICE/BAKKT(owner of NYSE) , Fidelity, TD ameritrade, CME, and more are already directly involved in Bitcoin mining, investing and trading.

5) Exchanges like coinbase, square, gemini , and more already are very large companies heavily involved in Bitcoin

6) Many local states has both case law and legislation on Bitcoin making it more difficult to make illegal

7) There is plenty of existing case law in US courts that have shown encryption and code to fall under the 1st amendment protections 

8) Making it illegal would not stop bitcoin but just reflect they are a totalitarian government and an inept one at that because stopping Bitcoin is far more difficult than winning the war on drugs",2020-06-16 05:03:38

Most people think we're super weird so I'm doing my best to explain it from how other people view the space. 

There's a time and a place to name drop Ethereum but sometimes you got to go with Bitcoin for accessibility. 

I want to ask for your support for my Gitcoin grant. I'm trying to get into Ethereum education full time. Starting with my newsletter and also a consultancy business. I'm doing this based on my long held premise that the technology is a 10, and awareness is at a 0. We can RT each other on Twitter all day long about the inevitable mooning but the reality is we're all bobbing along to the whims of whale games while we wait for the rest of the world to wake up to what's going on. I'm doing by best to bring this stuff front and center to every investment and financial professional I can reach out to. My newsletter already has a handful of high profile investors I personally know that would otherwise know nothing about crypto. 

[If you wish to support my grant, you can do so here.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/156/zero-knowledge-education) Every Dai means a lot because of the matching and today is the first day so it would be amazing if I got off to a good start. I'm not going to pretend that a few thousand Dai wouldn't help me a lot. The newsletter at least is truly a public good as it's non-rivalrous and non-excludable. 

This community is in a rare position to play kingmaker for any of these grants as this is home to 90%+ of all people who know how to make a tx on Gitcoin. I can't promise anything but know that I'm doing my best to not just sit here and wait for adoption to come to us.

Past that Satoshi was clear in his online communication, which you appear to have never read. He said there should always be some free transactions. He proposed a snack machine that accepts unconfirmed transactions.

That's not **religion**. It's **history**.

It's okay that you disagreed with the project mission. But then doesn't that beg the question as to why you invested in the first place (if indeed you ever did)? 

By the way, since you think that I'm a nobody who doesn't understand computer science (I have an undergrad and graduate degree plus over two decades as a practitioner, but whatever, Mr Cryptographer with zero commits), doesn't *that* beg the question, ""why are you here?""

Original post:
&gt;In a worst-case scenario, let's say that crypto is a fad and we're so deep inside of our bubble that we're the only people who haven't figured this out yet. (I know this isn't true, but this is a game.)

&gt;How long do you think you will remain an Eth maximalist if this rocket never launches?

&gt;What would be a triggering event to wake you up from your delusion to make you realize you made a mistake?

&gt; I know these sound like negative questions, anyone who knows me knows that I'm a fanatical moonboi, I'm just curious about our collective intuition.

My response:

This is a great question and one I have been working through myself.  Unfortunately most people will approach this question with  some rendition of ""Well there is no way it will fail so blah blah blah"".

IIt may surprise people to hear me say this but I am looking at this question very critically.  What would cause me to take capital and move to the next thing (and therefore count Eth as a failed launch)?  It likely won't be any one thing but here is some of the things on my list.

1.  Prolonged failure to launch the Eth2 phase 0 genesis block due to not enough initial stakers.
2.  A brain drain of research and engineering talent.
3.  Lack of meaningful adoption of Eth 2 once Phase 1 or 1.5 is complete.
4.  Lack of meaningful independent dapps that are not DeFi.
5.  Failure to ship Phase 1 by the end of 2021.  Phase 0 is the foundation, but Phase 1 is where actual meaningful blockchain transactions/data will be occurring.
6.  Chaos and fracturing of the Eth research/development teams.
7.  Devs/researchers sabotaging Eth for personal gain or for the benefit of third parties.

fv5f60j,cajunflavoredbob,5,"So I have several questions. Many of them question whether or not this service should exist in the first place. I hope you understand that I mean you no disrespect when I ask them.

It seems like your service is not an indexer or a server. It looks like it downloads nzb files and stores to contents in your cloud service. Nothing else that I know of exists already that does this all in one. I have many questions and concerns about this.

*  What gave you the idea to start this type of service?
*  Are you aware that most of us use plex/emby/jellyfin for media playback already?
 * Are you going to create your own apps for all platforms like they have already?
*  If you're internal video player is competing with those programs, do you provide support for *at least* the same files types as they do?
*  How much cloud storage space are you offering? 
 * Average usenet local storage is around 2-4TB of space.
*  What are your planned prices for this service? 
 * I can get unlimited google cloud storage for twelve bucks. VPNs for streaming torrents are around five bucks a month.
*  Do you connect with any of my indexers or servers? Do I need to upload the NZB file to your service myself?
 * If you do connect to my other providers, how do you handle authentication?
* What speeds do you offer in terms of downloads to your cloud storage, and also downloads to the end user?
 * I'm assuming here that you do offer direct downloads to the end user. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

**From your webstie:**

* ""We are not a Usenet provider. We are not a Cloud storage provider. We are not a Streaming service provider."" &lt;-- Ok, then what are you? 
 * If you're not providing Usenet access, then I have to purchase my own indexer and server subscription. If you're not storing my files, then I have to pay for my own local or cloud storage. If you're not streaming files I've downloaded, then I have to have my own software. What point does this serve? Am I misunderstanding something? It sounds like you don't do anything but download the actual files, which Sabnzbd and NZBGet both handle fine without a cost.
* ""Stream media files right through your laptop, phone, or tablet."" &lt;-- I must be missing something, because your ""What we are not"" section clearly says you aren't a streaming service. Do you or don't you stream things that are downloaded?
* ""Want to store your files somewhere else? Piece of cake!"" &lt;-- So I can pay you to not stream or store my files? I don't get this.
* ""No need to upload subtitles separately. Just check if your Usenet file already has ones."" &lt;-- Are you just connecting with opensubtitles.org for this? 
 * Since you aren't streaming anything, I'm assuming that you're just matching the title to a subtitle database and passing that on to the customer. Why wouldn't I just use opensubtitles.org for this?
* ""Your data is protected by SSL, and with our offer of bitcoin payments, you can be as anonymous as you want."" &lt;-- This brings up a good point. What logs do you keep?

It sounds like your service is a cloud based downloader, and nothing else. I upload the nzb file to your service, and it downloads the files, then serves that file to my device with optional subtitles. The only benefit I see here is that my personal server wouldn't need to be running to download things. However, if I need to provide my own indexer, server, and storage, then I may as well use a local newznab program to download directly to my device or choice. Unless I'm really misunderstanding here, it doesn't sound like your service provides any real value to the customer if it's only a cloud based nzb downloader.

fv66q93,rjmcoin,4,"I think then you may have missed the point.

Cardano is not (yet) targeting mainstream developers. (2007 .NET). They want to find a niche group of highly skilled developers (Haskell) that have been building mission critical systems for decades (Stock exchanges, Banks, NASA etc) to build the first round of Cardano ""dapps"" with completely new experiences. (iPhone 2007).

What he mentioned about mainstream developers is the fact that today's ecosystem only allows blockchain to be a small component of the development process (Microsoft building identity on Bitcoin).

The server, client, blockchain balance is still primarily OFF the blockchain and therefore most projects are essentially blockchain agnostic (as they should be). The blockchain is just a public or private record system for a small subset of the applications. Most of these magical ""dapps"" can be ground to a halt if you just shut down the servers or client services required to run any ""decentralized"" projects of any use. By example of Cryptokitties, running an entire end-to-end dapp on a decentralized platform is 10-15 years away, the tech just isn't there yet.

In the mean time the regular Javascript, C++, etc.. normies that are extremely susceptible to writing junk code and submitting it to an app store in a ""launch it fast and fix it later"" mentality can still plug away at the server and client side and then use the blockchain that's the most efficient for the small component the blockchain will play.  Plutus offers an experience where there are both on chain and off chain code can exist in the same file so it greatly reduces complexity and room for error, but that's still only a part of the equation.

If you look at developers in crypto, ETH has a large piece of that pie, but maybe around 1% of ""developers"" are developing on blockchain, let alone ETH. This is what he means by fighting in a small pond right beside the ocean. So ETH has ~70% of ~1% is roughly what he's suggesting. (not his words of course)

Regardless, the ""network effect"" echo-chamber seems to be overwhelming otherwise sensible people as well as the snow blind ETH community that has latched onto an idea that just hasn't been fully flushed out. They are working hard and bound and determined that ETH is the future and the only future and I'm sure they will find a way to build a Model-T one day.

In the mean-time Cardano has been building a rocket-ship on a start-from-scratch-with-science approach, already seeing in 2015 where things need to go, and in 6-8 weeks, we're going to have Shelley and shortly after we'll have Goguen.

Does it mean your employer, landlord, parents, university, etc. are paying for the electricity?  That doesn't mean it is free electricity, it just means someone else is paying.     Or is it that you are in a location where there is more electricity than demand, and thus the cost per kWh is extremely cheap (e.g., West Texas, western Washington State, parts of Quebec with excess hydroelectric power, Tennessee Valley, etc.? 

Anyway, how much are you trying to buy?   If you want $100 worth of BTC per month, you'll need (currently) about 3 Antminer S9s.  Each uses 1,400W, so that means you'll need three outlets each on their own circuit breaker.  

And they are loud as well (like a jet engine in your closet), and three S9s throw off the same heat as does four 1,000W space heaters, so you'll need fans to exhaust that hot air out a window.

fv657jd,freeradicalx,3,"I'm a libertarian socialist, aka left libertarian, aka OG libertarian, aka anarchist (A French anarchist actually coined the term libertarian in the 1890s for use in his anarchist newspaper after the government outlawed identifying oneself as anarchist, the US right later coopted the term in the 1950s to replace a muddying liberalism, pretty much just because it sounded similar). So yeah, I'm a libertarian and I like guns and hate central government. But the ""left"" / ""socialist"" part takes it further than that: Anarchists draw their rejection of the state from their rejection of hierarchy. Hierarchy is our actual enemy and that's why we reject both the state *and* capitalism, both forms of hierarchy. It's also why we laugh at confused ""libertarians"" on the right who reject the state while simultaneously licking oligarchial boot. Its not OK when politicians and cops and the military do it to you but it's apparently OK when Amazon and Facebook and Apple do. My interest in bitcoin isn't to get rich, I do not identify with the wealthy, it's to protect what little value I am allowed to keep from state manipulation and the externalities of capitalism in their game I have been forced to play at a distinct disadvantage. I do not agree with competitive economies, but since I am stuck in one until it collapses I figure I might as well make the most of it and use whatever tricks I can to preserve my autonomy.

fva7n8v,1MightBeAPenguin,4,"Think about it this way: Bitcoin was launched back in 2009, and Satoshi always intended for it to scale, so that it can be used in commerce as more people join the network. Would it make sense for him to make a system in which the blockchain couldn't scale? No, that would be extremely short-sighted, and not make sense for a project that took years to create.

What economic model makes more sense for global adoption, such that everyone can use Bitcoin? High transaction volume with low fees (aka affordable and better for everyone), or low transaction volume with high fees? I think this makes it clear as day as to which economic model is better, and which one is truly a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Now Blockstream, the main company that the devs work for are funded by several conflicting interests including, but not limited to AXA Ventures, other banking institutions, and Digital Currency Group which not only is funded by Mastercard, but also has a current federal reserve member on their team. They insist on keeping the blocksize small despite many educated people having debunked the idea that an increase in the blocksize limit will cause harm to centralization.

The blocksize limit was set almost 10 years ago. Wouldn't it make sense to increase it considering that technology including bandwidth, digital storage, computing, and network latency have all improved and ALSO have gotten cheaper? Apparently not to Blockstream and Bitcoin Core (which have become synonymous at this point).

I've been working on [Libauth](https://github.com/bitauth/libauth) (previously `bitcoin-ts`) for a couple of years now ‚Äì the goal is to make a flexible, lightweight, and easily auditable Bitcoin Cash JavaScript library.

Libauth has no dependencies, and it works in all JavaScript environments, including Node.js, Deno, and browsers. Some highlights:

* **Flexibility** ‚Äì Even highly-complex functionality is built-up from simpler functions. These lower-level functions can be used to experiment, tweak, and remix your own higher-level methods without maintaining a fork of the library.
* **Smaller application bundles** ‚Äì Applications can import only the methods they need, eliminating the unused code (via [dead-code elimination](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/)).
* **Better auditability** ‚Äì Beyond having no dependencies of its own, Libauth's [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) approach makes auditing critical code easier: smaller bundles, smaller functions, and less churn between versions (fewer cascading changes to object-oriented interfaces).
* **Fully-portable** ‚Äì No platform-specific APIs are ever used, so the same code paths are used across all JavaScript environments (reducing the auditable ""surface area"" and simplifying library development).

This makes Libauth a really strong choice for Bitcoin Cash libraries, CLIs, and browser applications: you may be able to cut down your list of dependencies, and (with dead-code elimination) your library can be much lighter-weight than if you used one of the more monolithic libraries (like bitcore-lib, bitcoin-js, and bcoin derivatives).

For the record, Ethereum handles just ~1.2mb of data every 10 minutes. This is basically just on par with grandaddy Bitcoin. Yes, that produces about 5gb/month. But what's the actual cost there? I can buy a terabyte ssd hard drive for 120$ currently. That would allow me to store 200 months worth of Ethereum blockchain growth!! That's 16.6 YEARS of storage at current rates. By then, storage may be 100x cheaper again

Meanwhile, we have had absurd fees for months that literally eliminate most use cases. Like, just transferring an NFT costs &gt;1$. Guys this is not cool. This directly fucks up my business, flowerpatch.app, and gives most of our profits to the miners

Even if you truly believe in l2, that only works if we can actually scale the base layer as well. Remember, people need to use l1 to move funds in and out of l2s. Also, l2 adoption is clearly not ready

Meanwhile, ETH is working on several mitigations for the amount of data stored. We have alternate data structures, stateless sync, partial sync, and Eth2 sharding coming up

In short, we have had high fees for 1.5 months, driving out many usecases. The storage need is at the same level as BTC. We need bigger blocks even with l2. Miners are making the right call here, to raise the gas limit!

Edit: one metric that shows whether eth can raise the gas limit is the uncle rates. This signals all green currently, with historic low rates: https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_uncle_rate",2020-06-20 02:57:49

2) Ok got that point. I hope b1 still have a lot of that money. I doesn't see a problem to first develop the ecosystem better and start with marketing when its ready. A company like block.one will have a lot more costs than just pay salary for developers. I think it will not only be 4%. 

3) Its just what I see is that block.one use the money to grow the whole EOSIO ecosystem, which in the end will benefit EOS as the mainchain. Like ERC20 token benefited Ethereum. But EOSIO is IBC ready. And that was clear from the beginning that this will be an architecture with horizontal scaling. 

I got in EOS actually around Januar 2018. I made a good profit with bitcoin, invested in EOS and lost all my profit again. Waiting since today, that the price will go up again. But if I would have invested in Ethereum instead of EOS, I would lost the money as well. 

The only thing what I am saying is that EOS is not a chinese cartel, nor a shitcoin and clearly not a scam. I see the technology and the amazing application which developers build and keep believing in it. 

I don't have any problem with anybody who think if they are b1, they would have decided differently. But I am pretty sure, they could have done everything different, the price still would be the same, because crypto is in a bear market. Maybe the price would be instead of 2.50 it would be 5 or 8. But that would not make any difference for all this people who are so shitting about EOS, just because they choose the wrong time to invest. I bet with you as soon the bull market starts and EOS start increasing with the price again (and maybe b1 start the marketing because they are ready with their products) everybody will be happy again. I just have enough to read all this false accusations and decided to do something against it. I have nothing against facts or critisism.

A scam is a criminal activity, which b1 is not doing. If they were, they would be in jail and for sure would not be able to settle an agreement with the SEC!",2020-06-20 05:41:05
fvdlbar,kilmarta,2,"I've done up a review / tutorial of using bitmex funding to earn passive interest. 

Here is a table of the interest you would have made on bitmex and the price changes in bitcoin

https://imgur.com/5sshP26

Overall you will only get a good return it the price of bitcoin rises significantly, and get a negative return if bitcoin falls in price.  So you will get a better return owning crypto if the price goes up or lending out a stable coin if the price falls.

Either way I don't think it is worth using Bitmex to earn interest this way.  To be clear I still think bitmex is good to use for other things, like using leverage while most of your coins stay safe in your wallet.

fvh3zk4,CCalith,1,"I think some here are missing the point.

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing about Bitcoin Cash is utility. It works better as peer to peer electronic cash than Bitcoin Core. The point of the fork was to keep it true to purpose and vision. Bitcoin Core advocates don't even try to pretend that Bitcoin Core is peer to peer electronic cash anymore, and instead fall back on the platitude that it is a store of value. In other words, it doesn't have any utility whatsoever, except for being a ponzi scheme to park your capital, in the hopes it appreciates in USD so you can exit your position before the next guy.

&amp;#x200B;

What some of the Bitcoin Core people realized a while back is that even with large blocks, Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash) can never achieve Visa-level transaction throughput. So while Bitcoin Cash has a path to achieve many hundreds of transactions per second, far superior to Bitcoin Core, it can never compete with Visa in the many thousands of transactions per second. 

&amp;#x200B;

AVA on the other hand, uses an entirely new consensus protocol that gets Visa-level transaction throughput now, with payment finality in under two seconds. It's scaleable and efficient. It's intended to be a platform of platforms, providing the layer one substrate that all projects can work off of to build their own value-added propositions. 

&amp;#x200B;

AvaLabs are not interested in yet another cryptocurrency as peer to peer electronic cash. They are interested in building a platform for digitizing real-world assets, where each independently developed sub-platform controls the parameters for their own governance, while utilizing the efficient and scalable layer one consensus protocol provided out of the box on the AVA network. This is huge, because it means that even traditional institutions who are looking for some kind of blockchain-type solution, but who don't want a purely decentralized model that is completely out of their control, can also be onboarded according to their unique governance requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, the folks heading up AvaLabs are honest folks from well-respected academic institutions who have received $6m in funding from top investment firms. They've turned away much more capital, as they don't want to fall into the all-too-common trap of getting overfunded and losing focus. But don't take my word for it. Do some research, watch a few interviews with Emin G√ºn Sirer and you will get a better understanding for what they're doing.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would love to see is Bitcoin Cash ported to run on the AVA network, replacing the PoW consensus protocol with PoS Avalanche consensus and immediately reaping the rewards of Visa-level transaction throughput. IMO, the first large-cap cryptocurrency intended primarily as peer to peer electronic cash (Bitcoin?, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, etc.) that makes this transition will eventually become the cryptocurrency that wins the peer to peer electronic cash race.",2020-06-21 06:00:10

To me it's similar to the case of ""bitcoin doesn't have any from address!"" - yeah of course a transaction itself doesn't contain such thing, but the tuple of previous txid and vout uniquely points to the previous output item, so that it's definitely the ""from address"".

Question is, if the hash and code is controlled against the will of the community and users, would they be willing to continue with their own fork? interestingly, ABC are planning to continue with the 'upgrades' so all it would take is for users to refuse the upgrade and continue on the same path - arguably ABC would then fork against the BCH community, rather than the other way.

If you are asking if LN is possible on BCH, sure, and I would also argue if BCH is going to be successful, it should follow the same route. Many of the cons for LN such as transaction fees are less of an issue on BCH whilst providing the added privacy that LN could provide.

LN is decentralised also, if you believe BCH is, it follows a very similar model except with more implementations of the protocol.

For this reason, Automatic Replay Protection failed miserably at the only time in its history it would have been useful: when Bitcoin SV split off.

Without theoretical benefits materialising in practice, the costs (a rigid upgrade schedule with forced software updates even if there is no change, users having it activate unintentionally) are probably not worth it.

Either way I am not advocating for Bitcoin ABC to drop Automatic Replay Protection. Every implementation can safely make their own decision on this issue. If Bitcoin ABC likes it, they should keep it in. If all other nodes don't like it, they should keep it out. Automatic Replay Protection never activates if people keep their node up-to-date, and developers can decide for their own nodes what should happen to them when they are not up-to-date.",2020-06-22 03:17:30

fvk23wy,Jstodd_,1,"&gt;but PoW is still way more efficient than fiat. 

Im not sure about that. Centralized systems like used in fiat are pretty efficient compared to POW. Distributed systems cost more, for the obvious reason that more computers are doing it. 

Cost efficiency goes more like:

FIAT &gt; POS &gt; POW

With avalanche being one of the most efficient in the POS category.



&gt;I just see POS go the way of government. A few entities will gain too many coins and eventually try to create mandatory fees or inflation because that‚Äôs what their incentive is.

Actually, they are more incentivized to look out for the protocol because their wealth is on the line. And since ethusuasts can participate, they chip in. Miners care less, because they just want short term profit.

&gt; A few entities will gain too many coins

Maybe. But also on Bitcoin, there is an average of 4 mining pools that make up 51% of the network. Just 4. You can verify on coin.dance. If POS has better distribution, then this should be a nonissue.

&gt;I‚Äôm still not convinced the effectiveness of forking because those entities can anonymize their coins and it won‚Äôt be easy to tell who owns what coins unless you‚Äôre going to ban anyone who votes for inflation (malicious or because they think it‚Äôs good food them) in the new fork which silencing opinions always leads to a bad outcome

Best conspiracy theory I've read in ages because well it's accurate. The push of stablecoins or fiat backed cryptocurrency by the banking industry is because stablecoins have the transparency of cryptocurrency (surveillance plus!) with the market manipulation of fiat currencies. None of the forced scarcity of Bitcoin, all of the FED money magic of the USD is what every stablecoin is about. There are pushes to build private systems to get around the transparent nature of the new system by building intra-network financial systems for the biggest corporations, so they themselves won't have their transactions scrutinized.

Think about it: you have people running around destroying things that were produced by the society (body). If this were a human's body, we'd call them pathogens without blinking an eye.

This is symbolically a disease ravaging our body (society). If you look, they're taking down Washington, Jefferson, they tore down a Grant statue, and defaced the Lincoln memorial.

This has NOTHING to do with racism or slavery - if it did, the Left wouldn't be allies with Muslims (Mohammed was a slave owner). Why deface Lincoln or topple Grant? They freed slaves!

No. This is a deliberate attempt to undermine the basis of western civilization. Columbus brought the most technologically advanced civilization to the new world, and the same civilization came to be the first in all history to make slavery illegal.

The desire to abolish slavery - and institute the freest  government ever - all stems from Christianity (which obviously stemmed from Judaism). The same people toppling these statues are also atheists - it's not a coincidence.

I'll try to answer some of your questions...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is there a way to know when the Cardano network will achieve 100% of circulating supply (and the minting process comes to an end)?

Its hard coded - see the [delegation design specification](https://hydra.iohk.io/build/3156413/download/1/delegation_design_spec.pdf): T‚àû is the maximal amount of ada to ever be in circulation (i.e., 45 x 10\^9 ada).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How is the ‚Äúminting‚Äù rate? I mean, stakers gain rewards for verifying the network from newly minted ada coins, right? And there is a fixed maximum supply, so, how much ada is minted per block? Are there halvings like in bitcoin and similar chains or is this a fixed minting rate or it is dynamic and tied to the # of tx or something..? 

[https://youtu.be/NaR5W78eFo4?t=1417](https://youtu.be/NaR5W78eFo4?t=1417)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I‚Äôm not a techy guy so this is probably why I didn‚Äôt understand this, but, what is this about two protocol coding languages (rust and Haskell)? There are two teams developing the code at the same time in different code languages?

[Rust vs Haskell testnets](https://youtu.be/K6_EcEMbFoY?t=0&amp;ref=adatainment)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How long does an ADA tx takes to have full confirmation?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Someone told me that, in the future, the project is going to be self-funded, since a part of the fees from txs are sent to the treasury and the community votes on how to spend it. Is there a way to know how much the treasury has accumulate until now? Are these funds stored on a public address or something?

It's hard enough to enforce their war on drugs, but to impose on a decentralized (edit global) network where people are doing honest business and commerce that has widespread public sympathy is going to be nearly impossible.   

&gt;However, ‚Äúthe government has something that those who work with virtual currencies don‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs a gun.""

Most altcoin ratios corrected 70-90% down from ATH, Monero is no different. 

Bitcoin is still sitting on it's Golden Throne, sucking life from ~~1000 psykers daily~~ all promising and technically advanced altcoins just to keep itself alive.

Plus there's the Crypto FED called Tether which is making paper-paper USD with which Bitfinex can pump BTC/USDT price anywhere they want. Without this ""crypto quantitative easing"", BTC would be $1000 - $1500, and Monero would be peanuts.

The fear of delisting is too much for the ""investors"" I guess, so they skip Monero.

Then, there's all these shitcoin tokens which appeared out of nowhere with $1B+ market cap. Coins older than 5 years are considered garbage. If you don't make 100x returns under a year, forget about that coin.

Crypto is a sad bunch of rudely awakened dreamers, I have to concur. No one believes in crypto store of value or means of exchange anymore. Governments turned out to be overpowered and unbeatable. Even that guy XMR2020 who was hyper-bullish on Monero, changed his Moon/Global adoption target to 2030 or never, whatever happens first.

So in all fairness, I decided to educate myself. I have now spent 30 minutes looking into this guys account, his post history a decade ago, and his post history in the past year. It is not exhaustive research, but I think is a fair light weight, high level analysis and helps to balance this post validating and providing credence to this youtuber.

Davincij15 was extremely prescient in 2011. He also talked about Ripple in 2015, and appeared to be interested in the technology, and was very objective and avoided specific price predictions. 

More recently however, he is making wildly subjective price prediction videos, like this one 9 months ago where he states Bitcoin was going to $15,000 ‚Äòimminently‚Äô: https://youtu.be/5zjkdqqu35w

Comparing his video from nearly a decade ago to the one posted previously in the daily is comparing apples to oranges. His previous videos he stated he did not know the price movement one could anticipate, but that at the current price, it seems undervalued. This video from even 2 years ago seems objective, he thinks another bubble will happen, doesn‚Äôt know when or to what magnitude, but believes value will increase: https://youtu.be/boutqoS0YaE

He is now posting videos predicting price increases in a very short period of time, that other cryptos will 100x and posting alongside other ‚Äòcringey‚Äô youtubers that use titles that look like ‚ÄòINSAAANEEE!!! BITCOIN BREAKOUT TO PRICE IMMINENT &amp; ALTCOIN 100X‚Äô.

So cue up 2020, the economy is suddenly collapsing‚Äîwe are well into the information wars, and now we are in the beginning stages of the currency wars. Covid hits the US, Congress passes the CARES Act, and suddenly the administration has $500 billion to be spent however they see fit, and they aren‚Äôt going to tell us where the money is going. 

So at first I was like any other person‚Äî‚Äúoh, they fired the watchdog committee, this is an obvious sign of corruption, they must just be pocketing the money‚Äù. But what if they are just using that half a trillion dollars in liquidity to continue to manipulate markets around the world‚Äîincluding bitcoin?

Because even if this is all insane, and I‚Äôm completely wrong, it seems like no one stands to benefit more from bitcoin having the same ceiling as the SPX. Trump has said he hates cryptocurrencies. Central banks have really never been more threatened by them than this year, when they are forced by circumstance to turn on their printers to save their people. 

How do they keep bitcoin from going to the moon, especially after the halving? By trying to get everyone else to make the correlation stick. It‚Äôs a small price to pay now.

fvwvcvy,palacechalice,3,"The thing that really strikes me about this order is Bloom doesn't seem to even attempt to evaluate the evidence. In that way, it's very conspicuously different from other rulings during this case. She recounts almost all of the arguments, but she only opines on a few bits (more on this later). Then she says:

&gt; Importantly, virtually all of the concerns raised as to the evidentiary matters at hand are fact-intensive, context-based, and require credibility determinations to resolve. They also rest on the Court making factual determinations that ultimately affect issues that go to the heart of this case. In other words, while the underlying determinations presented in the Motion ordinarily reside squarely within the provenance of a jury to decide at trial, Plaintiffs instead present them to the Court to sort out.

Indeed, the plaintiff's evidence is fact-intensive and comprehensive, but it is also mostly uncontested. Quite often, the defendant's response amounted to ""this was forged before the litigation started so the defendant isn't responsible for the fact it's forged"" (which, by the way, wasn't true for all the forgeries; some were provably forged for this litigation); they never really rebutted most of the evidence.

By handwaving away the plaintiff's evidence, she's essentially punishing the plaintiff for doing their job really well. I guess they should've stuck to a few key points and ignored the rest so Bloom wouldn't feel overwhelmed!

And what about the evidence Bloom did evaluate. Let's go point-by-point:

&gt; Plaintiffs also assert that Defendant produced fabricated evidence during the course of this action, but Defendant counters that he has produced nearly two million pages of documents

Um, that doesn't sound like a counter. Why would producing 2 million documents excuse producing forged documents? Maybe the reasoning is that there are so many documents, some are bound to be forged?

Furthermore, the plaintiffs are entitled to the documents they are entitled to after agreeing on keyword searches over a year ago -- let's not pat the defense on the back for producing the documents that they were legally required to. In fact, from following this case, I've gotten the picture that the defense often produced large volumes of irrelevant documents (that don't seem to come from any keyword search they agreed to) to hide important ones.

&gt; Similarly, although Plaintiffs challenge the veracity of the family law settlement, the Tulip Trust III,  the  W&amp;K  operating  agreement,  bitmessages,  the  CSW  Filed  List,  and  other  documents, Defendant points to deficiencies in Plaintiffs‚Äô characterizations of the evidence  and the claimed inconsistencies. Id.at 17-25

I checked her citation ranging 9 pages of the defendant's response. I have no clue what she is referring to with ""deficiencies in Plaintiffs' characterizations"". This is among the most egregious handwaving I've ever seen. She entirely fails to acknowledge evidence that the ""family law settlement, the Tulip Trust III,  the  W&amp;K  operating  agreement,  bitmessages,  the  CSW  Filed  List,  and  other  documents"" are forged with this tiny little paragraph. Each one of these accusations was backed by unimpeachable evidence (with the _possible_ exception of the family law settlement"") -- cryptographic evidence quite often, and she just ignores it.

To bolster her reasoning that most of these matters are for the jury to decide and not the judge, she quotes another case:

&gt; And ‚Äúperjury and  fabricated evidence do not constitute fraud upon the court, because they ‚Äòare evils that can and should be exposed at trial.‚Äô‚Äù

How in the world are the plaintiffs supposed to bring this up to the jury at the trial? The jury doesn't care about what happened during discovery. Do the plaintiffs just tack onto their closing arguments, ""oh by the way, the defendant forged hundreds of documents, forced us to spend several months of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire expert witnesses in case they use them at trial; they tried to get the suit dismissed four separate times with forgeries; we still don't know what Craig's actual bitcoin holdings are and can't trace them which is pretty important to our case to prove damages.

fvzznyv,spit-evil-olive-tips,6,"First you want to understand the original problem blockchain &amp; bitcoin were trying to solve.

If I hand you cash, that's a *two-party* financial transaction. Just me and you. If I use a credit or debit card, or a check, or Venmo, or whatever, that's a *three-party* (or more) transaction. Companies get involved, paper trails get created, etc. So it's obvious why anyone buying &amp; selling drugs, or anything else like that, prefers two-party transactions.

Pre-Bitcoin, two-party financial transactions on the internet were basically impossible. If I hand you a $20 bill, you know that I no longer have possession of the bill, so I can't spend it again. That doesn't work on the internet. If I had some way of emailing you a file representing a virtual $20 bill, there'd be nothing stopping me from emailing the same file to someone else. This is called the double-spending problem. So pre-Bitcoin pretty much everything on the internet was a three-party transaction, involving an intermediary like Paypal.

The idea behind blockchain is that it creates a permanent &amp; unchangeable public ledger. In order to send you $20 worth of Bitcoin, I have to publicly announce it, and it gets written into a ledger in a way that it can't be taken back. And the ledger records the equivalent of the serial number of the $20. So I can't double-spend that $20 because the 2nd recipient of it can detect that I already spent it once and it doesn't belong to me anymore. It's not *really* a two-party transaction, because there's a ton of other parties involved (every miner in the Bitcoin network), but it has the ability to be mostly-sorta-untraceable-if-you-do-it-right the way cash does.

That's the gist of it. There's a bunch more problems around making sure transaction records are sufficiently anonymized (because they're public and need to be, forever, for the system to work), the cryptographic details of the proof-of-work scheme, the ridiculous goddamn electricity usage, the artificial ""exchange rate"" between USD and Bitcoin, etc etc. Plus the ridiculous degree to which techbros think you can sprinkle blockchain fairy dust onto any problem and solve it.",2020-06-26 06:53:25

fw01728,mkgll,5,"I agree with BSV and BTC. I think the BCH \*ideal\* is as you described, and I also think it rarely lives up to it these days like it has in the past.

1/ r/BTC has had crypto purity checker bots for over a year now to flag you if you post in a BSV subreddit. That's not 'censorship,' strictly speaking, but it's manipulative and has a chilling effect of preventing people from discussing certain things on this subreddit or from listening to ideas in other forums.

2/ The most popular BCH Telegram groups censor and delete content all the time. I have seen videos that criticized SV heavily get removed because it also said a few nice things about SV. That's not a sign of a healthy community open to ideas.

3/ Steve Patterson‚Äîone example among money‚Äîwas scheduled to debate BCH vs BTC on the Hotep Jesus Show and a group of \*well known\* BCHers, who I won't name here, emailed and harassed Hotep to have him removed from the show. Hotep later reinvited Steve for another show once he realized how crazy this all was.

4/ Blocksize caps and central planning of use cases are the worst form of censorship because they prevent certain business models from developing. Most of the important developers in BCH have made clear that, for example, people who want to use the chain for data usages should look elsewhere. And so projects like Satoshi Dice have posted they are considering leaving BCH and projects like [Memo.Cash](https://Memo.Cash) have said they don't necessarily see a future for them on BCH.

5/ Prior to the IFP disaster, several individuals involved in BOTH ABC and BCHN organized a core-style ""enemies of Bitcoin Cash"" list that was passed around on Telegram, on Twitter and in Reddit comments. Later when the IFP was opposed, the same thing was done towards opposition and continues to be done today.

There are many more examples.

In some ways, none of this is on the level of SV lawsuits against developers and businesses or BTC trolling, doxxing, harassment, lawsuits, threats, sockpuppetry, censorship, information manipulation, DDossing, lying, etc etc etc etc.

In other ways, as someone who has been involved in Bitcoin Cash since the beginning, its sad and frustrating, and it feels like the slope is downhill from here and many of the standards we once had for discussions have been watered down to the point of non-existence.",2020-06-26 07:06:33

Lots of different projects show good promise but Crypto is kind of in the early pilot phase right now. Its showing promise and it has the foundations being laid in place but we need people to adopt the technology by developing on top of it. Its still reserved for those quite technical and hasn't become mainstream but it is getting there. 

How many people would have heard of Bitcoin of Ethereum 10 years ago? 

Do you think the Internet was cool 10 years into its development cycle? We have taken a long time to get to the richness in functionality that you have available on even your mobile phone these days. If a big project rushes development they may not get a second chance so by nature they can take some time to deploy new changes. It also isn't like we have a lot of history and examples to follow in this space. It seems like everyday there is news coming out showing where a different project is doing something new. 

A lot of people are not patient enough and want the finished perfect product right now. It's going to take time to get there and actually probably won't get there until new innovators join the space. How Crypto is used in 50 years time is going to be drastically different than how it exists today.

Cardano ADA is going to redefine this entire space. With Shelly ADA will be instantly one of the most decentralised cryptocurrencies. Many times more decentralised than bitcoin itself. Then comes smart contracts by end of year meaning it will more than rival Ethereum. Voltaire which adds a treasury and community voting system allows the network to fully fund itself for future upgrades is also on track for end of year.

The tech behind it will be the best in the industry and is fully peer reviewed and independently audited by third parties. Meaning I'd expect this is where government and institutional money will flow. Coinbase listing is almost definitely coming shorty after release of shelly too etc etc etc. The three entities behind Cardano are huge and constantly working so there is far too much to going on to mention here so please do yourself a favour and explore it or miss the boat.

fwaet57,Imnotusuallysexist,1,"Maybe so, but I'm sure as hell enjoying ilthe illusion.

Nobody is going to replace money, we'd have to go back to pigs and chickens in baskets.... Fiat currency is just too powerful of a tool of social control. But it is going to change.  

No amount of wishing will make people continue to use a tool that burns them, when a tooll that makes life better for them and does the same job is at hand.

  Crypto has a long way to go to be that tool for most people, but every day bitcoin is worth more than zero,  it gets a little closer.

The whole covid thing has opened up a lot of eyes to the false assumptions thay have had about the way the world works.

 Most will go back to being drones, of course... But some won't... And the ones that don't are the ones to watch, ultimately.

 As much as this is serving to be the ""reset"" that global banking has craved, I think in the end it will hurt them more than they understand. Not financially, of course, but when people believe less in the lies you tell them, the costs are often incalculable. 

If you are in the position you claim to be, there's no downside to going over early. You'll be there one day anyway, if you live long enough.

 If you've got a lot of money, you know how much of a pain in the ass it can be to move, how it restricts your freedom, the burden it entails, and the useless inertia it creates.

You can change a lot of that for yourself, if you want.

Don't be a fool. You should at least have a few toes in the pool, never hurts to be early to the table.",2020-06-29 03:32:31

fweacyq,brianddk,4,"Best depends on your interests.

* Trezor if your a open-source maximalist
* Ledger if your an appleophile
* Coldcard if your are a bitcoin maximalist
* KeepKey if you are willing to sacrifice privacy to save money

Here's the price chart

* KeepKey $50 - Promo for $10 (80% off) if you KYC with their exchange
* Trezor-1 $55 - Provides Deterministic builds (max open-source)
* Ledger-S $60 - Provides ""Secure Element"" (SE), ***mostly*** open source
* Ledger-X $120 - Provides ""Secure Element"" (SE), ***mostly*** open source
* ColdCard $120 - Provides SE, and source, but cannot verify builds 
* Trezor-T $160 - Provides Deterministic builds (max open-source)

All of these work with Electrum.  I'd consider Electrum the best wallet SW to use either with or without a HW-wallet.  

If you use altcoins, you'll have to RTFM to determine which hw-wallets work with which alts.",2020-06-30 04:11:51
fwevhfo,andrew31g,4,This statement makes me feel like you haven't done enough reading about Bitcoin and the infrastructure that is currently being built around it. Someone screenshot this so that we can send it back to this person later! Lol,2020-06-30 07:02:28
fweb2fm,paoloaga,4,"Every sane person would notice that:

BTC can't scale and it's unusable with 1 MB blocks.

LN is bugged and there are many ways to lose money.

Liquid is bugged and/or has backdoors.

Segwit introduced a lot of complexity and poisoned the chain and it already presented a bug.

BTC was already working well. The blocksize increase would have been seamless. This is why BCH exists, to preserve Bitcoin from corrupt people and bloated code. This is why I believe in adoption and in success in the longer term.",2020-06-30 04:17:26

fwffj9z,CryptoMatttt,4,"Bitcoin is free money. You don't need to be 18 in order to interact with Bitcoin directly. But the caveat is that many exchanges (especially those in the USA) that are used to cash out or buy-in are required by law to know their customer, meaning you will have to submit valid ID, bank info, and be 18+. This means you may have some difficulty cashing out to USD if that is your aim.

What you could do is start mining now and start to accumulate some coin. Hopefully, the BTC you make will go up in value over the next few years, then when you are 18 you can cash out for a new PC or whatever you want to buy. Holding the BTC will be more beneficial in the long term anyway if history tells us anything.",2020-06-30 10:03:33

fwfpjl8,Leroy--Brown,4,"People here respond with their short answers and don't understand the fundamentals of asset classes.

Google asset classes.

Art is in the same asset class as gold, Bitcoin, rare metals, antiques/collectibles. It's a speculative asset. The price is not attached to any company's revenue stream, the price is disconnected from any companies debt obligations, and the price is disconnected from any government/central banks central currency. As a speculative asset, it's value isn't tied to anything with underlying fundamentals.

As long as you're ok with the value of your investment being either zero, or 2000x tomorrow, then go for it. Speculative asset prices are only determined at the time of sale, and only determined by psychology.",2020-06-30 11:41:30
