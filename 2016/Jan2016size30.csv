cyhnnsv,evoorhees,57,"It's a reasonable question. The answer is twofold: 1) I came to realize that to the extent any digital asset (and I avoid the term cryptocurrency here intentionally) did something economically useful, it would warrant a value/price and 2) I realized it was unecessarily difficult and unsafe to trade such assets with old school custodial order book exhanges. 

On 1) I realized not all coins were exact clones of Bitcoin. Some were significantly different (and I don't mean just a ""faster block time""). Some were fundamentally different and would thus likely find unique use cases. Therefore there would be a universe of assets, and they deserved frictionless exchange.  On 2) I discovered an elegant way to enable users to trade coins, with no custody and no accounts. Faster and easier and safer.... thus a business opportunity. And to be able to do it without banks and fiat entirely? And to nurture both the transparency of Bitcoin (all of our txs are visible on homepage) and the privacy which is a right of all humans (no accounts or personal info required)...  Match made in heaven. 

So did I change my mind on alts? Yes. That doesn't mean they are all valid, indeed most are at best experiments and at worst half assed attempts for pump and dumps. Some are valuable though, and beneficial to this industry we are building. They should be judged individually on their merits. I cringe when I hear people refer to the whole body of them as scamcoins. It's lazy bigotry, and often perpetrated by those who aren't confident deep down about Bitcoin itself, which isn't an affliction from which I suffer.

And do I hope to make tons of profits by building a business on these observations? Hells yes. ",2016-01-01 05:54:38

cyhd2jw,SirEDCaLot,32,"Hi Amanda!

I warn you I've been up for more than 24hrs so this may be a bit disjointed...

1. Yes.  BIP101, if adopted, increases the block size limit in several steps.  Bitcoin Unlimited by default does not have a block size limit.  Therefore it will be compatible with whatever larger blocks BIP101 creates.  

2. If by support you mean 'works with' (not 'shows support for') then yes.  A Bitcoin Unlimited node with its max block size set to 8MB or above will accept any blocks created by BIP101 in the first two years.  In 2018, BIP101 raises the max block size to 32MB, and doubles every 2 years after that.  
It's worth noting that this is the MAX block size, not how big the blocks actually are.  How big the block actually is depends on how many transactions there are to go in it.  Right now blocks are around 900KB.  If we raised the max block size to 50GB tomorrow, blocks would still be 900KB because that's all the transactions there are.  

3. The fork requires 750 of the last 1000 *blocks* to be tagged as supporting BIP101 (that's about 1 week worth of blocks).  This has nothing to do with nodes, only miners.  So if we could persuade a few of the big Chinese mining pools to adopt BIP101, that could make BIP101 activate.  Running a BIP101 *node* doesn't actually help things, but it does show community support for BIP101.  If the miners see a majority of the community running BIP101 they are more likely to support it themselves.  

4. The fork will happen once a. BIP101 activates, and b. the first block &gt;1MB is mined.  At that point all Core nodes and miners will reject the &gt;1MB block and keep mining on top of the previous block, while all BIP101 nodes and miners will accept the BIP101 block and start mining on top of it.  The blockchain forks into two new chains.  See the right side of [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/qgkzCjR.jpg) (but ignore the left please).  The two chains will still try to relay transactions to each other, but they will grow further apart over time.  
Now at this point, the Core chain will only have 25% of it's normal hash power (due to only 25% of the miners working on it) but the difficulty will stay the same.  That means that at 1/4 speed, blocks on the Core chain will only be mined about once every 40 mins, reducing the transaction capacity of the Core chain to 1MB per 40 mins (250KB/10mins).  This chain will quickly become overloaded- only transactions with absurdly high fees will confirm.  Since the difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks, the overload will persist for 1-2 months.  I believe all remaining Core miners will switch to BIP101 in that time and this chain will die.  
With 75% of the hash power and the same difficulty on the BIP101 chain, blocks will come out about once every 13 mins.  With 8MB/13mins capacity, the BIP101 chain will have plenty of space for all transactions.  It will keep working normally and become the official Bitcoin blockchain.
Within about two weeks the difficulty will adjust and it will be back to 10 min blocks, so 8MB/10mins capacity.  

5. You can't vote by node, node votes are a vote of public opinion.  It's voting by blocks mined that has actual effect.  I think if BIP101 is adopted, Bitcoin-Core will have to implement BIP101 fairly quickly.  It remains to be seen how and if the community heals from this whole thing.  It certainly will mean a vote of reduced confidence in the Core developers' roadmap.  

6. No major mining pools have officially switched.  A few community pools have offered a BIP101 node (so individual miners can support BIP101 mining) however these were DDoS attacked for a long time.  That seems to have mostly gone away so we're starting to see them pop up again.  

7. Block height decides the main chain- the chain with more blocks wins.  The exception to this is Core nodes will ignore a chain with &gt;1MB blocks even if it's much bigger, however if BIP101 is adopted that means 75% of the miners are on board which means everybody else will be getting on board quickly.  So to answer the question in a sentence- the chain with more hash power will have more blocks, and the chain with the most blocks is the official chain.  

Now a few other things to consider.

The majority of mining power is in China, and the Great Firewall (GFW) slows down connections into or out of China.  This presents issues since the Bitcoin protocol is currently very inefficient at propagating new blocks when they are mined.  If a block takes too long to propagate it risks being orphaned- one-upped by another block or two mined by another miner.  An orphan block ceases to exist, and the miner that mined it doesn't get a reward, so they try to avoid that.  Miners can and do cap the size of the blocks they create, separately from the hard coded block size limit.  

At Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong, Jonathan Toomim (/u/jtoomim) gave a great talk on block size propagation.  The conclusion was that today the network is ready for blocks of 2-3MB size.  Now that shouldn't preclude increasing the cap to 8MB (with BIP101), because remember the blocks will only be as big as there are transactions to put in them, and we won't have 8MB worth of transactions for quite some time.  

By the time block sizes reach 2-3MB, several improvements (that are being developed now by both Core and XT devs) will greatly improve the efficiency of block size propagation.  Thin blocks are the basic idea- if a node already has the transactions in the block in its mempool, then you don't need to send those transactions again.  Just send the block headers (block signatures and the IDs of the transactions that block contains) and the nodes can then assemble the block without having to be sent all the block's data.  That's a very simplified explanation, but the end result is it could easily double or more the efficiency of block propagation.  With thin blocks, we'd be ready for 8MB blocks once transaction load gets there.  

Hope that helps!  Please feel free to ask or PM if you have any questions!  :)",2016-01-01 00:57:09

The caricature of a room filled with rich fat oligarchs who smoke cigars while laughing at people they have been oppressing, is not the origin of any evil.

In the real world, any bad guy we may hope to *bypass* with Bitcoin (mostly bureaucrats I suppose) acts with at least the same level of ""good intentions"" or ""rights"" as theymos. The only bad thing about them is the fact that they think they know better than those who are subject to their decisions. That is the norm we are acting against, and it is not contingent upon whether they actually know better.

It is important not be mistaken about the fact that the ""hostile hard fork"" in question is describing a situation that happens with the desire of Bitcoin nodes.

If your mind is not automatically made up against the aspirations to herd our node operators into doing what's good for Bitcoin by controlling the information they are subjected to:

* The ability of Bitcoin to hard fork away from any particular set of rules is the only reason we have to trust in its future. Although different in nature, this is equivalent to how the ability to fork makes open source projects worth your trust and dedication. A wide acceptance of the idea that all non-consensus hard forks are hostile will lead to Bitcoin's corruption (if not this time, then next).

* Any protocol development regime that requires tight control of information flow to the node operators is not adequate for Bitcoin, and will inevitably lead to its demise if upheld.

cyiyjdm,SeemedGood,22,"Actually, derivatives were not the main (or even the ancillary) culprit.  The BIS and the Federal Reserve Bank were the main culprits for the crash.

Few people understand that the Basel 2 Banking Accord that was being implemented in 2004-2007 changed the bank capital requirements to HEAVILY incentivize mortgage lending at the expense of traditional corporate lending.  The crux of the regulatory change was to create nearly infinite leverage for mortgage and government lending in order to redirect the flow of high-power money (and its consequent pyramiding) into the more politically favored sectors and away from lending to both large and small businesses.  And just to reinforce the point the regulators increased the capital requirements for corporate lending at the same time, thereby further restricting capital flow and leverage in those sectors.

The ostensible reasoning behind this move was to reduce the moderate default probability idiosyncratic risk on bank books at the expense of increasing the low default probability systemic risk.  

As early as 2004 those of us who were having our businesses shrunk in this way argued that reducing idiosyncratic risk at relatively low leverage ratios, in order to increase systemic (correlation) risk at MASSIVELY higher leverage ratios, all for the effect of achieving cheap lending to governments and poor people (less productive sectors of society), was both stupid and dangerous.  I know this because along with a small group of others being affected I made this argument to the CEO of a large international investment bank in early 2005 as Basel 2 was being implemented and capital was being withdrawn from my lending business and shifted to ridiculously bad mortgage lending.

His response was to acknowledge the difficulties with that transition and then say ""...but these are the new regs and there's nothing we can do about that.  If we don't do this, there's no way we can hit our ROE targets.""  I left the meeting, called my realtor, and put my house on the market - two years early.

The house sold the first weekend for almost twice what I paid for just prior to G'spans last rate cut hurrahs.  I took a lot of crap from my colleagues about selling for the next two years until we all got back from the ASF conference in Vegas featured in the movie - that stuff really happened, and Mark (not his real name) actually did stand up in that Option One meeting and ask that question and then take the phone call.  Right after we got back the end really got rolling.  Unfortunately it was illegal for me to short.

Derivatives were not the cause of the crisis, the FIAT nature of the global currencies and their regulation by the central banks and governments were the cause of the crisis.  In this last case you can specifically point to Greenspan era Fed monetary policy and Basel 2 regs.

While derivatives of Bitcoin are possible, the shenanigans with monetary policy and using regulation to pyramid monetary creation in politically favored sectors is not possible.  And thus Bitcoin as a global monetary standard WOULD CERTAINLY prevent a repeat of that last crisis or anything like it.",2016-01-02 12:56:36

* Increase our software coverage by releasing a new wallet for iOS devices (LoafWallet) and improve existing ones (Android and Electrum).
* Release Litecoin Core 0.12 which will feature block pruning, memory usage optimization, Tor stream isolation support and Tor hidden service support, improved signature validation using libsecp256k1, network performance improvements and additions (like ZMQ notifications) and many other changes. This will be a major release.
* Add support for version bits (BIP9) which allows rolling out multiple soft-forks at once instead of doing them sequentially. This will rapidly accelerate the roll out of new features.
* Add support for relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers. (BIP68 and BIP112)
* Add support for Segregated Witness. 
* Change P2SH address prefix to prevent confusion between Litecoin and Bitcoin addresses. This will require a hard fork and we would like to include any other changes which require a hard fork at the same time.
* Add support for cross-chain atomic transfers.
* Create a Litecoin sidechain to try out new opcodes, confidential transactions and other innovations.
* Add support for the Lightning network protocol.

cyip5mg,Capt_Roger_Murdock,14,"&gt;We don't want Core (or anyone else) deciding this for us.

Even more fundamentally, Core never had that power. Bitcoin, by its very nature, will always be defined by the code people choose to run and the version of the ledger that people choose to value. All ""the Core devs"" could ever do was provide a *suggested* Schelling point about which consensus *might* form. For a long time, the Schelling point they provided with respect to the block size limit was sufficiently acceptable to a large enough segment of the Bitcoin network to earn this consensus (i.e., when that limit was well above actual transactional demand). Those days are clearly numbered. All Bitcoin Unlimited does is remind us who was really in control of Bitcoin all along (the market) by removing an [""inconvenience barrier""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ykwac/i_just_submitted_a_bip_that_would_allow_users_to/cyesiw8) that artificially strengthened the Schelling point defined by Core's recommendations.

A block size is nothing more than a ""production quota"", and Economics 101 will tell you that production quotas decrease market efficiency and result in less supplier profit. That's because you are limiting the market mechanisms of block space.

**The larger the block cap is, the stronger fee market there is. A fee market is NEVER created by artificially hard-capping blocks, because instead of users bid higher and higher, users will simply stop bidding altogether and use something else.** This results in less demand, and users won't pay more than they have to, resulting in the worst fee market.

There ARE valid reasons for limiting the block size, like centralization concerns. The block cap should be the highest that is acceptable for centralization; fee market plays nothing into this. **Smaller blocks do not create a bigger fee market.**

cykavp0,killerstorm,28,"&gt; Luckily, bitcoin has a built in upgrade mechanism with an elegant design. If a majority of bitcoin miners “vote” for a particular upgrade then by definition this is the new version of bitcoin. 

This is absolutely NOT true. Miners do not control the Bitcoin protocol.

If miners decide to increase block subsidy from 25 BTC to 50 BTC, nodes will simply ignore those blocks as invalid. Even if 99% of miners ""vote"" for this, it still won't matter.

In reality, **Bitcoin is governed by economic incentives**. It is similar to a system of checks and balances. Neither users nor miners can unilaterally change the Bitcoin protocol:

 * If miners change the protocol the use in a backward-incompatible ways, their coins won't be recognized by users, particularly they can't be traded on exchanges, and thus they'll be losing money (as they still have to pay for electricity).
 * If users change the protocol, they will no longer be protected by the hashpower, and might suffer from attacks.

Miners and users (which include merchants, exchanges, payment processors and ordinary users holding bitcoins) must cooperate with each other if they wish to change the protocol.

&gt; Although Coinbase is not a miner (the only real “vote” we have is perhaps in the court of public opinion), 

Exchanges like Coinbase have tremendous influence as they can control which coins are traded and thus which ones have value. It also represents millions of users.

I find it really sad that CEO of a large Bitcoin company is so clueless. It is pretty much Bitcoin 101. When somebody learns about Bitcoin, he asks ""so it's controlled by miners?"" and people explain that no, miners have to obey the rules just like everyone else.

cykgtk9,Halfhand84,39,"Great read, thanks for sharing.  

&gt; So [in the past year] the block size doubled and the number of full nodes fell by 6%. Can we use this as a proxy for what will happen if we raise the block size more? Maybe. **There could be other factors which impact the number of bitcoin nodes such as the &gt;&gt; price of bitcoin &lt;&lt;**

The problem of a shrinking node ecosysyem is illusory, temporary. A problem of chronomyopia. I've said it before and I'll say it again, understanding Bitcoin is made far more difficult when your predictions fail to **assume** an exponential increase in demand. Mining will become far more profitable just after any price boom, a mining economy [= many new nodes] can spring up out of thin air as real value is ""created"" (read: siphoned from fiat) from suddenly surging demand. 

This is precisely what I mean when I say Bitcoin is a financial singularity - in this analogy national fiat currencies are massive and ancient stars - full of mass (wealth) waiting to be extracted by a network that has already siphoned 6 billion USD from them in the first six years of existence.

&gt; But why are you so certain Bitcoin is a financial singularity?

Bitcoin is a software protocol, organic, adaptive. [In a way, very much alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaPgfErzeu0). My premise is a simple one: As humanity gets better at computer science, mathematics, cryptography, network engineering, and so on - Bitcoin also gets better as a currency - because *we'll be better at engineering it*. In retrospect it seems to me that there was a tremendous lack of focus on ""civil cryptography"" before Bitcoin created this new financial incentive. 

&gt; One could even make the argument that raising the block size would allow bitcoin to scale to Paypal or Visa levels and cause an increased interest in bitcoin leading to more nodes. **What if every bank and accounting firm needed to start running a bitcoin node?**

I see BU as a pretty mundane thing, really: the major Schelling points for consensus are going to be whatever Core recommends (1MB+Segwit?), whatever XT recommends (BIP101), and maybe some other number/BIP supported by a bunch of miners and industry groups. I think ~99% of miners/nodes will just be choosing from among these two or three options in the dropdown menu in BU.

*Just as they do now*, people are going to set up their nodes/miners to jive with the emerging consensus. Unlike now, they won't have to choose Core vs. XT to do that. They'll just take two seconds to change a GUI menu setting. More importantly, *their choice won't be tied to a specific dev team*. 

BU let's users get their secure codebase from the Core team even while taking their blocksize recommendations from the XT team, for example. That's the real significance of BU, as I see it.

The traditional banking partners that Cryptsy needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy.

And it makes a lot of sense. Every miner for example has a unique inner and outer network in terms of bandwidth and restrictions. Smaller blocks may be best for some while higher capacity  networks can handle bigger ones. At some point these market forces will emerge a generally accepted block size that most of the network can agree on where only a small minority of blocks are orphaned, somewhere between the high capacity bandwidth and low.

This in fact is how Bitcoin has already worked so far. It is only now that blocks are starting to hit that upper limit, and Satoshi himself said the limit was to be removed some day once SPV clients were prominent and the risk of high spam were eliminated. The time is now to allow Bitcoin to keep operating the way it was designed. Doing anything else is is against the founding vision of Bitcoin.

Core wants to make it artificial by capping the maximum size regardless of your network capacity. That means artificial fee structure and a non-free market. That is unacceptable.

Valid fee bearing transactions which are not confirmed for days is a sign of a broken network in a pathological state.

RBF has only one purpose, and it is not unsticking stalled transactions. The only purpose for RBF is to support an auction house eBay style bidding war fee market in a highly and artificially constrained network.

RBF is intentionally designed to destroy bitcoin as a payment network. Period.

The only time RBF makes sense is if **in the future** nearly 100% of all payment transactions are being handled by layer-2 networks then and, only then, would RBF be an appropriate BIP.  However, today, when bitcoin is in its infancy and one of it's primary use cases is as an irreversible electronic cash system, adding RBF today would hurt bitcoin irrevocably.

Pushing a 'feature' which intentionally destroys the bitcoin network as a payment system **before** any viable layer-2 networks exist to offload payment transactions is simply sabotage at this point.

Benefit of the doubt...let's say the inventors of RBF thought it was a creative solution to an actual problem.  Well, guess what, the community has spoken and they don't want it.  If it is not removed from core, the community will simply switch to a client which does not have this 'feature' of destroying bitcoin as a payment network.

A vendor can choose to not accept RBF-tagged transactions. Any wallet implementing RBF would be stupid to put it as a default (instead, if it rolls out, I imagine there would be a check box for ""transaction can be reversed before first confirmation?""

""Interesting. This isn't just a decentralized marketplace, there seems to be something bigger going on. If you look closely at the screenshots, you will see there seems to be a social integration within it too. Notice there is the ability to follow stores. I'd imagine that would mean there will be a feed to consume all the new items and content from the stores you're following too. This isn't going to be the application you pop in to buy something once a month with Bitcoin, it's going to be a social platform with commerce layered in that you visit every day.

This seems like what every artist, social media star, author, photographer, musician, etc needs. Build a strong following, post an update of a new song, content or anything and people can pay to play/read it right away. New types of pay to read blogs will likely start to emerge in the market. New social media stars will emerge by creating edgy stores where people can pay them to do/draw/write/sing/play/cook/photograph/wear/eat certain things. A new social channel will come to life and the content and stores will be like something we've never seen on the internet before. It's going to be very very interesting people.

cyodc7s,SeemedGood,18,"I think what you really mean to say is that Bitcoin is designed to be money as opposed to just a currency and actually be(come) a unit of account.

The qualities which make a money useful (and therefore have value to us) have little to do with whether that money is inherently ""backed"" by some other good or not.  The concept of money being ""backed"" by some other good arises from a deficiency of some forms of currency (paper for example) that have a very low marginal cost of production.

If a currency has a low or non-existent marginal cost of production, then it will make a very bad money in and of itself, because the market will have the tendency to overproduce it.  That is to say that like any other good the market will produce it until its price (value) equals its marginal cost of production.  If the currency is not ""backed"" by some good which has a significant marginal cost of production (and thus acts as the actual money which the currency just represents) that currency will eventually become worthless.

So ""backing"" really just means that the currency is not itself acting as the money but rather just representing some other good which requires a productivity input to create. 

Bitcoin avoids that whole mess because it does actually have a significant marginal cost of production (computer resources and electricity).  Like physical gold mining, mining Bitcoin has a marginal cost structure and mining the next 10 units of bitcoin costs roughly 10x as much as mining the next single unit.  This means that it can act as both a currency and a good money simultaneously, which would allow it to become a very good unit of account and exchange - certainly one that is FAR superior to anything we commonly use now.

cyo8t9w,Anonobreadl,16,"&gt; Many people believe that Bitcoin is inherently less efficient than centralized payment networks like Visa and MasterCard. It isn’t. When comparing Bitcoin with these systems, people typically point out there is a lot of waste and inefficiency because you have so many nodes performing redundant work. But it’s not required that we have lots of nodes validating transactions.

Heard of **PRISM**? Funny thing - it turns out, the US government can trivially coerce the largest US tech companies to take actions *directly against* their users' wishes. This would include spying on them and hijacking their data without their consent.

Imagine what utter havoc would be wreaked on the Bitcoin system if the US government got their wish, and we had no more than a few dozen Corporations running all the nodes? Would Bitcoin continue to be permissionless through the years? Would development be any *less* centralized? The answer to these questions is an emphatic NO.

By advocating a future where we have 35 some odd nodes for the entire world, presumably owned by no more than 35 megacorps, you're advocating to put Bitcoin's backbone precariously under the thumb of the government.

&gt; Bitcoin would work perfectly well if only one node was validating transactions and building the block chain

And who owns that node? For crying out loud, if we only had one node, we only have ONE Corporation in a datacenter determining what is and what isn't the longest valid chain. WTF kind of network is that?

&gt; There are only as many nodes on the Bitcoin network as there is demand to perform independent and trust-less validation of transactions

What are you talking about? Have you *never before* wanted to check your BTC balances in perfect privacy? Have you *never before* wanted to accept payments in perfect privacy?

Guess what - you need a full node to accomplish these things. You can't manage it over Tor - you need to do it by making zero remote network connections for perfect privacy.

&gt; In the degenerate case of only one centralized node, which is most comparable to the legacy card networks, Bitcoin is probably more efficient.

Astounding.

&gt; The more widely used and significant Bitcoin becomes, the more people and companies will have a need to perform their own, independent transaction verification.

BitpayStephen, how incredibly disingenous of you. As you surely know, most BTC-accepting merchants *already* do the lazy thing, and just contract that function out to BitPay or Coinbase.

By preventing us - the people of Bitcoin - from operating full nodes of our own, you eliminate our ability to do this independent from a Corporation like your own. For example, if it takes 6 weeks and $10,000 to spin up a new node, 99.99999% of merchants are going to take the lazy route of trusting Bitpay or Coinbase with that function.

What does this do to privacy? Autonomy? How does this affect which products people are comfortable *buying* with BTC? Do you want Bitpay or Coinbase to figure out what you're spending all of your BTC on?

Regardless, this vision advocated by you BitpayStephen is certainly good for Bitpay's revenue! Thanks!",2016-01-07 02:44:04

Longer Answer: Altcoins are a very important part of the cryptocurrency world, for a few reasons:

**Altcoins provide competition for Bitcoin.** If there were no altcoins, Bitcoin could very quickly become stagnate, with an air of entitlement. With the existence of altcoins, however, not only does Bitcoin have to compete with government-issued currencies, but also with other cryptocurrencies. This forces Bitcoin to adapt to market conditions or die.

**Altcoins allow for experimentation.** We have only seen the tip of the iceberg in regards to what cryptocurrencies can do. However, with a multi-billion dollar marketcap, Bitcoin can't afford to be a testbed for every new innovative idea. Altcoins can provide that testbed.

**Altcoins provide for niche solutions.** Imagine a small country or community that wants to have its own currency. They might have certain economic views that aren't completely consistent with Bitcoin, but they can easily create their own altcoin and use it as their own currency. 

These are just a few reasons off the top of my head. Remember, Satoshi didn't just create Bitcoin, he created the modern cryptocurrency.

cyr80mp,MightyColin,36,"You get in my car, I drive you to your destination and at the end I say ""you owe $50"". You hand me your card, I shove it in a machine, hand it to you. You confirm an amount, choose an account, enter a code, etc. You hand the machine back to me with your card still stuffed in the bottom, I wait a few seconds while it 'processes' then reach for a print out. I grab the receipt and hand it plus bank card back to you. You stuff the card back in your wallet and struggle your drunk-ass inside for a well deserved puke and sleep after a long night at the company Christmas party.

Sounds normal enough?

You probably wouldn't notice the machine I handed to you looks unlike one you'd seen before, but then when was that last time a cab actually took debit? You have no idea what it's supposed to look like and even if you did, you're not looking too carefully trying hold down 3 too many vodkas+cokes. Likewise, how carefully do you look at the bank card when you get it handed back to you? Looks like a black TD bank card - same as yours - what are the odds the account number or name are different? Who checks that stuff? Is your name even on your card and if not do you have any idea what digits are supposed to be on there?

If you wanted to be a criminal you could 3D print a case, stuff it with a Pic32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi, and have it drive a LED matrix to say ""choose your account, enter pin, confirm amount"" etc. in the usual way and then print out a receipt. It doesn't actually do anything, it's just a prop. Behind the scenes it's storing information to an SD card that you'll read off with a notebook in the glovebox as soon as you get around the corner. Realistically you're looking at about 2 hours worth of design and soldering, an hour of programming, 3 or 4 hours of waiting on a makerbot to print, and about $60 worth of parts to get it all together. You could build a fake debit machine as a Saturday project without any real skill, you just need a bit of time to read tutorials on the web and some creativity to adapt them for your crooked purpose.

I wouldn't be surprised to find out that you could buy one with bitcoin from various dark online markets and have it delivered to a PO Box. If you can buy fake passports, drugs, and guns this isn't a stretch; it's less risky because none of this stuff is going to raise the eyes of a customs agent.

To get a card to swap: you can either steal one to begin with (RBC, TD, CIBC and you've got enough to cover 1/3 Canadians), or sign up for each of the banks and report your card stolen. Maybe borrow some from co-conspirator friends. Either way, once you have a bank card to trade you're set. You swap with your first customer, empty their account, then trade that card you stole to the next person you come across.

The fake cab driver doesn't bill you for the ride; they just grab your number and card then hit the nearest ATM to withdraw everything you've got. Who cares about losing a $50 fare if it yields an $1100 pay-day. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

Even if you notice immediately you'd never get through the robotic 'report-your-card stolen' website/phone-service before you'd been robbed. It's more likely that you won't notice the scam until the next day at the earliest. You were just dropped off at home after a night of drinking: you're done spending and you'll be nursing a hang-over in the morning.

BIP101's limits were set with ""I think the bottleneck will be bandwidth to people's homes"" in mind, and the goal was to address people's concerns that all validation would end up in data centers.

I also assumed that miners would understand the difference between a protocol limit and the actual size of blocks produced.

I was wrong.  The physical bottleneck on the network today is not bandwidth to people's homes, it is the Great Firewall of China. BIP101 would still be fine as a protocol limit... except Peter Todd and others have managed to put enough fear into the miners of some aint-never-gonna-happen-because-nobody-makes-money ""attack scenario"" to make them reject a protocol limit higher than whatever the current (crappy) network protocol can support.

A simple dynamic limit like Stephen proposes is easy to explain, makes it easy for the miners to see that they have ultimate control over the size (as they always have) and takes control away from the developers.



Unfortunately, at least one developer believes it is really important to make miners pay something to make blocks bigger, and has been working on a much more complicated scheme (""flexcap""). I have seen no evidence that developer is ever willing to compromise on anything, and he has a track record of working on complicated solutions to simple problems (he's the founder of the freicoin altcoin, which uses demurrage (complicated) instead of monetary inflation (simple) to make people's money less valuable over time).

One note. Personally, I think the debate over *where* the block size limit should be set is a lot less important than the debate over *how* it should be set.  Most ""small blockers"" claim to support small blocks because they worry that ""big blocks"" are a threat to Bitcoin's ""decentralized"" nature. But to me, the biggest immediate threat to Bitcoin's decentralization is an ""implementation monoculture"" that's effectively allowing a single development team to unilaterally set a controversial economic parameter (an economic parameter that, it's worth noting, was not originally intended to be an economic parameter, but instead a temporary anti-DOS measure). It seems to me that whether we need a block size limit and if so, where it should be set, are two questions that should be answered in a decentralized way by the market (which is why I support the approach proposed by Bitcoin Unlimited).

You nailed it!

The size of a transaction is usually dominated by the signatures that authorize spending each input.  The original idea of Segregated Witnesses was to split blocks and transactions into two records: an ""extension"" record with all the signatures, and a ""main"" record with all the other information.  The main expected advantages were 

1. simple clients who need a block, but do not intend to validate the signatures of every transaction in it, can fetch only the main record, thus saving bandwidth.

2. The 1 MB limit would apply only to the main record size plus a fraction (1/4 in the current proposal) of the extension record size; so the change would increase the capacity of the network

3. the ID of a transaction (txid), that is currently a hash of the whole thing, would be redefined to be a hash of the main record only.  That would fix in one swoop all the sources of transaction malleability.  

    (Currently, a third party can intercept a transaction and, even without access to the private keys, tweak its signatures in such a way that the transaction remains valid but its ID changes.  Such ""transaction malleability"" attacks break many wallets and other software out there, and invalidate chained transactions that use the original txid to refer to its outputs.  Mark Karpelès tried to blame MtGOX withdrawal problems and losses on malleability attacks.  Recently some Russian programmer jammed the bitcoin network for several days with that trick, just for fun.)

4. Other vaguely specified information could be stuffed into the extension record.

I suspect that this proposal has other motivations that Blockstream is not telling.  The Lightning Netvapor seems to require exceedingly complicated signatures, so perhaps SegWit is a way to fit a meaningful number of LN transactions (or even only one) in a block, without raising the holy 1 MB limit.

Pieter Wuille, one of the Blockstream co-founders and one of the Core devs with commit access, said that he had this brilliant idea a few months ago, but put it aside since it would require a hard fork.  But then Luke Jr had another brilliant idea that allowed it to be deployed as a soft fork -- that is, without telling users about it.  

The idea is to redefine another script opcode, that is currently a no-op, to mean ""check the signature in the extension record"".  A transaction that uses the SegWit format will use a script with this opcode in place of each output address.  Then old clients will read that opcode as ""no-op"" and think that the output can be spent by anyone; whereas new clients, and at least 95% of the miners, will know that the spending must be signed in the extension record.

Pieter is enthusiastic and is now pushing the deployment of SegWit at full speed, ignoring all criticisms.   IN particular, he has never explained why the radical reformatting of the blockchain is necessary, given that the same benefits above can be obtained, much more effectively, without any change to the format.   

SegWit will considerably weaken the security of simple clients, and will require extensive changes to any program that requires the signatures, such as block explorers.  It will also allow a weak form of ""reverse malleability"" (changing the signatures of a multisig without changing the txid).  

Just by probabilities, SegWit it certain to have unforeseen consequences and exploits that will not be revealed by Blockstream's tests.  For me, it is the best evidence that the current Core developers are so incompetent that they cannot even suspect that they are incompetent for their job.

cysniqs,ydtm,23,"Upon doing some further forensics investigation (applying unreddit.com to some other controversial /r/bitcoin threads), indications are now starting to come to light that the coverup of ideas and opinions went far beyond merely censoring [""comments of frustration and jabs""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/409kcg/omg_i_just_discovered_unredditcom_it_shows_all/cysmuz0).

Instead, there appears to have been a **systematic attempt on the part of the mods at /r/bitcoin to cover up some of the most important and crucial serious (and persuasive) arguments involved in the debates on scaling and blocksize.**

For example, see this other thread showing some rather shocking ""smoking gun"" evidence regarding the sort of systematic, heavy-handed censorship many of the most important, substantive, and persuasive ideas and proposals in the scaling and blocksize debates.

It is interesting to note that (despite the many months of systematic censorship), many of these important suppressed ideas and proposals did actually go on to become quite accepted and mainstream (as they eventually got re-submitted to other, less-censored sites on the internet), simply due to their sheer persuasiveness (for example, notions about decentralized development, or blocksize as an emergent phenomenon of markets).

We can only guess at the amount of damage done to Bitcoin by the censors at /r/bitcoin who desperately attempted to prevent these important ideas and proposals from even being mentioned.

It is clear, however, that the people engaging in such censorship have inflicted considerable (although hopefully only temporary) harm on Bitcoin as well as on Reddit (as a site considered to be useful for discussion and debate), by keeping most of the community in the dark for many months about what some of the most important Bitcoin thought leaders were actually proposing and discussing.

Ok, so while we hit a new high of $464 yesterday, we did not “break out.”  Instead, today we dropped three boxes to $447.  This reversed our chart into a column of Os.  If the price spikes up over $465 sometime before the end of this 24 hour period, this reversal would be moot and we will break out into a double top.  It could happen, and that is why on the chart I’ve indicated today’s reversal with a grey background.  This is to remind everyone that the reversal is not “official” yet.

Keep in mind a reversal, in and of itself is not a reason to sell or buy.  There are some times when they are—the long poles for example—but this particular one does not seem to have the “drama” associated with it.  That is my term, not an official charting term.  I don’t think anyone would call a drop the likes of which we have seen over the past few days “dramatic.""

A reversal changes a couple of things.  The formation is now ten columns wide.  That is almost a record for bitcoin—at least in recent memory.  What this means is that when the next move (up or down) it should have some “umph” behind it.  I am not making any predictions at this point.

We also change our reversal to a new column at $460.  This would match the previous high column and set up a triple top.  In PnF charts, this is kind of a big deal.  But again, no predictions until we see some movement.

We still have to fall a considerable distance in order to cause a negative break down.  

So, we are still in a consolidation mode.

I apologize for the gun control comment yesterday.  I thought it was kind of funny, but this is not /r/politics.  I will steer from those areas from now on.

Anyway, I should have posted the story about Justin Bieber getting tossed out of a Mayan ruin for being naked.  I think we call all agree, that WAS funny.  And that guy is just “out there somewhere.""

cysqkwe,theymos,18,"I think:

For some time, Satoshi lurked on various cypherpunk mailing lists. It was a little hobby of his, but he wasn't famous or a major participant. One day the idea for Bitcoin came to him. He wasn't sure that it'd work, but he was excited about it, so he thought that he'd give implementing it a try. In the two years that it took him to finish 0.1, new interesting facets of the problem presented themselves, and he was able to solve them. He considered a number of future use-cases, and added support for them to his software. When it all seemed to be working OK, he released it.

You have to understand that the ideas behind Bitcoin are not way out there. All of the crypto already existed, and even the idea of a block chain already largely existed in the form of git. Satoshi didn't need to be a mathematician, cryptographer, or master software engineer to come up with the ideas behind Bitcoin and then implement them. In fact, I think that Satoshi might not have been much of a programmer before building Bitcoin. But he was dedicated and detail-oriented. Maybe he read a good C++ book front-to-back before starting on the coding, and then put real effort into following best practices (with a large amount of success, though some imperfection).

In 2009 Satoshi was probably disappointed that Bitcoin wasn't getting much attention. But when things started picking up in 2010, he enjoyed explaining Bitcoin to people. He liked talking about the technology that he'd spent so much time thinking about and coding.

But then various more difficult problems arose. He didn't have a solid idea for long-term scalablity. He'd always planned to implement SPV in his client, but doing so looked like it'd take some major hacking. He'd had vague plans of auctions &amp; trading systems built into the client, but he couldn't find a good design for these things. Etc. Additionally, he was having to deal more and more with people, which he didn't much enjoy. Some people started to question his technical decisions, making it more difficult for him to make changes, and he couldn't always depend on miners running his code. There was also wikileaks and Gavin's CIA visit. All in all, Satoshi probably felt like he was losing track of the project, and moreover he didn't see anything technology-wise that he particularly wanted to work on; the programming that needed to be done was huge and/or conceptually very difficult (including some things which haven't been settled even today). So he just gradually lost interest. Most people forget that he didn't just completely vanish one day; first he left the forum and only responded via email, then he only responded to a handful of his usual correspondents via email, and finally he stopped responding to even these people.

After his last forum post were he said he was ""venturing into more complex ideas"", I think that this was not some hint that he was quitting Bitcoin and doing something else. I think that sometime after this post he actually did do a lot of work on solving some big technical problem, but failed to really solve it. And then when he looked back at the Bitcoin community, where there were now a few devs (Gavin, Sirius, lazslo, etc.) doing some work, and some real companies/organizations starting to form, he found it too tempting to just leave things alone.",2016-01-10 17:57:36

cys81yd,jtoomim,16,"&gt; In Satoshi's vision there was no such thing as developers setting the capacity, or a 'safe' capacity.

Yeah, I don't like that either. In all fairness, though, Satoshi was the one who implemented the 1 MB cap. He wanted to [increase it](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) eventually. Like maybe 270,000 blocks ago. We're interested in a permanent solution like a flexcap, BU-style stuff, or BitPay's branch, but none of those ideas have consensus yet among both miners and users. I think a 2 MB hard fork in the next few months has consensus, so that's what we're coding now. A more permanent solution can come later.

&gt; In Satoshi's vision, the transaction fee should be sufficient to pay for the marginal cost of adding the transaction to a block. Every transaction that pays such a fee should be processed in the next block, without any artificial capacity limit.

So there's no evidence that your odds of buying stolen goods is higher than eBay, a pawn shop, or any other second-hand seller. Cybercriminals tend to prefer bitcoin, too. 

And those reported instances where g2a keys were revoked for being stolen? They were replaced, but of course this wasn't reported-on.

Scams exist and they would cost g2a money if they felt obligated to refund for every scam, so the insurance compensates for that. People seriously think g2a actually has a way of checking whether a key is valid without redeeming it, so they pretend the insurance is just a scam. But guess what! Every other similar service charges insurance too. It's just built into that fee you pay them and not optional.

Personally, I think digital goods should always require a confirmation. Restaurants and other brick and mortars should use similar heuristics as they would to guard against a hot check or counterfeit bill passer. Or wait until something *like* LN comes along and fixes these problems with a stronger guarantee. 

There is no countermeasures for Finney style double spend (save a block reorg), but it does require a miner's assistance. Other types that don't depend on miner cooperation are a little less likely, but are pretty easy to pull off as well depending on the ""rules"" of the transactions.

&gt; Increasing or removing limits does not increase centralization. Keeping 1MB, on the other hand, very likely will.
&gt; Actual block size (not the limit) can grow only due to increased adoption, which itself will result in much broader decentralization.

18 months ago the world of bitcoin was happy and cohesive. Then it grew. 

Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen thought we should scale bitcoin by increasing the historic cap on the max allowed block size.

Around this time a VC invested $22 million to hire Greg Maxwell, Adam Back, Peter Wuille, Rusty Russel (don't know his real name) and others. This was called 'Blockstream' and their goal was to increase the functionality of bitcoin by adding side chains.

Joseph Poon and his colleague then published the first details of the lightning network.

Short cut a few steps:

The division between 'core developer' and Blockstream employee became very fuzzy. Block stream now insists LN is the way to scale and Adam Back, who had no role in bitcoin until Blockstream, now has a disproportionately large amount of power and thinks we should never increase the block size.

Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen decided to let node users vote on increasing block size by releasing a client called Bitcoin XT, including the BIP101 scaling mechanism.

Our Dear Leader (TM) at /r/bitcoin thought this was dangerous, declared it an alt-coin (it's not) and banned all discussion of it. This banning and censorship continues to this day.

Soon /r/bitcoinXT and /r/bitcoin_uncensored appeared, but now everybody seems to agree /r/btc is the new place for uncensored talk and promotion of all things bitcoin.

TL;DR Everything used to be happy in bitcoin land until big money got involved, Adam Back declared block size increases a no-no and Theymos banned all discussion of XT which would let nodes accept larger blocks. We're all still bitter about the multiple betrayals involved.",2016-01-11 06:57:16

* Mike is clearly sympathetic to government concerns about Bitcoin.

Hence I don't know why anyone who trusts Satoshi would trust Hearn.

Which of these positions is more likely to keep Bitcoin secure from government control?:

* Big block supporters are primarily interested in scaling to accommodate more users via block size NOW and worrying about security issues later.  Arguments are either founded on things Satoshi said years ago, a vague feeling that main-chain transactions should always be ~free for everyone, or a belief that big blocks will increase the number of full nodes on the network [despite making nodes more expensive to operate].

* Small block supporters are primarily interested in keeping Bitcoin secure NOW and worrying about scaling later via more effective means than block size.  Arguments are generally founded on a belief that just raising the block size doesn't accomplish much in terms of scaling vs other - better - approaches and making blocks larger beyond a certain conservative point would generally decrease decentralization because nodes would be more expensive to run, blocks slower to propagate etc.

He can say he's being ""white hat"" all he wants.

But he also has a tendency to be a vengeful little vandal. 

Which probably explains why he didn't just run his little exploit on some testnet, or against some ""dummy"" institution.

Instead, he ran it against an actual financial company duly registered under law in the USA...

...a company which also (incidentally) has been *censored* by Peter Todd's cronies at Core / Blockstream, because it dared to announce that it was considering using code *other than* the code produced by said cronies at Core / Blockstream - which they are desperately trying to force everyone to use by any means necessary (including censorship of major Bitcoin websites such as /r/bitcoin and bitcoin.org) - apparently in order to force people to use their forthcoming products (such as Lightning Network).

---

Open-source is open-source and any company is of course free to appropriate it and modify it and use it as it will. 

But there is something particularly sleazy and unethical (although perhaps not outright illegal) when a company like Blockstream comes along, gets $21 million in funding to buy off a bunch of programmers for an open-source project (and who knows if they paid off Theymos too, to ""control the message"" - he certainly seems to be affiliated with them, although not as a ""dev"") and then proceed to cripple the free/cheap open-source aspects of project so they can drive people into their paid add-ons (while also trying to silence anyone who dares to point out that they're doing all this).

---

Furthermore:

Weren't there some legal cases several where a major corporation was found to be breaking the law, when it punished another company for daring to *not* use its products?

For example, I recall several years ago (probably in the 90s) when certain PC manufacturers / OEMs (eg, Dell, Compaq?) dared to *not* pre-install Microsoft's ""Windows"" operating system - instead installing Linux (and thus avoiding paying the Windows licensing fess to Microsoft, and being able to pass this savings along to their customers).

Microsoft retaliated against those OEMs by doing the following: During the annual run-up to the big retail seasons of September back-to-school and Christmas, Microsoft withheld the new release of Windows from those OEMs, in order to punish them (seriously hurting their bottom line, as these OEMs weren't able to install the newest version of Windows on *any* of their machines).

This was a questionable tactic which seemed borderline legal at the time (after all, Microsoft merely withheld the most recent version of its Windows product from those OEMs, while making this product available to those OEMs' competitors).

However, in the end, Microsoft did actually get taken to court over this - either by Dell, Compaq etc. - or by the US government itself. (I don't recall what the outcome of the case was.)

Apparently the case involved some law where a company can't punish some other company for suddenly deciding *not* to (exclusively) use its products.

The parallels to Coinbase being censored from bitcoin.org (for suddenly deciding to consider *not* to (exclusively) use Blockstream's ""products"") may be merely approximate here, or may even not be applicable legally (I am not a lawyer) - but still, the parallels do seem rather suggestive.

---

I do really think that at *some* point, *someone* from Core / Blockstream is going to ""go to far"".

They reek of hubris and entitlement, and they communicate and operate in a bubble. 

By being in a bubble of censorship, they are becoming more and more out of touch with what the community needs and wants - and they probably are also underestimating how strong their competitors are, and overestimating how strong they themselves are, perhaps often tending towards feeling invulnerable.

In fact, they are very weak, for several reasons:

- They no longer support open communication and decision-making, which can lead to becoming misinformed and fragile

- They have come to rely on certain ""legacy"" benefits which they accidentally inherited - being early incumbents in certain areas (their devs enjoying commit access to Satoshi's Github repo as kindly granted to them by Gavin, their censor and attack-dog Theymos domain-squatting important Bitcoin internet real estate such as /r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org).

But these early-incumbent advantages may also end up making them weak and lazy and reckless - as we might be seeing already with Peter Todd's vindictive and possibly illegal attack defrauding the US financial institution CoinBase.

I want to leave the heavy lifting to people with much more technical competency.   But I do wish to be informed about developments.

Having said that, a couple observations:

- it seems at best a cheap shot and at worst a bit manipulative to call Bitcoin Classic an ""alt coin""  - clearly this is directly related to Bitcoin and arose from the blocksize debate - it reminds me of something a cheesy salesperson would say: ""We sell real aluminum siding, our competitors sell toy plastic siding"" then they proceed to correct you every time you mention it and call it ""toy siding""

- XT and Classic are a lot different than the 100 other also rans and the intent is MUCH different - this is potentially going to be the new Bitcoin - so it's a lot different than pot coin or hobbit coin or whatever

- okay, let's put that argument aside and say that this IS an alt coin - so what?  This is a sub that is designed for people to keep up with Bitcoin news and what is important in the industry -- this is newsworthy -- if Gavin got a job at Hasbro and decided he was going to design Star Wars toys, guess what, that's newsworthy also and people should have the right to see the news and vote up or down - just as some news about Ethereum was relevant - did this sub need to know every detail? Nah, but it's self moderating in many ways -- but at the very least a discussion of related tech, a large crowdsale in Bitcoin etc.

- the votes of the members of a sub are the best measurement of relevance - 171,000 people are on here and more of them upvotes that article than any other one in the time it was up ....so not only did members of this sub think it was relevant -- they thought it was THE MOST RELEVANT - so the main question is:  Is the goal of the mods to serve what the subscribers want from this sub or to put forth an opinion?

- some devs and people passionate about this issue don't care about what the public and CEOs think (a though they still need the miners) - for those who do care I'd say that they do a massive disservice to thier cause by censoring and blocking discussions, calling it an Alt Coin or making statements that seek to discredit some devs

Fact is, there are some damn smart people on both sides of this, there are some huge and important companies on both sides - it's not a decided issue - 

I'd really love to see more and discuss it here - those who dislike Gavin's plans should not fear discussing them and poking holes -- but, like Erik said, the more someone shouts to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, the more it makes a lot of people think that there is a problem with core that people fear to discuss

More importantly than any effect such a small blocksize increase may have on bitcoins scalability is the opportunity to prove that the ""core"" implementation developers do not have complete control over the Bitcoin system.

It MUST be shown that such control is an illusion, that there is no crown to seize, no throne to be usurped, no small group of individuals to be coerced by agents of a nation state.

The post that raised concern of the block size limit to a fever pitch was this one:

https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32

It paints a picture in which:

- there are ""huge"" confirmation times
- nodes' mempools would fill up and cause system crashes, compromising network security
- double spending unconfirmed transactions will become easier
- users will complain about unconfirmed transactions being stuck
- fee-bumping transactions would further overload the memory pool, creating a ""race to the top"" in fees
- SPV wallet users would have no way to gauge what fee to pay
- all of this would generate negative press, discouraging new users and encouraging mass exodus
- the exchange rate would collapse due to outflows
- fees would fall again to an equilibrium level
- ""Bitcoin would survive,"" but with loss of ""momentum""

Keep these predictions in mind as 2016 progresses. This was the year in which it was claimed in no uncertain terms that the block size limit *must* be raised or terrible consequences will result.

We've already had a taste in the second half of 2015 of what happens as blocks approach max capacity for extended periods of time.

So there's a falsifiable claim on the table, and it looks very likely to be put to the test within the next 12 months. Judge for yourself whether last year's tsunami of vitriol and ad hominem attacks was justified by the facts.

cyxllg4,slowmoon,26,"If the blocksize is so important, maybe another cryptocurrency will just grow bigger than bitcoin on the strength of the increased transaction capacity and take bitcoin's crown. People could just start migrating over. I'm serious. I'm not trying to hawk any altcoin so I won't even name one. But if a road is full of cars, isn't it normal to see most cars trying to turn onto a sidestreet? 

Hardcore bitcoiners may never switch, but think about from the perspective of someone who is trying to order his drugs on the dark web when he sees transaction fees for bitcoin are $1.00 per tx and transaction fees for some ""shitcoin"" are $0.01. If the shitcoin has enough liquidity for him to buy and sell it quickly and without much slippage, does he care that he's not using bitcoin? 

So you have the druggies migrate over because their transactions are getting stuck and the fees are too expensive. A few frustrated bitcoin whales dump their coins for that altcoin. A trickle could turn into an avalanche. And then you have a new coin at the top of coinmarketcap and bitcoin will be somewhere in the top 10.  This will get resolved one way or another. With or without bitcoin. 

But yes, I agree that we may miss out on a great opportunity this year. Bitcoin was basically the only asset class that did well last year and this fact was reported on many media outlets.

If you haven't seen it yet, have a look as this early, visionary talk in which Mike lays out many of the programmable money ideas that people are working on today, both in Bitcoin and elsewhere:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA

That said, I'm not sure the article's thesis makes sense. Mike seems to be saying that the Bitcoin experiment failed because the change he was advocating (raising the block size limit) was rejected by the Core team, and by miners. He goes on to imply that Bitcoin is controlled by an oligopoly centered around the Core team.

The article conspicuously glosses over the non-intuitive difference between hard and soft forks. The fact that neither XT nor any hard-forked alternative has been able to gain credible momentum should speak to the difficulty of creating hard forks, DoS attacks notwithstanding. And knowing that certain rules will be nearly impossible to change is a feature for many.

Second, Mike has repeatedly suggested that Bitcoin should be led by an oligopoly of one. So it's ironic to be claiming failure for Bitcoin on the grounds of oligopoly when Mike's stated goal seems to be something even less inclusive.

The discussion of censorship on Bitcointalk and this /r/bitcoin is a red herring. Every forum will maintain its own editorial policies. Nothing stops any Bitcoin user from availing themselves of alternative news outlets and forums, just as nothing prevents them from running a custom node with a new block size limit or installing a distribution that does the same thing.

Maybe - just maybe, the block size limit isn't increasing for reasons that might not mesh well with Mike's thesis.",2016-01-15 08:12:49

There is no core without two of the most seniour developers - Gavin and Jeff. Core is a was and what is now called core is a completely different team with a vision that is fully opposed to keeping bitcoin open and accessible to all or easy to use. 

The current core team instead wishes to create walled gardens through LN bringing in middle men with their gateways and checkins taking away fees from miners and taking away the easy usability from users all for the pleasure of users paying them a fee. 

Moreover, the company currently in control of core has the same business model as R3. They plan to create private blockchains - like liquid - and sell them for a fee to banks, businesses, companies, or even consumers. That is their business model is to create bitranets - similiar to intranets - to compete with the open ledger that is bitcoin. As the interests of open bitcoin and bitranet often are in competition, a team offering such bitranets and in control of bitcoin will necessarily wish to make the open ledger less competitive.

Ergo RBF which kills 0conf transactions while in their liquid bitranet they boast about 0confs as a feature - ergo keeping the open chain from scaling so that the bitranets win by default, etc.

TL;dr There is no core any longer. What was core is now divided into classic and core. Your choice therefore is between a team which abides by the wishes of users, listens to them, shares satoshi's vision and more importantly shares the vision of keeping bitcoin open and accessible to all, a world wide ledger that can be used for smart contracts and a million other things - or you can choose core which is killing 0conf transactions, refuses to listen to users and is controlled by a company that is in direct competition with bitcoin's interest of being open and accessible to all. 

The users have made their choice - so have the most seniour developers.  The miners signed 8mb in blood so to speak, then asked for bip100 - and core simply ignored you.

cz02j38,fireman451,50,"Wow, surprising that Bitcoin would be undone by pure greed.  Also ironic.

There was a possibility in the past that a degenerate situation would occur with the difficulty mining but that passed but this seems much more plausible because all the miners not voting to go to the new thing are acting in their own self-interest which is opposed to the long term sustainability of the whole system.

It has to do with scarcity.  Bitcoin had little scarcity for the miners to profit off of until the blocks started filling up where they relied on the block discovery lottery.  With anther halvening soon (or maybe already occurred?) miners need to find alternative sources of revenue to keep their systems running. To do so, they vote to protect the block size scarcity which would result in an increase of the transaction fees they also profit from.

Pretty funny to see how libertarians are getting hurt by actual rational self interest when the ideal in their head hits the reality of the world.

Perhaps he was a Trojan horse for the banks/regulators for longer than many might think.  When he couldn't get bitcoin to be the system he wanted/needed he quit, slandered it and punched it in the face on the way out the door.

Rational self-interest has collided with preserving the long-term health of bitcoin. And rational self-interest has won.

Bitcoiners, clever captains of industry that they are, couldn't figure out that this was an obvious ponzi scheme, which allowed him to steal what at the time consisted of 7% of all the bitcoins in existence.  

And his name was ""Pirate at 40"", and he ran the ""First Pirate Savings and Trust"", which was apparently not any sort of a clue that maybe he was going to steal all their money.  

Another bit of hilarity about all this:  there were bitcoiners who were insuring deposits with pirateat40, so you could buy insurance on your deposit in case you defaulted.

cz0lfkk,evoorhees,54,"Adam - I appreciate that position. However, the ~2MB soft-fork solution, through SegWit, applies even more significantly to a bitcoin with 2MB native blocks. In other words, the good and valuable work of SegWit is made MORE valuable by a 2MB block than by a 1MB block, for SegWit roughly doubles the max tx quantity. 

So, portraying it as an either-or situation isn't correct. It is not the case that ""either"" SegWit soft-fork 2MB happens, OR hardfork 2MB happens. Both can, and IMO both should happen. Increasingly, it appears both will.

The question is then, how to do it most safely? In an ideal world, Core would realize the vast support for larger blocks (made increasingly apparent by Classic's momentum), and would work to incorporate that 2MB support into Core. Core has stated that absolutely will not happen, however. Fine, that's professional disagreement. But it means a fork will occur without Core's stewardship.

SegWit is a great compliment to blocks of any size, and for that reason, perhaps paradoxically, SegWit will not satiate the demand for 2MB or greater blocks. 

Ultimately, Classic is not about a magic 2MB block size. It is about showing the world that one group of devs doesn't have monopoly power on the protocol. It has become an experiment and lesson in decentralization. Even those who denounce Classic should be able to appreciate that sentiment. ",2016-01-17 03:27:16

you (creator of bitcoins) create a safe place in which you put a file, that file is a bitcoin. To gain that bitcoin, people need to enter that place. The place is locked by a password. Nobody knows the password, you neither. People must try all the password until the find the right one. Let's say it is a loong and coomplex password, so you need computational power, a lot of it in order to find that password in a reasonable time. Now, you release a software that makes people able to try to access this place through internet. When someone find the right password, they earn the bitcoin, the password is changed and a new bitcoin is generated. Moreover, the more people are trying to get that password, the more complex the password will be.  
Trying to get that password is called ""mining"" bitcoins.  
So you basically create something that is uncommon and requires resources to be obtained. From this fact comes the value of the bitcoin.

cz2gmxh,ForkiusMaximus,69,"It's like you're thinking, ""A controversial change can be imposed on me, therefore it can be imposed on a me by a government."" This is wrong twice over. 

1) A controversial change can't be imposed on you; you're always free to stick with 1MB and sell off your coins in the market-favored fork. (If you're worried about 51% attacks you could implement Luke's idea and change the mining algo.)

2) Even if you consider the market stopping its support for your favored version ""a controversial change being forced on you,"" it doesn't follow that a government can come in and alter Bitcoin as it sees fit. The market would have to support it. Now you might say the government can shut down the market, etc., but this is just an attack scenario that always existed. 

Your mental model on this appears to be so fuzzy that you've got it exactly backwards. The reality is **hard forks are the only market-driven way to 
*resolve* a controversy**.  It is the notion that controversial hard forks must be avoided that centralizes control and makes Bitcoin vulnerable to a government attack, even if that attack were limited to freezing the Bitcoin code and never allowing any further changes. 

It seems in your mind you have it that it's Satoshi's setting in stone or the stewardship of the Core devs that ensures something like the 21M coin limit stays put. [It isn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3skbkz/forkology_101_the_source_of_the_sanctity_of_the/) It's the market's preference for 21M being set in stone, because the market knows changing it means a loss of confidence in Bitcoin as hard money - its core value proposition. That is why no government can come in and change it. 

The same, however, does not apply to the blocksize cap, because even though it is controversial the market is not wedded to any arbitrary number like 1MB over say 2MB. During a hardfork, the market may or may not support a change, but just because it does - through a decentralized process - that doesn't mean a government could come in a impose changes in a centralized fashion. 

In fact, the idea that it's  the wise shepherding of the Core devs that is what is preventing a government from imposing changes is far scarier. Co-opting a dev team or a repo is far easier than trying to endrun a market - and anyway if governments could do such a thing Bitcoin would have no hope in the first place. 

Hard forks are the only way for the market to express its will, which is the only way for Bitcoin to remain both decentralized and viable. This ""all boils down to normalcy"" anyway, as we knew all along that Bitcoin was a matter of trusting the market. A denial of hard forks is market denialism and fundamentally anti-Bitcoin. You always had to satisfy the market or get forked off, controversial change or otherwise. The hard fork just makes this reality clear. 

Finally, even if all this hasn't convinced you that **hard forks are exactly what is needed in a controversy**, there is no means of avoiding a hard fork anyway if the market wants one. The outcome is one of three cases: the market values your favored version, the market values a different version, or the market values a split where both versions retain significant value (this would likely mean there is actually value in splitting the ledger into two copies, and probably changing the PoW algo on one of them). 

- If if values yours, there's no problem. 

- If it doesn't, you're free to continue using it but no one will trade with you - it's a change being imposed on you but it in a fully decentralized manner and there's no point is railing against it as it was always the case the market could move against you. (Heck, the market *could* end up being dumb and selling BTC down to near zero at any time, for any reason - that's nothing new, and controversial hard forks don't change this). 

- If the market values both, we agree to disagree, no one gets imposed on any more than you can say a price drop imposed something on you, and if the market is wise - as Bitcoin is predicated on trusting it to be - we'll all be better off under the split, for example because there *really did* turn out to be a need for a SettlementCoin and a CurrencyCoin type of arrangement (I doubt it, but it's a possible scenario).

In no case does anything bad or unusual happen. In no case does any government to impose anything it couldn't already.",2016-01-18 15:30:29

cz2ionn,Anenome5,25,"&gt; what kinds of strategies would you suggest for paving the path to liberty?

Here's Rothbard's article

https://www.reddit.com/r/Ancapraxis/comments/3b6325/four_strategies_for_libertarian_change_murray/

Also see the sidebar on that sub.

My own chosen path is both seasteading and cryptoanarchy, with some agorism thrown in.

I believe that the state relies on a belief that every statist must believe is true, and while they believe it is true they will always be a statist, and people like us have learned that the belief is not true through primarily training in economics.

*They believe the state is necessary to have a stable society.*

If this lynchpin of statism can be pulled, the result is that the state loses its philosophic and intellectual underpinnings and we will then watch the state crumble from within like to many dominoes.

The way to achieve this pulling of the lynchpin of statism is to build a functioning ancap enclave that actually works like our theory says it will, that its outcomes are not horrific such as the statists believe it would be, but instead it becomes a desirable place for people to live, such that even *norms*, that is people whom are non-ideological, desire to live there and move there of their own accord for job opportunities and general niceness of the neighborhood.

If we can build an ancap enclave that does that and uses a voluntarist legal order to hold it all together, then we have proved that you do not need a state to have a stable society.

We will prove ancap is true by that outcome, and at that point it will just be a matter of time.

There is two historical precedents for this. One, no one believed a constitutional democracy could be stable back in 1783. Europeans thought the idea that presidents would simply hand over power every 4 years to be ludicrous.

But we know what happened, presidents have handed power over every time, because everyone expects them to, because no one feels bound to follow the order of a former president the day after he's left office. It is stable, and the US became an amazing place to live--the entire world clambored to get there.

As a result of those two things--proof that republican democracy was stable and the fantastic and desirable economic outcome, the entire world was able to justify the abandoning of monarchic-based political decision-making and move to a constitutional or representative one.

The second example is the soviet union. They believed for a long time that the USSR and socialist economic planning would be able to produce more wealth for their people than capitalism. And for awhile they had the illusion that this would be true, because they very rapidly industrialized. But the rapid growth they experienced was actually due to having so very much catching up to do.

When Yeltsin finally visited the US himself and picked a grocery store at random to visit, he was shocked at the great variety of food available to everyone, such that even the wealthy elites of the party like himself had absolutely no access to, and no hope of every producing that level of prosperity under economic socialism. So they abandoned it, and relatively peacefully too.

Actually there's one more great example: Hong Kong.

Take the exact same Chinese as those living literally next door to them, and they turned HK into an amazing and wealthy place. After reunification, the Chinese abandoned economic socialism and adopted the legal and economic norms of capitalism, seeking to replicate the success of HK across all of China, resulting in hundreds of millions being brought out of poverty and the modern success story today, and the legend of Hong Kong is still being dreamed about the world over.

It's a legend that seasteaders can sell, we can bring foreign investment and jobs to places by forming our own HK-like charter city, a semi-autonomous zone, such as the recent ZEDE legislation in Honduras.

I believe we can build an ancap seastead and make it a very profitable place to live, begin growing it among the non-ideological after we work the kinks out among ourselves as to how an ancap legal system can be built--we know the theory, we will need to get some practical experience with it.

This built, we will shock the world, showing them a place that requires no monopoly-government whatsoever, and from that moment, the lynch-pin of statism will have been pulled, and much like the progress of bitcoin sending ripples through financial markets, much like democracy led to revolution after revolution the world over, the successful demonstration of an ancap city will send tsunami waves through the political harbors of the world, demanding they abandon their existing state and adopt new political norms that we have at that point proven to be practical.

That is how we win, by demonstration, by pulling the lynch-pin of statism, not by a vote, not by a movement, by results.",2016-01-18 17:05:10

&gt;So how bad is it? There was a block consisting of one transaction in the coinbase, it was broadcasted about one month ago. It was f2pool that was clearing up a bunch of spam on the blockchain. The problem is that this block takes 30 seconds to validate. It's a 990 kilobyte transaction. It contains about 500,000 signature operations, which each time serializes the entire 1 MB transaction out, moves buffers around, then serializes it, then hashes it, it creates 1.25 GB. The bitcoin serializer is not fast, it's about where 60% of the validation time was. So 30 seconds to validate and that's on a beefy computer, I don't know what that is on a raspberrypi, it's not linear it's quadratic scaling... If you are doing 8 MB, then it's 2 hours and 8 minutes. There are some ways that gavinandresen has proposed that this can be fixed. This transaction would be considered non-standard on the network now, but miners can still generate these transactions.

- That a few core developers attack bitcoin

If consensus of all developers is needed it means any developer can attack bitcoin by vetoing required changes.

For example, if I have $500 in my bank account, there aren't actually 500 one-dollar bills stashed away somewhere, there's just a digital record that the bank holds that much of my money. If I choose, I can transfer some of those digital dollars to someone else's account, in exchange for, say, a hamburger.

Often the devs response is some kind of my-way-or-the-highway reaction which completely undermines Bitcoin's foundations and the confidence in Bitcoin as a network. Bitcoin isn't built on devs backs, it's built on the users that *use Bitcoin*, Bitcoin could still run with 10 good devs and service 100,000,000 users, but it wouldn't matter how many devs you have if the user base shinks to a couple hundred.

The developers that have positions of influence in Bitcoin development have gone to great effort to gain that influence and it has utterly corrupted their understanding of where they stand in the Bitcoin community. They are not judges or referees that get to make the final call. That's the miners', and the community's job. This is the true definition of a decentralised network that devs like Greg, btcdrak, Adam, et al. harp on about (which is incredibly ironic considering how they are trying so hard to force everyone to stick with Core BTW).

It can even assign a relative weighting to those options, especially if coins in the two sides of the fork are allowed to be bought and sold in advance by proxy through futures trading on exchanges (e.g., Bitfinex would let you buy futures in CoreCoins and/or ClassicCoins so that the matter could be resolved before the fork even happens, with the legendary accuracy of a prediction market).

Anything controversial, on which many reasonable people are in disagreement, is the perfect time for a hard fork. The idea that controversial hard forks are to be avoided is not only [exactly backwards](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41fup9/to_core_developers_we_are_not_firing_you_we_are/cz2gmxh), to even entertain the idea shows a [fundamental misunderstanding](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-267#post-9989) of how Bitcoin works and calls into question everything else one might say on the subject.

Hard forks are the market speaking. Soft forks on any issues where there is controversy are an attempt to smother the market in its sleep. Core's approach is fundamentally anti-market and against the very open-source ethos Bitcoin was founded on.

Bitcoin development in general is serving Bitcoin users, no one else. If the users decide it's time for change in direction, it's time for change in direction. 

If particular devs don't like it, they can either suck it up and continue developing stuff in Bitcoin that both the developer himself and the users appreciate, or they can quit.

That's natural process. The way it should be. Developers usually care most about developing stuff that concerns themselves but if it doesn't concern the userbase at large, there is a conflict of interest.

The right way to solve that conflict of interest is not for users to compromise, the compromise must come from the devs.

For any reasonable dev this should not be a black &amp; white issue. Raising the blocksize to 2MB shouldn't be a killing blow to anything especially when it gets widespread ecosystem consensus (and the hard fork to 2MB won't otherwise happen).

If they quit, then they quit. It's a major loss for the development resources of Bitcoin but Bitcoin will recover from that.

3/ At Brookings, Charley Cooper was mentionning your article at the time it was published, mentioning the hook ""It's a failed experiment"" and the whole time he is selling R3 with the same argument ""So this public blockchain is useless for financial service that's why you all need our product""  calling you a proeminent core developper (He must have misunderstood you on that). He acted it like a rehearsed PR STUNT. 

So don't serve us this shit again ""ohh R3 and Bitcoin have nothing to do with each other"" already served by R3 this weekend. R3 is the one always talking about Bitcoin and finding every way posible to diss it. And yes unlike R3 many people think that WE NEED a public blockchain, a moip, an internet of value.

Now I don't know if you have realized this already but you ruined anything good you might have done in the space for 5 years. You are a despised man in a large part of the community. And your lack of emotional control and constant public bickering culminating in this magnificient act of burning bridges will certainly not do you any favor in your next business endeavor after your stint at R3 (just one company among many others selling wind on powerpoint like its 1999 again). Who needs an out-of-control Drama queen?

And by the way, please deflate that huge ego of yours because it doesn't match any reality. You are no visionary. Considering the time you arrived in the space, if you had an ounce of vision you would be loaded like a Roger Ver today. And you wouldn't need to go work on useless shits at R3 with a few hundred coins left.

&gt; the size of the witness portion of a SegWit transaction is counted 25%. A SegWit transaction can be split into two parts: the transaction data (i.e. where the coins come from, how many coins, where they go to), and the witness data (the signatures and scripts you use to prove that you're allowed to spend the coins). It's only the second half of the transaction, the witness data, that gets the 75% discount. This means that transactions that have a lot of signatures (e.g. large multisig) benefit much more than typical transactions. - [L](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3zuhnu/summary_of_major_blocksize_proposals/cypcobn)

and 

&gt; I think the 0.25x byte discounting in SegWit is effectively a subsidy for projects like Lightning and sidechains. Those projects have more complicated signature scripts than typical transactions, so they benefit more from the signature script discount. I don't like that. Lightning and sidechains should compete with on-chain transactions on their merits, not on their subsidies. - [L](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/40275p/forking_pressure_may_2015_vs_now/cyrvg0q)",2016-01-19 09:03:17

cz3tt3c,Vendor_BBMC,47,"Ha ha! Touche!

Everyone gets over their BBMC-phase. Except me!

Seriously though, any old meth can go into pills It would be a waste of pure meth, which is for smoking from glass. I don't know who the US airforce get their meth pilss from right now, but that contract could be worth the pair of us teaming-up!

We are both manufacturers, but at very different ends of the market. I make small amounts (relatively) of something at the chemical limits of purity, so its expensive.

I couldn't do what Quantik does. I keep reading posts from people who think they can. ""How hard can it be? Buy a shitload of Alprazolam and a fucking pill press. voila!"", If that's the case, why aren't you doing it, then?

The things manufacturers have in common is forward-planning, and the drive to solve problems. You smoke cannabis because somebody planted seeds 5 months ago, and created an environment which was secure and provided all the growing plant's needs, then after switching to 12/12 they resisted the impulse to  harvest early.

Quantik will have encountered a thousand problems before making his first bar. then another thousand to expand his business. If he's anything like BBMC, he's more or less a user cooperative, with some roles being done by customers who he will never speak to directly or meet. But whatever the process, Quantik worked it out by doing it himself a thousand times before delegating it.

I couldn't make millions of anything. the only thing most of us do a million times is breathe in and out. Now, imagine having to SELL every breath you've ever taken, for bitcoin, around the world.

You'd think that would be valued by drug users, whatever their drug of choice. They don't. What we need is a **rule 17 banning ""druggism"".**

Next time you're tempted to use the word ""bartard"" or ""meth-head"" in a sentence, try the same sentence with ""nigger"" or ""jew"" there instead. Read it back to yourself a couple of times.

Would you use that?

I've even seen mods dismissing ""bartards"" like they're not human, simply because they don't smoke cannabis, with occasional LSD and MDMA like they do.

You can draw the line at coffee, or tobacco, or whiskey. I don't consider cannabis a drug, I think that's why stoners can be as dismissive and judgemental of drug users as a whiskey-drinking republican senator - they're barely drug users. so if they want to be accepted in this community, they've gotta respect rule 17.

The same goes for the moderators and their attitude to manufacturers. Not only would it be boring here without Quantik, TGUK and myself, but there would be no drugs to ease the boredom. nothing for ""vendors"" to arbitrage between countries or marketplaces. Nothing for scammers to entice you in with.

Yesterday, I saw a post giving details of some recent QUSA arrests, and a MODERATOR thinking out aloud about banning ""bartard"" posts! If you use drugs, you aught to know what side of the fence you are on. Its serious when people start getting arrested, so when it hits the fan you either get behind Quantik and help or keep your fucking stupid comments to yourself, because wishing harm on somebody who makes or uses drugs is worse than being a grass in my book.

You say your ""main concern is the safety and security of this community"" when you ban the man who has safely manufactured more fentanyl-free xanax then anyone on the face of the planet. But our legitimacy on reddit is ultimately rooted in real-life, tangible drugs.
When Quantik is banned by somebody yet to manufacture a single fent-free bar, people discuss him even more, only they have to guess what he's thinking. You're not cutting the drug maker off from this sub:- You cut the sub off from the world of drugs and darknetmarketplaces.

You weren't expecting THIS particular meth-rant today, were you? That's because you're a bunch of fucking stoners.

&gt;Satoshi definitely intended to increase the hard max block size. See:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0

&gt;I believe that Satoshi expected most people to use some sort of lightweight node, with only companies and true enthusiasts being full nodes. **Mike Hearn's view is similar to Satoshi's view**.

&gt;I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation of the ""Bitcoin currency guarantees"". Satoshi said that the max block size could be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard descriptions of the Bitcoin system.

&gt;**IMO Mike Hearn's plan would probably work. The market/community would find a way to pay for the network's security, and it would be easy enough to become a full node that the currency wouldn't be at risk**. The max block size would not truly be unlimited, since miners would always need to produce blocks that the vast majority of full nodes and other miners would be able and willing to process in a reasonable amount of time.

Sounds like Theymos ought to ban himself from his own forum for saying that. It's weird how a person can change so drastically in such a short amount of time. There's something incredibly fishing going on with Theymos. I've even seen him argue against his first point about Satoshi's plan to raise the block size limit. Theymos has now twisted Satoshi's words as ""this is how you *could* conceivably raise the block size limit, not that it ever *should* be raised"". It's Goddamn Orwellian.",2016-01-19 05:15:24
cz3vf85,45sbvad,34,"Yes, Bitcoin is rising in popularity so fast that transaction space is becoming limited. Bitcoin already has a system for prioritizing transactions inside of it's blocks. You can send bitcoin transactions for free, and if there is free space available your transaction will be included for free. If there is no free space available your transaction will be returned after 48hours. If you don't want to wait you simply send a small fee with your transaction, usually $0.001 to $0.03 depending on network usage at the time, and your transaction will be included in the next 10 minutes. If you send too small of a fee and want your transaction processed sooner you can ""re-send"" the transaction with a higher fee and it will replace the lower fee transaction.

The idea that Bitcoin is dying because it is so popular is absurd.

Credit Card transactions take 90 days to settle. Ninety Days. Three months. During this time period transactions can be reversed. CC transactions cost $0.03 + 1-3% (depending on merchant). You don't see these fee's but the merchant passes them on to you.

Bitcoin transactions take 10-30minutes to settle. After confirmation there is no possibility of transaction reversal. Bitcoin is the SETTLEMENT layer.

cz2qtug,belcher_,32,"Some points.

0) You may be right about better communication being needed. Although to the defense of core, the forums were filled with shills, votebots and an angry-mob that had all it's emotional buttons massaged by developers-turned-politicians like Mike Hearn.

1) The updates to a block size hard fork have to happen all at once, the updates to a segwit soft can be rolled out slowly as needed. This is one of the main reasons a soft fork is much safer which you completely missed.

2) Bitcoin does not have clients or servers. It is peer to peer (and not datacenter-to-datacenter as would have resulted from Mike Hearn's proposals.) The distinction is important.

3) Segwit does not introduce a new kind of address, it uses p2sh addresses which have existed at least since 2012.

4) People have been flagging the block size being raised for years but *it was rejected because it's a bad idea*. Until a week ago we were fighting off ideas to raise the block size to **8GB**.

5) The hard fork is not happening. We're a long way from that. Classic hasn't even written any code as of now.

6) Bitcoin is not a democracy and doesn't have elections. If you want to use a democratic currency, go use central bank money controlled by your favorite liberal democratic state. One of bitcoin's main value propositions is it may be able to resist tyranny of the majority.

7) Bitcoin on-chain transaction are not a good payment network. Every transaction must be flooded to every node in the network, which scales as O( N^2 ). The idea that all coffee purchases and online tips will be recorded on the blockchain is ridiculous. Rather than a payment network, bitcoin should aim to be digital gold; decentralized, censorship resistant and with monetary sovereignty.

What can replace credit cards and remittances, however, is a network of payment channels that routes payments instead of flooding them. Far more efficient, cheaper and confirms instantly instead of waiting for the next block. If you look, bitcoin core has been working on updates to help the Lightning project for months now, with BIP66, BIP68, BIP113, BIP65/OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and soon they'll adding be BIP112/OP_CSV. Was the OP aware of these?

cz50rgt,seweso,40,"Classic is scary? First 20Mb was too much, then 8Mb was too much and now 2Mb is too much. While Core dev's signed off on 4Mb. Isn't that a bit weird? 

And how many chances do we need to give them? They have had years to add an increase. Alternative clients are created because Core keeps saying No. Why would we give them one more chance when they keep saying No? Doesn't compute. 

&gt; Core has a lot in the pipe to cover the supposed capacity problem, with way smarter solutions than a dumb constant change

Classic is not about throwing everything away what Core does. Opt-in RBF is considered very contentious and it seems it has anti-consensus (more people are against than for it). And Segregated Witness seems to be too complex and would take too long (as a blocksize limit increase). 

&gt; A hard fork will lead to a lot of problems, like people unable to know if the payment they sent was valid, that will harm bitcoin forever. 

Dont spread baseless FUD. A hardfork which activates at 75% means that the remaining chain is dead. In the best case scenario (that 25% of miners stay on the original chain which is very unlikely!) you have 40 minute confirmations and only 1.5 Mb worth of transaction per hour!  While the 2Mb chain has a capacity of 9Mb per hour. 

Furthermore most transactions will be valid and accepted on both chains. That means that the longer we wait to switch the more transactions there will be, and the bigger the backlog on the old chain will be. The chance of the old chain dying grows bigger and bigger everyday. 

Although I would say the chance of the old chain dying is already near 100%, looking at the fact that there already is global consensus to do a hardfork.

&gt; The roadmap for classic is already childish and scary

Again with the FUD. Choosing 2Mb and choosing Classics development model are two different things. Also don't know what is scary about that list. 

&gt; There is way less risk to give Core's roadmap a try (no fork and it historically works) and see how the network will react to fees

Clearly almost everyone disagrees with that assessment. People probably don't like seeing things like [this](http://imgur.com/z9WSqr7). Bitcoin slowly becomes less usefull, not good for its value.

Improve 0-conf tracking by cointracker · Pull Request #16 · bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic · GitHub
This change in 0.12 would make our 0-conf tracking much less reliable if deployed.

re-enable UPNP by cointracker · Pull Request #15 · bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic · GitHub
UPNP makes our 0-conf tracking and compliance tracking more reliable by allowing us to make incoming connections to nodes behind firewalls, we should re-enable it by default.

&gt;- Soft-Fork triggers in Jun/July 2016 
&gt;- 50% of adoption after one year

Don't forget, all bitcoin wallets, block explorers, API providers, everyone, has to hard-fork their software to make it compatible with SegWit. Or, just go with [BitcoinClassic](http://bitcoinclassic.com) and run a few lines of code to hard-fork the network and bump up to 2MB blocksize in a month or so.

Another great comment.

&gt;this from Sergio Lerner, prominent Bitcoin core dev. from BitcoinClassic Slack Channel:

&gt;**sergiodemianlerner** 5:29 PM Regarding SegWit, I don't know if you have actually looked at the code but the amount of code changed, including consensus code, is huge. (maybe ~500 lines). I think such change has never been attempted in the history of Bitcoin. We cannot just say lightly that a couple of weeks after the 2mb hard-fork we're going to deploy segwit. That code needs months of review. Also I'm against the complexity of segwit as a soft-fork (probably requires 200 additional lines of code of consensus critical code). Segwit almost prevents consensus-compatible re-implementations of Bitcoin in other languages.

Which is why I want to ask: if you're in it for the quick gains (which you most likely are considering that a 7% rise is newsworthy to you) then why Bitcoin? It's not even close to being the most volatile asset to bet on. Not only that, the rises and falls are impossible to predict because the market is being heavily manipulated by the Chinese so you're rarely, if ever, correct with your timing. At least with basic stocks you have milestones like quarterly results where the price will probably jump one way or the other. 

Or did you just bet it all on black and now you're happy that your bet paid off with a massive ROI of 7%?

cz5kw5j,NintenEthan,32,"I know this has probably already been explained to you numerous times, but I suppose I will do it again:

**Bitcoin going up does not bum us out.**

Now, you may be wondering to yourself, why is that so? After all, most of us in /r/buttcoin think bitcon is extremely flawed (to put it mildly), and we have been known to get a kick out of the price dropping (at least, when the drop is large anyway). Knowing those two things, you'd think we'd hate seeing the price rise, right? Wouldn't that just make us all feel stupid? 

Well, no.

See, the thing is, even if the price does rise every now and then, most of us still wouldn't change our minds about bitcoin. The long term trend seems to be that bits-coin is falling in price, and so the day-to-day fluctuations matter little to us. Furthermore, even if we were to see the long-term trends for bitcoin's price changing (ie. if it were to go on a steady upward trajectory), we would still have big issues with your favorite e-fun bux. For example, its continued lack of mainstream adoption (even as other payment services, like Apple Pay, have gained a very large userbase despite being around for a far shorter period than bitcoin has), its extremely slow speeds, its huge carbon footprint, and the problems with the community itself, among many other issues. 

Which brings me to my main point: the community itself. Let's say that, for the sake of argument, you are correct about bitcoin, and we are wrong. Let's assume that all of our misgivings are incorrect. **Even if bitcoins is the wave of the future, we would still be laughing, because of one very important thing: the community is hilarious.**

This is the primary source of our comedy. Even if we are wrong about bitcon, even if it truly is the greatest creation to spring from mankind's loins, that doesn't change the fact that the community is a toxic cesspool of nonsense, naivety, silly politics, and scam artists. 

Perhaps you and your cohorts are right, and in twenty years we will be paying for our rent in bitcon. That doesn't change the fact that the community is a comedy gold-mine. And that is what truly brings us together.",2016-01-21 04:59:21

&gt;Switching to BIP 101 or Bitcoin XT is a bad idea; we will never do that. After a meeting with some other Chinese pools earlier this year, we proposed an 8-megabyte limit, because we thought Gavin's initial 20 megabyte proposal was too big for us. I always thought 2 megabytes would be better as a first step, but I did not want to offend Gavin with a 10 times smaller proposal. Gavin then answered us with BIP 101, which due to its steep growth curve is essentially 8 gigabytes, so it’s done. I don’t trust Gavin anymore – nor Hearn for that matter.”

cz6cab2,Introshine,20,"&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

&gt;New technologies—supported by advances in encryption and network computing—are driving transformational change in the global economy, including in how goods, services and assets are exchanged. An important development in this process has been the emergence of virtual currencies (VCs). VC schemes are private sector systems that, in many cases, facilitate peer-to-peer exchange bypassing traditional central clearinghouses. VCs and their associated technologies (notably distributed ledgers based on blockchains) are rapidly evolving, and the future landscape is difficult to predict.

&gt;**VCs offer many potential benefits, including greater speed and efficiency in making payments and transfers—particularly across borders––and ultimately promoting financial inclusion. The distributed ledger technology underlying some VC schemes—an innovative decentralized means of keeping track of transactions in a large network––offers potential benefits that go far beyond VCs themselves.**

&gt;**At the same time, VCs pose considerable risks as potential vehicles for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and fraud. While risks to the conduct of monetary policy seem less likely to arise at this stage given the very small scale of VCs, risks to financial stability may eventually emerge as the new technologies become more widely used.**

&gt;**The development of effective regulatory responses to VCs is still at an early stage.** VCs are **difficult to regulate as they cut across the responsibilities of different agencies at the national level**, and operate on a global scale. Many are opaque and operate outside of the conventional financial system, making it difficult to monitor their operations.

&gt;Regulators have begun to address these challenges, with a variety of approaches across countries. Responses have included clarifying the applicability of existing legislation to VCs, issuing warnings to consumers, imposing licensing requirements on certain VC market participants, prohibiting financial institutions from dealing in VCs, completely banning the use of VCs, and prosecuting violators. These approaches represent an initial policy response to the challenges that VCs pose, but further development is needed. In particular, national authorities will need to calibrate regulation in a manner that appropriately addresses the risks without stifling innovation.

&gt;More could be done at the international level to facilitate the process of developing and refining policies at the national level. International bodies are playing an important role in identifying and discussing the risks posed by VCs and possible regulatory responses, and they should continue to do so. **As experience is gained, international standards and best practices could be considered to provide guidance on the most appropriate regulatory responses in different fields, thereby promoting harmonization across jurisdictions.** 

&gt;Such standards could also set out frameworks for cross-country cooperation and coordination in areas such as information sharing and the investigation and prosecution of cross-border offenses.

Then he [hires](http://blog.viacoin.org/2014/07/31/viacoin-hires-peter-todd.html) Peter Todd for ""at least 50% of his time"" to work on VIA but no, it's actually Core, but with funds raised for VIA/XCH? Yeah dude sounds legit. I wonder how far the money trail goes and who exactly is involved in what capacity.

&gt;BTCDrak shouldn't really be considered a core developer but perhaps the better term would be a Bitcoin Core weasel as he has weaseled his way into being thought of and considered a core developer through brown nosing.

&gt;Ironically his only contribution to the Bitcoin Core repository is a document entitled ""Contributing to Bitcoin Core"".

&gt;BTCDrak also managed to create an ICO for his altcoin Viacoin which is just a clone of Bitcoin and the accompanying project ClearingHouse which is just a clone of Counterparty. BTCDrak isn't a programmer but has enough coding knowledge to make a Bitcoin clone and enough technical doublespeak to swindle people out of 600 Bitcoins for the ICO.

&gt;At the time 600 Bitcoins had a value of around $380 thousand dollars.

&gt;BTCDrak paid a small portion of that money to Peter Todd to implement some features such as CLTV (Check Lock Time Verify) and uses that as a badge of honor. Essentially paying Peter Todd a portion of the $380k has allowed him to weasel his way into the Bitcoin Core developers team.  He also conned Peter Todd into assuming the role of ""Chief Scientist"".  Peter Todd in November wrote ""I was previously getting paid by viacoin to do Bitcoin Core dev work - I never actually contributed to Viacoin directly"".",2016-01-22 23:24:25

The objections are about creating an artificial restriction by severely limiting the blocksize. 

Some people act like, if we raised the blocksize limit to 32MB, then the very next day we would be seeing 32MB blocks. That isn't the case unless there were enough people/businesses willing to pay a competitive fee to get it into one.

The real issue is an attempt to turn bitcoin into an auction house by, first, artificially constraining the blocksize such that the average steady state of the network was one with a continuous backlog measured in hours, if not days. Then people would use RBF to 'bid' for the high privelage of getting their transaction processed.

This would destroy bitcoin as a payment network, as the average confirmation time would be hours, to days, if ever.

A fee market, with full RBF, may make sense if something like the lightning network existed in a usable form to offload day to day payment transactions. But it doesn't exist yet, and probably won't exist fully integrated into the entire ecosystem for a couple of years.

cz6j47l,crypton8,18,"Is Bitcoin Dead? $1 Billion In Startup Investment Says No

Bitcoin has been declared dead about ninety times since it’s release in 2009, but this time it’s different. Instead of a media outlet breathlessly repeating assurances from a banking sector executive that the first blockchain based virtual currency is dead, the source of the obituary was none other than Mike Hearn, a leading Bitcoin developer.

Hearn’s post on Medium exposed some of the inner workings of the Bitcoin industry, focusing in particular on the deadlock among developers regarding how to increase the maximum number of transactions per second. Hearn deserves to be heard, given the time he has devoted to making Bitcoin work, but many of his concerns have been blown out of proportion.

The majority of the article discusses an issue that has been in hot debate since the middle of 2015, the scalability of the Bitcoin’s underlying ledger mechanism, the blockchain.  Bitcoin currently has the ability to handle between 3 and 7 transactions a second due to a mix of the current 1mb limit per entry to the blockchain, called a block, combined with the current methods of uploading the transactions. As it turns out, the number of Bitcoin transactions are growing at such a rate, that we, as an industry, needed to start thinking about scalability as early as last year.

Hearn’s proposed solution is a new version of the Bitcoin protocol, called BitcoinXT. There were many changes, but most importantly the block size was expanded by a factor of eight. Other developers feared that the increased block size would make it harder for smaller miners, industry players who validate transactions in exchange for the ability to create Bitcoin and receive transaction fees, to participate. The consolidation of miners would lead to centralization, removing much of the security and efficiency attributed to Bitcoin.

The other concern was the transition from Bitcoin to Bitcoin XT. The proposed modification would be added to the official software immediately, but would not activate until 75% of all clients running the Bitcoin protocol, called a node, were upgraded. The nodes that did not upgrade would continue running, but with a separate view of the state of the Bitcoin blockchain.
Recommended by Forbes

This separation is conceptually similar to the dreaded ‘hard fork’, a situation where there are two different versions of a blockchain. During a hard fork, many of the checks and balances that keep Bitcoin running falter until the industry decides which blockchain is the most legitimate. The theory is that since BitcoinXT would be an intentional, in place upgrade of the existing system, announced well in advance, there shouldn’t be any question as to which version of the blockchain is correct.

While an important voice, Hearn is not the only one and there are other solutions being tested. Bitcoin Classic, another scheme to expand the Bitcoin block size, is supported by over 50% of all the miners (something which Hearn mentioned was blocking the increase of the blocksize), as well as big players like blockchain.info, Bitstamp, and Xapo. Developers have also been developing new scaling technologies that neither increase the blocksize nor risk a hard fork, such as Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network. There is more than one method for Bitcoin to make it over this transaction volume hurdle.

Hearn spent months trying to shepherd Bitcoin XT through the internal development process. When it became clear this was not going to happen, he left Bitcoin for R3, an organization that is building tools for banks with non-Bitcoin based blockchains. Several months after joining R3, Mike released his post on the failure of Bitcoin, highlighting lack of scalability.

Hearn’s post posits an end to Bitcoin, the latest and certainly most interesting among the nearly hundred predictions of its demise. His frustration even after months of no longer working directly with the development team comes shining through. As bad as his assessment sounds, the future is a bit more benign.

Last year, it was announced that over $1bn had been invested in various Bitcoin oriented operations. This is a pool of entities that have both talent and financial resources. While many are chewing over Hearn’s missive, this group is having internal discussions about what to do next. Despite a perceived scalability problem, for which fixes are being developed, these companies are growing fast, with new technologies like Bitcoin debit cards and better ways to pay international contractors.

Hearn’s post has already been added to the Bitcoin obituary list, but when we look back on this event it will look more like he applied the defibrillator paddles to the Bitcoin protocol development team.

So how does this affect entrepreneurs in the industry? For us, it was all about managing fear, uncertainty and doubt. You see, after Hearn published his post, concerned parties started reaching out from various aspects of our business, from investors and partners to even entrepreneurial friends in our personal lives. To those reaching out from outside the industry, it seemed that an impending doom was upon us.  After several conversations, one by one, we managed to reassure our stakeholders that everything was fine.

Will this be the last time we will have to deal with this sort of industry doubt?  The previous 90 declared deaths to Bitcoin point to a resounding no. Luckily, $1bn in startup investment, a fast growing industry, and a group of core developers dedicated to scaling Bitcoin means that companies like ours are here to stay.",2016-01-22 00:00:30

I've covered a lot of ground of TA and analysis, this is what works for me. I know some are skeptical, but this is just my opinion and what I believe it to work. I hope you guys don't mind if I repost in tomorrow's post if this thread gets rolled over in an hour or two.

[Long term bitcoin daily price chart](http://ibankbitcoins.com/sites/default/files/users/user1/1-21-2016_chart_0.png)

I will first go over the technical analysis and charting, then discuss my projections for the upcoming short term and intermediate term. Let’s take a look at the chart below. Note, the support/resistance lines were drawn a while back and some still holds true today.

Bitcoin price has recently broken down from the steepest trendline with multiple support points. There were early warnings that a break down was likely. The Mike Hearn's article and TX backlogs caused some serious panic selling. The next trendline up is from a longer time frame. We briefly breached it but rallied above it so far. This line is also pretty steep so a break down wouldn't affect the longer term trend, but shows more short term bitcoin weakness.

The major support line is at 2340 which coincides with the previous spike high and the most recent crash. Above this support is bullish since it is the upper end of the trading range. In terms of moving average, the 200 day and 365 day moving average is way below the bitcoin price. I use this to gauge the general long term trend. We are a bit extended at these prices since the moving average is so far away from the price, but price can remain at these levels for an extended period of time.

The last and most important thing I want to talk about is Dow Theory. If you are not familiar, I hope you can read up on it online or a previous article I've talked about. In summary, Dow Theory suggests that a trend going up needs to form a higher high and a higher low and vice versa. Look at the red arrows on the chart; we have formed lower highs on multiple occasions on the daily chart. While it is not immediately bearish, it does show buying weakness. On the other hand, the market is also forming higher lows which confirm that we are in an uptrend. We have two conflicting signals, which bring me to my next point.

In the short to intermediate term, I expect further market weakness. We have conflicting signals in the Dow Theory which suggests bitcoin price might be in a choppy market. Since price is at the upper range of the trading range. I expect it to pullback further. I am still bullish long term since we are trending up. So unless trendlines and supports start to breakdown in addition to a lower high and a lower low, I would not change my long term price projection

It was always inevitable that Core's code offerings would be unbundled from their (attempts) at consensus setting, particularly with respect to a highly-controversial economic parameter like the block size limit.  If the network adopts 99% of Core's proffered code but decides to pass on their suggested block size limit, that doesn't mean they've been ""overthrown"" (they were in never in charge to begin with), nor does it mean that they can't continue to contribute.

cz6mi0l,tsontar,14,"&gt; No matter where people stand on the blocksize issue, it seems clear that the blockchain can't accommodate an infinite number of transactions.

That is absolutely true.  But the fair market value of a transaction depends on the market being unmanipulated.

By setting an artificial capacity cap, Core is behaving like OPEC, keeping supply limited in order to drive up prices.  This has profound market-distorting effects and is a terrific violation of Bitcoin's social contract, to-wit ""[Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin)""

If the free market is not allowed to set production capacity and price, but these are controlled by a handful of developers and miners, then Bitcoin is in fact controlled by a central authority.

&gt; In that case, what's so wrong with using fees to discriminate between competing transactions?

Nothing (this is inevitable if Bitcoin becomes successful) but these fees should be market-priced, not set by a central planning committee as is currently happening.

cz8nd9n,Falkvinge,88,"This transaction was a consolidation of many small transactions that had gone into a multisig address. It's a real-life business scenario and not a hypothetical use case. The first time this transaction was tried after all signatures had been painstakingly collected from cold storage from signers across the planet, Armory displayed a [failure dialog](http://i.imgur.com/xtjDM8E.jpg) I had never seen before - ""this transaction was not accepted by the bitcoin network"".

Looking at the data that went around people to collect the signatures, I realized those files were 180kB large, so the transaction itself could be as large as 90 kB. (It turned out to be 52 kB large, and I had no way of knowing that.) 90 kB meant a minimum fee - using the previous rules - would be 0.009 coins. But in the current climate, you need as much as twice that. Given how hard it is to gather offline multisig signatures from different time zones, we went with 2.5x.

[Update: it turns out 2.5x is even the minimum now, if you want to be included within two blocks.]

So this transaction has a fee of 0.025 coins, ten US dollars. When creating it, Armory put up a [warning dialog](http://i.imgur.com/48JY36b.jpg) - ""WARNING EXCESSIVE FEE: This transaction has a **very** large fee, 0.025 bitcoin, compared to the required amount which is **zero** bitcoin"".

Uhm, yeah, no. Requiring zero fees for a multisig transaction was yesterday.

Now, the situation with a typical business and choosing a transcation fee goes beyond affording or not affording the transaction itself. In many use cases, you also **can't risk even being in a gray area** where the transaction may or may not get through, and discover 72 hours later that it was dropped from the mempool without ever being picked up by a miner.

Hence, ten-dollar transaction fees merely for consolidating funds. Welcome to the new bitcoin. Can I have the old bitcoin back now, please?

*A note by the translator:*

*[Historically Nine Two Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Consensus) is a political term referring to the outcome of a meeting in 1992 between the semi-official representatives of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan.*

*The title has a two-fold meaning: like the historical Nine-Two Consensus, this announcement shares the same view to seek common ground while reserving differences; Nine Two Consensus is short for Ninety Percent support and Two Megatbytes cap increase. --End of translator's note.*


**[Baseline]**

* We support 2MB upgrade with the precondition of 90% hash power agree. 

Our vision comes from Satoshi's original white paper -- Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. 

The white paper has defined bitcoin as a currency, not a settlement system. 1MB will not meet the requirement for a currency, neither can it satisfy the needs in a settlement network (1MB=7 tx/second, SWIFT=60 tx/second)

This ""Nine-Two Consensus"" is our effort to avoid the split of the community, and ensure the safe and sustained development of this community.

Meeting held Jan 23, Beijing, with people from many Chinese BTC companies including AntPool/Bitmain, Bither, HaoBTC, BTC123, BTCKan, Richfund, Yunbi, SoSoBTC .... 

**[Details]**

As Miami conference has not yet reached consensus, the Chinese community members gathered in Beijing to seek consensus within China. The aim is to prevent the split of community, seek common ground while reserving differences. Core has said that a scaling without consensus is too risky. We will give them the consensus. If the consensus is reached, btc market will be more stable, and in the meantime, future efforts will be more practical.

**Here in this meeting we, the attendees, all agree the following plan**

* When blocks are full, and at that time, 

* if Core has not yet upgraded to 2MB, 

* and if Classic is not enough widely supported, 

* We will do what Satoshi has pointed out https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366 
We will add a code patch to increase the cap from 1MB to 2MB to solve the pressing problem.
This means, as we think, has a big potential to reach consensus, and urge Core to accommodate.


**[Risks in Segwit]**

Core’s Segwit plan will indirectly expand block size, but not without risk.

Firstly, Segwit has only 1.6MB theoretical effect. There’s considerable complexity in code development, which would make other applications difficult to upgrade, or even unwilling to upgrade. If only 50% tx adopts Segwit, the 6-12 months hard work will only achieve 1.3MB effect, which is more or less meaningless.

Secondly, Segwit has large modification in bitcoin low-level logic. While the workload is huge, the community is exerting great pressure. The core team has to work overtime to deliver it in time. 

Bitmain CEO Mr. WU Jihan also confirmed that ""There are Core devs working more than ten hours a day and try to get the work done faster.""

Many of us here has tech background. We know what overtime often means to quality.
The history of bitcoin is not absent of bugs. As indicated here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures .For instance a hacker exploited bitcoin vulnerability to produce 184.4 billion bitcoins in 2010-08-15 http://8btc.com/thread-23642-1-1.html.

Currently our bitcoin is stable and solid. This is a joint hard work of six years. If we push to produce segwit, the risk is too large. We may suffer grievous loss. Bitcoin price may even go down with one order of magnitude. Which is enough to kill the future. 

So we think it’s vital to prevent core from hastily delivering Segwit.

**[Support Now]**

We will do our best to ask all bitcoin companies / users to join us. 
Please reply in this thread to help.

**[Supplementary]**

- Why is 90% a consensused hash ratio?

- Because some hash power is not in mining pools (solo mining or in private pools), which means they cannot express their voice. We subtract this silent portion, and get an actual 95% of total public hash, which means a consensus.

DDoS attacks should have no place in Bitcoin.  I'm a big block supporter, but if someone was DDoSing Core nodes I'd publicly condemn that attack and tell whoever was doing it to stop.  I neither need nor want that kind of 'help'.  If big blocks can't win on their own merits through respectful debate, then they should not win.  DDoS attacks should have no place in the argument.  

Yet when XT came out and XT nodes were getting HUGE DDoS attacks (as in, knocking entire ISPs and hosting operations offline), nobody said anything.

(Yes, I just now coined that term.)

What this shows is that consensus on larger blocks can emerge even though the different user bases have different priorities and run different software.  This is directly analogous to a group of minority parties forming a *coalition government* to unseat a leadership with less than majority support (in a multiparty government).

Note that the change can still occur without forcing everyone to agree on one client (we don't all have to join the same political party in order to win the vote).

Imagine if we forked with Classic, XT, and Unlimited each taking 1/3 of the hashpower in the new Bitcoin.  Together, these three teams ""control"" the ""reference"" and support blocks up to 2MB.

Once we reach the 2MB limit, provided no ""block size catastrophe"" has occurred, we can imagine that the XT and Unlimited users will keep voting for larger blocks, but maybe the more conservative Classic users aren't ready for larger blocks.  Then the 2MB Nakamoto coalition will divide again, large vs small blocks, and the scenario will replay, with the market forcing a new Schelling point to emerge at a higher limit.

I wanted to migrate to something more robust, like a database (e.g. SQLite, MySQL). I prefer tracking and micro-managing my assets myself, rather than hiring an accountant, or letting a service handle it (.e.g Mint).

I'm a software developer, both professionally and as a hobbyist, and I was about to design my own system, when I stumbled upon [ledger-cli](http://ledger-cli.org/), a double-entry accounting system. It's a command-line program, which might not be for everyone; but if it is, I highly recommend checking it out. Another alternative, is [hledger](http://hledger.org/) (imo, not as a powerful), which has a web UI if that's something you prefer.

- http://ledger-cli.org/
- ledger set-up example (not mine): https://github.com/dmp1ce/ledger-cli-example
- docs: http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html

The gist of it is that you store transactions in a text file (or multiple) using your favourite editor, and you would run ledger to read and crunch numbers from the file and display them to you according to the command-line flags you give it. Note that ledger never modifies your files. Example of a file: https://github.com/dmp1ce/ledger-cli-example/blob/master/Bitcoin.ledger


Some of the things I really like about ledger is that it reads numbers into actual rational numbers (fractions), manipulate them as rationals, and convert them back into decimals when displaying the final result to you. This was something that was very hard to do well in a spreadsheet.

It's also currency-agnostic, which I really like, and especially useful when you have accounts in multiple currencies; in fact, I've seen folks use ledger to track billable hours (rather than money).
More info here: http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Currency-and-Commodities

When you want to see the value of your accounts, you can feed it [ledger] the prices of certain commodities via another file: https://github.com/dmp1ce/ledger-cli-example/blob/master/prices_db For stocks, funds, and bitcoins, I have a script to generate/update this file at periodic intervals, and I would just run `ledger -f finance.ldgr --price-db prices_db -V bal` to see the balances in market value.

czan3hp,jensuth,26,"* [Greg Maxwell in his email that set the foundation for the Core scaling roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html):

    &gt; Going beyond segwit, there has been some considerable activity brewing around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called ""weak blocks"", ""**thin&amp;nbsp;blocks**"" or ""soft blocks"".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding **their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question.**

* This sort of thing is mentioned further in the [capacity scaling FAQ](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq/#weak-blocks-iblts):

    &gt; *Weak blocks and IBLTs just say “2016” in the roadmap schedule. Does this mean you have no idea when they’ll be available?*

    &gt; [Weak blocks and IBLTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivgxcEOyWNs&amp;t=1h40m20s) are two separate technologies that are still being [actively studied](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/bitcoin-block-propagation-iblt-rusty-russell/) to choose the right parameters, but the number of developers working on them is limited and so it’s difficult to guess when they’ll be deployed.

    &gt; Weak blocks and IBLTs can both be deployed as network-only enhancements (no soft or hard fork required) which means that there will probably only be a short time from when testing is completed to when their benefits are available to all upgraded nodes. We hope this will happen within 2016.

    &gt; After deployment, both weak blocks and IBLTs may benefit from a simple non-controversial soft fork ([canonical transaction ordering](https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2#canonical-ordering-of-transactions)), which should be easy to deploy using the [BIP9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki) versionBits system described elsewhere in this FAQ.",2016-01-25 09:43:15

One BTC is actually backed by 1 square kilometer of the planet's surface.  When you buy bitcoins, you are buying real estate on Tatooine.  Since the planet is imagined to have only 21 million square km of area (of which 15 million have already been sold),  the price can only go to Meemooine (the planet's farthest imaginary moon).

To be honest, we must warn you that there is not much you can do with land on an imaginary planet of an imaginary galaxy, except buy it, sell it, and imagine what you could do after becoming filthy rich from trading it.

You may have been offered real estate in other imaginary planets.  Don't waste your money.  Tatooine has two advantages that they don't have: it was imagined before all of them, and has the largest real estate agent network in the Universe.  

As for the ISO code conflict with Buthan, that issue will be addressed as soon as we can imagine that intergalactic travel has been invented and the two countries have exchanged ambassadors.

czc1dhr,todu,34,"I read about Hashcash. As far as I understood it, it's only a method to spend some electricity and cpu time to hash one email (including the recipient's email address) to show that there has been work spent on generating it. The purpose to prove that work has been spent on generating the email is so the receiver can be more confident that the email isn't just spam. It just wouldn't be practical to spend so much computational power and electricity and send millions of spam emails.

Ok, good. He invented a clever way of reducing the amount of spam from huge amounts to high amounts. But that is so far away from inventing a currency that I'm quite sure he would never had invented Bitcoin if Satoshi never would have done it. Those inventions are simply too far apart. 

I'm not saying that Satoshi was uniquely special in his ability to invent such a thing as Bitcoin. When the time has come for an invention to be invented, it will be invented. But the Hashcash idea of preventing spam was very well known among people who were responsible to prevent spam in their employers' email systems. Hashcash was released in 1997 and *no one in the whole world* realized that the anti-spam invention could be used to create a currency until 2008. 

If it would be true that ""Bitcoin is just Hashcash extended with inflation control"" like Adam Back claims in his Twitter profile information, then it wouldn't have taken eleven years to go from step 1 to step 2. We would've had Bitcoin in like 1999 or sometime then. The step between Hashcash and Bitcoin is much farther than it seems. It's easy to feel that an invention is ""obvious"" *after* someone had invented it and explained it to you. A kind of confirmation bias.

So no, in my opinion Adam Back is just arrogant when he insinuates that he is the person who has invented the most of the Bitcoin currency. He had intimate knowledge of Hashcash for eleven years, and it still took a different person (Satoshi Nakamoto) to invent Bitcoin.

With that said, when the time for an idea has come, the idea will come. If Satoshi wouldn't have released his invention in 2008, then my guess is that someone else would've released the very same idea in 2009 or at the latest in 2010. But I'm pretty convinced that it wouldn't have been Adam Back. Inventing two major inventions in a row is as unlikely as winning the jackpot of a lottery twice in a row. Inventing things is much more about brute force and being lucky than people think. It's always easy to rationalize how and why you successfully invented something, after the fact. 

**Tldr:** So it's not that I think that Adam Back is especially stupid or anything, it's just that it's very unlikely to invent two major inventions in a row when you're literally competing with every other human alive. **Going from Hashcash to Bitcoin took *the whole world* eleven years.** In fact, I think that Adam Back is annoyingly intelligent and that is the reason that we're having such a hard time routing around him.",2016-01-26 11:30:30

czcdbvw,killerstorm,25,"The capacity problem was well-known from the start. In fact some people were skeptical even before Bitcoin was launched. It's the fundamental issue with Bitcoin.

EVERY node needs to validate EVERY transaction.

Current limit is arbitrary. We can increase it 10x without much bad consequences. But if you expect billions of people to use Bitcoin daily, we need at least 10000x capacity increase, and that's a problem: at that point ordinary people won't be able to run Bitcoin nodes, only corporations will be able to. It will no longer be peer-to-peer cash it was meant to be.

So what do we do about it?

There are essentially two camps:

1. Let's do more research! -- There are some promising ideas which can potentially let us to increase capacity million times.
2. Fix the shit ASAP! -- People are concerned about rising fees and want capacity to be increased immediately without any complex developments.

Most developers are in camp #1. They don't see issues with fees rising from $0.01 to $0.02 per transaction and want more time for research and optimization.

Most users(?) are in camp #2. They don't care much about technical limitations and trade-offs, they want transactions to be fast and cheap.

Ideally we should solve the core issue: ""EVERY node needs to validate EVERY transaction."" It seems to be possible, there are several realistic proposals. But it will take several years to research and implement them. So the question is: what do we do in the meantime?

czb9djp,Emocmo,25,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

I took my eye off of  Bitcoin over the weekend.  Seems we had more fun than I thought we would.

We reverse UP into a column of Xs.  We reversed up from the low of $373 to a high yesterday of $406.  And as I look at the chart it looks like the jump up to $406 was pretty brisk.  I guess I missed some excitement.

So just and the last two moves were pretty “range” at 11 boxes up, followed by 11 boxes down, it doesn’t seem like that can go on forever.  Here are the new figures:

The reversal of a column of Os would happen at $394.99.  This is exactly $5 lower than it is as I type.

The negative breakdown is a price lower than $370.   The price has bounced off that point twice now.  If we break down under $370 it might be a significant breakdown.  That would be a triple bottom breakdown.  That is not a good sign.

Based on the last breakdown count of 21 boxes, it could break down to $300.  That would not be a lot of fun.

The break out signal is at $430.  Any breakout would probably be good for few boxes, but there is a ton of resistance right above the breakout point.

The formation is six columns wide.  Again, this is wider than normal for Bitcoin, but only one or two columns wider.  Remember, the last formation was ten columns wide.  When that failed to break a triple top, it pretty much fell like a rock.  Whether that was external matters or just the perceived value of the trade, the width of the formation indicated a pretty significant move when it happened.  

My prediction?  If you look at the big fall from the last major formation—the one with the long pole breakdown warning, the price fell 21 boxes.  Usually on a long pole the reversal is 1/2 the pole.  That would make the reversal point around $400.  So, based on the start of this formation and its present position, we are currently 11-12 boxes up from the bottom—right where we should settle down.  My guess is we continue with this formation around $400 for a while.  

Since the trend is down, I would not be shocked to see us drop back into the mid $300s ($370-340) for a couple of days.  The resistance going up is going to be brutal until it gets over $500.

So, I did not get the job at the brewery.  And, my Patriots lost.  Combine that with just enough snow to ensure I have to shovel the driveway.

Its a sad day in emocmo-land.    But the sun with rise again.  My dog loves me.  My wife hasn’t tossed me out.  Life is still pretty good.

Storage, definitely not free if you want things secure. Trezzers cost money, completely offline computers cost money, storage in general costs money.

Transportation being free is weird. If they mean you can carry around bitcoins then yeah, I guess. But I can carry around cash. If they mean transporting between individuals then it isn't free.

Security, yeah the bitcoin protocol is secure. That doesn't help you much if you don't follow the 273 step protocol to actually secure your bi-tcoinz.

Feduciary media. I guess this is a concern for libertarians out there that don't like the banks. Most people are fine with it though.

Recordkeeping. Who has to manage their own fiat records? The bank does that for you. Unless I have the best bank on the planet and these guys are using some dude with a mattress.

Counter-fitting is impossible. Unless someone double spends. That probably doesn't count as counter-fitting in buttcoin land though. One also wonders why it matters from a consumer or business perspective. I have yet to be ripped off by counterfeit money.

Issuance by an algorithm because math is always the best. That is an efficient way to keep a currency on track.

Payment clearance. Conveniently, it isn't ""cheap"" in the fiat column. 

Scarcity. Fixed currency = good because da gubment can't steal from you! Says the person who disagrees with modern economic theory.

czd6l1h,nullc,93,"On the topic of ""denouncement"", I think this note is regrettable: It is both unprofessional and a crass move of disrespect towards fellow human beings.

I called out Theymos on the moderation policy and counciled against it. Yet the poster here claims there was only silence; this is flat out untrue.

At the same time, when moderation was temporarily discontinued before aggressive moderation was first instituted the flooding attacks on the /r/bitcoin were so bad that you could flip three pages before seeing something that wasn't an (often untrue) advertisement for Bitcoin XT along with a myriad violent insults and conspiracy theories. That same embarrassing non-professionalism and near zero SNR now plague the alternative subforum today.

How loud can I continue to oppose when the ""uncensored"" alternative is both uselessly bad and, yet, also ""censored"" itself?  I still think the aggressive moderation is a bad move, but would we be better served by turning /r/bitcoin into /r/btc? Absolutely not: And even to someone who believed that the /r/btc way was better: it already exists.  Probably the most essential element of free speech online-- where the ability to speak at all is nearly a physically inalienable right-- is being able to have your own space, where attacks can't bury your words in tripe. In that sense the constant bragading attacks on /r/bitcoin and against the Bitcoin Core project's own communication tools are some of the worst kind of censorship possible online.

Against this backdrop; people from the bigger-blocks-at-any-cost community run with smears and insults against myself and the longstanding developers of the Bitcoin software and protocol the network uses today. Though that community mostly acts through pseudonymous throwaway accounts, some of the attacks are by well known names.  Does the poster here denounce it? No, not that I've observed.  Do they denounce the threats against my lives of myself, my family and other Bitcoin developers?  Do they denounce the lies being spread to attack my reputation and others who have supported Bitcoin so many years? Do they denounce the flooding of the Bitcoin Core communications channels and github by sock accounts? No, seemingly not.

Of course, there are an effective infinitude of things going on in the world that any reasonable person finds reprehensible. Waging a campaign of disagreement with most of those things has no effect beyond wasting time that could instead be used to inform or make the world a better place.  So, I don't expect the poster to have denounced all the vicious and sometimes unlawful attacks performed in the name of his interests.  But I do find it ironic that he criticizes others on the basis of a higher standard than he seems to hold himself to.

Emotionally, the argument that Bitcoin Core has an affirmative responsibility to denounce a social networking forum choosing a foolish moderation policy makes the lack of his own opposition to all the vile attacks against us conspicuous by omission. Was it the intent to suggest a degree of implicit support for the parallel attacks that he hasn't denounced? I doubt it, but I can't deny feeling a little bit that way. But if I really expected it done, I would have asked in private; not via an unprofessional public list of demands.

312 transactions today. Minimum transaction size was 0.05 BTC (more than 'spam', IMHO). 

When I did 0-confirmation transactions, I had no successful double-spend attacks across over 4000 BTC worth of commerce. I simply waited 1 minute and ran the transaction info I could determine through a neural network. If there were any perceived risks, I would deffer transmission of their purchase until the transaction was in a block. This occurred less than 8% of the time.

You missed my point and the point of the OP. Let me try to say it clearer. Core should give a clear time estimate (like Q3 2016, Q1 2017 etc) for increasing block size. Let me quote the roadmap to refresh your memory on where it stands:

""Bitcoin will be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the risks of not deploying them""

That means a block size increase might happen in 6 months, 7 years or NEVER. You either have missed this possibility as a cause for concern from the ""other side"" and much of the community overall, or you intentionally ignore it. So I'm bringing it up now, and it's Erik's point too. There is obviously a LOT of push for a block size increase, some sort of leadership and resolution on the matter.

czf3fb2,theonetruesexmachine,34,"Let me remind you of a few choice quotes from /u/nullc (all in the last 2 days, *while this statement was being finalized!!*):

&gt; I would also generally describe Theymos that way: His very permissive approach got the bitcointalk forums removed from bitcoin.org, and had Mike Hearn quoted in the NYT accusing him of being in cahoots with criminals.
&gt; 
&gt; [That doesn't mean I agree with the /r/bitcoin moderation policy; but Theymos falls fairly to the extreme in terms of his own preferences for anything goes in public venues]


and (emphasis mine)

&gt; Probably the most essential element of free speech online-- where the ability to speak at all is nearly a physically inalienable right-- is being able to have your own space, where attacks can't bury your words in tripe. In that sense the constant bragading attacks on /r/bitcoin and against the Bitcoin Core project's own communication tools **are some of the worst kind of censorship possible online**.

and from /u/luke-jr

&gt; Mainly I mean the accusations do not seem credible. /u/theymos is one of the most anti-censorship people I know, and the accusers tend to be trolls trying to violate the rules in one way or another.



This statement is pretty much lip service at its finest.  They don't concede any of the points necessary, and still insist that /r/Bitcoin is fairly moderated and (get this) **they are the ones being censored** by brigading.


In the meantime you have legitimate users that can't post on r/Bitcoin (like me, banned for life!) who get unfairly branded as trolls and brigaders.  Check my comment history, I am neither.


The right to run and discuss your own forks of Bitcoin is essential to the consensus mechanism it enables.  Decentralized distributed consensus relies on individuals being able to choose their own consensus set freely and without coercion.  ""Moderating"" one of the main discussion channels to remove any posts promoting alternatives is coercion.  Coercion out of the fear of a hard fork, which has happened before with no ill network effects.


Recognize censorship, reject coercion, promote freedom, achieve true consensus.  And if there are two consensus sets at the end?  Good.  That means that's what the users want, and it's how it should be.  

That's what freedom is, not the freedom to have your little safe space against brigading.  The freedom to choose your own protocol with the full information available to you.

&gt;“I think we should do the Segregated Witness soft fork first,” Voisine said. “It will be quicker to achieve consensus. However, Segregated Witness will only give us something like an 80 percent capacity increase, and hard forks take a long time to deploy. The hard fork needs to be readied, and roll-out started quickly after. While I’d prefer it if Bitcoin Core does that, it appears Bitcoin Classic is the leading option for deploying a hard fork. As such, we do support that project.”

If I recall correctly the Core roadmap cites the inevitable need for a cap increase hardfork at some ill defined point in the future. Clearly lots of people, including Aaron Voisine, are sceptical about the lack of any specific details about when/if Core would get around to that.

I think they could quell a lot of the debate if they just put a realistic date on when they plan to raise the cap, and they could scupper any real chance of a ""contentious hardfork"" if they add their own much more conservative version of bip101 to the code with a delayed activation date.",2016-01-28 04:21:56

I'm certain the only reason they are making these statements now is because it's finally starting to sink in that their handling of this has been disastrous, and that there is the very real likelihood that the community is going to kick them to the curb. This is not a step in the right direction, this is them scrambling to get back in control again, and once they do, they'll simply go back to their old ways. They've been given so many chances to arrest this situation in the past and they've spat on every single one of those opportunities.

And in all honesty, does anyone really want to be a part of a group that acts like that? Now that we've seen just how low they'll go, do people really want to reconcile with people that treat the wider community with brazen contempt?

All this is, is an attempt to rebrand by saying ""this is the *real* bitcoin core and we're nothing like the people that run and represented the *old* bitcoin core"". We all know for a fact that they are exactly the same group of people and they are all thick as thieves.

Notice how no-one was called out for their bad behaviour and how they refuse to distance themselves from the misbehaving members that caused all the trouble? The fact of the matter is that the very devs that contribute to core were some of the worst agitators out there. btcdrak was a perfect example of how he caused absolute mayhem within hours of being appointed a mod here for example. Their scheming, how they entertained the idea to sabotage other clients, attempts at character assassination, their open resentment of any development outside of their little clique, their continued use of heavily censored forums.

At the end of the day, the community was not the problem here, certain (but NOT all) devs that work on Core was the problem, and their refusal to admit how badly they screwed up shows they have learnt nothing.

cze740d,oakpacific,23,"Good to see dude that understands his stuff: 

""Segregated Witness is worth the effort even if it provided no block size increase,” Voisine said. “It has lots of advantages. The thing I think is most interesting about SegWit soft-fork technique is the ability to add new signature types such as Schnorr signatures. This means that if elliptic curve algorithms were broken, for instance by quantum computers in the future, we could fix that with only a soft fork, by adding a new quantum resistant digital signature algorithm. The fact that we get a quick, effective bump in block space is just a bonus.”

You know why Gavin likes Segwit? Here are the 3 aspects of Bitcoin he wanted to change most(emphasis are mine):

**1.Have transactions refer to previous outputs by a hash that omits the scriptSig.**

**2.Use Schnorr signatures instead of ECDSA**

   3.Go back in time and have the Bitcoin-Qt wallet use hierarchical deterministic keys.

From: http://interviewly.com/i/gavin-andresen-oct-2014-reddit


Another crucial cryptographical improvement brought to you by Segwit: 

""Multisig payments currently use P2SH which is secured by the 160-bit HASH160 algorithm (RIPEMD of SHA256). However, if one of the signers wishes to steal all the funds, they can find a collision between a valid address as part of a multisig script and a script that simply pays them all the funds with only 80-bits (2^80) worth of work, which is already within the realm of possibility for an extremely well-resourced attacker. (For comparison, at a sustained 1 exahash/second, the Bitcoin mining network does 80-bits worth of work every two weeks)

Segwit resolves this by using HASH160 only for payments direct to a single public key (where this sort of attack is useless), while using 256-bit SHA256 hashes for payments to a script hash.""

Unfortunately when Blockstream Core uses this as their answer to scaling, it's difficult to not demonise it's drawbacks.

In any case, LN can wait, there really is no rush or even a pressing need for LN WRT scaling. I'd much rather work like this were put on the back burner in preference to other far more pressing needs, like the blocksize, making coins more fungible/anonymous, and working on more modest improvements/adoption, better software/hardware wallet interoperation/functionality, etc. . After all Bitcoin already has a huge amount of functionality that still isn't utilised much. LN is a ""nice to have"" feature, but it is hardly something everyone is desperate for.

It's safer for a few reasons: One is the improved deployment-- meaning unmodified systems keep working.  There are many people out running bitcoin software which is not very actively maintained... with segwit they can upgrade on their own schedule. (this also makes it faster to deploy)

It's also safer because it allows resource constrained nodes to opt out of some of the load without dropping out of the network completely-- effectively it relaxes the requirement for global broadcast a little.

Segwit also improves a serious cost alignment problem we have in Bitcoin-- the database of spendable coins is a very costly resource for the network, since it sets the minimum bound on the amount of fast storage needed to operate a node. But right now adding data to the UTXO set is effectively cheaper than signature data, which is very easy to handle.

There are also some quadratic costs in validation, with segwit addresses without adding a bunch of additional hardcoded limits, which, if nothing else, are more complexity for developers to deal with. Adding those limits is part of why the code posted today for the approach Bitcoin classic proposes is so complicated.

Importantly, there is a lot of controversy around blocksize hardforks which has been created by the highly spun promotion of really aggressive ones which would radically change the character of the system... resulting in many people opposed to them right now-- if not on Reddit--, the bitcoinocracy site shows millions of dollars worth of bitcoin signing messages opposed to them.  Beyond the technical issues, great political care is required with hardforks-- they have the potential to undermine the property rights of existing users, and a controversial one could split the network into multiple effectively competing currencies. I wouldn't personally support a highly controversial hard fork unless I thought the alternative was a failure of the system-- and it seems especially foolish to me when we can get roughly the same capacity in a much better way without one.

Bitcoin is a good alternative these days.  You may have noticed that governments aren't too keen on letting you move large amounts of wealth across borders, even if it belongs to you.  Since the Bitcoin ledger is pretty much everywhere all the time, you don't have to worry about crossing borders with it.  All that trouble they went through to secretly move cash internationally in the movie The Wolf of Wall Street is no longer necessary thanks to the blockchain technology.

The St. Kitts and Nevis Citizenship-by-Investment program is one of the best ways to buy your way into another nationality.

I really like the stacked time of contribution part, it's especially interesting-- it lets you easily compare 'most recent' activity in the same graph that also includes overall.

Selfishly, I like this chart because unlike virtually every other one I've seen, it doesn't systematically misattribute my work in the libsecp256k1 subtree to Pieter. :)  

That said, most of my work isn't coding in any case (actually most of those lines attributed to me come from special testing code)-- on a ""coding"" basis, I'm overly credited here.. which probably will feed more of the ""Gmaxwell is a great ~~typist~~ coder but what does he know about anything else?""

(or Wumpus and Jonas simply because they've done a LOT of the UI work; or Jeff's RPC work from when he was at bitpay)... and to some extent ""most of the work"" is review is true for everyone working on Core.

It's a bit of an _interesting_ a choice that it leaves out the wallet and apparently all UI parts (RPC, etc.): it's filtered to include only ""core"" the consensus, blockchain, p2p network, etc. (this is noted on the graph)  I guess it was created to answer a particular question about the more meaty parts of the system.

Any kind of 'lines' metric is going to be a quite approximate measure of contributions. But then again, to non-participants all this stuff is opaque; and that makes it better than nothing I guess.

czgbxhs,rowdy_beaver,37,"Greg, I really do appreciate the work and effort that you and others are putting into Core.  I certainly don't expect Bitcoin to ever match Visa in size or scale.

What we have is a road that allows anyone to drive on it, and it stretches around the globe.  People have homes and are building businesses along the road, and more people are starting to find reasons to use this road.  It is starting to get crowded.  In your role as city planner, you see this happening, and you and your team are making plans to build a highway, called Lightning, alongside this road.

It has taken many years for the customers to build driveways to their homes, so they can get to these businesses.  They are getting comfortable with driving the road and using it to conduct their business.  While everyone agrees that the highway is needed, they also know that they will still need to use the road to reach the highway.

The highway is clearly being built, but it is not yet available for use.  The newspapers are promoting the highway, and telling everyone how great it will be once it is built, and that it will solve all of the traffic problems when it's ready.

But it isn't ready for use yet.  People are asking for the old road to have just another lane opened, to make it easier for them to continue to conduct business as they always have.

Certainly, expanding the road will reduce congestion.  The road isn't being replaced by the highway, and it will still be needed by everyone to reach the highway.

The on and off ramps for the highway haven't been published yet.  The community does not know if the highway will be open and how far they will have to drive to reach it, or when  their destination will have access to the highway.

The traditional Bitcoin protocol is the road.  Lightning is the highway.  We have wallets and QR codes and everyone knows how to use them.  Once Lightning is built, there will need to be a massive construction project to get all of the wallets and tools created or uplifted to use it.  It is not going to be immediate, and it is not going to be without issue.  Everyone is going to need some understanding of how to use Lightning, and they will still need to use the underlying Bitcoin protocol to open and close a payment channel.  People don't know enough about Lightning to know if they will be able to make use of it, and we certainly don't know when it will be available or when the parties we transact with will be ready to use it.

So even with Lightning, there is still need for the Bitcoin protocol to allow more traffic.  That is not going to change, and it is not going to go away.  Ever.

Eventually, if things go as you expect, everything can happen on the Lightning network and it will be seamless to open and close a payment channel.  We're not there yet.  Every payment channel is still going to need the old Bitcoin protocol.

The old road, the Bitcoin protocol, will still need to be maintained even after the Lightning highway is built.  It still needs capacity boosts to handle the thousands of payment channels that will be needed, and it will continue to do so long into the future, just as the Lightning highway will also need additional lanes eventually, too.

The job as a city planner is not easy.  Simply increasing the tolls to use the road is not going to reduce traffic, now that everyone knows that they can transact securely and easily.  It will reduce some traffic, and many will be pushed to other roads.  There are many ways to scale.

I see Classic as a project that will add the extra lane to the road, while Lightning and other improvements are built.  I do not see them as competition.

You probably saw the recent conversation between Samourai Wallet and Mycelium: You develop functionality A, I will develop functionality B and we will share with each other.  Very powerful.  Maybe that same lesson can apply to Core and Classic.  Let one maintain the old road while the other builds the highway.  There are plenty of on/off ramps that will need cooperation, ideas, and assistance from both teams.  Everyone will benefit in the long run.

This is not a competition.

You might aswell say ""the central bank has a committee that sets monetary policy so the dollar is decentralized"".** It doesn't make any sense to view the system that way.

2007: an online store for underground French Canadian hip hop. That was my first experience with a startup. What a disaster. Thank God I was only contracted to do the whole store/website. I think they failed cause the market was too niche, and they had no marketing clue. Also, they were 7 co-founders. Seven!! Every small details to change was a debate. One day I just said ""man, this is fucked up."",  and the guy in charge to pay for the domain and hosting just stopped. 5 months alive: total sale: 2 songs for 99c. Lessons learned: 7 heads are too much. Niche is nice but too niche is crazy. Have a marketing plan or something. 

2009: a real estate listing page. I guess I got swallowed in because the guy had credentials and capital (his family owned an hotel). After 7 months of work, the MVP site was done. It was beautiful.. Then I realized he had no marketing knowledge whatsoever. As soon as we launched, he asked me ""so, where are the visitors?"". That's when I knew I dun goofed. I told him to hire marketers, nope. I told him read marketing books and startup stuff. Lessons learned: don't put too much trust in your Co-founder. Ask him questions about the execution plan. 

During 2009 and 2013, I worked enterprise. Needed the cash, startup life wasn't doing well lol. I gained a lot of experience during that time, both in coding/architecture and management. 

2013: a YouTube competitor. I knew this one was doomed from the start, but they gave me an amazing salary and relocated me to Thailand. I mean, 95k/year goes a long way in Thailand. The home page, which was static, took 13s to load from America. GG. There was a company wide meeting that lasted 2 days, to debate which categories will appear on the page. Yes, including engineers and the secretary. When I offered to fix the stack issues after hours because the Dev environment was shit (if it took 13s to load the static home page on production, imagine how long it takes on a Dev server), they said yes. When  I finished 2 weeks later, the CTO just decided to discard my work, without even looking at it. Lessons learned: if you hire good people, consider listening to their opinions (when we say video on mobile is huge and back it up with stats and research, don't discard it) . ""join and win cash"" is not as good as a marketing plan that you think it is (people think it's a scam). Watch your burn rate (they were burning 300k a month). Keep your staff morale high (2 days meetings is a no no). 

By that time, I left the job. That startup was where I learned the most, in reverse way. Everything not to do in a startup. They ended up going bust after 3M spent.

czgf7ij,BobAlison,17,"&gt; ...The issue is that in the basic Bitcoin system every node takes on the whole load of the system, that is how it achieves its monetary sovereignty, censorship resistance, trust cost minimization, etc. Adding nodes increases costs, but not capacity. Even the most hopeful blocksize growth numbers don't come anywhere close to matching those TPS figures [5K-120K transactions/second]. And even if they did, card processing rates are rapidly increasing, especially as the developing world is brought into them-- a few more years of growth would have their traffic levels vastly beyond the Bitcoin figures again.

This is the fundamental problem. And it's far from theoretical, as anyone who has recently tried to start a full node from scratch knows all too well. I know because I've lost count of the number of posts here and elsewhere that start with ""I just set up Bitcoin Core and took a payment, but it's still syncing. What do I do?"" There's even a Wiki page dedicated to telling befuddled newbies how to abandon the full node wallet for one offering less security and privacy. Running Armory has become a non-starter for many. Even those just trying to experiment with running a full node to learn about and support the network have been shocked at how long sync takes. And this is despite top-notch work in the last year to accelerate syncing while working within the constraints this system imposes.

We can try to wave these problems away with knowing references to Moore's Law, or we can face the reality that's in front of us. The cost-benefit tradeoff of running a full node is moving in the wrong direction - rapidly. Increasing the block size limit will almost certainly compound the problem. Satoshi could only speculate on the problems even modest uptake of Bitcoin would bring. We now have better information than he ever did.

We're going to have to be much smarter about scaling Bitcoin than simply upping the block size limit at the slightest hint of fee pressure.

czgq5v5,tsontar,13,"Great article!

I want to address a couple of edge cases because they're sure to be points of contention from the obstructionists.

From the article:

&gt; I’ll start with the assumption that there is a supermajority (two-thirds or more– comfortably over 50%) that wants one set of consensus rules, and a minority that wants another set of consensus rules. This analysis doesn’t work if there is an even split in opinion about the rules. I’m also assuming that there is a supermajority of both hash power and transaction creators (the ‘economic majority’) on the same side; the analysis is different if miners and exchanges/merchants/users disagree about what the rules should be.

So there are these two edge cases:

1. what about if there's a fork and the network (miners and users) are 50/50 split?

2. what about the case where there's a fork with miners on one side and everyone else on the other?

These edge cases each represent a *failure of consensus* situation.

In the first case, a fork should never initiate with only 50% hashpower behind it, because it's unwinnable.  Honest miners will never produce a block that violates the current consensus rules unless it's *clear* that a majority support it.  If only 50% support it, then there is perforce a ""dishonest"" reason that the miner broke from the pack and mined the block.  So this case really looks more like an attack on consensus rather than the network trying to arrive at consensus through blockchain voting.

In the second case, consensus has clearly broken down when miners are willing to mine blocks on chains that are not being used by transactors, and transactors are refusing the chains offered by miners.  This represents the situation in which miners and users are literally attacking each other for control of the money - for example, this is what would happen if the mining majority decided to increase the block reward - sure, a majority of miners might agree to it, but the rest of the world would view it as an attack.  At any rate, there is a failure of consensus.

""Failure of consensus"" is an important term, because it means that the blockchain isn't in a consistent, validate-able state.  In Case 1, nobody can really say with any authority which chain is recognizably ""valid"" because neither chain has a majority of Proof of Work behind it.  Either chain can double spend the other so neither one is producing tamper-resistance.  In Case 2, the miner majority clearly produces the chain with the most proof of work, but the chain is rejected by the market (price -&gt; 0) which continues to trade on the minority chain, even though it is not tamper-resistant.

In either case, when consensus fails in Bitcoin, *we cannot safely transact* - the network is actually ""broken and unusable / untrustworthy"" because it is not producing a tamper-resistant blockchain.  Without confidence in tamper-resistance, Bitcoin is useless.  Needless to say, this punishes every participant heavily, driving the network towards a resolution.

That is why these failure states should be extremely rare and also self-correcting.

They can also read the wrong name in the envelope; they can also misreport in syndication to subordinate stations (ie: jeb florida bush bro fox affiliate); they can change the database info; there's many ways that the deep state can rig elections.  It doesn't have to happen in the 'collection' phase, and in fact, that's not where fraud has ever happened really.  It's like we have cognitive capture over 'election fraud' but don't know how it actually happened.  It happened at the database level and absentee ballot level and reporting levels. I know this firsthand as I was asked to evaluate a voting systme for a state grand jury in early 2000s.

This is why we should outsource the task of elections to other countries, both friend and foe; disallow the intelligence community or secret societies to get ahold of the information.  Every vote should be published as anonymous and mirrored for confirmation and tallying; every person should be able to securely and anonymously and uniformly (universal system) vote on a highly audited open source platform that they can run from their computer from a CDROM they can burn and verify.  They should be able to vote at any time and print a copy of their vote as a kind of 'tear off' ballot that should match their publicized vote by some identification number.  This id number can't be tied back to them because registration, the vote are stored in separate databases that aren't colocated and the registrant information is encrypted with public key encryption that only certain advisors have access to (which don't have access to voting information); similarly voting advisors don't have access to registration...

You got that right.  Just this week we found a change to 0.12 that Blockstream made in November, that broke Mike Hearn's clever thin blocks feature and its 85% reduction in block propagation data requirements.

Here we have Blockstream actively fighting scaling improvements.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ec73ef37eccfeda76de55c4ff93ea54d4e69e1ec

The change eliminated a long-standing feature whereby nodes would not serve transactions seen in a new block to a filtered peer, if it believed the peer to already have them.  The justification given was the chance of a false positive, which is set at 1/1000000.

Monero retains a lot of Bitcoin's security properties (eg. PoW) and builds on top of cryptographically sound design that is well researched and the properties of which are well known. If you want to trust money to a system, and hope that it isn't broken, then look out for several signs of danger:

1. *Extremely new whiz-bang cryptography:* such systems, if soundly designed, might present the cryptocurrency of the future, but need anything from 10-20 years of academic peer review and experimentation until you can safely trust it.

2. *Systems that lack mathematical proof of claims:* specific claims in Monero are, for instance, that signatures are unforgeable, that the index of the true signer in a group signature is anonymous, that signatures are linkable (to key images) in order to prevent double spends, and that signatures are exculpable (ie. neither group members nor group issuers can produce signatures on behalf of other members). These are backed by mathematical proofs validating these claims. A lack of mathematical proofs for claims that are made by some of these other cryptocurrencies is EXTREMELY worrying.
3. *Layering complexity to solve issues:* often when issues in a scheme are pointed out (eg. edge case breaks, bad incentives, disincentives, ranged attacks, etc.) it is natural to try and solve these issues without abandoning the scheme. More often than not, though, the scheme no longer satisfies the original goals once you start applying superglue and duct tape to it. Furthermore, complexity is the enemy of security - every additional ""fudge"" added to a system is a hole for an attacker to exploit.",2016-01-31 04:23:47

At one time, litecoin and bitcoin were the same with a few variables changed.  Then, each development team started adding new things to each coin and they diverged.  There are more bitcoin developers, so bitcoin got ahead of litecoin over time, with many features never having made it across.  In particular, bitcoin has been ""refactored"" quite a bit over the years to make code easier to understand, even when the new code doesn't do anything differently than the old software does.  Much of this refactoring never made it to litecoin.

While features can be brought in one at a time, there is a trend in altcoins towards making minimal changes and being able to simply copy them into every new bitcoin version.  For example, reddcoin developer /u/cryptognasher has plans to ""rebase"" his coin on the latest version of bitcoin.

czii24c,awemany,15,"Ok, let me get this right:

Your referenced commit, [ec73ef](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ec73ef37eccfeda76de55c4ff93ea54d4e69e1ec) by gmax and sipa curiously came about three weeks (11/26/2015) after this pull request and idea from Mike Hearn to make block transmission more efficient (11/03/2015): 

https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/91

Correct?

What I find interesting is gmax' argument for removal in the commit message:

&gt; Mruset setInventoryKnown was reduced to a remarkably small 1000
 entries as a side effect of sendbuffer size reductions in 2012.

&gt; This removes setInventoryKnown filtering from merkleBlock responses
 because false positives there are especially unattractive and
 also because I'm not sure if there aren't race conditions around
 the relay pool that would cause some transactions there to
 be suppressed. (Also, ProcessGetData was accessing
 setInventoryKnown without taking the required lock.)

Ok, so can you explain what he meant by 'especially unattractive'? This is known to be a bloom filtering method, so false positives are expected, correct? What is 'especially unattractive' about this?
This does not sound like a sound technical argument...

Furthermore, he's as far as I understand talking about possible race conditions causing false negatives(?). Is there any reasonable and evidence-supported suspicion that this is indeed the case?
