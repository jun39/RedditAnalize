d751mf6,Coin-Dance,32,"&gt; Would you mind showing us the statistics?

[Sure](https://i.imgur.com/BGobS37.png).

Of our Reddit traffic for the month of August, 2016:

 - 47.64% are from /r/btc 
 - 49.79% are from /r/bitcoin.

&gt; Also your poll does not include ""Do not care"".

Although the primary goal of the Coin Dance project is to provide a platform for those who *do* care, this is something that we will be doing in the future.

To take this one step further, we'll be adding the option for the community to create and manage their own polls, starting in September. This furthers our goal of providing the tools for those who want to be heard but haven't been given that chance to participate in a meaningful way.

&gt; It skewers the result.

d74sm4s,nsarwark,29,"&gt; I'm no economics major, but returning to the gold standard seems like a horrible idea from what I have read. I will be voting for Gary Johnson, but can you speak to why Libertarians favor the gold standard?

Some Libertarians favor the gold standard, some like bitcoin, some favor a Friedman static rate of monetary inflation.  The thing that ties all of those together is that they are not susceptible to manipulation by governments to inflate away savings or give out special favors to cronies in the way our current central banking system allows.

d746on1,peoplma,22,"&gt;What is the other challenge? Well, security.

Just to throw some numbers out, let's assume a common, modern, efficient yet powerful CPU, the i7 6700k with a power consumption of 133W under full load, and a relatively low price of electricity, $0.08 / kWh.

Electricity will cost $0.255 / day.  So from that we can plug in numbers of expected transaction fees per day, and approximate the number of CPUs that will be securing the network (with the mining-as-a-zero-sum-game assumption).  Let's say we have tons of transactions a day, enough to average 1 BTC / block in fees.

144 BTC / day - $82,800 / day

$82,800 / $0.255 ~ 324,705 CPUs mining, with a return of 0.00044348 BTC per day.

Let's say starting out, we have very few transactions and low fees, 0.05 BTC / block.  Then we get ~16,235 CPUs mining.

Botnets cost anywhere from $200 to $1000 for 10,000 hosts.  So if we only have a 0.05 BTC block reward, we could be 51% attacked for around $400.  If we have an enormous block reward of 1BTC per block, it would be ~$20,000 to 51% attack.

In contrast, it would cost over $1 billion to 51% attack bitcoin.

***

This is fundamentally why sidechains will not work.  They cannot have a block subsidy (or else the 21 million BTC limit is violated) so they cannot be secured.  If an altcoin gets attacked, nobody cares.  If a bitcoin sidechain gets attacked, it will make international news and bitcoin will be (correctly, for once) declared fundamentally broken.",2016-09-01 01:44:38

d742d4m,blockologist,11,"&gt;This is how new experimental features should be done; not by doing dramatic changes to the main network.

Changing a 1 to a 2 is not dramatic. Even changing it to a 4 isn't overly dramatic. Creating adaptive block sizes isn't dramatic. You guys are making it dramatic because it's your political goal to do so. These are not radical ideas, they are only viewed as such by those who are intentionally making the block size small. So you have to ask yourself, why would they do that? 

Decentralization? If that is the case, they wouldn't implement Segwit to get to 1.75MB and possibly up to 4MB under certain conditions. It's not about decentralization, it's about control, and what else?

Oh and PS: if you want to say that the mainnet is not for experimenting with such ""dramatic"" changes, why is Segwit being deployed to it? It is the most significant and dramatic change to come to bitcoin in some years.

It is now evident that there *is* a de facto standard development structure of Bitcoin which decides how it will evolve, and they do not plan to ""absorb well tested features"" of alternative networks, like most of us imagined years ago.

Now, ""specialized"" coins are somehow not ""alternatives"", but accepted (whenever rhetoric necessitates, but not really) as harmonious citizens of this space. Since Bitcoin is no longer an all-in-one solution to the world's problems, but rather just another specialized coin, the market will need to adjust accordingly. ""Fees"" is just a part of the whole situation.

Since most of what gives Bitcoin value is speculation about its future, this all still drives people to altcoins. Arguing otherwise seems like denial to me.

If you are honest, Ethereum is, regardless of the language they use, pretty centralized and imho too much influenced by bankers.

But zCash really is another deal. I can't understand how people like you and Gavin think so high about it. The absolute deal breaker should be this: http://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/83/how-does-monero-privacy-and-security-compare-to-zcash/99#99

&gt; Perhaps the biggest security risk with Zcash is the possibility of collusion among those participating in the trusted setup.

&gt; If all parties involved in the ""trusted setup collude (either willingly or under duress) then there would become a possibility for the creation of an unlimited number of coins without detection. Zcash is so private even the coin supply cannot be verified if the trusted setup described above fails.

&gt; With Monero, coin supply is easily verifiable on the blockchain in real time so any exploit altering the coin supply (other than coinbase transactions) would immediately be noticed.

According to Core/Blockstream, VISA level scaling can only happen offchain. Coincidentally, this fits very well with Blockstream's business model to commercialize offchain solutions (development, consulting etc), where the cofounder and CTO Greg is also one of the leading and vocal Core developers. A very  fertile ground for conflict of interest. 

-

The argument that 100 + developers are coding for Bitcoin is true, and according that logic ""Blockstream does not control Bitcoin"". On the first glance it might be true. **But** a very small group of Core developers also work for Blockstream, who have indeed the [administrative](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-chief-scientist-gavin-andersons-github-commit-access-removed/), [political power and the financial resources](http://imgur.com/a/FlQe6) to determine the agenda how Bitcoin should scale.  

-

Almost all their development efforts are targeted towards Bitcoin offchain. That's why we have full blocks and high fees, which increase the pressure to adopt offchain products. Pretty convenient.

-

So we have two competing layers. Layer one (onchain) is still co-controlled with miners. With layer two (offchain), **miners lose basically their say and have the tremendous risk in being disintermediated** (e.g. PoW change), the risk being out of the Bitcoin business. Alternatively, they mine altcoins as BW and [BTCC](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/772002551336099840) do or plan with Ethereum Classic.

-

At this stage though, there is no product delivered aka [Vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware). Vapoware is a good strategy by incumbents to deter customers (miners) switching software. Switching costs are high due to unreasonable fear of system failure, political maneuvers by agents (BTCC, BitFury) or implicit threats (Core) to cutoff miners from future revenues streams. 

-

In a nutshell: miners like /u/jihan_bitmain, /u/MacBook-air or HaoBTC are in a dilemma and they increase their dilemma with their inactions. In addition, other Bitcoin companies made the mistake not to support a nonprofit development team. If I were Jihan et al., I would test and work with other development teams to have a plan B or an alternative.

-

Though, that changed recently  with Bitcoin Unlimited ($500K funding). The greatest threat to Blockstream is Bitcoin Unlimited. Greg's actions by discrediting BU and intensively arguing with BU developers is an implicit confession that things get tricky.

-

A sad true story.

d77x3fx,litepresence,16,"Ancaps who think that Proudhan was wrong to declare ""property is theft"" didn't ever read Proudhan. 

Illegitimate ""property""; state defined property, in context put forward by Proudhan, is a property obtained by a process whose funding is exogenic to the owner; State entitlement to a State subject grantee for some plot; the structure and cost of court and title maintenance, as well as security, is defined and appropriated by State.   And how is this function funded?  Tax.  Theft; violent State theft enforced by a threat of a thump on the head with Uncle's stick.    The title maintenance is stolen.  The enforcement is stolen.  The adjudication is stolen.   Further confusing the statist notion of ""property"", how did you get there? muhroads?  muhlicencepermitandregulatorycapture?  muhintellectualproperty?   The ""State construct"" of property is theft.   

Every system of property has a notion of abandonment; without such we'd have a situation as we do in bitcoin with ""orphaned"" coins... coins which are lost forever because the user died or lost the private key.  Likewise, if there was no notion of abandonment within Lockean (whether statist or ancap/polycentric) property claims, then various plots of earth would end up orphaned; legally owned by dead organizations; naked remaindermen. 

So we have the notion of ""legal abandonment"" and ""adverse possession"" within the Lockean system of property which pass title onto subsequent usafruct/settler claims in absence of the original title holder.   In the real world, the State claims; expropriates these properties for unpaid land tax and liquidates them at auction.  In a stateless world what state would expropriate and auction abandoned property; would not the sunken ship simply be common again? 

If we were to introduce an stateless society who would pay for title claims?   The state through its thieving exogenically funded functions of court and cop, etc. ?  Or would proprietors; the beneficiaries of such claims, self finance court proceedings in pay to play polycentric local courts to defend their claims?  Would they fund on site security guards, or gasp... form entrepreneurial alliances to other competent individuals for deputized mutualist security of people's widget factory #37?  When the proprietor, or his agent(s), or co-owners, is actively defending the claim, property is no longer the naked legalism of title; it is a possession.  

So then, with the function of courts, security, and title claims  being financed by the proprietor rather than society at large through taxation, ""property"" is no longer naked; it no longer becomes a theft.   ""Property is liberty.""

When in fact such claims are only found to be valid when the property is in a state of ""occupancy and use"" by the owner or his agent; rather than ""abandonment"" we find ourselves coming full circle back to Proudhan: legitimate property claims can only be maintained through an act of possession.

The only real difference between left and right anarchism is

Right: property owner plaintiff is entitled to property claim in court of opinion if trespassing possessor fails to show abandonment.

Left: property owner plaintiff is entitled to property claim in court of opinion if owner shows continuity of occupation and use of what was, is, and shall be the commons.

A unless court of public opinion B 
B unless court of public opinion A

There's little real difference except the assumption of commons vs the assumption of trespass; and this assumption forms spectrum not a black and white field. 

The spectrum of what constitutes private vs common property between here, the sun, and the far edge of the universe compels the story towards an assumption of commons where ever the frontier between civilization and the wild arises.  How long need a ship be sunk before it falls into the commons of the deep?  How long need a moon base be abandoned?  How desperate must a man be before he takes refuge in the bubble of air in a long sunken ship?   As the answer varies from individual perspective to individual perspective so to is the notion of what constitutes legitimate property.  Here in we find the spectrum of left and right anarchy; reality of local opinion might represent a point on a bell curve of local cultural conception of abandonment and commons.

My takeaway is this: as small as alts are compared to bitcoin, bitcoin is that small compared to many other currencies and commodities. That is not a reason in and of itself for bitcoin to go up. But is a 10x rise of BTC against gold unthinkable? Is a 10x rise against the USD unthinkable? Far from it. Bitcoin is still starting from a position of ""fuck-all"" (technical term) compared to gold. 

EDIT to finish the thought: If bitcoin can fix some of its flaws, or find a new use case, or just continue growing as it has (as localbitcoins data seems to indicate), then there is no reason why we won't see *bitcoin* eventually ripping upwards against gold or the USD again.

Monero is substantially (not just technically, but also in practice) more private than bitcoin, and RingCT is coming soon and rounds off a big chunk of the remaining privacy concerns.

I could do a writeup of the known issues, but your best best it to take a look at the work that has already been done in the Monero Research Lab:

https://lab.getmonero.org/

This is a great read (and not too technical): https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0001.pdf

It explains the known issues related to tracing transactions, how well monero already does at them, and where it needs to do better. Most of the ""needs to do better"" areas are being addresses with RingCT and the existing project roadmap.

The biggest area most people need to be aware of, in my opinion, is that spending large parts of your monero wallet balance will involve spending multiple outputs from the same block, which tells the person who sent you monero that you have spent it and which transaction you spent it on. They can't tell from the blockchain who you sent it to (unless you sent it to another address they control), and the amounts can be tricky to determine (due to being broken into a bunch of chunks). Read up on the research to get a good picture.

Then the hot springs dried up, and the town kept going on reputation alone, despite the fact that actually going to that town wasn't anything special. Nothing like the old days. The rooms were overpriced, not everyone could even fit in, and the locals got smug and self-important, because they were living in the legendary town, which was a national wonder and all other towns were second rate - at least in that town's citizens' minds. The food sucked, all the houses were made of glass, so everyone could see everything you did, 24/7, and if you gathered in public or spoke your mind, you got kicked out of the town. The town council was full of self-important douchebags who were bought and paid for by a mining conglomerate who wanted nothing more than to do _who knows what_ to the place, but they certainly raised the rents on the houses in the town, and while there were big plans for a gondola, a tower with a viewing deck, and a new marina, the people in the town only wanted wider roads and sidewalks, because busses couldn't even fit, and you couldn't walk two wide on the sidewalk. Rather than do that, the town council denied that wider roads were not safe, but that putting a monorail in was, even though it had never been done, and only let the people go faster between two places they already went back and forth from. This would enable the same person to make more trips to the same place each day, but wouldn't handle any more people overall. The town council got worse and worse, and then another town popped up next to that one, full of people who had been kicked out of the first town. The second town grew quickly, but its only purpose, understandably, was to complain about what happened in the first town, but the anger in the second town was so palpable that people started leaving it, too, because nobody wanted to visit there either. A few other towns popped up closeby, trying to offer the vision of the original town, with nice places to stay, great views, and affordable rents, but they couldn't agree on basics, and nobody seemed to want to move there, in no small part because advertisements for the other towns got taken down in the first one.

Sounds like you've made up your mindâso less trying to convince you otherwise, but rather wanted to share the reality of being a bitcoin exchange/conversion service in the US:

* Since [March 2013](https://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html), FinCENâthe primary anti-money laundering regulator in the USâhas required businesses like Coinbase to have a [BSA/AML program](https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_007.htm).

* As part of that, we're required to ask about a [customer's sources of funds/wealth/employment](https://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/fin-2010-g001.html).

* If we don't do that (i.e. ""Coinbase should push back!""), we run the risk of [fines](https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/html/20150505.html), losing our licenses and/or ability to move/store fiat currency and potential criminal liability.

So when we ask for information, it's not rooted in any inherent desire to invade customer privacy. It's legally required.

scalability and decentralization.

d7aing5,Quilf,11,"This is a fantastic idea. I've just spent five days synching the blockchain with Armory to learn about bitcoin, and so far the main thing I've learned is that I don't have any. Feel free to teach me something new.

In all seriousness, the main thing that is missing is something to make bitcoin both simple and convenient to use. This is the third time I've looked at bitcoin, and then just walked away in frustration or irritation. And there's no point pretending that I'm less smart or less capable of understanding the economics than the next man. It's just a lot of stuff to take in, and I've got other things going on. 

Once we have that simplicity and convenience, people will start their own giveaways to get you in the door. It won't need to be systematically organised. Cashback in bitcoin will be much, much simpler for retailers to manage than a lot of of the current arcane schemes, for example.

The real serious issue is that there doesn't seem to be anyone willing or able to make it easy and convenient. I mean, sure, the instrinsic concepts are complicated. But the same is true for any other economics. The same is true for electrical engineering. 

People still use ATMs and TVs every single day without thinking about it.

The key is not to get people interested in learning about the inner workings of arcane crypto stuff. The secret is to make it more attractive than the alternatives. 

Nobody would buy a TV if there was a pretty high chance of it disappearing the next week, some sketchy neighbourhoods notwithstanding. Nobody would use an ATM if they needed a password sixtyfive characters long to get in, and they could lose all their money if they typed it in wrong. 

I'm not suggesting solutions, btw. I'm as confused as everyone else, apparently. But I absolutely see Bitcoin becoming foundational. I just can't tell when the transformative moment will be.

d7b3jkf,silkblueberry,11,"Remember when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone and said ""Remember when your phone was just a phone? Well now your phone is a platform that can run any number of applications including a 'phone' app that emulates the old behavior.""? Well, Ethereum did that to Bitcoin. Ethereum allows the possibility of rewriting many applications that you know and love in a decentralized way that doesn't require any middlemen, not just currency like Bitcoin. Imagine Facebook without the company in the middle, just peer to peer social networking. HTTP is hyper centralizing as it requires a central server to coordinate everything. Those central servers are always owned and operated by a middleman (Facebook, Twitter, Ebay, Youtube, etc). Imagine client software talking directly to other clients in a peer to peer fashion, without the need of any intervening servers. With Ethereum they talk directly through the Ethereum blockchain, bypassing HTTP/web 2.0. This is made possible through combining and harnessing human incentives and economics through a cryptographic monetary unit called Ether, the fundamental unit of account on the Ethereum network. Ethereum represents the emergence of Web 3.0.

Ethereum covers the logic piece and some state.  It doesn't handle decentralized routing of static files, or anything that takes up a lot of space.  This is going to be handle by Swarm (some dapps are using IPFS currectly).  Encrypted messaging between dapps will be handled by the Whisper protocol.  Ethereum + Swarm + Whisper = vision of Web 3.0.

An Ethereum dapp has a 'back end' and a 'front end'.  The front end looks exactly like any other modern web app.  Truly, it can be any front end technology you want (ios, android, windows, whatever).  The back end however, is the Ethereum blockchain (for the logic/state piece of the dapp puzzle) For JavaScript, the front end of the app talks to Ethereum blockchain through web3.js.  The dapp must have access to an Ethereum node in order to operate.  The Mist browser from the Ethereum Foundation runs dapps like a browser runs web pages.  Alternatively, there is a project called MetaMask which is a chrome plugin that plugs your Ethereum node into the Chrome browser, making it possible to run fully decentralized dapps right in the browser.

It's early days.  Demo Day is in three weeks and we'll get to see a lot of awesome dapp demonstrations.",2016-09-06 12:45:47

If that is the case (which I do not agree with, but it is self-fulfilling), the natural course would be making a list of weighted desired features and allocating investment towards multiple crypto-currencies providing them.

d7cte8f,Lite_Coin_Guy,19,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, known for their involvement in the beginnings of Facebook FB +1.46% and for having competed in the Olympics â not to mention their 6â5â height, Harvard and Oxford pedigrees and identical looks â were vacationing in Ibiza in 2012 when a friend of a friend introduced them to Bitcoin.

Just as they had never intended for rowing to become such a big part of their lives when they first walked into a boathouse at 15, Tyler says of how they found themselves captivated by Bitcoin, âwe were on vacation, not looking for the next big thing, but thatâs how it always works. Itâs very serendipitous. You donât predict when youâre going to fall in love.â

Describing how they began buying and studying Bitcoin and found themselves âsucked in,â he concludes, âThis was a pretty heady romance.â

In the latest episode of my blockchain and fintech podcast, Unchained, (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio), Tyler and Cameron, chief executive officer and president, respectively, of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and the first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), tell us what else occupied them in the years between the 2008 Olympics and the launch of Gemini in 2015, discuss the importance of regulation in a sector once associated in popular culture with illicit activity and explain why weâve seen so many hacks of Bitcoin exchanges.

Tyler, left, and Cameron, right, and I did not get this dressed up to record the podcast! I forgot to photograph us then, but we had another opportunity the next day when we spoke at the San Francisco Money show. Hence, the more formal attire. Also, it must be noted I was wearing heels. (They were not.) (Beth Kurteson)

Having majored in economics at Harvard, the brothers were intrigued by Bitcoin because they had never before conceived of currencies beyond fiat ones. âIt was a big eye-opener that all of a sudden there was this huge alternative,â says Cameron. âItâs almost like finding a new color. Thinking about all the different aspects of it, we figured this is probably a pretty binary outcome â itâs either a zero or an enormous new opportunity.â
Recommended by Forbes

Having grown up in an entrepreneurial- and business-focused household, they also liked that âBitcoin is both disruptive from a technology perspective but thereâs a tremendous power of social good behind it. So you can both build a cool business or have a great investment return and thereâs the promise of potentially improving the remittance industry or banking the unbanked,â says Cameron.

Even their experience in Ibiza underscored how much of a technological improvement Bitcoin offered. Something went wrong with the payment for the hotel and they realized that overnighting checks to themselves would be faster than a bank wire â not as easy as email.

âWhen you think about how everything else works in the digital age and the way that money does, money really falls short,â says Tyler, saying money acts âpre-internet.â

After studying the space some (and investing in several cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin hardware and software firm 21 and Bitcoin vault Xapo), they decided to become a âpicks and shovelsâ company for the industry â a fully licensed and regulated cryptocurrency exchange that would facilitate a liquid market in digital assets.

Noting that the United States has some of the strongest regulation and consumer protections in the world and that that framework fosters some of the globeâs most liquid markets, Cameron says, âTry to imagine a world without the NYSE or Nasdaq or the BATS exchange. The equity markets wouldnât exist.â (The twins recently switched the designated exchange for their proposed ETF, which will be called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust and trade under the ticker symbol COIN, from Nasdaq to BATS.)

Tyler adds, âEvery investor around the world wants to invest in U.S. markets because theyâre regulated, and theyâre licensed, theyâre trustworthy, they have confidence. If you take that away, the global economy will take a hit like nothing else. We want to create that for Bitcoin.â

They also place an emphasis on regulation and security because they feel that the positive social impact Bitcoin could have, in terms of banking the unbanked or slashing remittance costs, isnât worth anything unless it can be secured properly. Discussing the recent hack of about $70 million worth of Bitcoin from Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex â the second-largest Bitcoin theft in history â they say that operators of exchanges and their regulators need to look closely at the details, to, for instance, see how a âmultisigâ security service (one that requires a majority of multiple pre-authorized signatures, such as two of three or three of five) is actually implemented.

Bitcoin, which initially took off among the libertarian crowd, has many fans who donât like the idea of centralized exchanges, and they often point to the hacks as evidence that such exchanges are a bad idea. âWeâd love to create a decentralized exchange,â says Tyler, âbut â¦ people donât know how to do it yet at the scale and the speed required for the players in the legacy financial world. So when you think about the speeds happening at Nasdaq of NYSE, itâs microseconds. Itâs orders of magnitude [faster than Bitcoin].â (On average, it takes ten minutes for a Bitcoin transaction to be processed and on average an hour for it to be considered irreversible.)

Tune into the episode (Google Play, iTunes, Stitcher, TuneIn Radio, web) to find out what investing behaviors theyâre seeing from professional traders and institutional investors, how the blue-chip Wall Street types are currently getting involved, and what Tyler and Cameron believe to be the next hot thing in the cryptocurrency space.

Plus, Cameron tells us what he really thinks about the efforts of incumbent financial institutions to create private blockchains and Tyler reveals how much money he has in his wallet.

2. Excessive storage and bandwidth demands from a too-big blockchain, especially if popularity explodes. Countermeasure: make scaling an immediate priority.
3. KYC/AML-related bans (or ridiculous regulations) on anonymous cryptocurrency. Countermeasures: prepare to operate underground, and maybe look at less brittle ways to exchange with fiat/Bitcoin/whatever.
4. Bugs. Countermeasure: Every conceivable software quality measure.

I'm only counting things that could have permanent destructive effects or cost existing users a lot of money. I don't think things that just slow down growth are big problems.

I count scaling as permanent because:

1. It constrains other changes you might want to make... and vice versa. Wait too long and you may have lost all the best options.
2. Some solutions might feed into the schism thing... or, as with Bitcoin, the schism thing might prevent a solution.
3. Depending on how it's done, blocks created now may burden every node forever.

I'm not sure exactly what you can do... you've got the transaction, which proves it was taken, but I'm not sure how you can prove whether or not it was stolen. 

Jesus...that's fucking rough. About two years ago the BTC price shot up to $1200 (I remember that distinctly as I had been mining BTC and LTC and sold mine out for a pretty good return.

So, if he took them then... around two years ago, and cashed them out on an exchange into cash-in-the-bank he'd have about $176,400

If he didn't, he'd be sitting on close to $100,000 right now in BTC. 

I suspect, though, if it was two years ago... it was when the price shot up and he probably stole it and cashed it. Or at least a chunk of it. 

I'd first look in r/bitcoin and see if there is any way you can prove this. Because, BTC is essentially cash. It's treated like a commodity. That is real-world theft as if someone stepped into your home and stole your stash of gold out of your safe. The difference is, you can prove things with the transaction codes (that's what makes BTC safer than cash or gold for example). 

See if there is any lawful recourse you can take before you confront him head-on. Check your options. 

If you find that you don't have many, I'd confront the fucker head-on. Hopefully he's racked with guilt for stealing form a dead man. Maybe he held onto the BTC.

d7dvy2p,Itchy_Craphole,33,"*Some shitty itchy analysis ahead, buckle up...*



* Been watching [that 4h chart...](http://imgur.com/a/opXwT) this little penant should be closing fairly soon, today or tomorrow perhaps. 

* Bands are getting tighter and tighter, macd looking good.

*  If the past years upward trend is going to continue, now is the time for that blip up. Everyone is itching for it.... Besides that sep 3rd jump up, we have been very flat. Stability preceeds big moves. Im guessing someone knows something. That was a big buy out of the blue. 

* Post halvening pressure might start to realize... supply is significantly decreased, none of use truly know how each halvening impacts the markets. Sure we can say that only 12.5 bitcoins are being mined or whatever, but it will take time for the market to acclimate. There are speculative pumps and dumps prior, but again it takes some time for the true supply/demand to be realized. 

* No big auctions on the horizon to jeopardize our path.
* The wound from finex hack is starting to heal... slowly.... there really needs to be a regulated, insured, secure, easy to use, mainstream way for the masses to trade this shit. 

* Enter the ETF crap that has been ongoing forever, it does however seem to be gaining attention, perhaps rumors are becoming reality.... That is again only speculative, but I do like to give credence to rumors and chatter as it often tends to stem from a sliver of truth. Just like that bitch who gave jason a hand job behind the bar. Those rumors were true! I friggen knew it!!!!!!!!!  No one smokes a cigarette for that long!!! 

* Election upcoming months. Rocky road for all markets in my opinion, trumpie will absolutely have an impact on world markets when he is elected. So who knows that will likely be good for bitcoin, but that is unknown, serious speculation. I doubt enough people actually have exposure to bitcoin yet, for it to become a safe haven asset. I doubt many millionares are prepared to park their money in bitcoin to avoid the brewing storms. Hell, bitcoin is a sloppy storm in and of itself. Balls in china's court as far as I am concerned.

* Remember the Chinese Yuan has been on a fairly steady decline for the past 3 years. And the turmoil regarding the EU and all that brexit jazz....The phillipenes are now in market mania too, who knows... oh and QE is still in effect and wont stop anytime soon. Bitcoin being non inflationary should be a no brainer if it lasts the long fight.... 
 

* All that being said, im still optomistic for the short term and long term. We may catch a few fake out dumpies here and there, but with the tech markets booming (FB, NVDIA, AMD, AMZN, etc. hell, nintendo fcan play too....) ((no reason Bitcoin cant hitch a ride and join the party)) and with the future of automation on the horizon, I believe NFC(near field communication) will be huge. It has a few hurdles and needs tweaking before it is a realistic alternative for everyday use and shit, but we are in limbo.... The awkward stage where we as average consumers and spenders are swiping and sticking chips and apple paying and what not.... It is certainly on the horizon, if I can watch a grey haired grandma pay for her coffee using her iphone and dunkin donuts app, then yes, we can all adjust to that type of everyday payment use....  The days of credit cards will likely be behind us in the coming decades. And in amidst the tech infrastructure, encyption will be king and a lot of us here are betting big that bitcoin will rise to the challenge. Market cap just shy of 10B, we are still incredibly small....  So yes, wildly optomistic for the coming ten years or so...  Exciting times now... In a world where privacy is quickly becoming the hottest and most desirable commodity, bitcoin might open a door to many who are searching for some financial privacy and freedom. 


 
The end, my glass is empty and I require more whiskey.....  
  


Until next time....

Two of Ethereum's flagship DApps are nearing completion and should be live nearer to the end of Q4 or Q1 2017.

Ethereum exists *for* these types of applications.

So far, Ethereum has purely been a speculative vehicle, and is about to evolve due to real utility.

If Augur &amp; Digix do what they state (and I am very impressed with how important an issue security has been taken), we will finally see the true power of Blockchain Technology.

People seem to think of crypto as limited to the size of Bitcoin. 'Nothing will take over Bitcoin' etc. But this is the time where organizations *will* take over the marketcap of Bitcoin via a real need.

The speculative bubble crypto has been in for the past *half decade* is about to end.

Stop trading, start allocating your capital to serious projects. I've made over 1.4K BTC from investing in the Ethereum crowdsale, and have reinvested most of this into promising DApps on the Ethereum blockchain already.

Stop thinking about money and start thinking about projects which can disrupt the world as we know it. For me that is Digix and Augur.

Putting assets on the blockchain and having an unstoppable (democratic) prediction market will change the world, in some ways bad (fewer jobs) and some ways good.

Ethereum and the applications to come will force the world to implement a basic income, so even if you don't invest, don't worry, you won't be working for the rest of your life, I predict. Machines will do that for us.

With regards to price predictions, I wouldn't be surprised to see Digix climbing to at least a market cap of ~$300mm before mainstream adoption even arrives. Augur, I really couldn't put a number on it. The sky is the limit.

1) Size of customer base. Online stores have exposure to basically the entire Bitcoin community.  Local stores could have as little as a handful of Bitcoin users in their entire city/town. 

2) Transaction time.  Even with 0-conf, transactions sometimes take time to propagate. In addition a slow cell/internet connection by either the retailer or the customer introduce a weakest link problem. In person transactions can sometimes take a minute or two to show up depending on the wallet, fee, connection, and so on.  Too many factors make it inconvenient.  Online however doesn't matter much, just don't ship until confirmation... Done.

3) lastly, educating cashiers. Every single person at a local storefront has to know how to accept Bitcoin and be comfortable with it or it's always going to be a slow and painful experience.  Online, as long as one guy gets the whole Bitcoin thing and can sort out any problems, this is usually enough.

TL;DR the delay in transaction broadcasting and propagation, the need to have all employees knowledgeable, and the severe lack of local customers makes Bitcoin a nuisance when it comes to POS transactions.

I wouldn't be surprised if the power consumption per bank transaction is decreasing as server processors become more efficient.

You will never see a drop in BitCoin energy consumption because as mining hardware gets more efficient, miners will just add more hardware and stay at their current power consumption levels (more hashing with same energy vs same hashing with less energy).

Roger Ver's BU pool activated BIP109 on testnet (from the perspective of BU and Classic), then a few months later mined a block incompatible with it. (The invalid transaction was big but otherwise ordinary).

BU's developers' [don't consider this incident of activating 109 then mining a 109 invalid transaction a problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4zqd7g/roger_ver_does_your_bitcoin_classic_pool_on/d6y7cjv)-- they have a theory of Bitcoin operation where participants don't really validate beyond parsability but follow the most hashpower regardless of where it goes... 

&gt; Follow-up question: was Greg Maxwell the first or only person to discover the fork had occurred on testnet? 

Someone posted on rbtc asking why their testnet client was in safe mode and rejecting the testnet chain. I provided them with some tech support in PM.  This was a month after classic was forked off testnet.

(I don't run classic so I hadn't noticed it-- it seems that the developers of classic don't run it on testnet either...)


* Quadratic hashing costs: Because of a design flaw in how the transaction is processed by the CHECKSIG instructions, validating a single transaction could require hashing gigabytes of data-- because the amount of data hashed is related to the transaction size squared. With larger blocks the amount of data that had to be hashed could grow tremendously. Segwit addresses this by fixing the design flaw to keep the hashing amount linear (e.g. 10k transaction results in ~10k hashed for checksig).  BIP109 doesn't fix the square cost behavior but puts a cap on the total amount of hashing in a transaction/block, limiting the bleeding. I don't have much affection for the way BIP109 does that: it leaves in pointless high costs, the limit doesn't reflect the true costs for suitably optimized software, it potentially invalidates already signed transactions... etc. but _something_ had to be done there and it did something, unfortunate BU signaled BIP109 without actually implementing any of the BIP109 logic.",2016-09-10 03:06:37

I am sorry I was away for so long.  The new job keeps me busying during the day.  And I have to fit in all of the other stuff into a few hours when I am not working.  I have to choose between you all, and my wife.  And for now, my wife wins every time.

So, I was surprised the other day when the price shot up.  Thanks to the lousy China situation for that.

The price broke out when it went above $610.  The move upwards was pretty brisk, hitting a top of $631 on the 7th.  The break out should go up to $650-$680 depending on which was you count the system.  If you count a four column wide formation, the high would hit $650.  If you overlay the last break out, the increase could go as high at $680.

Keep in mind, these projections are not based on THIS particular movement.  It is usually best to keep in mind a 30-60 day time frame.

In order for this to reverse back down, we need to see a price under $610.  A break down would occur all of the way down to $540.  I am pretty confident we are going to spend some time in this area, unless there are some monetary issues that we havenât see yet.

On a related note, I urge folks to go to Zero Hedge and read the article posted yesterday or the day before talking about why Bitcoin was popping.  It referenced the capital control aspect of it in China.  I know there are a ton of people who donât buy that.  It was the first time Iâve seen it in a âseriousâ article.

AMD and nVidia were pretty much neck-and-neck on terms of technology before Maxwell. In fact Hawaii was damn good, and heavily underrated when the 290X was new, marred first by the absolutely terrible reference cooler, then the bitcoin mining boom that ruined the consumer market until around when Maxwell came out. 

Maxwell was absolutely astonishingly good. I don't think any part of the chip-making industry has seen such fantastic advances in performance/efficiency *without a process change*... ever. Not that I can remember anyway and I'm not exactly young. Yeah it sucks that everyone was stuck on 28nm for so long but still, holy shit, the jump from Kepler to Maxwell was fucking amazing. Keep in mind that from a technical perspective, Hawaii (GCN 1.1) was pretty much better than big Kepler, edging out the 780 Ti and only being slightly worse than the egregiously overpriced OG Titan. Although (especially with the reference model) heat and efficiency were not strong points, it was better performance per mm^2 and per dollar. Maxwell just shit on GCN and AMD is still playing catch-up. 

I'm not sure what technical wizardry was involved to make Maxwell and Pascal GPUs so goddamn efficient, but AMD is still lagging behind. The good news for AMD, as far as I can tell, is that nvidia has *not* made significant architectural improvements with Pascal compared to Maxwell. The performance and efficiency gains are pretty much purely thanks to the process node shrink and the higher clock speed that it allows. A hypothetical maxwell GPU with the number of cores and clock speed of a 1080 would give you pretty much identical performance. Further, DX12/async support for Pascal appears to still be very weak, if not as completely non-existant as it was on Maxwell. 

Still, though, nVidia made such a huge leap with Maxwell that AMD is still playing catch-up. Polaris was a disappointment because, core for core and clock for clock, it is only about a 15% gain over GCN 1.2 (as seen in Tonga/Fiji). Better than the essentially 0% gain from Maxwell to Pascal, but it needed to be more like a 50% jump to be competitive/better. 

I'm not an electrical engineer let alone knowledgeable enough about what specifically can be done to improve GPU performance, but it is clear that if AMD is going to present better competition to nVidia, they need to make a much larger improvement in architecture with Vega. 

Keep in mind ""big Pascal"", aka GP102, is likely to be far from a max-size die, leaving nVidia room to boost performance in a second round of 16-nm chips once the process is more mature for higher yields. Although they are certainly charging enough...",2016-09-11 15:43:57

d7hdksc,7a11l409b1d3c65,14,"Here is why their calculations are wrong. I'll provide an easy example of how debt conversion into equity usually works. This example is simplified (no conversion discount). 

&amp;nbsp;

Buttrepreneur Ben wants to give poor Africans access to Bitcoin to make humanity thrive. So he starts a Blockchain company. 

* For simplicity, let's assume the company has no equity, no liabilities and no assets. He owns 100% of the company which totally reasonable investors value at $1 million (because Blockchain = future). 

* He takes a loan of $500k, and Carol, the creditor, has the right to convert the debt into equity later on. Ben now has $500k assets (the $500k cash he got from Carol), his equity is 0 and his liabilities are $500k. The company is still worth $1 million - nothing changed, because although he now has additional $500k in cash, he also has additional liabilities of $500k.

* The debt conversion happens. Carol agrees to convert the $500k loan into equity. **Since the company was worth $1 million before the conversion, it is now worth $1.5 million because the debt gets erased from the books**. However Carol gets 33% from the company ($500k / $1.5m) and Buttrepreneur Ben holds the other 66% - stocks of his company got diluted, but his stake is still worth $1 million (0.66 * 1.5 million). 

&amp;nbsp;

This is exactly what Buttfinex was doing. **Except that at Finex, the $500k cash the company got from creditor Carol were stolen**. They are simply not there anymore -  gone. Hence, the value of the company should decrease from $1 million to $500k  (they took a loan, but have no cash in return). 

That's why their calculation is wrong. They are simply assuming that no funds were stolen, so old shareholders are better off. And in Finex' case, it wasn't $500k, but $72 million.

d7hfau8,jesuslovebtc,13,"Buttfinex just announced that they will give their tokenholders the possibility to convert their tokens to Buttfinex equity, for $1 equity value per token. This means that butthurt token holders can be become shareholders of Buttfinex. Here is an illustration of shareholders before and after the conversion. It's basically a convertible debt at a hilariously bad equity rate.

You are probably wondering why the orange piece of the cake is so small. This is because Buttfinex management values their company at $120 million. If buttfinex token holders convert their tokens (face value ~$80 million) to equity, they only receive 40% ($80m / ($120m+$80m)) of the company, while in reality it should be close to 99%.
 
Let's look at Buttfinex' real valuation. Kraken values themselves at ~$17 million, so they are probably worth about $5-10 million (rough, optimistic estimate), and Kraken doesn't have $70 million+ outstanding debt. So let's give Buttfinex the benefit of the doubt and say they had a valuation of $25-30 million pre-hack since they were market leaders. Considering the hack and the consequences on image and debt, plus all the technical debt (they still have no clue how the breach happened), we can guesstimate their worth at ~$5 million post-hack (again, very optimistic since they are basically bankrupt). Raising $80 million capital (they are of course not raising any real money, just converting fun-tokens into equity) would therefore mean that the old shareholders would only hold 5% of Buttfinex, down from 100% before the conversion, and tokenholders would own 95%. Because that sucks for the old shareholders, they simply set their valuation to $120 million, which means that they will hold 60% post-conversion ($120m / ($120m+$80m)) instead of 5%. And all the outstanding debt (money they owe to butthurt token holders) magically disappears :---).
 
But again, no real money is being raised, which means that even if Buttfinex has a valuation of $10 million post-hack and pre-conversion, it doesn't mean that they are worth $90 million after they converted their debt of $80 million into equity. The calculation just doesn't make sense because the tokens are not an asset (unlike cash) because they just resemble stolen money, money that is not there there anymore. Their calculation would be technically correct if the customer funds were not stolen, since the funds would then resemble a real asset (it would still not be fair because - apart from the ridiculous valuation - there is no conversion discount). However, Buttfinex is assuming that the tokens resemble underlying, additional cash, which means that conversion of their token debt into equity raises their valuation by the face value of the debt. Effectively, the hack increased their worth by $80 million to $200 million. Seems like their management just doesn't care about wrong formulas and their customers don't understand the issue anyway, so why not? Tokenholders now have the choice between keep shifting their tokens between each other (free trading fees for Buttfinex) and converting their tokens into worthless Buttfinex equity at a laughable ratio.

In each case, Buttfinex wins. This is good for Bitcoin!",2016-09-11 06:45:17

d7inyel,ferretinjapan,32,"It's funny, OP reminds me of when Bitcoin had it's GPU mining ""crisis"". I fondly remember when Bitcoin mining migrated from lowly CPU mining to GPU. It was an absolute whine feast, a dev released the very first gpu miner, but only binaries, and pocketed 20% of each block as compensation for the increased hash rate, it was hardly theft, all completely legal, even ethical considering the speed improvements. Instead of being thankful, users were fucking rioting :), they complained, and complained, and *complained!*. ""It's not fair!"", ""this is playing dirty!"" wah, wah, wah. But they never once thought that maybe they should post a bounty to make their own miner. Eventually the original dev, puddinpop I think he was, simply got sick of it and offered to open source the code for a bounty. The community rushed to meet the bounty, he released the code, and that became the backbone of GPU mining.

The reason I bring this up, is because I often see many users complain, plead, even threaten devs to ""do this because if you don't xyz will happen"", but rarely do users actually stick their neck out to contribute back to the devs that do all this delicious work. Noodledoodle is a perfect example, and there have been many other instances too, so much so that I often feel compelled to make sure devs get the appreciation, recognition, and compensation they deserve.

It really doesn't take much to give back to the devs, a tenner here or there, and thankful comment, some grunt work to grease the coding wheels a little via testing, documenting, or some other generic help. If they did that, I'm certain things would progress MUCH faster.",2016-09-12 05:51:08

**OP is wrong, if we upgraded the block size to support 50 million transactions per day we'd see very dramatic negative consequences. Decentralization would disappear. OP's post ignores the most significant engineering constraints that are keeping the blocksize limited to 1.75MB (where segwit puts us)**

Man, not this again. This article is very naive, and ignores many important considerations that hold back scalability. This is not credible research, it's some guy doing napkin math with no idea of what actual engineering limitations are holding Bitcoin back. The hard part of Bitcoin is not getting nodes to download historical data, it's getting miners to propagate blocks fast enough that large hashrate miners don't have competitive orphan rates.

Here's an actual research paper which looks at the scaling limitations of Bitcoin. It strongly urgest that 4MB is the largest safe block size, after that &gt;10% of the nodes will no longer be able to keep up with the network. Optimistically, software and moore's law (etc.) have improved the bounds to 6MB since then. But you'd have to re-run the tests to be sure.

http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf

More than anything, Bitcoin is a decentralized system. The core developers work hard to make sure that the strongest point of control in the ecosystem is not strong at all. By and large, they are not doing a good job. 3 mining pools control more than 51% of the hashrate. That's actually a lot better than it has been, but it's not a distribution that you should feel comfortable with. Ideally, the strongest miner holds less than 1% hashrate, such that it's pretty inconceivable that anyone, even a powerful coercive global government, could round up 51% of the hashrate to execute a hostile soft-fork. (to, for example, make sure that ISIS is not allowed to use Bitcoin. If ISIS does start using Bitcoin, I guarantee that we'll see a huge political push to get some centralized regulation in place).

Payment processing is also not decentralized at all. Coinbase and Bitpay process a massive number of transactions every day. I don't know what the coin volume is as a percentage, but that's a huge risk to our ecosystem. It means they can choose to decide to deny your payments if your coins seem suspicious, and that would block access for you to most of the merchants in the world. It means that companies like Elliptic have a much easier time deanonymizing users and harming coin fungibility. And more pessimistically, if one payment processor is handling more than 12.5 unique bitcoins per block on average, it means that they would actually have financial reason to execute long range double-spends (attempting regular 50 or 100 block reorgs using hashrate they've purchased just so they can 51% the network). I don't think the last example is a real risk, it'd kill Bitcoin if anyone started doing that (then the coins you stole would be worthless, and the mining investment would not pay off).

The vast majority of money entering or exiting the Bitcoin ecosystem also goes through exchanges. You have otc trading and local-bitcoins trading which makes up a not-inconsequential amount of the total movement between Bitcoin and fiat, but not enough to be able to say that the act of moving between Bitcoin and fiat is decentralized.

So already we see that there are significant centralization problems in the Bitcoin ecosystem. We're at a huge decentralization deficit, and it'd be foolish to sacrifice that further in the name of scale. No decentralization means that Bitcoin has failed at it's core goal. If you want to sacrifice centralization, go use Ethereum, a coin that has been happy to repeatedly make the centralization-scalability tradeoff. (See the DAO, among other things)

&gt; Last week forum.bitcoin.com published a video about time it takes to download, fully validate and check 7 years, or 420000 blocks of Bitcoin history (from day one of Bitcoin). This is 75GB of data which took 6 hours and 50 minutes to fully validate on mid-range hardware.

Downloading historical data is not where the bottleneck is, you're focusing on the wrong things if you want to scale Bitcoin. Even so, 75GB is a lot of data, most consumer machines that I'm familiar with have much less than a TB. It's fine if you've gone out of your way to pay for extra drive space to hold  the bitcoin data, but if you didn't think about that when you purchased the machine it's going to be a painful to store that much.

&gt; A further goal for home-users is that the rate at which they can process Bitcoin blocks should be at least five times the speed at which they get created. This means that if a system has no internet for an hour it would take around 20 minutes at full speed to catch up (process the backlog and process all new transactions generated while processing the backlog).
Faster is better, but slower than 5 times the creation speed is too slow.

That means it would take a home-user 1 year to download and verify a blockchain with 5 years of history. If you invoke the idea that network speeds and computational speeds grow exponentially, then maybe it'll take the user 2 or 3 months of continuous, 100% resource utilization to download the blockchain. This bound does not do a good job of looking ahead. What is a reasonable expectation for how long it should take to download and verify the blockchain?

&gt; The actual requirements are really low to be able to make payments safely, and fast if you use SPV clients.

SPV clients derive their security from full nodes. It's a tragedy of the commons problem. If everyone is doing SPV, then SPV is actually not secure because nobody is actually validating the blocks. And... everybody does SPV. Merchants do SPV, home users do SPV, even miners do SPV. If things were to get worse (something we're aggressively fighting against), you may end up with a situation where there's only a small number of full validating nodes in the world. If those validating nodes collude (or are forced to collude by their governments), then they can execute any hardfork they desire (including creating more coins), because nobody else is able to do the validation to expose issues. We need to protect our full nodes. There should be thousands of them, and they should be in points of control in the ecosystem (e.g. mining blocks, accepting payments). A full node sitting on AWS being run by a guy who just wants to make sure there are more full nodes is practically meaningless. A full node is only significant if it's refusing to mine on top of illegal blocks, or if it's refusing to accept payments from illegal chains.

&gt; This check takes quite a lot of time and a simple solution would be to decouple the returning of the block and the validation so the miner can start mining optimistically over the check passing (it should pass in 100% of the cases anyway).

This is a security disaster, and hugely weakens the security of SPV. SPV nodes will blindly accept blocks simply because they have performed the necessary amount of work. If the miner itself is not validating blocks before propagating them you end up with garbage like this: https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining

&gt; Next to that is a technique I called ""optimistic mining"", which helps miners by splitting the uploading of blocks into two parts. One is a super fast notification of the new block. Just the block-header. A miner receiving such a header validates it has valid proof of work and then can start mining empty blocks on top. When the full block has arrived and all transactions are seen. All transactions in the mempool are updated to account for the new block, and last, a new block template is created with as many transactions as fit, only then does the miner start mining it.

See above. ""Optimistic mining"" is a disaster for security. And, many miners do perform optimistic mining, however they do it without sacrificing security by mining blocks with 0 untrusted transactions in them (typically that means there's just 1 transaction - the coinbase transaction).

----------

Please, for the Love of God, somewhere between dozens and hundreds of people who have spent years analyzing Bitcoin and working on scalability problems have been beating their heads against walls trying to figure out how we can get from 3tx per second to something that can compete with Visa.

If it were as simple as this post suggests, the solution would have been found ages ago.

It was these types of posts that caused so much damage to the Bitcoin ecosystem last year. People would post scalability solutions that seemed intuitive but were incredibly naive and ignored the fact that **distributed systems are extremely hard, decentralized systems are much, much, much harder**.

If you want to help with the scaling problem, the best thing you can do is educate yourself. And realize that the learning curve here is not 3 weeks and 20 blog posts. It's not 3 months and 400 blog posts. It's going to take over a year to learn all the difficult problems associated with scaling a decentralized currency. Until you've that experience, please defer your opinion on how we can achieve scaling to those who have taken years to study the problem.

I promise that we'll see more posts that say 'scaling Bitcoin is easy, just look at this stuff!', and I promise that scaling Bitcoin is not easy, it's not as simple as that one blog post made it sound, and if someone did find a golden bullet to achieve scalability you'd know. You'd know because every expert in the space would be talking about it, posting about it, blogging about it, and they would be really excited.",2016-09-13 01:02:13

d7l69q1,todu,53,"Gregory Maxwell (co-founder and CTO of Blockstream) said that he had ""proven mathematically that Bitcoin can never work"" when he first heard about Bitcoin. That means he read about how it works, did some math, concluded that it can never work, and said so publicly (Does anyone have a source for this? I'd like to read where he said this).

Adam Back (co-founder and President of Blockstream) said that he was contacted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself by email before Satoshi mined the genesis block. (Does anyone have a source where Adam has confirmed this email?). In that email Satoshi is said to have thanked Adam for creating Hashcash which Bitcoin used. As far as I know Adam read that email and yet he concluded that ""Bitcoin can never work"".

Bitcoin's genesis block is mined in January 2009. The exchange rate of Bitcoin reaches 1 000 USD / XBT in November 2013. Adam Back buys his first bitcoin according to an interview where Adam said so. (Does anyone have a link to this interview?).

In November 2014 Gregory and Adam found the Blockstream company with a few others. They soon employ almost all of the most active Bitcoin Core developers.

So both Gregory and Adam have changed their minds about ""Bitcoin can never work"". They now say that Bitcoin *can* work. But they *still* say that on-chain scaling can never work. 

That is just another way of saying that ""Bitcoin can never work"". 

So the current decision makers for how the Bitcoin protocol should be and is developed *never understood how Bitcoin is supposed to work*. It was always intended to scale to Visa transcation volumes (at least 60 000 tps) **on-chain** according to Satoshi and practically all early adopters before Blockstream was founded.

People used to say that airplanes would never work and that experimenting with building them was a waste of time. Would you want such people to be in charge of making ""improvements"" to the airplane that you're using? Imagine if they said that ""Airplane scaling can never work on-wing. We need to keep the length of the wing at exactly 1 meter because that was the original wing length chosen by the inventor of the airplane. All scaling that can safely be done must be in the engine, the wheels etc.""

Gregory and Adam are two such people for Bitcoin. And we're using their ""improved"" airplanes, and investing our money in their airplane company. In the meantime multiple people who understand that 1 meter wings are not crucial have begun building their own airplanes and airplane companies without this arbitrary limit that was supposed to exist only for the very first airplane.",2016-09-14 01:39:15

d7ltwi6,OPSEC_KING,19,"First off, why are you wanting to deposit cash into your bank account? 

Cash is the ultimate end product you want. Remember, anything that is deposited into a bank account is logged and kept forever. Each deposit is essentially a nail in your coffin and something you may have to explain if shit ever hit the fan.

Here's a few notes and pointers, coming from a seasoned veteran:


* Deposit the bare minimum you need

* Make it seem like a recurring thing, like a paycheck. ($500 every Wednesday, etc)
* Random sporadic events and large amounts are what causes and raises suspicion. 
* Calculate the averages of your monthly deposits to your account. Try not to exceed this amount by more than 20% in a given month. If you deposited $10,000 in total for last month, you do not want to deposit anymore than $12,000 for this month. (So if you deposit $12,000 this month then you can deposit $14,400 next month, etc)
* Always, and I mean always, make sure your physical cash deposits are less than 50% of all of your deposits. So if you deposit $5,000 in paper checks / money orders / electronic deposits for the month, do not deposit more than $5,000 in cash for that month. If you only have cash, then just purchase money orders or get creative.
* Do not spend more than 75% of your deposit within 1 week. If you deposit $1,000 on Monday, do not spend more than $750 by the following Monday. Let your deposits mature.
* Do not keep an empty bank account.
* All of these points are relative to automatic algorithms that banks deploy to catch suspicious activity and calculate risk.
* Most checking accounts come side-by-side with a savings account. Utilize it. Normal people save money.
* Be valued as a customer. Think about taking advantage of any special investments that you can slowly contribute to while being a member of the bank such as IRAs or CDs.

  &amp;nbsp;

Remember, anytime you can avoid using the banks, then do it. You can pay bills or order things online by utilizing non-reloadable prepaid gift cards. These are activated at the counter and do not require any registration. You would be surprised at the amount of services you can also pay by utilizing Bitcoin as well. You can also utilize USPS Postal Money Orders, Western Union Money Orders, or MoneyGram Money Orders. They are cheap and convenient when it comes to converting your cash into a less suspicious method. I religiously used money orders in the past to pay for rent and various utility bills.

If you just really, really want to offload your money into some kind of financial establishment, then I suggest picking up a reloadable prepaid debit card (avoid greendot, they are not good). These are far friendlier when it comes to reporting requirements and privacy. Generally the max load limit is $10,000 for any type of reloadable prepaid debit, and it's for a good reason as well, so they don't have to report as much. You can reload these cards via various methods. ACH Transfers, mailing them a check / money order, cash at the counter, reloadable pin/codes, or MoneyGram / Western Union. If you're feeling really sly then you can also just sign up for these cards with an identity other than your own. You can either get a smurf (someone you know) or go and buy a high quality fullz off of a vendor.

Frankly, in an ideal world, bitcoin would run on a fully encrypted mesh network that would be capable of surviving independent of ISP's and the existing Internet.

We might even want much smaller blocks as well.

There is little recognition for how bitcoin is supposed to survive a truly concerted attack by state actors.  

This notion that you can just keep upping the blocksize limit, increasing bandwidth costs and putting a giant bulls eye on every node without consequence, is naive.

Those who argue for bigger-blocks-now, come hell or high water, have lost all concept of just how revolutionary bitcoin is. 

Today bitcoin has a market cap of only about $10 billion dollars and has very tightly regulated onramps and offramps.  In other words, today, it's a 'manageable' problem for the state.

However, if the market cap were to grow to a 100 billion dollars and people would stop bothering to convert to and from fiat (operating primarily in bitcoin alone and thereby circumventing most existing controls) the attacks from the state at that point would be severe.

Petty payment transactions can, and should, take place on layers built on top of bitcoin via other networks with different security requirements and acceptable levels of risk.

The primarily role of bitcoin should be to establish a way to store value that cannot be shut down or confiscated by the state.

I don't care if the state tracks my cup of coffee purchase, I do care if they try to track, block, whitelist, blacklist, or otherwise interfere with my wealth.

I was at this discussion outside, and the Core supporters were being fairly reasonable. The point of this statement was that Bitcoin doesn't work very well, TODAY, for small brick and mortar payments. Credit cards do, relatively.

Where the two sides of the argument differ is how to make Bitcoin work for such payments IN THE FUTURE. They say Lightning Network and other contraptions. We say bigger blocks (and then Lighting Network and other contraptions).

I fully support Bitcoin Unlimited and despise the Core roadmap, but it was the big block supporters (not necessarily yourself) that were being unreasonable in that little meetup outside.

The government simultaneously underpins theses arguments with the assumption that the government is both an unimpeachable moral custodian, and impervious to the huge, embarrassing and frequent hacks that happen to the government departments, corporations, political organizations, and even the DoD.

d7n003q,Bees_to_the_wall,18,"My conspiracy theory is gaining traction! Hear me out. 

Online games have you connect to a server. Whenever you are connected, you are using a certain amount of bandwidth, very small in a case of a game though, but no matter, it is still a measurable amount. The server also needs to treat the data that is being put through it. This, multiplied by the amount of connected clients, needs to remain within some kind of parameters to achieve the desired quality of service. 

Now, unlike most games I have played before, BDO pretty much rewards you for staying online at all times. You can auto-fish, you can auto-loop to train mounts or to increase your character's strength and what not. I just saw today that you will get EXP by being AFK sometime in the near future since KR version has it. 

If BDO were a subscription-based game, you could argue that the sub you pay covers the connection-related costs. Our version is buy to play, but 30$ wasn't much. The KR version is free to play.

My theory is that the game's engine has a subroutine that farms crypto-currency, using every connected client. It doesn't need to run at your CPU or your GPU's full usage, just enough to run it. Perhaps it shuts down whenever you're actually using the game so you never notice it, but go fishing or train a horse, trickling in the background is that Bitcoin-farming routine.

Ethereum has great support propping the price up. In spite of existential risks to the project through the DAO the price has kept price support in the 10-12 dollar range. That's just a technical - but isn't a bad place to open a position which remains psychologically cheap to the new user in spite of the 1bn overall market cap (12 bucks sounds a lot better than 620). It is also gaining new on ramps all the time - coinbase being the most significant this year.

It is clear that ethereum has the most development momentum within the entire crypto ecosystem, both in relation to the main core project and in terms of allied startups building out the ecosystem than any other cryptocurrency - including bitcoin at this stage (with Gregory Maxwell driving governance and scalability concerns so successfully he may as well have divested his entire net worth into XMR/ETH). 

Out into next year we can expect a series of network upgrades in the form of PoS (which reduces effective money supply by encouraging holding through compound interest gains, accompanied by a major reduction in new coin emission, akin to the Halving in bitcoin - or a super Halving if you think about it) and improvements like sharding / raiden to allow ethereum to actually scale up to become the public ledger of the internet.

Meanwhile bitcoin has the worries of an impending hard fork, a battle coming between implementations (unlimited vs core) with entirely different views of what the bitcoin ledger should become. The incumbents have (unbelievably) capped transaction throughput on the ledger to favour a nebulous concept of decentralisation over drawing in fresh waves of users - whilst damaging bitcoin usability by removing 0-conf transactions and inflicting long delays on transaction confirmations by failing to make even basic upgrades to the network in a timely fashion. Decentralisation is worthy of protection - but not at the price of destroying any potential of the project from attracting or supporting new users. Complete naivety or perhaps Gregory Maxwell has a 'sponsored by JP Morgan' on a t-shirt somewhere. 

Either way, on hype alone ethereum is virtually guaranteed a run at bitcoin at some point in the next 18 months. And with the above headwinds it seems like a speculators paradise for the financial engineers to shift value from bitcoin to other chains as the almost inevitable exit from bitcoin continues (https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage). 

COI: holding bitcoin and ethereum and XMR.

PS: the dirty little secret of the developers who keep saying ether is not a currency is that the ethereum roadmap treats ether exactly as a potential bitcoin-killer scalable cryptocurrency for the internet. They just aren't announcing it as that and they probably won't until it the price spikes after PoS and/or it overtakes bitcoin and becomes obvious in retrospect.",2016-09-15 05:36:19
d7ntko3,DaSpawn,9,"the bitcoin community forked 1-2 years ago.  The bitcoin code forked into multiple compatible implementations at the same time (Classic, BU, etc) as the original ""core"" implementation and development is completely shifted focus away from bitcoin itself and onto side pet projects and future features needed for said projects (SW, LN).  The blockchain itself however has not forked in over 5 years and the control of the miners became centralized and co-opted by politics (as Satoshi feared/predicted)

Currently there is a concerted effort to prevent bitcoin itself to scale by using misdirection and hollow promises of future scaling with side chains (LN) requiring implementation of new ""features"" needed for it to work (SW).  The political control of the miners is preventing the blockchain itself from forking as the community has been trying to move forward with bitcoin itself for years impeded by politics, greed and censorship of information sources for bitcoin to keep people from discussing scaling bitcoin itself instead of side chain projects only like LN

During the community and code fork of Ethereum it was shown that multiple implementation CAN survive a fork and the community will support the fork they see fit, if not both.  

User are being denied the choice of the blockchain they want to follow by forcing through changes using soft fork techniques that fool the rest of the network into thinking new convoluted transactions are valid instead of doing a hard fork and allowing users decide what software they want to run.  this also ensures these convoluted features are forever part of bitcoin, good or bad, broken or not

bitcoin is in a precarious place, there is tons of understandable animosity in the community and blind following/worship of potentially dangerous roads people are trying to put bitcoin onto.  Bitcoin itself will survive, but the solidness and dream of what bitcoin was to become is lost for many people

people were already reluctant to try bitcoin/cryptocurrencies and all of this intentional division of the community will forever hurt bitcoin, whatever it becomes and only keep away what was needed the most for bitcoin to grow, new users

While IPC is not necessarily the trump card many seem to believe, it is still important. More GHz is not necessarily better (unless under the same architecture).

Nvidia's efficiency is achieved by sacrificing many features in architecture and board design, such as double compute (although AMD is also nerfing this I believe), a hardware scheduler, vram (which takes up a lot of the power for a card), processing methods such as asynchronous compute, and so forth. However, these features are more intended to heavier workloads than gaming so Nvidia should put these on their Tesla lineup.

d7onr5c,sapiophile,16,"&gt; Forcible wealth redistribution is impossible without central banking. 

That isn't true at all. Look at the Autonomista movement of Argentina of the last fifteen years - the excellent documentary [*The Take*](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-take/) (full stream at that link) documents them well.

Squatters' movements have also been reclaiming the commons without state or bank intervention for as long as there has been such a thing as private property.

Those movements, and many others, not only effectively redistribute property, but do so directly in defiance of the State, and are often quite violently opposed by it.

But here's the real kicker: socialism doesn't even prescribe ""forcible wealth redistribution"" - that's a strawman. Seriously. Sure, a number of Leninist states pursued such a goal, but Leninists today are a very small minority of socialists - there are many more [anarchists](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secA1.html) than Marxists pretty much anywhere on the planet, and we get a great deal more done than Marxists do, besides.

Now, that's not to say that there aren't many anarchists in favor of reclaiming the commons by whatever means are necessary and just for people's survival (I happen to be one of them), but to say that this is a ""socialist"" tenet is false on its face, and further, it absolutely does *not* require any kind of central banking.

**Socialism is literally nothing more than workers being the owners of their workplaces.** Period. That's it. That's the actual, technical definition of socialism, and it's the one that nearly all anarchists (who, as already mentioned, constitute a sizable majority of socialists worldwide) use the term. It's also how qualified political scientists define it.

So what you're thinking of is Leninism, sometimes also called or ""lumped in"" as ""MLM"" (Marxist-Leninist-Maoism), ""Marxism,"" ""State socialism,"" ""Authoritarian socialism,"" or ""State capitalism,"" this last being the term preferred by scholars like Noam Chomsky and many other anarchists. And those types are, frankly, basically irrelevant in any kind of politics today, except in a few peculiar nations where they have organized vigorously over decades, with some solid momentum from the old Maoist bloc.

It is almost undeniable that if there is anything ""socialist"" about the crew behind Mr. Robot, they are quite assuredly in the Libertarian wing of the idea.

----

So, with that out of the way, let me further contribute why I, as a socialist, also embrace Bitcoin, to quote a comment of mine originally written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/4ipad9/what_about_bitcoin/d30kd6q):

I'm pretty in favor of it in the short- and medium-term, but I'm also quite wary. I think it's a great way for people to stop paying war taxes (and other taxes) and to dismantle the power of banks, etc. It's also extremely useful for fundraising for radical causes - let's say you want to donate money online to Rojava, or the Chicago bail fund, or whoever - if you use a credit card, paypal, etc., there's a clear paper trail linking your legal identity to your support of those causes, which is potentially problematic. Donating with Bitcoin, it's a lot more like just sticking cash in a hat - much, much more private. This benefit also extends to other situations, as well - in a hypothetical, actual revolution-type scenario, a system for moving resources around that cannot be interrupted or censored has obvious applications. There are still privacy concerns with Bitcoin, though, and using it with strong privacy is still somewhat tricky, but at least it doesn't yield a direct line to personal data with every transaction. And improved privacy (often referred to as ""fungibility"" in the Bitcoin community) is squarely on the roadmap for the future, and seems pretty solvable.

I also moderate /r/DarkNetMarkets and I believe that the darknet drug trade has done a ton of good towards harm reduction in the drug-using community. DNM drugs are by and large purer, safer, more accurately dosed, and so on, and when they aren't, there's *infinitely* more accountability of the vendors than in the ""conventional"" drug trade. There are organized efforts for publicized purity tests (even crowdfunded subsidies for testing samples from people who can't afford it themselves), scandals surrounding dangerous cuts that emerge, as well as access to lifesaving resources like Naloxone (Narcan) through the same channels as the drugs themselves. As a medic and public health advocate, I see all of this as a huge step forward.

The last thing that excites my about cryptocurrencies is that it's a great entry point for introducing and adopting other important cryptographic systems and methods. I earnestly believe that widespread understanding and adoption of strong cryptographic tools for communications, security, and anonymity have enormous potential to subvert the current global order, especially as technology becomes more and more integrated into our lives. The Bitcoin community is **filled** to the brim with people who never in a million years would have otherwise used [Tor](https://torproject.org), [I2P](https://geti2p.net), [GPG](https://gnupg.org) and other security and privacy technologies, and because of the network effect, with every person who starts learning about and using those tools, they become even more useful. In that way, Bitcoin might one day be indirectly responsible for killing Facebook (and replacing it with [something better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_software_and_protocols_for_distributed_social_networking) based on strong cryptography and privacy controls), for thwarting mass surveillance, and for facilitating the crypto-anarchist/cypherpunk vision for the future (which is largely tainted by ancapism, but there is also a significant leftist presence in that field, as well). To all my comrades here, I strongly encourage you to start learning about cryptographic and anonymity software - it is one of the best tools in our kit for liberation!

**I have a lot of critiques of Bitcoin, too, though**: for one thing, obviously, currency itself is a problematic thing. Hence the ""short- and medium-term"" qualifier above. It still allows the hoarding of resources away from the commons, and the subversion of the consent of workers and others, as well as being a means to facilitate hired oppressive forces. Of course, this is true of any currency, not just cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

For another, the Bitcoin community itself is quite toxic. Rampant misogyny, out-and-out privilege-blindness, Just World Hypothesis bullshit, patronizing and racist ""charity"" and ""benevolent globalization"" ideals, and just old-fashioned insecurity and bad-faith arguments in defense of fragile egos are everywhere in Bitcoin-related communities online, which I believe are a reflection of the extremely privileged demographics that are its mainstay.

Additionally, even Bitcoin's *best case* endgame may largely just end up being a shift of the power balance into something equally oppressive - from the current dominant ruling class of old imperial hegemony to a hegemony of privileged nerds who are largely clueless about pressing social issues and the world. While pulling the rug out from under 10,000 years of accumulated power certainly sounds fun (and I'd love to see it, regardless, if only because it would be fascinating), as we anarchists are very well aware, it matters little *who* holds the power - it is the holding of power itself that is problematic.

Then there's the oft-cited environmental impact of mining, or even just the baseline resources expended just to run the non-mining computer network. For me personally, I actually believe that this problem is overstated - it's easy to overlook the very real environmental impact of conventional money systems, which rely on the construction, furnishing, and utility consumption of enormous office complexes, an entire physical security infrastructure (including the production and operation of armored vehicles, vaults, and so on), and of course the incalculable but overwhelming impact of middlemen and other inefficiencies that employ millions of people towards what are essentially redundant and unnecessary ends - lawyers, bankers, accountants, escrow agents, fund managers, and so on, which cryptocurrency technologies have the potential to greatly reduce (and in some cases even eliminate). The resources expended to accommodate such inefficiencies are enormous and impossible to survey completely. Funny - I feel pretty gross talking about ""inefficiencies"" like this... feels a bit too much like ancapery to my sensitive and thoroughly communist brain. But it's true. Anyway, so while ""well this *other* way isn't any better"" is a really frustrating and stupid argument, it is in this case at least appropriate, and my best estimate is that the environmental impact of cryptocurrency is probably approximately a wash, on this front, or possibly a modest net improvement.

All in all, I'm excited by cryptocurrencies, and I really think more folks from our movement should get on board. The community issues I mention above are (partially...) solvable by changing the constituents of that community, and this is a technology that has a lot of benefits for us, if we manage not to be too turned off by its shortcomings. There is also, of course, the small but not dismissible chance that cryptocurrencies could really take off in a big way, and largely supplant traditional money, in which case it would behoove us to not be left in the dust as the new global underclass, and claim a significant share of those resources while we still feasibly can.",2016-09-16 10:27:38

d7qh1xb,throwierme,104,"I was early to bitcoin as well. Bitcoiners have been obssesed with making the perfect ""coin"" - so a lot of focus is on the properties of the token itself: how much there are, what the increase schedule is etc... etc Very much in the sense of gold, silver etc. This they believe will make it truly valuable.

Ethereum's focus truly is different. The focus is the ecosystem itself. Bitcoin is trying to compete with the dollar, the euro, the yenâ¦. To buy coffee, alpaca socks, etc.. Ethereumâs focus is trying to create an economy that has never existed before. Itâs creating its own ocean.

The paradox is that by not making that the center and competing in the existing ocean, but rather focusing on its own world, itâs creating value well above and beyond any other token-centric coin â which gives it real value.

As far as Ethereum replacing bitcoin, I am slowly seeing that come to fruition. I have a fair amount of bitcoin but have never used bitcoin for the ""real world"". Why use it for things you can buy with dollars? Thereâs only one way you can pay your taxes, but there sure as hell was only one way you could have bought into Ethereum, etc. If you were smart youâd use it for things dollars *canât* buy.

Most interesting upcoming projects are on Ether. I donât even know any new projects that are significant that are being funded via BTC. A huge change from before when all experimental crypto projects were  raising BTC  and it was *the* standard. With all the dapps coming into play itâs a monumental shift to ethereum. I have only felt it this year. But itâs real.


Tldr: Bitcoin: waiting for ""X"" to accept Bitcoin. Ethereum: building the new X.

d7pr9gl,Vendor_BBMC,14,"I thought I'd let you read the two vendors above before getting to me. I haven't made a burrner account because I don't have anything to hide except my name and address.

I earn about 20% of what the first vendor earns, work 7 days a week, birthdays, Christmas day, you name it. I haven't had a holiday for 7 years. Nobody can come to where I live, and I've gradually had to fade out of my friend's lives.

The ""vendor"" part is very easy, I don't really count that as a job. Making the meth I sell is much harder, a typical batch takes 4 to 6 days due mainly to the many purification steps.

Of course I get high on my supply! Once my brain likes it, it's ready for yours. I can't just make it and assume that its perfect meth without testing it at every single stage. Its been 7 years of research and very hard work for little reward but the good thing is that good drugs can sell themselves.

I chose the one drug which had never taken off in the UK, so I feel like I have to do everything better to sell meth here and I have to make the market and help the UK to develop its own meth culture. When marketplaces have stolen everybody's bitcoin I decided to chase them down on the blockchain.

I don't mind being fairly broke now, because these are early days and I'm probably the most ambitious vendor you'll ever see. I think about the future of DNMs a lot and I've got a clear idea of how I want them to develop,

Having said that, I haven't traded on a DNM for a year, because I felt like I could shave another half % of my meth's impurities, and I had to reconstruct BBMC to be a user cooperative.

BBMC has a simple 2 to 1 split, My customers purchase everything I need to produce the meth except water. Out of every 3g I produce, I keep two, and one goes to pay customers who work for me. Its a very radical but sustainable business model, and my ""workstomers"" can be paid in meth, bitcoin, or any mix inbetween.

I don't shill, bribe people to review me or sneak about under aliases telling lies because I really believe in the quality of what I make and sell, so I'm happy to stick a camera between my eyes when I'm smoking it and let them see exactly what I see, on youtube.

https://youtu.be/oZEZc7wcfkA?list=PLMShB_SM1W3UYodBC1gU818V1mQsofYD8

In effect, prospective customers get to ""be"" me when I'm testing my meth with my headphones in, listening to music on youtube. Its a very honest way to show drugs off, but by song choice and controlling what they look at, they are amused or disgusted by the same things I am.

I can never expand my production enough to become rich, its incredibly hard, labor-intensive and skilled work which is difficult to scale-up, but I have probably the first luxury brand on the DNMs and the only drug worth filming.

In the future, I intend to make a new batch, new videos and list on a different marketplace every week - whichever one puts in the highest bid, or I feel is most-deserving of publicity. But first, I need to show that my youtube channel can market the marketplace I list on so I've chosen tiny Oasis marketplace to prove the concept.

It WILL happen. I just have to somehow reduce demand from my direct customers so I have enough to sell on Oasis. I'm exhausted, and this week was the first week I didn't produce a batch to sell. I'm scared to even look at surespot, all the customers wondering when it will be ready.

d7qgglc,Dunning_Krugerrands,14,"Ether has the technical characteristics which make it a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin. (Faster transaction times, less inflation after POS, interest bearing after POS).  However for actually buying stuff both Bitcoin and Eth are bad because their value vs fiat is so volatile. So merchants that have bills to pay in fiat have to instantly convert crypto to fiat and prices need to be constantly updated as the exchange rate changes. A better solution for payment is a stable coin which tracks the value of a fiat currency or a basket of fiat currencies. These are in development and will probably end up being the primary mechanism for buying stuff on ethereum. In which case Eth will become primarilly an investment asset (because it will have a return though staking and very little will be issued). It will also have a function for M2M payment, contract to contract payment and as a deposit within other smart contracts including collateralising stablecoins. It will thus be an investment asset and the default currency for developers but not consumers.

I would also be surprised if ETH doesn't at least double market cap in the next 18 months. I think there is a non-negligible chance of it overtaking the cap of bitcoin in that time if the network is upgraded and payment processors like bitpay incorporate it. There will probably be a tipping point for payment processors such as bitpay to add this support. Say when the bitcoin : alt ratio drops below 50%. I would also not be surprised if bitcoin retained its current order of cap and the gains were in addition to the existing overall market cap for the entire ecosystem. DYODD.

d7pjcxc,Vendor_BBMC,10,"&gt;As we know the unfortunate that nothing lasts forever...I guess ten years maybe at best? Then all will say we were the revolutionaries

Sites like reddit fulfil a need, so they will always be around. But you're probably talking about the ""Silk Road model"", right?

1. Tor

2. Bitcoin

3. escrow

4. Vendor and user feedback

It will last until something better comes along. Individual things like the currency or subnet we use will change as technological things always do.

I remember when napster was taken down. It was already too late, I knew I was never going to pay for music again. I only traded on SilkRoad for about 7 weeks before the FBI closed it, but as with napster it was too late.

Personally, I think we are right at the start of something. Once you've used a DNM there's no going back, which is why DNMs will take over the vast majority of drug dealing.

The drug economy, if it were a country, would have the second-highest GDP. Lets do some maths

there are 15.8 million bitcoins in existance, worth $600 each. Bitcoin's market cap is less than $10 billion.

Estimates vary greatly, but a recent estimate put the annual spend on DNMs  to be about $300 million. Would this equal the spending of the second-richest country on earth? Of course not. It wouldn't even buy the houses in my street, let alone a town or a country.

I hope this shows what an early stage we are at. We ARE pioneers. So why aren't we doing pioneering things? There are plenty of problems with that silkroad model, particularly how easy it is to falsify feedback, and the problem of trustworthiness.

**The very encryption which keeps us safe from arrest also allows anybody to rip off anybody else, and get away with it**

the second problem is that of marketing, for drugs, vendors, and marketplaces. Its incredibly unsophisticated, entirely text-based, and dependent on word-of-mouth and reviews on obscure drug forums.

Since DPR was arrested, there hasn't been a single significant development. No innovation, people stuck in an outdated PGP mindset trying to prevent DNMs from expanding by keeping them secret, doing LE's job for them.

It won't always be this grey and depressing. One day, DNMs will become part of our shared culture. We will have a second summer of love, and everything will go from black &amp; white to colour. I hope I'm still alive to see it  https://youtu.be/Ypu6Cpy1xXM",2016-09-17 03:02:02

http://business.time.com/2013/02/05/the-federal-governments-128-trillion-stockpile-the-answer-to-our-debt-problems/ 


But more importantly, you should remember that no one really understands any of this, not even people directly in the know.  Global finance is so massive, complicated, and subject to change that what is true now may not be true later, and governments, as unwieldly as they are, are always playing catch-up with reality.  Things like bitcoin take them by surprise; and with a large amount of a country's worth based on mineral and oil rights, they may be in for a massive upheval if new more sustainable energies take control, rendering those oil rights worthless. 


However since the US also leads in technological development of alternative energies, once oil fades as the leader of energy, it is likely our country that will produce the alternative, and thus, we'll recoup a lot of that value. 


Regardless of all that, we enjoy an almost incomporable piece of real estate in the country itself, ideally located, easily defensible, resource rich, with neighbors that do not threaten our security or directly compete with us, as with in Europe. 

The value of that alone is worth an almost incalculable amount.  So whatever you may hear - the US is still one of, if not the best and most secure place to live, and will probably continue to be so for hundreds of years forward. 

EDIT:  Also, one thing to keep in mind - as a citizen of the US, YOU, as a taxpayer, are technically a shareholder in the value of our national assets.  Yes, you pay taxes, and yes, our government is actually incredibly poor in returning assets to the people, but that stockpile of gold they mention?  YOU own a share of that - we all do.  A country is just the sum of its citizens... so out of roughly 200m taxpayers, you own 1/200,000,000 of that 130 trillion dollar wealth.",2016-09-18 12:50:01
d7rhwr4,Somnambulant_Sudoku,173,"First off, this is not an area I am an expert in, so If I say something inaccurate, I hope someone can correct me.

Bitcoin is a currency that is defined by a protocol. 

1. There are 21 million bitcoins that can be mined total, ever. This is by design.

2. Every transaction that happens is stored indefinitely by the blockchain. The blockchain is where the trust that who says they own a bitcoin owns it comes from, and the basis of this trust is somewhat two fold. (Side note: This also means if a wallet is ever definitively linked to someone, there is a permanent record of their transactions) 

3. The blockchain is generated using hashing functions (By definition, a good hashing function is irreversible by anything other than brute force), and part of the input to the hashing function is the last thing prior to it in the chain. This means to forge 1 record, you would have to succesfully forge the entire blockchain. 

4. you can't forge the entire blockchain as everyone has a copy of what already exists. A theoretical 51% attack on the blockchain is also partially mitigated by having historical blocks every so often, so the damage someone with it is partially minimized here.

5. Because everyone has a record of it, anyone can look at the blockchain to see how many have been mined.

6. Using that number alone however does not account for any bitcoins that may be permanently lost. (Data loss making them inaccessible, forgotten wallet paswords, etc.)

When a block of bitcoins is mined, everyone else knows about it at some point soon after through the block chain when a coinbase transaction happens. This makes the public values of each coin known to everyone. 

From all of this, you can find the number of bitcoins that have been mined so far by looking at the blockchain and totaling the amount that have been mined so far. There are several websites that can do this for you. Many of these are full blockchain explorers, others may just give you general data regarding the current state of the chain. You can also do this manually if you want.

d7rhbwg,burninater44,88,"Well,  Bitcoin functions using a very detailed transaction log called a block chain. This block chain has a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever made and is now several terabytes in size. 

One could easily look through the block chain and just look at all of the transactions where Bitcoin miners were paid. 

It's also fairly simple math to figure out all of the bitcoins in existence because they are rewarded to miners at a constant interval (something like every hour) and a predetermined amount which decreases predictably over time. The math would be very easy that way, just multiplication and the numbers wouldn't be hard to find. ",2016-09-18 14:48:48

d7qq380,Taek42,33,"**TL;DR Between the next halving or two, the block subsidy is going to drop low enough that we have something to worry about unless fees are high enough to take over. Incentive misalignments means that the total block reward for miners must exceed the total payment activity of the largest entities on the network.**

Transaction fees are going to become important a lot sooner than 100 years. They are probably going to be important after the next halving, at the longest range they are going to be important two halvings from now, which is about 8 years away.

https://www.smartbit.com.au/charts/transaction-fees-per-block?from=2014-9-17&amp;to=2016-9-17

Transaction fees are currently about 0.3btc per block, which is about 2.5% of the block reward. Assuming transaction fees do not grow (which is a pessimistic assumption - they will grow as they have been growing over the past 2 years) that will be 5% after one halving and 10% after 2 halvings. At that point transaction fees are a big deal.

But we have something more important to be considering. After the next halving the block reward will only be 6.25 btc per block, which means the cost of executing a large reorg is only 6.25 btc per block. If you want to send around large amounts of money with Bitcoin, you will find yourself needing to wait for a large number of confirmations to be certain that the transaction is secure.

This is because the receiver could potentially deploy a large percentage of the transaction towards mining hashrate with the intent of causing a reorg. Or better yet, they could try to bribe miners to attempt the reorg for them. If you send someone 1000btc (say you are buying a house), you can dedicate a full days worth of mining rewards to a reorg (6.25btc * 144 blocks in a day)  and still come out ahead when the reorg is successful.

While it currently seems unlikely that miners would cooperate, that attack vector is a definite misalignment of incentives.

It's even worse if the entity sending out the money is a large anonymous drug market, because they are probably sending large payments to many different people, and hiding them in a way such that we have no idea how large the sum of the payments is. A popular drug market could be sending out payments in excess of 1000btc per day where no single payment exceeds 50btc (this could be even worse if the drug market is clustering payouts to a single day every month - that day could see 30k+ btc in payouts). The drug market is already doing illegal things, bribing miners is probably not beneath them if it means that they can get all of their payments back in an exit scam.

Bitcoin is not secure for large payments unless the block reward is competitive with the payment activity of the largest entities on the network. If there's an entity like Coinbase sending out 5k btc per day, you want the block reward to be at least 5k btc per day. This can be combatted by fighting payment centralization (such that there are no major payment entities like Coinbase in the ecosystem), but today's reality is that most payments go through one of a small number of payment processors.",2016-09-18 02:15:48

d7rhiyh,Dirty_Socks,23,"There are two basic answers to your question:

1. We don't. 

2. It depends on what your definition of ""in circulation"" is. 

The reason for the first answer is that the difference between unspent coins and lost ones can never be known. For instance, Satoshi mined many of the original blocks and thus owns a huge number of bitcoins. However, the coins have never moved. These coins could be used at any moment, he could walk down to overstock.com and buy some furniture for instance. To contrast, in the case of the guy who had thousands of bitcoins on a hard drive and threw it away, those coins are conclusively lost. 

Because Bitcoin does not require proof of stake, any coins can sit away collecting dust and yet be spent at any moment. So we'll never know just how much is ""liquid"". 

Having said that. We can safely make some assumptions. For instance, we can assume that Satoshi is not going to spend those original coins for a long time yet. He may never spend them. We can assume that a lot of the early coins were lost simply because they had little value back then. After all, would you mourn the loss of a hard drive that had $.50 worth of dogecoin on it?

On a similar note, a lot of people have bought Bitcoin as an investment, and can be assumed to be holding it for the long term. So those coins are out of circulation too. 

So to bring it down to the second question: *What is your definition of ""in circulation""?*

I'm going to go with the simple definition and say ""coins spent in the last X amount of time"". And that is actually quite straightforward to figure out. Because of the blockchain's public nature, it is quite easy to track every coin that has been spent in the last year back to its roots. 

So that's all we need to do: take each transaction from the last year, track the coins backward, and give the grand total. ",2016-09-18 14:57:14

&gt; **If we get it to the point where a significant portion of people who don't care about payment methods use bitcoin in the background then we will has massively taken off**.
&gt; at best we have marginally taken off.

I just wanted to say that I think the community should support member's constrasting viewpoints. I think that this response, while it might be perceived as negative to a lot of bitcoiners, is actually a very rational response.

I also agree with it. Bitcoin is *not* mainstream, and I think we must accept that fact. I think *are on the path to* being mainstream, but we are not there yet.

Most importantly, I've added emphasis [bold] to the important part. *That* is the golden goose that we are looking for. Using bitcoin as a rail for interglobal payments, without people even realizing they are using bitcoin.

The real question is, will bitcoin be used for that? Or will the banking establishment just make their own systems? You would have to be living underneath a rock to not see that the banking establishment [is doing exactly that](http://bravenewcoin.com/news/bank-of-england-states-central-bank-issued-digital-currency-will-compete-with-commercial-banks/).

So the question is really, *how* will bitcoin fit into this evolving industry?

It will almost certainly fill a niche category. Bitcoin is permissionless, and needs no authority for its use, so there are endless use cases where bitcoin will be the rails infrastructure that regulated entities cannot use because of cross border legalities. 

The real question is whether bitcoin will remain resilient to the attacks of nation states and economic realities. Will it remain ""decentralized-enough"" ? Will its incentive system continue to function in 2024 after the btc reward drops to 3.125? Will btc's pricepoint offer enough economic incentive during these halvings that it will continue to be a economic viable solution to game theory?

Will the technological advancement of alternative-to-silicone transistor tech keep advancing? Or will we stagnate? Will graphene live up to its hype? Will 3D nano stacking tech continue to see moore's law advancements?

These are all highly philosophical questions that cannot be answered, only speculated upon, but it should give you a good idea of how complex the realities are of our community, and the challenges we face.

d7uc1a7,fluffyponyza,13,"&gt; The weirdness of the monero, bytecoin, and other cryptonote coin launches will always make you question what's going on

What weirdness? thankful_for_today [properly pre-announced the launch](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0) and even [had Windows binaries](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.msg6278986#msg6278986) ready to go for the launch. That thankful_for_today ended up being unable to play with others, and had Monero forked away from him, is just testament to it being a cryptocurrency driven by its community and not by some central, identifiable ""creator"".

At best you can criticise the purposely-crippled hashing code in the daemon, but one of the reasons that we were even able to fork Monero away from thankful_for_today was because we found and fixed that in short order. Further optimisations were [found by Professor Dave G. Andersen](https://da-data.blogspot.co.za/2014/08/minting-money-with-monero-and-cpu.html), who managed to make a bit of money for a few weeks before his optimisations were made public and incorporated into the daemon. Prof. Andersen's [comment on the whole thing](http://i.imgur.com/Kct7epN.png) further clarifies that the Bytecoin scammers could hardly have exploited this in any meaningful way.

It's no surprise, then, that 2640 commits after thankful_for_today was kicked out the tribe the Monero codebase is massively distinct from its origins. And, unlike Bitcoin forks that can lazily ride the coattails of Bitcoin development, our commits are 100% original and don't rely on any changes by anyone else.

Moreover, the well-known DevTome article that investigated loads of altcoin launches ([""An Investor's Investigation Into The Mining Statistics Of Bitcoin Alternatives""](https://archive.is/XCxc1)) concluded the following about Monero:

&gt; On one hand, a 4 year plan to produce 85% of the currency is waaaay better than 90% of the coins on this investigation. In comparison to bitcoin, we see that from its inception from January of 2009 to today, May of 2014 (roughly 5.5 years), bitcoin has produced around 60% of its expected coin totals). In that sense, Monero isn't too much of a divergence.
&gt; 
&gt; **There are no instantmines or premines in Monero**. The smooth block subsidy scheme could be a little bit more tapered towards a slower distribution than it is, but ultimately this coin passes the smell test.

In fact, if we're going to talk about launch weirdness, that same article actually calls Litecoin's launch into serious question:

&gt; Despite being Bitcoin's supposed silver to it's gold, Litecoin does not escape from this analysis kindly. In the first 96 hours, we see a well defined curve that demonstrates instamining occurred, showing 450,000 LTC being created in less than 6 hours.",2016-09-20 16:58:26
d7u8klf,coblee,13,"Thanks dballing1 for your thoughtful analysis. And yes, I've been thinking about adding anonymous transactions to Litecoin for quite some time. Unlike others, my purpose of adding it is less so that you can do shady things with the coin. The main reason is fungibility. It's the one thing lacking in Bitcoin to keep it from being the perfect form of money. I elaborated on that when I gave a talk at the MIT bitcoin expo. (https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/2yasup/charlie_lees_opening_keynote_at_mit_bitcoin_expo/) A currency with fungibility is far superiors than one without. And I also believe that protection of one's privacy is important and for whatever your reason is.

&gt; The fact that Litecoin launched without confidential transactions is actually reassuring. 

I agree. The instamine by the creators of Dash is concerning. The weirdness of the monero, bytecoin, and other cryptonote coin launches will always make you question what's going on. And it seems like zcash cannot launch without a possibility of the team holding on to some keys that let them print an infinite amount of coins in the future without anyone knowing.

Litecoin can do much better, but of course, there's always a risk of adding something that's not well tested or a hardfork (if needed) can go bad as we saw with Ethereum. But Litecoin is in a much better position to take this risk compared to Bitcoin. I believe this is a place we can add a lot of value to the ecosystem.

&gt; Coblee once mentioned that a coin with private features would never be allowed on Coinbase. 

I didn't actual say exactly that. I said it would be hard for Coinbase to justify adding a coin that's sole purpose is to be a currency for DNM. So for example, now that a few DNMs are adding Monero to elude government tracking, it would raise a lot of regulator's eyebrows if Coinbase added Monero to its platform.

&gt; From my research it does appear that anon transactions can slow down the network

It's true that CT will increase the transaction size and slow down node processing. The good thing is that Litecoin has plenty of spare block space. Mind as well make use of it. One thing I am a big proponent of is to make sure that incentives are aligned. So we try to make sure that the fees charged for a CT is proportionate to how much it strains the network to support those transactions.

We are only in the preliminary stages of trying to see how best to added anon to Litecoin. And thanks /u/xinxi in helping with this. Please give us more feedback. Thanks.",2016-09-20 14:18:51

## Flexible Transactions

FlexTrans is a new [transaction format](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/spec/transactionv4.md) that solves all cases of malleability and thus makes Bitcoin ready for future technologies like the Lightning Network. ([blog](http://zander.github.io/posts/Flexible_Transactions/)) It also cleans up a lot of technical debt and provides a clean road forward for a long list of protocol improvements which will be possible equally clean and technical-debt free.

For instance FlexTrans allows us to remove signatures from a block after it has been validated, which in practice means about 75% size reduction. Additionally this technology completely replaces any need for segregated witness.

Flexible Transactions is a new technology and would benefit from more usage and testing. This release does not allow FT on main-net.

d7uw7rg,ThomasZander,25,"&gt; 1) can this be used as a backwards change? (IE converting old transactions to flex transactions to save disk space)

No. You can't change the old transactions at all because doing so would not just break the signatures, it would also break the transaction-id.  And the txid is used to refer to transactions by other transactions.

This is one of the basic flaws in the first version of Bitcoin that FT fixes.

&gt; 2) Once we're using flex transactions and a rescan is required - if we're pruning signatures, how do you rescan the blockchain? 

Notice that I strongly believe in fixing one thing at a time, but doing it in a forward-seeing manner.  What I am trying to say is that FT doesn't prune signatures. You would need some more research on how to do that best before rolling that out. Which means that today all I do is speculate what future software would do and how it would safely remove those signatures.

My guess is that we'll stop doing full signature validation for blocks that have a lot of other blocks mined on top of them, the proof of work is enough security to know that plenty of nodes have validated them before.  
So we can then copy the transactions to a different file, including the block header and the merkle-data for the now-gone signatures.

The end result is that when a node does a full rescan of his on-disk data, he skips the signatures of transactions and only validates the block headers and the proof of work and naturally reads all the transactions, which is why he does the rescan in the first place.

&gt;How do you send blocks to other nodes? (or am I understanding how this works wrongly?)

Two answers;  Currently the transactions just have a different format and the block format doesn't change. So blocks are the same blocks. No change. Just the individual transactions are of a different format. (Transactions are just appended in one lone list in a block)

Second answer is in future when we would do signature pruning.  We'd likely need a new block format if you want to send blocks that do not have any signatures anymore in a secure manner. This is because we are missing some data and that makes the calculation of the merkle-tree impossible. Which means the receiver can't check if the data he got is valid and proper. More research needed. But we'll likely end up with a second merkle-tree. One that becomes something to ignore after enough POW was added on top.

To answer any wondering why we can't fix this before we start to use Flexible Transactions;  as a software engineer its very useful to only do one big change at a time.",2016-09-21 03:07:37

&gt;Money is any asset that:

Eh, passable, but lets look at my Mishkin Money and Banking text (paraphrased):

Money must meet 3 criteria-

1.Medium of Exchange- 

* must be used for transactions, eliminate the trouble of finding a coincidence of needs, and also reduces transaction costs.

* must be easily standardized

* **must be widely accepted** (neither bitcoin or gold)

* must be divisible

* **must be easy to carry** (not gold, arguable on bitcoin)

* must not deteriorate quickly

2.**Unit of account-** 

* **must be able to use as a measure of value/metric to compare goods** (How much does a cup of coffee cost in bitcoins? Gold? Yeah, I don't know either)

3.Store of Value

* must be able to use in the future (i.e. you must be able to save it)

* should maintain relative value to initial value

&gt;And different types of money (USD, bitcoin, gold) compete to fill those 3 roles. 

Gold isn't money. Neither is bitcoin. They are *assets*.

&gt;Stating that money can only exist with a semantic government approval is tantamount to providing the state with a monopoly money. 

wat. So we should instead just barter and stuff again? What the hell is a monopoly money? Want bitcoins? Buy bitcoins. Want gold? Buy gold. Fiat currency is far more liquid than commodity money/commodity-backed money (how easy is it to exchange large amounts of gold for large purchases? Do you own a dump truck?), and bitcoin is [highly volatile](http://www.coindesk.com/price/). I realize that the idea of fiat currency trips some people up, simply because it works *because we agree it does*, but neither bitcoin nor gold provide practical solutions to this irrational fear of dreaded *STATISTM*.

&gt;Money is a technology people use to enhance commerce, no different from oil, trucks, banking, or any other product.

...Except you don't trade in oil, or trucks, but you can buy these things with money. I believe I have sufficiently outlined why money differs from other products.

&gt;It is absolutely regressive to suggest that the government should monopolize production of any other commercial good, so why money? 

I don't think that word means what you think it means. How is this regressive? Also, not everything should be privatized (see water, roads, law enforcement). I don't want to overanalyze this low-effort, nonsensical point though.

&gt;The federal reserve has only been around for 100 years, and guess what? Before that, banks were (somewhat) free to issue their own money, even though they were still highly regulated.

The car has only been around for 100 years, and guess what? Before that, people could ride horses to work! Also, LIQUIDITY MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT? 

&gt;The future of competitive currencies is here, like it or not. 

No it isn't.

&gt;Also, in canada, you can pay taxes and utilities with BTC.

FIAT CURRENCY GET REKT. Nice anecdote, but what is his point? My pawn shop will give me money in exchange for vintage baseball cards. Does that mean we should start using baseball cards to exchange goods?

d7vsdgv,redlightsaber,16,"That's all fine and good, but he's isn't mining anything to make that happen either, or leading a new effort to create such a HF. Right now and for the last few months, the best effort to achieve the eventual goal of dynamic blocksizes has been to support bip109, since the Classic project **motherfucking has it on its roadmap**.

I find that ""excuse"" quite vacuous, as a result, as indeed the Classic HF proposal to 2mb was a *compromise* so that the maximum number of miners would agree to it; and most had, as a matter of fact, previous to the wonderful HK agreement. If by any chance he is being honest about the reason, he needs to wake the F up to the reality of the world, stop falling in the FPTP tragedy of the  commons (the same way /u/ProHashing proudly has), and get with the program that's most likely to end up achieving his goal, instead of complaining that it's not perfect, and continue to see bitcoin lose business, market share, and adoption in the meantime. 

Oddly enough, this ""allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good enough for now"", is precisely the attitude the Core devs have, that has gotten us in this mess in the first place (assuming no conspiracies), without a path forward.

This, while an angry-sounding comment, is coming from someone who's for the most part stopped believing BTC is the future of money, and whose holdings every week continue to shrink in favour of other cryptos. So take my advice /u/ViaBTC ... Or don't, but some months from now when BTC looks  more like an alt than the king of cryptos, and your hardware has been reduced to very expensive space heaters, don't attempt to fool yourself or others about where it was that things went wrong.

d7vxu8g,sapiophile,16,"No way, for many, many reasons:

1. First of all, Tails updates more promptly than Mint. Mint is based on Ubuntu which is based on Debian. Pretty much all of them rely on the Debian Security Team to write the security patches they use. Debian gets them first, and Tails is Debian (with some basic configuration changes). That means that a simple `sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` on the Tails command line will patch your software faster than Mint would. But even if you're not manually updating packages in Tails (which is not really necessary), they actually **do** release a whole new OS version every time a significant 0day is published. With good CVS and management, as Tails has, this is not really much of a hindrance. Tails even very frequently gets updates **before** Debian (and of course, Mint) releases them, because the Tails maintainers are just that badass.

2. Linux Mint contains tons of proprietary, closed-source binary blobs, and makes no attempts to be a Free Software system. This is extremely bad from a trust and security standpoint.

3. Linux Mint specifically has an absolutely **atrocious** record on security issues. From their slapshod, thrown-together bleeding-edge package assortments, to the time earlier this year when their website got hacked and was distributing malware-infected .isos, to the fact that **they didn't even offer signed releases until after that hack**, and so much more. Mint is not intended or designed to be a secure distribution, nor stable enough for production. It is more-or-less for watching YouTube and for playing games in WINE. Some people might say it's also for a Linux newbie or a grandma, but these days I don't even recommend it for that, because it's so unstable and unreliable that it produces a much more frustrating and harder-to-use experience than stable distros like Debian Stable.

4. Tails has an incredibly well-thought-out security design including extensive application-user segregations, hardened compiling of all packages, locked-down filesystem permissions, and in the newest release, ASLR, which prevents many potential exploits of applications. Linux Mint, in comparison, is basically the opposite, and in fact, doesn't even *support* some of those features (at least not without a lot of hacking).

5. UX security: Tails's design is intuitive and pared down to just what a DNM user or cypherpunk might ever want, with easy and integrated access to relevant tools like an anonymized Electrum Bitcoin wallet and the panel GPG Applet, and much more. Using Bitcoin anonymously with other systems, on the other hand, [is extremely tricky and is always prone to easy errors that gravely compromise anonymity](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3353ae/opseccomputer_folks_gotta_stop_saying_use/). Through streamlined User Expperience, security is improved and made closer to foolproof.

6. Amnesia. An extremely useful feature for DNM users. Basically impossible to set up Mint to do.

7. A dedicated OS for anonymous activities helps improve compartmentalization and enforces an OPSEC mentality in the user. A ""one-system-for-all-activities"" model is much more prone to leaks and failures. For more info see http://privacy-pc.com/articles/hackers-guide-to-stay-out-of-jail-opsec-for-freedom-fighters.html

There's even more that could be said, but those are the biggies.

Whonix has somewhat different security parameters from either Tails or Linux Mint, and so is difficult to compare directly, but is also a very good choice for DNM use. Qubes-Whonix is also worth using, though it has specific hardware requirements and requires some skill, but it allows for very fine-grained compartmentalization which is the foundation of OPSEC.

**TL;DR:** Please don't use Linux Mint. If you really, really want to use some system that isn't purpose-built for anonymity (like Tails or Whonix), at least use Debian Stable or some system that isn't made out of poop.",2016-09-21 22:08:00

With productivity decreasing, everyone panics because without that 2% growth, that [$18.8 trillion](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/campaigns/us-federal-debt-what/) in debt becomes a massive freaking problem.

There isn't anything we can do but ride it out over the next ~20 years. (As a whole) people are going to have to get used to a drop in standard of living. Quantitative easing increases wealth disparity and creates asset bubbles. Stocks are absurdly priced at the moment. NIRP punishes savers and the War on Cash is going to pan out much like the War on Drugs - i.e. police raids, only they take your safe instead of your pot. People with any sense will store wealth elsewhere - overseas, precious metals, (*cough*) Bitcoin, collectibles, art etc.


People are also switching to services instead of purchases: renting instead of owning, bartering, cooking instead of eating out, Uber and a bike instead of owning a car, Netflix instead of cable, delaying marriage and kids, living with five smelly roommates and so on (a lot of the stuff Millennials have already figured out).

I'm dubious of the ability of startups to do anything of note (public chain) within the next 1-2 years but the overall ecosystem, if we consider the technology, is going to make major strides in that period.

The ""rogue employee"", as they called him, was their lead programmer and was no stranger to the company or the scene.  In fact, he was often considered(for admittedly good reason) the reason why their anti-cheat was so great.  He was definitely an integral part of ESEA at the time.  

When the bitcoin mining scandal first occurred, their story was that it was an April fools joke and that the lead programmer had floated the idea to one of the owners, 'lpkane', and he signed off on it.  Then when the shit hit the fan and they realized how big they had goofed, they changed their story to pinning it on the programmer, presumably because they realized as a company that they could all go down or only 1 person needed to go down.  I imagine they came to some agreement to let go of the programmer while letting him take the blame in exchange for some undisclosed compensation.  After all, the client they use is their baby so its not like it would be hard to justify some sort of compensation for him.  

Anyone that's been part of the pro cs scene knows well that ESEA is a very manipulative and inclusive group.

d7zcl6q,nullc,34,"After reviewing it, I think this proposal is not a good one-- though I'm happy that it was actually written up as a proposal. It took considerable effort to review because the proposal isn't well specified-- you couldn't implement this from the BIPs because none of the serialization is defined. I hope the proposal is improved to the point that it can be evaluated as a standalone unit, but at least it was documented at all and with some help from the author I was able to give it some review.

Unfortunately, it follows Bitcoin ""classic"" newspeak tradition by being named the opposite of what it does: It actually removes flexibility by ripping out several fields of transactions in order to make the transaction slightly smaller. The result of doing this eliminates CSV's functionality, since there are no longer sequence numbers on inputs.

We can think of this proposal as accomplishing several distinct ends: It's a proposal for transaction compression-- which itself wouldn't be a consensus change at all and which could be done on a link by link basis, it's a proposal to change txids, it's a proposal to change transaction costing,  and it's a proposal to change the signature hashing.

It's useful to break it down along the functions and consider how well it does each:

As a compression scheme it's marred by incompatibly with existing transactions. A good compression scheme would work for all transactions, past and future. It gets about half the savings of other proposals that serve this function because it wastes space coding types and lengths even though there is absolutely no flexibility in most of them (the mandatory fields are all hard coded, and something changing them would be a new hardfork and a new transaction version number). It also fails to exploit common redundancy inside scriptsigs. By welding the compression to the hashing and consensus it also means that its not feasible to quickly evolve the compression according to changing usage patterns.

As a proposal to change TXIDs it only accomplishes the goal of getting signatures out of the ID, no other benefit, and breaks compatibility network wide (all bitcoin using software would require a synchronized flag-day update); despite these deployment complexities it is no simpler than segwit's improvement there: both require an additional commitment to the witnesses.

As a proposal to change transaction costing, it actually makes it relatively cheaper to create entries in the UTXO database than to remove them. This worsens the incentive misalignment, encouraging people to spam the UTXO set instead of cleaning it up.

As a proposal to change signature hashing, it fails to fix the N^2 signature hashing problem, it fails to reduce the size of the revealed data for safely spending. 

I expect that the other proposals for transaction compression will eclipse this because they have perfect compatibility, vastly greater impact, and can be deployed in a highly permissionless manner without creating network flag days and requiring every user to upgrade-- plus deliver greater compression.",2016-09-24 05:35:04

d7zzumf,Joloffe,24,"Thought for the day:

It was obvious to me from a at least 9 months before the bitcoin Halving that it would have a massive effect upon the price. I positioned myself for this four yearly event and did very well from the price surges. Gaming it out I surmised that rather than after the halving as previously, the rises would happen before the halving took place this time, as prior history was factored into the market. 

It seems obvious to me that the same game is soon to be played with ethereum. Let's see we have huge development progressing with a multitude of startups, DAPPS and already ethereum is #2 in terms of market cap behind bitcoin. DevCon 2 showcased how big ethereum is trying to be.

But inflation is high (1 million coins a month) and it will be probably 9-24 months before PoS is released in the Serenity release with synchronous scaling improvements to ~1000 - 1500 tps through sharding. Also don't forget monetary inflation will drop to between 0 and 2% forever and reward those holding the currency who support the network with a validating node (very different from bitcoin nodes and centralised Chinese miners). 

The EF dev's are constantly saying ether is not 'supposed to be money'. But once the countdown to Serenity becomes more clear I would posit that ethereum will experience a super Halving phenomenon. As serenity goes live on testnet and the market can see it works then a massive influx of capital will begin to move into ethereum. Once the highly publicised switch from POW to POS occurs ethereum will be very dangerous to bitcoin. At this point ethereum has a chance to become a 'bitcoin killer' and take the crown. I believe it will coincide with a x10 or greater rally which will be breathtaking in ferocity.

The big question is when are metropolis and serenity pencilled for release!",2016-09-24 19:53:26

Theres three things for me: 

1) Ray the Warden's bitcoin service problem (hot wallet/cold wallet)

2) The power grid on the Eastern seaboard going in and out

3) Price's whole thing with the Congo

Here's what I think is up: 

Esmail is exposing the viewer to the intricacies of bitcoin banking and how bitcoin can be protected through servers, how its value works, what it is. When Phillip Price reveals his eCoin idea to ""Jack"" the high ranking American politician, he is initially told no, he cant get the president to do that, then Price goes on to talk about how with no other alternative, the Chinese are using bitcoin, and what could be worse than not having control over the currency (i wish i had the manuscript with me for what exactly he said) instead they should control the money themselves through eCoin. 

I believe Mr Robot/Elliot always had the desire to avenge his father's death. So he went back and he looked at what was Washington Township. He found that it was a massive computing center created by eCorp, powered by coal (which burned at high levels can cause radioactive waste leading to something like leukemia) which pushed the limits of data storage, computing power, and required a lot of electricity. 

Elliot/Mr Robot's idea is to retool the township as a bitcoin mining center, that way when eCorp falls (phase 2), eCoin fails, the monetary system collapses entirely, all physical records that were to be digitalized are destroyed. Something will need to be introduced in its stead, ""the Chinese are using bitcoin"" already, but transferring bitCoin internationally is tricky business. In fact, in 2008 China made it so that bitcoin could not be transferred through international finance (CALLING ALL EXPERTS ON BITCOIN, please enlighten us on this in particular). So Elliot goes to the Dark Army/WhiteRose in order to find people with the power and the will to take down the powerstructure, who can manage to take control of Washington Township, *siphon energy from the american power grid* in order to mine massive amounts of bitcoin *in the United States*. 

The precious metal white rose is hoarding (mentioned in the last minutes of season 1 between him and Price) is why Price asks Colby to use his influence to let the Chinese have Congo (Esmail even has Colby ask the question we should all be wondering *why Congo?*. Well it could very well be because this metal is critical to a new type of processor that WhiteRose has been able to use at the Township Project, allowing him to harness exponentially greater computing power (thus bitcoin mining ability), but requiring more energy to run (thus stealing from the grid).

Imagine Elliot/Mr Robot trying to figure out a way to take power away from the elite, the same elite that killed his father. Obviously he would want to use their own project, the one that killed his father, against them... if he could find a way. So he does... Or did WhiteRose find him???

Once miners upgrade to it and begin using it for their own payouts everyone will enjoy increased capacity.

d7zxes8,GrapeJamAndFish,15,"/u/YRuafraid I have posted my reply in today's daily thread so we can continue the discussion here; and so that anyone who may be more knowledgeable than I, or anyone with a conflicting opinion can chime in.

The original comment thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/543jvn/daily_discussion_23sep2016/d7ytgga) and my reply below:

&gt;""I guess that's what my main confusion was. Do dapps require a lot of ether to run? When they talk about companies using bitcoin's ""blockchain technology"" it doesn't really mean anything about the price of bitcoin. You can utilize the blockchain with 1 satoshi, it won't put any pressure on the supply which is really what motivates the price. Is it like that with ethereum?""

Fair question. It is difficult to provide any estimates of exact amounts, however I will try and give my best explanation of how gas pricing works, as it is quite a bit more complex in comparison to BTC's fee structure - I hope this gives you a better idea. The total gas required for any transaction depends on the complexity of the computations it requires. Each individual computational step has a hardcoded gas cost, a table with a list of these costs [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit#gid=0). While the amount of of gas associated with each computational step is hardcoded, the price of each unit of gas is dynamically set by users and miners, with the current price of gas being [22.325 gwei as I write this](https://ethstats.net/). The fee that gets paid to the miner for processing the computations = gas cost * gas price. As an example, the amount of gas required to perform a value transfer (like with Bitcoin) is 21,000 gas, the current price of gas is currently 22.325 gwei (or 0.000000022325 ETH); therefore the cost of the *value transfer computation** becomes 21000 * 0.000000022325 = 0.000468825 ETH at current gas prices, so roughly $0.0062 (vs BTC's ~ $0.01 I believe). That being said, like with Bitcoin, the miner will have a minimum fee requirement in order for the block to be processed, with higher fees resulting in higher priority. When you consider that every single possible computation has a cost in gas coupled with the fast block times, you can imagine the significance if Ethereum were to reach mainstream corporate, consumer and govt adoption.

&gt;""Does the total supply not have a cap right now? Didn't know that""

At the moment the total supply is not capped, however VB has mentioned before that a cap may be introduced when we move to PoS, if not, at the very least the rate of inflation will be significantly lower with current estimates being between 0 and 2% per year (BTC's is currently around 4% I believe). Keep in mind that BTC's second year inflation rate was 100% and  ~33% at $1B mkt cap.

&gt;""But to be fair bitcoin paved the way for all other alts. It took a while for people to understand the concept of crypto currency and blockchain... when bitcoin came out no one had a clue what these were... so to say because ETH rose faster than BTC it's better than BTC is completely unfair""

True, as I mentioned BTC will always be the pioneer crypto currency, nobody can deny that it has paved the way. However despite it's 7 years of existence, it's significant scaleability issues, indecisive community/dev team, dramatic price fluctuations, centralized mining structure, and I would argue also it's tarnished image due to it's links to online black marketplaces coupled with the negative anarchist attitude associated with it's community (not that I would wholly agree with these two statements, but consider them through the eyes of the general public, businesses &amp; governments) have made it unattractive for further large-scale investment and have thus constructed massive barriers to mainstream adoption. So while I agree that the time-span of the two is not comparable, BTC has reached a road-block, whereas ETH is really just getting started.

&gt;""Any examples? I'd like to check them out""

The state of all current Dapps in development can be found [here](http://dapps.ethercasts.com/). However, personally I find the following to be the most promising: DigixGlobal, Transaction Relay, uPlay, BlockApps, Ujo Music, Slock.it, Zcash, Swarm and possibly Gnosis/Augur.

You may also want to look into [Plutus](https://plutus.it/), [Blockchainfirst's Ethlan BioT products](http://www.ethnews.com/blockchainfirst-worlds-first-ethereum-light-bulb), and [BlockPay](https://blockpay.ch/)


&gt;""Same can be said about BTC with who it's caught attention from and how $10B is insignificant in the grand scheme. But it seems like you dismiss bitcoin because you think niche features that other alts have are more important than bitcoin's network effect, its liquidity, its support and network security (which ETH obviously lacks). ETH's features are completely different from bitcoin, Vitalik himselself said it's not meant to be used as money, so ETH is rising in its own right. I don't agree with the notion that ETH is going ""replace"" bitcoin""

In no way do I expect ETH to replace BTC, as you said they serve two completely different purposes. That being said, it's entirely possible that another crypto-currency or even a sub-currency running on the Ethereum blockchain might. Bitcoin's supposedly impressive network effect is often used as a basis for it's permanency, however I would argue that it is no where near large enough for that in the global scheme of things; it's entirely likely that BTC will pan out to be the Myspace of crypto-currencies. ETH and many other coins (such as Monero) have no issues with liquidity. The network security of Ethereum itself is not under any particularly significant threat, BTC faced similar attacks to the ones we recently experienced in it's early stages. Also do not forget that the hack on 'The DAO' was an issue with a poorly coded contract, not the network itself.


Whether Bitcoin continues to be used or maintain it's value in the future is anyone's guess, I am not saying it won't. But what is undeniable is that Bitcoin has hit quite a significant roadblock. So while I don't expect it to disappear completely (nor would I wish it too, I like Bitcoin too!), I do not expect it to maintain it's spot as the dominant coin (by mkt cap) over the next 5 years, and I do not expect it to reach mainstream adoption.

Core don't want to scale bitcoin this way.

Of course no standards exist and so several implementations will be competing for this role. Only blockstream holds the patents though..

Now get with the program and realise that the bitcoin core scaling roadmap is already set in stone and involves segwit which will deliver the massive performance upgrade of 3 tps to 5 tps.

I personally trust the lead bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell (CTO Blockstream) who recently had this to say about bitcoin scaling:

&gt;'It isn't possible for bitcoin to scale and for blockstream to remain profitable. Therefore I have concluded bitcoin cannot scale.'

Reddit is just a place to discuss news. It's not a decision making engine, and it's not a democratic mass media platform.

Sadly, self-moderation (users up/down voting stories and comment) is not effective in cases when somebody is pushing his views with dedication, and is willing to use all available tools such as manipulation, brigading, sock-puppet accounts, etc. Ordinary users cannot thwart well-organized propaganda campaigns.

This is why we have moderators. Reddit gives tools to moderators to combat people who are abusing the system.

This is not perfect, as moderators might be biased and might enforce unreasonable policies. Thus reddit gives users a tool to escape from unreasonable moderators: they can simply start a new subreddit with a different set of moderators. Thus ultimately end users are in control. This can be compared to cryptocurrency hard fork.

I think ideally moderators should just improve signal/noise ratio. E.g. when somebody says something 100 times, they should remove 99 mentions.

Are /r/bitcoin mods tyrannical? I don't think so. People say they are censoring block size debate, but /r/bitcoin is where I've read about Gavin Andresen's 20 MB plans, Bitcoin XT, Mike Hearn's decisions to proceed with a hard fork, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Peter R's paper, and so on.

Exactly right. Fees comprise less than 3% of bitcoin miner revenue. Almost all their revenue is derived from the block reward (which in turn is determined by price of BTC). 

Obviously miners don't care about tweaking 3% of their revenue - if the fee market *doubles*, creating unprecedented costs for bitcoin users, it still hardly impacts a miners' bottom line.

590 has been proven as a really strong support on all exchanges and we seem like we've almost broken the mini-downtrend/retracement. If we break about the 615$ within the next 1-2 days, we have a really good chance of breaking above the 640$ area.

More QE is coming, Gold's breakout will come late October and the US Election is getting closer. These 3 might give Bitcoin a big boost.

It has been many days since the halving and the hashing power and pool distribution keeps increasing, which is a very positive thing. The more days that pass from the halving, the chance for moving strongly upwards increases.

d834ms6,ItsNotDavid,34,"&gt; Intel are right to be scared.

Not really. You need to understand that implementing your own custom circuitry to do exactly what your specific software's algorithm desired is always going to be the fastest solution - always (given you use the latest technology to accomplish that of course). Companies has been doing that since ever. Even during the 70s companies have been making accelerators to accompany a microprocessor. Even Intel has been doing that. The famous 8086 was given a math coprocessor - the 8087. That was a custom cheap to do just math. Later the 80286 and 80386 all had an 80287 and 80387 to do the same. Advanced technology allowed Intel to move the 87 coprocesor into the chip by 80486. While custom full-fledged coprocessors are way less common as ASIC is considerably more expensive - PLAs/PALs/GALs/FPGAs took over that area. Today it's a big business with very high performance applications utilizing it everywhere. It's the very reason Intel bought Altera, they want tight integration with an FPGA so that it would be much easier to interact between the two and deploy custom hardware on demand.

That being said, Microsoft is doing exactly what needs to be done if they want to achieve extremely high performance for a very specific algorithm. So nothing here should be surprising. Custom bitcoin miners have been using FPGAs for years. Drones make use of FPGA s(including military) to implement algorithms that deal with various sensory in real time. Goes without saying even NASA has been using FPGAs for years in various spacecrafts (Mars Rover too; they use the Xilinx radiation-hardened XQVR4000XL btw).",2016-09-27 05:27:59

d82qcid,Uptrenda,29,"I remember when Gavin and Mike Hearn first started talking about block size increases that there was this massive drama where everyone was focused on their personal characters to try discredit them. Like when Mike Hearn called Bitcoin ""a failed experiment"" and the price dropped later that day -- many people were very angry at him for that, and people weren't exactly *rational* when they were calling him a ""traitor"" [2].

And I admit I was a part of that problem too since at the time I didn't really give a shit about the block size and mostly went along with the bandwagon. But looking back at everything thatâs  happened â it seems to me that both Gavin and Mike suffered from a massive amount of abuse and character assassinations compared to other developers ...

So I decided to go back and reread some of what they wrote just in case I fell for the circle jerk and it really wasn't that controversial:

* They predicted the blockchain would go to shit (this wasn't hard to do.)
* They argued that there was plenty of bandwidth and hard drive space available today for it to be economically justifiable for most people to run full nodes that are able to support at least a 20 MB block size.
* They carefully refuted all current arguments against increasing the block size (these were either censored or no one bothered to read them.)
* **Satoshi Nakamoto** himself even said that he anticipated for the network to scale up in terms of bandwidth and disk usage when he first launched Bitcoin.

So yes, Bitcoin was never suppose to become this contentious clusterfuck of segregated witnesses, Lightning Channels, sidechains, drivechains, treechains, and 1337 Harry Potter Spells ... with much information manipulation and political disingenuity spread in-between. Instead, Satoshi had always intended for the blockchain to stay open and simple based on predictable advances in networking and storage capacity. Advances that are quite consistent based on things like Wrightâs Law.

â¦. But I think even with Wrightâs Law ... I argue that networks in the future are going to have even more capacity because virtual reality and augmented reality are now viable, so more and more companies are going to be delivering new content in 3D -- with a lot of early adoption fueled by porn, home cinema, gaming, and education. More HD 3D content = massive amounts of space required = increased incentive to deliver powerful gigabit+ home connections [0][1] at a cheaper price and to produce cheaper drives to store them on. .:. So full node integrity is preserved well into the future.

**Tl; dr, Gavin and Mike were right about everything and the Bitcoin community persecuted them for it. Iâm also taking a break from this mess  for a while because its become too depressing. Stay strong /r/btc.**

[0] We're already seeing software that was traditionally only distributed via disk (like games and movies) being delivered via the Internet so things like Netflix and Steam will also contribute to a faster Internet â and people love HD for their ultra high res screens.

[1] Google Fiber + Google Balloons â already viable and there's countless new technologies that focus on increasing bandwidth capacity; Gigabit home connections are already possible in many places. So a 20 MB block size is extremely conservative.

[2] People are personally invested and its considered heresy over at /r/Bitcoin to bring up any of Bitcoinâs negative qualities when we all know that Bitcoin is a perfect, world changing  iÌ¶nÌ¶vÌ¶eÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶mÌ¶eÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶  technology that will surely make everyone who touches it rich and obviously my investment in it has nothing to do with that â you just donât get it!

The sort of things that would be great to have if hard forks become possible.

BTCfork's MVF efforts are aimed squarely at performing a hard fork to upgrade the block size, without frills. We wish to provide a safe, validated client which allows the Bitcoin ecosystem to accomplish this upgrade _with minimal changes to the software at this time_.

At the same time, we see the MVF (as it develops towards production readiness) as a basis for more elaborate fork clients that may wish to build on top of it to provide features which they think the market will support in a first HF.

If we can get this done, I think the door will be open to future hard forks which safely upgrade the system in the directions that BU has mentioned (among others, although it is recent, that proposed BU roadmap may  necessarily entirely up to date).

d852w8j,PotatoBadger,38,"There is a difference in the **BU philosophy** and today's **BU implementation**.

The **BU philosophy** is that your Bitcoin client should followed the longest chain of blocks that is valid by your own definition. In theory, your client could allow you to toggle pretty much anything. Maybe you want your client to enforce SegWit, maybe not. Maybe you want to enforce a 100 KB transaction size limit, maybe 500 KB, or maybe 50 MB.

In practice, the main consensus parameter really up for debate at the moment is the block size limit. Thus, The **BU implementation** currently asks you to select your preferred block size limit. It doesn't ask you if you want to enforce UTXO signatures, because zero sensible people would like to disable that consensus rule.

So yes, BU currently enforces all of the usual consensus rules outside of the block size limit. /u/nullc is spreading FUD when he says otherwise. I like to believe, or at least pretend, that most of the Core supporters are acting in good faith and merely disagree with the rest of us. Gregory Maxwell is clearly not one of those acting in good faith.",2016-09-28 12:54:28

d8460db,jeanduluoz,31,"Here's my comment on Classic vs. BU:

Yes, eventually Bitcoin Unlimited or something like it will become the dominant implementation of bitcoin, and the network's performance and price will benefit.

As far as i can tell, the fork was just to decentralize development away from the current governance team - a soviet style, single-party politburo of code governors. Everyone ""votes"" for blockstreamcore, even though we're really really not able to vote for anyone else. So the plan was to fork away without changing the codebase. It also provided a quick-fix band-aid to the blocksize limit to alleviate the immediate danger of congestion.

Everyone including Classic proponents know that changing the artificial limit of 1MB blocksizes to a slightly larger artificial limit of 2MB doesn't actually fix anything in the long term. The plan was to decentralize development and reach an equitable long-term solution (like flexcaps or bitcoin unlimited), but the most urgent thing was to decentralize development and break the monopoly core has.

However, it looks like the market has said, ""just fix the fucking problem and people will follow you,"" rather than the approach of classic, ""get people to follow you and then fix the problem."" As a result, Bitcoin Unlimited has been getting a lot more attention, along with Flex transactions, headfirst mining, and xthin transactions.",2016-09-28 00:06:02
d8522qu,H0dl,30,"BU has the potential to destroy Greg and Blockstream b/c it fundamentally takes the opposite approach to his; allowing the free market to determine the direction of Bitcoin compared to his totalitarian approach of core devs are superior and users are irrelevant.  

the funny thing is, BU really is about not taking a position b/c it acknowledges it DOESN'T know whether onchain vs offchain scaling is most appropriate.  it's answer to the unsolvable question?  eliminate the limit and let all sectors of the economy, most prominently users and miners (the economic actors involved in tx's), determine the price of block space and it's size and whether or not offchain solns are preferred.  those in the know about things economic will immediately realize that miners have a vested interest in limiting blocksizes ON THEIR OWN just like they have over the last 7y causing a smooth rise in blocksize as opposed to occasional spamming Roman Candles up to 1MB, since rewards are paramount in the building phase of Bitcoin with tx fee volumes to follow as the transition takes place over the coming years.  BU also doesn't care if the market chooses LN or SC's as long as onchain isn't artificially crippled and is free to compete.  /u/nullc doesn't want to acknowledge this since he KNOWS BETTER.  in fact, he wrote a paper on this around a decade ago; why something like Bitcoin couldn't possibly work.",2016-09-28 12:29:49

My best advice would be to keep a careful eye on both primary and secondary markets to maximize your karmic return.

There are also occasional examples of memes that *do not* plummet once the secondary markets have become saturated -- a noticeable recent case being the astounding lifecycle of the Harambe stock -- but these are generally the exceptions that prove the rule and can almost never be predicted. 

As a minor side note - in spite of its astounding longevity, it is the opinion of this content farmer that the value of Harambe stocks should now be viewed, for all intents and purposes, as no more stable the value of a bitcoin during its heyday of media fame a few short years ago: the value may shift wildly, but ultimately its exponential growth is simply unsustainable.

d87ukqb,nullc,22,"&gt;  Surfing Facebook watching pictures, movies can lead to 20MB usage every minute.

Facebook surfing on your web browser is not a globally synchronous consensus flooding system, and Bitcoin's operating cost isn't paid for by a huge company with billions in advertising cashflow-- it's supported by individual node operators that receive no payment for their participation. If the facebook load glitches, millions of dollars aren't potentially stolen. Facebook isn't decenteralized, it's not a bad thing that only one company runs it and can support its resource costs-- but if Bitcoin became centralized like facebook, Bitcoin would lose most of its purpose and be out-competed by systems that were designed to be centralized.  I  understand that inside Google-- a huge multibillion dollar company with tons of bright minds at it, that spares no infrastructure expenses-- there is a global consensus system which they use to track critical data like system mastership. This system lives in a trusted environment and doesn't need to be secure against strongly adversarial conditions. ... and yet google services are limited to store only a few hundred bytes per service in it and keep updates to a few kilobits per second.

The requirements of a global trustless decentralized consensus system for transactions are very different from the requirements of webpages.

&gt; Bitcoin has very well written software 

Yes, -- so we do agree on something-- Bitcoin does have very well written software.

Which is why I also think it is such a travesty that you ignore the expertise of the people who wrote it.

When you look to the consensus and transaction processing scalability you will find that 100% of the software today is written by people that find your position concerning.

Cheers.

d87uklq,nullc,18,"&gt; I saw someone mention earlier that the Closed Captioning feature doubles as a transcript

AWESOME, thank you for the transcript.

&gt; The reason, naturally, is that we can only have about 2 transactions a second[...]
&gt; While all over the world people are sending about 5 transactions a second.

So I should be able to find 1800 MB of unconfirmed transactions created in the last 5 days alone? Where are they? ... They don't exist, these figures are untrue. Zander has understated the performance for median sized transactions by a factor of more than 3, and overstated the load relative to the capacity.

It's natural and expected for Bitcoin to always be at it's maximum. Though not its purpose, Bitcoin unavoidably provides a public highly replicated perpetual data store, with all costs externalized onto unpaid node operators. At a price of zero the demand is practically unbounded-- everyone would back up their computers into it (and some have tried).

If Bitcoin is to be successful as a decentralized currency it cannot afford to be burdened by acting as everyone's backup or messaging service, because -- due to physical limitations -- that could only be seriously attempted at a heavy cost to decentralization. But market forces control the usage, neutrally, by letting users bid fees for access to the capacity. This creates a revenue stream which we must have to support security as the subsidy goes away-- unless Bitcoin were to become perpetually inflationary like Monero or Ethereum. The fee mechanism is working and, in spite of claims by other Classic and XT creators there has been no ""crash landing"" or ""death spiral"", as a result.  Instead, we find, the system works fine as designed.

&gt; It's a bit like on a Bus stop and every 10 minutes a bus comes by with a maximum
&gt; capacity, you can ask people to pay more fees to get onto the bus
&gt; but that doesn't change the fact that people will be left in the cold
&gt; and there is no way around that.

The late [Ted Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes) might be impressed with the analogy here. But the Bitcoin blockchain is not like a bus in pretty much any way, nor are transactions like passengers. When someone creates a bus it isn't a single use event where every participant in the transit network needs to store a duplicate of that bus in their backyard forever. :)

A better analogy is to to compare the blockchain to a court. In the land of imagination people were worried about being defrauded in their transactions, to prevent this they were sure to take all their trades before the land's court so that the perfectly trustworthy judge would not allow anyone to spend funds they already spent or fail to deliver the funds that they promised.  Over time the court became heavily used and courts do not scale especially well and so the people of imagination land instead realized that they could arrange their business engagements with contracts and record keeping so that in the rare event of a dispute they could visit the court and obtain justice. But ordinary they wouldn't-- saving the court for disputes and other infrequent procedures and ceremonies (like name changes). Not only does this improve capacity, but it improves latency too-- you don't have to wait for the court to hear your case to make every purchase!

Likewise, in Bitcoin-- it's possible to transact without putting all our transaction data up for decision of the court (the whole network). In doing so, we can achieve true scalablity and improved privacy. There are many ways to accomplish this-- stemming back to the original channel mechanisms suggested by Bitcoin's creator (which Zander's 'flexible transactions' proposal attempts to remove), through things like [transaction cut-through](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=281848.0), or digital cash servers, and up to lightning-- the latest and most advanced of these tools. And just like for the courts of imagination, these systems also improve Bitcoin's latency dramatically-- something no amount of block size twiddling can accomplish.

&gt; They never actually give any facts.

In fact a great many facts have been given, including measurements of the changes in network over time, testing on test network (in fact Bitcoin Classic's original developer finally tested larger blocks and concluded 4MB were the maximum, after which he was apparently kicked from the project), to simulation tools. But you Zander doesn't seem to care about these things.

&gt; that ran a full import of Bitcoin's 7 years history.
&gt; Using default settings and a modern, definitely not a super computer.
&gt; The entire 7 years of history was parsed and imported in less than 7 hours.

The system in question was a six core 3.3 GHz system, at 19.8 total CPU*GHz it is the fastest CPU that Intel sells that works in a consumer motherboard.  It benefited from the introduction of libsecp256k1, a product of years of hard work by Bitcoin Core, involving novel algebraic optimizations and number theory insights -- which had just made the signature validation more than 5 fold faster and which had been cited in the Core Capacity roadmap as one of the offsetting improvements that make the two megabyte blocks of segwit viable.

And yet it still took 7 hours. That is a lot of time to be tying up your computer just to get something installed and running. Many people don't have the patience for it, yet for decentralization we need many to participate. 7 hours would be a long time for your business to be down if you needed to reinitialize its node(s).

Worse,""7 years of history"" is misleading: through most of Bitcoin's life Bitcoin had a 250k hard coded soft-limit.  The whole history of Bitcoin is only as large as 1.5 years of the current rate of growth and less than 9 months of growth at the segwit rate.  So his figure should have been 7 hours on a state of the art computer for 9 months of data. 7 hours now, then 14, then 21.... multiple days to sync after only a year or two of additional traffic... On today's state of the art processor, on a machine doing nothing else, and on an internet connection faster than many people in the US have available to them (7 hours is beyond what ADSL2+ could do).

For the last several years Core has put in heroic efforts to improve performance... and we now sync orders of magnitude faster than the original. Through these efforts that the growth of bitcoin hasn't pummeled the network. But the days of low hanging improvements are over and while a few improvements remain there won't be another libsecp256k1--  so it's a real shame that people like Zander exploit our hard work to use it as an argument that performance isn't a concern.

&gt; What this home node managed is 650 times that.

Yes, a node _must_ process blocks at _many_ times faster than realtime to have any hope of catching up in an acceptable interval when starting or after being online... and for miners it must be many times faster too, or it creates ""progress"" in the mining process, making it more like a race where the fastest participant always wins rather than the lottery that Bitcoin's incentives and security depends on.  Like other engineered works, the system also must have a safety margin, because it isn't acceptable for it to catch fire the first time something unusual happens or if there is a DOS attack.

What Zander doesn't mention is that Bitcoin Classic has now ""accelerated"" their syncup by cutting out validation: If a block's header, created by the miner that authored it, claims that the block was &gt;24 hours old (per cpu), all its signatures are just /assumed/ valid. This change undermines the incentives of miners to be honest about their timestamps: since fudging them would allow the miners claim large amounts of ""lost"" Bitcoins to share among themselves. This doesn't sound like an optimization that would be implemented by someone who thought the syncing performance was acceptable relative to the current load, but it's what bitcoin classic did.

&gt; It is like arguing we should not run, or heaven forbid, get on a bicycle

For someone who complained about emotional arguments, our presenter sure seems to spend a lot of time with vague and distant analogies.

&gt; is called XThin and it only sends about 42 kilobytes.
&gt; Which is 24 times as small as the actual block size.[...]
&gt;Well, first the obvious. The bandwidth needed for a node is cut in half.

The ""24 times"" is super disingenuous, ---

Long before Bitcoin Classic had ""xthin"", almost all miners were running the Fast Block relay protocol, which was created in response to orphaning induced mining centralization (that ""lottery becomes race"" issue). FBRP reduces the transfer time much more than xthin -- and the similar BIP152, which also predated Bitcoin Classic using Xthin. So for miners these later improvements have no effect, and without these improvements there might have been a single entity controlling mining now (at the time FBRP was created a single mining pool had amassed a majority hashrate)-- just due to the current load.

FBRP wasn't great for many peers, so it wasn't used by non-miners. For everyone else BIP152 was created. Tom's number of 50% however is impossible to achieve. The reason for this is because the amount of data sent and received by a node is roughly   NumTransactions*36*peers + TransactionBytes*Peers/10 + 2*Transactionbytes ... and the best these protocols could possible do is reduce that last 2* to 1*.  As a result, even perfect block compression has been measured to be only about a [15% bandwidth reduction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1377345.0).

It's a good reduction and it makes the nodes bandwidth usage less bursty and less likely to irritate its user-- it's an improvement that was cited as one of the justifications for segwit being an acceptable load increase back in December before any work on ""xthin"" (the BU's version of this technique) began. But it's important to not overstate it.

This will be my only response.  

##What is the story andytoshi is referring to?##

My ""Transaction Fee Market"" paper had a positive reception, both on the bitcoin mailing list and [on reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3fpuld/a_transaction_fee_market_exists_without_a_block/).  Indeed, a lot of people had not appreciated that block space--although completely digital--still had the properties of a normal economic commodity and thus was governed by the laws of supply and demand (something that now sounds obvious).  

Before that paper, I was relatively unknown in bitcoin; after that paper, the eye of Sauron was cast upon me.  Peter Todd publicly called me an idiot and Greg Maxwell emailed me in private, claiming that the paper was fundamentally flawed, and requesting that I issue a public retraction.  

At that point, I considered Greg a friend, and I respected his expertise in Bitcoin, so I acknowledged that indeed I might be wrong and tried to understand the points he was attempting to make (see the transcript you posted).  

I learned later that he was cherry-picking comments from this private email conversation and sending them to various people to ""prove"" that I thought there was a problem with my fee market paper, when in reality all I was doing was trying to understand the points Greg was making.  Upon learning that he had been doing this, I decided to post the entire email chain to get everything out in the open.  That was when I lost my trust in Gregory Maxwell.

##What are the weaknesses of my fee market paper?##

I'm still puzzled at how [this paper](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/feemarket.pdf) triggered such an emotional response in many small-blockers, when it's really pretty basic and the results are almost obvious in hindsight.   Nevertheless, there were two valid criticisms:

1. I didn't _explicitly_ model the self-propagation advantage of large miners.  

2. Questions remained regarding what pre-consensus techniques like weak blocks would do to my model.

(2) is what Greg was concerned about.  For the next six months, I worked on analyzing this problem and showed that the fee market would _not_ break down with weak-block pre-consensus techniques such as [subchains](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/subchains.pdf).  In fact, I showed that weak blocks could actually increase the fraction of fee revenue diverted to PoW security!   

##Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong##

&gt; I don't know why Peter R's talk was rejected from Scaling Bitcoin

My Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin talk was initially accepted and I even received a phone call from a primary conference organizer welcoming me to Hong Kong and helping me prepare for my trip.  I've been told by two separate sources that the selection committee was then ""shuffled"" last minute and some acceptances that should have been rejections were ""corrected.""  Mine was apparently one of these last minute rejections.

##My proposal for Milan##

It's funny that we're talking about weaknesses of my fee market paper, because that's exactly what my Milan presentation was going to address.  [Here is my proposal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p2r0pfhahplt3pv/SubchainsAbstract.pdf?dl=0).  

Incidentally, I also noticed that Greg had been laying the ground work for getting my proposal rejected for the past few months.  For example:  

- He blatantly lied and publicly said that I was [""physically threatening""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4nvfxw/part_5_of_5_massive_onchain_scaling_begins_with/d496vn8) people in Montreal.

- He [claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/54zfdl/this_is_why_bu_was_banned_from_stalling_bitcoin/d870cpv) many times that my subchains paper was plagiarized from his own work [yet he cannot provide proof for this allegation despite plagiarism being very easy to prove and even though I both cite his work in my references and thank him in my acknowledgments.]

##Moving forward##

My cousin is a history professor and I was explaining to her what I thought was a problem in Bitcoin research: we all agree what the facts are, but there is so much hostility surrounding the interpretation of those facts and the narrative that that interpretation fosters.  

What I learned is that in history, an _outstanding paper_ is one that uses the same facts to shape a completely _new_ narrative.  Work that challenges conventional thinking is _embraced_, not fought, even if it turns out later to be dismissed.   Only by viewing reality through multiple lenses can we hope to understand the truth.
