d5yoafe,ftrader,60,"FWIW, I'm developing a full fork client.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4utczg/hardforks_either_new_pow_or_the_same_how_much/d5sp55o

It will come in two flavors: with and without POW change. This is so that miners can have the option of securing this fork with their existing hardware (necessarily devoting less of it to 1MB-Bitcoin), or turn their backs on it and make their peace with the fact that the community can become the new miners and turn them into altcoin mines or expensive space heaters.

I could use some help with two things right now:

- competent reviews of the [satoshisbitcoin POW algorithm](https://github.com/satoshisbitcoin/satoshisbitcoin/tree/0.11.2_PublicTest_At403562) (it is a modified scrypt - and what my fork is using at the moment)

- feedback on the replay attack protection proposed at https://bitco.in/forum/threads/forking-tx-sigs-technical-discussion.1300/

The road to final fork release is described in more detail here:

https://bitco.in/forum/threads/announcement-bitcoin-project-to-full-fork-to-flexible-blocksizes.933/page-9#post-21603

More information about the 'principles' of the fork:

https://bitco.in/forum/threads/announcement-bitcoin-project-to-full-fork-to-flexible-blocksizes.933/page-9#post-21841

The forum is a better place for technical discussion around my planned fork. I'm happy to respond to general questions in this thread or a new one if OP prefers.

I will only release once the replay protection is working to my satisfaction and the rest of the tests check out. I have mined bigger blocks though :-)",2016-08-01 04:52:42

How can these people have their ignorance on public display, yet still govern Bitcoin?

The answer is that it all revolves around the fear of a Hardfork. That is why they have been screaming very loudly how bad the Ethereum Hardfork is. And I would not put it past them that they are fabricating the problems for Ethereum themselves in the first place (The DAO attack, stirring up resistance to the Hardfork, pumping up ETC). 

It always seemed that the main reason a HF was dangerous is because the people who said it that would make sure it is actually dangerous themselves. A self-fulfilling prophecy. It's akin to saying ""smoking is dangerous because you will get burned"", and then pouring gasoline over you and setting you on fire when you light up a smoke. 

That's what we are dealing with. People who think they are above it all. And they can do bad things for the right reasons. Subverting consensus because they know best.

The agreement expires tomorrow and Bitcoin Core has delivered 0 of 2 promises according to the agreement (no Segwit and no 2 MB hard fork code that is in a ready-to-install Bitcoin Core binary).

d5ys27k,drwasho,19,"Lightning will be nowhere near ready in 6 months. What they may have is a beta version that only developers can run or understand how to use that will be bootstrapped with collateralized hubs for payment routing (while they work on decentralized routing, good luck!).

It will take 1-2 years to create a consumer friendly wallet for lightning-based transactions that will have any meaningful impact on reducing the on-chain transaction capacity. 

Like segwit, merely deploying LN doesn't magically reduce the # of transactions in a block. Transactions need to be compatible with segwit, which means libraries and wallets have to change so that the ordinary person doesn't realize the effects of segwit, because they'll have no idea how to do it from the terminal. 

Similarly, just because the LN exists, doesn't mean people will use it for any or all of their transactions. Firstly, people are lazy and if they can send 5 transactions, over any period of time, on-chain without the fuss of setting up a LN channel and worrying about time-out transactions and refunds, then they will. Secondly, and perhaps most important of all, now you need to find merchants who accept LN transactions... Finding merchants who accepted Bitcoin is hard enough, now you have to get them to accept both and explain all of the tiny consumer-unfriendly details of how the LN works. 

Good luck doing that in 6 months. This will take years.

There are only really two incentive to use the LN and all of its intricacies: 1) transaction capacity, and 2) fee reduction. The reason I love the LN is because of 1. Fee reduction on the other hand has a pretty big caveat. For you to be incentivised to use the LN for 2, on-chain transaction fees need to be trending up (which it will be with no increase in the block size, with no ceiling). And there is the issue: the on-chain transaction fee will become the entry fee into the LN. With millions of people using Bitcoin in the future, this on-chain transaction fee will become prohibitively expensive for the developing world first and eventually ordinary middle class consumers. The only people that will be able to afford it are high income earners and institutions, who will be more than happy to impose their legacy financial structure over Bitcoin as they will become the new gatekeepers.

Bitcoin is ruled by people running miners and nodes and that won't change ever. (Ok, as long as skynet doesn't take over)

d601u3w,Capt_Roger_Murdock,14,"TEXT OF POST: 

I'm having trouble putting myself in the mind of one of these large miners who's still inclined to stick with Core.  What exactly is their thought process?  Here are some possibilities that jumped out at me, but there are probably others I'm missing:

* **Promises of a huge increase in fee income** - I can't find a link now, but I seem to recall the idea that Core has tried to sell miners on the notion that they'll be able to enjoy a huge increase in fee income if they continue to artificially constrain the supply of block space.  But that argument strikes me as pretty terrible (for the reasons previously outlined [here]( https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-536#post-19569) and [here]( https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-536#post-19578)).
* **They actually buy the small-blocker arguments about, e.g., ""decentralization"" and/or the ""danger"" of ""contentious"" hard forks** - I suppose that's possible, but the arguments all still strike me as being pretty terrible (for reasons that have been rehashed here ad nauseam). Plus, haven't most of these miners made it clear that they would be comfortable with a blocksize-increasing HF if Core were the ones pushing for it?
* **The threat of a PoW-change** - Do we actually know for sure if Core has threatened to release a (1-MB) PoW-changing fork if miners try to raise the limit without their blessing? Assuming they have, I guess I don't see why it's a particularly scary threat.  It seems highly likely that miners will also soon face a PoW-changing fork if they don't raise the limit.  I'd view that threat as the more alarming one.  Thus, if miners are worried about preserving the relevance of their hardware investment, supporting badly-needed on-chain scaling would seem to be the safer course.
* **No viable alternatives to Core** - Another possibility is that miners simply feel like they have no choice but to stick with Core because the other development teams aren't sufficiently large / experienced / well-funded.  But [as I’ve argued before]( https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-398#post-13840), this ""electoral party""-type view of Bitcoin governance strikes me as fundamentally misguided and unhealthy.  There's no reason to expect that all of the current Core contributors will simply abandon Bitcoin development if miners opt not to follow their suggestion re: the block size limit setting.  ([And again, the appropriate response to any who *do* quit is “good riddance.”](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-285#post-10477))

Finally, here's the question I keep asking myself: where is the ""organized resistance"" to Core? It seems to me that the major Bitcoin stakeholders who support on-chain scaling should get together and do the following:

* commit to funding an alternative development team that supports on-chain scaling for a period of, say, the next four years (my preference would be a team centered around Bitcoin Unlimited);
* host one or more actual scaling conferences with the miners where this group makes their case for their vision of Bitcoin's future, explains the problems with Core's vision, and attempts to address any concerns that miners may have; and
* make it clear to miners that if they do not allow meaningful on-chain scaling in a timely manner (and no, SegWit-style accounting bullshit doesn't cut it), this group will be forced to throw its collective weight behind a PoW-changing fork that will enable Bitcoin to scale. 

Unfortunately, I'm not a ""major stakeholder"" but to make this post *slightly* less ""slacktivistic"" (""rabble rabble! somebody oughta do something!""), I'd gladly commit to donating 2 BTC to any well-organized effort along these lines.

Since you need bitfinex's private key to sign transactions, I'm guessing that someone breached their server, got the key, then used it to trigger API calls to BitGo's server to move the money.

Don't trust investing advice from random stragers. Especially on Reddit where people tend to talk a lot about stuff they know absolutely nothing about ... Of course, that completely invalidates the following :)

First off you don't have to buy actual bitcoin to invest in bitcoins. It's a lot easier to just buy ETF's, ETN's or other types of certificates that track the price of BTC/USD

I invested in BTC in June when it broke above the $688 resistance for a short-term play but keep it to this day. It's a super risky play and definitely the riskiest piece in my portfolio — Here's my reasoning for keeping it, instead of dumping it like I normally would, when a short-term play goes wrong:

**Short term technical perspective**
We rose from $434 to $772 very rapidly. That means there's almost no support on the way down, so when news like this act as a catalyst for a dump it's expected to see such a strong reaction. I'm surprised we plowed right through the $580 area but the fact that we bounced off the strong support at  ≈ $460, and the [big lower wick on the candle](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XUTlxmMa/), tells me all hope isn't out yet. I think we'll see some consolidation at this level and then we'll see a bull or bear indicator at some point in the near future.

**medium term perspective**
I think we're going to see a real nasty financial crisis within the coming few years. I think it will hit fiat currencies hard in countries with a big national debt and we'll see a lot of inflation in those countries — That means investments that can control inflation (Gold, Bitcoin, etc) will see a significant rise. 

**long term perspective**
I believe a digital currency ala bitcoin will have taken over a lot of daily transactions because 

1. Sending money across borders is insanely expensive. That's a problem for the rising number of remote workers. In 2013-2015 ≈ 5% of my annual income went to transaction fees between countries.
2. privacy concerns in an exceedingly surveilled society. 
3. Banks are a pain in the ass.

For those of you who don't know, the underlying cryptography that protects Bitcoin relies on public and private key pairs. I often use the analogy that the public key is like your email address in that you can safely give it out while the private key is more like your email account password in that you should *never* give it to anyone who shouldn't have complete access to your account.

More often than not, they will then proceed to ask me to generate their private keys for them. Sigh. If my moral compass was only a little bit more off, I'd be **so** rich.

Almost certainly (if my house wasn't already too hot I'd set my GPU on it, just to see if I get incredibly lucky), but:

&gt; sha means that it could be reversed

Theoretically yes, but only by getting astronomically lucky or knowing a sha256 weakness that massively reduces its strength. If my figures[1] are correct, you'd be searching for longer than the universe has existed

[1] A memorable, but complex, password such as ""axD9!%There10-2Fox"" gives us a search space size of about 4 x 10^35 ([calculator](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm)). You, on average, need to test half of those to find the solution (50% chance of cracking). Let's assume that risk is too great; allowing only a 1% chance means the adversary has to try 4 x 10^33 possibilities.

8 GTX1080s will get you ~2.3 x 10^10 hashs/second ([source](https://gist.github.com/epixoip/a83d38f412b4737e99bbef804a270c40)). Let's assume a well-funded adversary who has 100,000 such machines (note that is ~1/2 billion dollars worth of GPUs, not even counting power, other hardware, etc.). This gives us ~2.3 x 10^15 hashes per second (for comparison, the entire Bitcoin network which is also sha256-based is running at around ~1.7 x 10^12 hashes/seconds, or 100 times less)

This gives us (4 x 10^33 hashes) / (2.3 x 10^15 hashes/second) to get a 1% chance of finding ""axD9!%There10-2Fox"" from the hash. Plug that into [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(4+x+10%5E33+hashes\)+%2F+\(2.3+x+10%5E15+hashes%2Fsecond\)), and it gives the following comparison for the search time:

&gt; ~= 4 x universe age 

For about a 1% chance of reversal. It may be possible to reverse in the future (either through a mathmatical breakthrough or some exotic hardware), but it's unlikely that sha256 of a long, complex input will be broken anytime soon (unless all/part of it is leaked/guessed some other way of course)",2016-08-06 16:47:37

d67kfta,blockstreamlined,26,"The very premise of PoS is faulty. No matter what icing you put on the cake, it's still rotten. 

PoW provides probabilistically strong guarantees of state consistency by enforcing a simple protocol for establishing, validating and updating the state of the blockchain by measuring work done. The foundation of this process is made possible by the delicate alignment of incentives among participants with competing but compatible interests. Often called Nakamoto Consensus, the valid chain is not only defined by work done, but also the rules by which transactions and blocks are validated. This is an essential distinction when analyzing the fault tolerance of PoW consensus. Miners produce the work/secure the network and holders drive value to the system by improving upon consensus code and building businesses and layered protocols on top of the main chain. While the functions of these actors are clearly defined, they do not exist in a vacuum. Miners will not propagate blocks or behave in a manner (e.g. censor transactions) which might be viewed negatively by asset holders and result in market uncertainty. Similarly, any changes that token holders want to make to the consensus code must be closely analyzed to make sure that fair competition among miners (which promotes increased decentralization/security) is not jeopardized. These checks and balances are what allow Bitcoin to achieve consensus within a Byzantine landscape of unidentified network participants.

Where PoS goes wrong is by restricting the processes by which consensus is achieved to a single party: asset holders. The premise of Casper is of course that incentive compatibility is derived from bonded validators making consensus bets in line with network expectations so as to not lose their bond, the outcomes of which are approved of by general asset holders who must maintain an active list of approved validators.  Because asset holders are both the validators of state and consensus rules, an incestuous relationship will likely emerge. While there are strict penalties against bad behavior of bonded validators, enforcement relies on consenus among participants on this external bonded validator list. Because this list exists beyond the blockchain, it does not itself have an ""objectively"" measurable value or enforcement protocol like a PoW chain. This ephemeral and easily replaceable list is the source of what is often called ""phone a friend consensus.""

As we have seen with the recent netsplit in ETH/ETC, maintaining consensus on validation rules is very hard when the very philosophies which brought people to the protocol are no longer in alignment. In PoW consensus you can hard fork whenever you like, but you'll either need miners behind you or some defensive hard fork strategy to attract new miners to your network. What makes this a generally difficult process to undertake when you have a sufficiently decentralized system (like Bitcoin) is convincing miners and users to join you. This difficulty acts as an equalizer and pushes users to find common ground on protocol improvements. When it literally costs nothing to create new histories and throw out bonded validator lists that you don't approve of, the ease at which controversial hard forks can be carried out is much too unencumbered for my liking. I believe it will ultimately fracture ETH into many split ends and destroy faith in ETH foundation and their 'research' teams.

ETC must not follow in their footsteps. The ETH foundation hubris on this proposal is very strong, ETC has a fighting chance for wider adoption if it does not make the same mistake twice of listening to Vitalik and Vlad. ",2016-08-07 16:01:08

d67hojp,blind3rdeye,15,"I don't know very much about how those things work. I don't think any of them are in immediate danger, and I'll try to explain why; but I could be very wrong about this...

Some forms of SSL and HTTPS rely on factorisation being a 'hard' problem; and with quantum computers, it is not a hard problem any more. So it might seem that those forms of security are in trouble... However, there are two things which might make it ok:

* Even though Shor's algorithm can factorise numbers in polynomial time (as opposed to exponential time); large number will still take a long time to factorise. Some people say ""seconds""; but that assumes quantum logic gates which are far faster than anything possible right now. More realistically, it will still take months or years to factorise very large numbers; which is good reduction from hundreds of thousands of years, but still not fast enough to mess with encrypted channels which only need to be open for a few minutes at a time.
* Also, SSL &amp; HTTPS could just use some other form of encryption which doesn't rely on factorisation. For example, I don't know of any quantum algorithm which can solve the elliptic curve problems. (But I haven't looked. Maybe such an algorithm exists).


As for bitcoin, I don't know much about that either; but I'm a bit more concerned about that. Although I don't think bitcoin's encryption is known to be vulnerable to quantum computers, I'm a bit concerned that if one day someone develops an algorithm to defeat the bitcoin security, quantum or otherwise, it could be a major problem. However, I've heard people dismiss such concerns, because the bitcoin blockchain is backed up in a stack of different places, and if it turns out to be vulnerable then bitcoin can be updated to use a different form of encryption and then just continue on from somewhere on the blockchain before it was compromised. (I've got strong doubts about this, because I don't think thing people are necessarily going to notice that it has been compromised; and even if they do, the whole world is not going to agree on which point the blockchain was first compromised... and no one is going to want their legitimate transactions to be rolled back.

Not that retail was a big part of the economy currently, but users were able to determine if they wanted to accept zero-conf (which was a decentralized, market-driven decision to use it). Many did accept zero-conf, and problems were few and far between. The claim that zero-conf transactions are ""dangerous"" is a central-planning excuse - businesses are more than able to conduct their own risk assessment of the value-at-risk in a $5 or $100 zero-conf transaction, and see it as value-positive even given risk. If they didn't want to accept it, they don't have to. RBF removes this flexibility in the network for transactions, and replaces it with technocrat moralization, which are just excuses for their own motive.

RBF solves a problem that never needed to exist (transaction stuck due to low fees). That problem only exists because transactions are currently facing artificial limits.  So RBF exists as a solution to allow bitcoin to continue functioning when it normally wouldn't, because its growth is being restrained. Normally, the network would break down with full mempools and failed transaction attempts, so RBF solves that.

So RBF is fixing a problem Core created. Either core understands exactly what they're doing - actively preventing scale to benefit Blockstream and short-term miner interests, or they're just stupid code maintainers that have never designed system architecture in their lives. 

Regardless, zero-conf is important, and scaling is very important. RBF exists to prevent those scenarios from occurring.

These are tiny bucketshops setup by bitcoin founders(those who got large balances early) in order to get fiat money. Karpeles bought Gox becuase Karpeles himself had 100k if not 200-300k+ bitcoin at one point, remember he was one of the earliest miners.

So in the Karpeles situation at Gox he was a monopoly price setter because he had all supply and knew all possible fiat demand.

By the end of Gox the amount of actual Gox users was low, and I believe lost BTC was under 20k. I mean did you notice the total lack of victim posts on reddit? What we also learned was Karpeles was manipulating the price every friday and Gox was never profitable.

What people are missing is the actual userbase of bitcoin is too small to support a 10bil market cap and $400 million of btc given to miners so 99% of supply is held off exchange and a tiny % is used to set a high price to attract more money.

d68uqmw,guywithtwohats,17,"There's probably only one way Bitfinex can make the BFX coin thing work: **they need to set an actual price floor that can only ever move up!**

1. Bitfinex should set aside a fund dedicated to buying back their BFX coins. This fund would represent the initial contribution from Bitfinex to cover losses, and would ideally contain a large percentage of their remaining liquid assets.

2. The amount of money in that fund divided by the number of outstanding BFX coins defines the current price floor. So for example, if there are 60 million BFX coins issued, and the initial value of the fund amounts to $6 million, then the initial price floor would be $0.10 per BFX coin.

3. This price floor should be represented by an actual standing buy wall on Bitfinex. Anyone who wants to sell their BFX coins can do so at any time and get at least the floor price. This buy wall from Bitfinex can only ever move up!

4. Bitfinex then should commit to growing this fund, using a large percentage of their future profits. This should of course be done as transparently as possible. The price floor can then be adjusted on a regular basis based on this growing fund.

5. Bitfinex has paid their debt to their customers once they have bought back all the outstanding BFX coins.

6. There should probably also be a price roof, defined by the nominal value of $1 per BFX coin plus interest. Bitfinex would then not be obligated to keep growing the buyback fund beyond the price roof.

Depending on if/how BFX recovers from his and how well they handle customer losses, things could turn around really fast. Imo, whatever update they give us will most likely be better than the current worst case assumption](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/4vwnmx/daily_discussion_wednesday_august_03_2016/d62hfcr)

Sorry for anyone's loss, but a 36% across the board haircut is miles better than BFX bankruptcy and no compensation. BFX resuming operations is also a better look than another gox situation. During the gox disaster I was holding while shitting my pants, during the BFX drop the buy signal was a no brainier to me. I'm not the only one who's gained confidence and sees bitcoin as something that's not going away anytime soon.

The bottom's in imo ($550). Not sure if you should go shot or long right now but damn it's good to be a holder.

d6ap2bs,nullc,25,"I doubt their security team is the right group to respond to a question like this--

But I can give a perspective as someone not from coinbase and someone whos never talked to anyone from coinbase on this particular subject:

Banks are big companies that largely make money by having a finger in every pot-- Bitcoin is billed by many as a major future technology in finance.  If so, banks will want to evolve and find their new position in the world of Bitcoin-- which may be fairly different than the services they provide today-- so investments in the Bitcoin sphere can be a way to gain experience in this new market and begin positioning themselves to adapt to it.

Especially considering that coinbase's services act as a bridge to traditional fiat institutions, it's essential that Coinbase have good relationships with the banking industry. To whatever extent that you're rightfully distrustful of banking-- it's a reality you can't really escape when dealing with fiat (especially if convenient use online is a requirement). It's important for Bitcoin's growth and success that some organizations provide that bridge; and we should be thankful for coinbase doing that-- as I'm sure it's a huge pain. :)",2016-08-10 03:17:11

If Peter were educable, we'd ask him to first measure, then document, that there is indeed a problem worth fixing, especially given that ""SPV mining"" makes up for speed differences between miners. 

But in reality, he is just a guy with little education, desperate to make his mark on Bitcoin, having arrived late and all the big issues already explored extensively by others, who now has no choice but to cling to shallow, Rube Goldbergian suggestions to fix perceived problems that do not actually exist. Which would all be OK, if he weren't such a toxic dick to everyone else.

This is important stuff. Even if you personally don't want to hear it.

If you are going to start deciding and telling us what we should and should not talk about, the end result will be tech that outgrows Ethereum because the Ethereum followers never knew what was going on....

Please, fck off with this pussy censorship way of handling things (excuse my uncensored thoughts).

The majority of the world's Bitcoin community are concentrated on only a few places on the Internet and the average person isn't going to search beyond the first few pages of Google. Mostly every avenue for Bitcoin-related anything is strictly controlled so ""consensus"" ends up being centralized as a side-effect. I really don't have a good solution for this ...

d6di8xr,packy11,19,"I really like this theory. As someone who works in finance, specifically currency trading, this is a very real threat. 

At this moment, all of the world's currency is backed by the US dollar. Therefore, the US dollar is absolute and has tremendous power. The days of gold or any other commodity being the backing for currency are gone (Thanks Breton Woods) and it has created a completely fiat economy in our world. Basically, this means that no money actually has any REAL value, it is just a fancy IOU that is ubiquitously acknowledged as valuable. The irony of this, is that while it makes US currency extremely powerful and our economy nearly invincible in terms of financial collapse, it also creates a giant hole in the logic - if we decide to no longer put value into the US dollar aka TRUST the US dollar, then there will no US dollar, therefore the world economy will collapse, leaving an opening to create a new world currency that is uniform and identical for all citizens on planet earth. 


With Elliot and F Society taking down E corp, what seems to be the world's largest bank, they essentially destabilize the US economy completely, in turn creating a ripple effect around the world. If it gets bad enough, then the US dollar will drop in value in trading and the government will have to continue bailouts (as they have insinuated) to keep the country afloat. If they don't, the economy will actually take it's true course, and the public will lose it's TRUST in the dollar, ultimately condemning it to having little to no value. Once this happens, it will allow a new currency, especially a decentralized encrypted currency such as bitcoin or Ecoin to take over. It will start exactly how these have started in real life (small niche markets or black markets) and propel into something more PayPal-esque. Eventually, people will feel safer using this tender and companies will acknowledge the consumer trends, looking into more convenient ways to process these transactions. Finally, they will completely transform into the main and only currency that is controlled digitally and will be the surrogate currency for our economy today.

This all makes sense in regards to the show and its themes as well.

The Dark Army represents China who is essentially the US frenemy in trade. While we do a ton of trading, more than any other two countries in the world, there is a constant power struggle and this includes the value of currency. It was shown that over the past 10-20 years, the Chinese government has been artificially creating growth in GDP to increase the value of the Yuan around the world. Once this was found out, it destabilized China's economy and created the mini world ""recession"" we are in today. This would line up with the Dark Army/Chinese government connection.

The constant reminder of the looming Ecoin and how China and Ecorp seem to be in cohorts regarding this would symbolize the changing of the public's view while in a state of economic emergency. This is when they would strike the fear of impending economic doom, and a new currency will slowly creep into the world just before complete anarchy starts to arise.

The side plot of Ray and his online marketplace is again another foundation of how the cryto-currency will become more popular. Yes, it is a very secretive black market now, but eventually, it will lend itself to legitimate businesses and become a model for everything.

Lastly, and most importantly, it ties in with the overall theme of this season, and the show in general - Control is an illusion. I won't go into much more specific detail regarding the currency and how it works, but essentially Price's speech to the Chairman of the Fed (Janet Yellen looking woman), speaker of the house and other government official sums it up nicely. The government and bankers are constantly putting on a mask each day to pretend that they have the economy in control. In actuality, they have very little control but have the confidence, compartmentalization, and communication to create the illusion. At any second, on any day most banks are on the verge of insolvency. With the amount of money being moved around between investment banks and central banks, every day trillions (yes that is correct) of dollars are exchanged on loan to help make sure things operate. If the economy is tanking and a particular cog in the system decides not to participate, it can stop the entire system from operating.

TL;DR - Money = Power. Power = Control. Control is an illusion therefore money is an illusion",2016-08-12 02:46:35

d6fdk0t,FluentInTypo,13,"My first thoughts when hearing about this was actually thinking it was a pre-commit, like what the anti-appelbaum people did with the Tor Project. He releases a hash of something that will be plaintext at a later date, confirming that he is commiting to whatever that thing is. Its a way of vouching for something. So, lets say there is going to be a be reveal soon - maybe not even from Snowdon, but something he is privy too and has been working on. He vouches for that thing now, with a precommit hash, so when it does leak, even if he were ""disappeared"" between then and now, he has effectively already authenticated it. 

Lets say in a month, Wikileaks or some whistleblower tweets:

 ""9/11 was indeed an inside job and here is the proof (link)""

Snowdon, knowing about this upcoming leak or being a part of it, tweets out a pre-commit - a hash of the very words in the tweet above. By doing it now, he is saying he can authenticate the exact future tweet and vouching for its authenticity. If he were disappeared, anyone of us could run the wikileaks tweet through the right hash and get his code, verifying he vouched for it last week. 

What lends more speculative ""credibilty"" to this theory is that he called on ex co-workers to contact him and that it was ""time"". He knew he was going dark. He plaintexted a message to them because they must have had an arrangement of how to carry out the ""plan"" once he went dark. The plaintext served two purposes - making sure the world knew ""something was up"" and making sure that everyone involved in the plan would hear about the tweets, read them and act accordingly. Sure, he could have contacted each person individually, but my bet is that, for whistleblowing, he couldnt count on his cohorts checking their internet ""dead drop"" at the minute he needed them too. So he had to create a circumstance where they would undoubtly know they really needed to check their drop, because the plan is in action. So, a purposeful media-frenzy.

 Remember, these are high states whistleblowers with multiple governments after them. They dont create a secret IRC room and talk every night. They create and sparingly use email addresses that they dont check very often. The less the better really when your absolutely being surveilled. So he had to force everyone involved to check and act. 

Lastly, as for him going dark, right before what I honestly think (speculate) is going to be a huge reveal, makes me think he is on the move, maybe not even in Russia anymore. The Russians either helped him leave because they are happy he is revealing something bad about the US, or they are just too embarassed to admit they lost him, especially when they dont know what he is revealing. 

And the co-workers...damn would I love to be a Stingray on the NSA walls right now. They must be in one hell of a tizzy trying to figure out who at NSA (who worked with Snowdon) might be a part of this. What is it that is going to be revealed? They must be going through Sigint 24 hours a day trying to find every possible internet thread they can to track down everyone involved, looking for one OPSEC mistake from Snowdon et al. 

And all weeks before 9/11 and months before a Presidential Election. Of course, my theory doesnt involve 9/11 specifically, except to incorporate this bitcoin thing. My theory has always been the pre-commit, which may or may not have meant he was in danger. It was however, ""Go time"" and he rustled the right cattle into action. Where he is and what they all are preparing for is anybodys guess. I still wouldnt be surprised is he turns up dead, and that angers and saddens me. The worse case would be if he were already disappeared and the ""contact me, its time"" message was literally NSA impersonating him to ferret out sympathizers from their ranks. I guess we have to rely of Greenwald vouching for him. I am not certain if we heard from Radcliffe yet, though his Russian lawyer says he is fine. I hope he is just on the run and deep in the dregs of preparing a leak with other people and in a safe place while doing so. 

So...will shit hit the fan? I dont know. Its only speculation. But if it is a new leak and I think it is, its going to be a big one. A bring governments down one. I am almost nervous.

d6fcvjk,vbuterin,13,"&gt; As far as I know, Ethereum does not do this as it does not store transactions in its blockchain. It only stores the current state of account values which changes every block. 

Transactions are included in the transaction merkle tree of each block. You can definitely download all historical transactions and verify them yourself from genesis if you want, just like bitcoin. The transaction **history** is also cryptographically immutable just like bitcoin, in the sense that even if the community agrees on an arbitrary hard fork to change the **rules** the old transactions are still there and you can still verify that those transactions were included and not other transactions. The rules themselves are not immutable in the sense that the community can hard fork to change them, but then that's a property of any blockchain.

&gt; This is why replay attacks can happen.

This has nothing to do with replay attacks; UTXOs and ethereum's account-based schemes are equally vulnerable to replay attacks after a hard fork split. If Bitcoin had a 2MB hard fork similar to Bitcoin Classic and a few holdouts stayed on Bitcoin Core, then transaction replay attacks would also happen.",2016-08-13 10:07:16

Their competing version has decided to use the same enum value, which is used on the network to identify the feature.  It is safe to assume there is no malice in them ending up with the same enum value. Although it is a warning that they didn't compare their new feature to the competition.  How is it supposed to be better if they didn't compare?

The problem is that now an XT programmer noticed and reported this issue, Wladimir closed the report saying its too late.  While there is no final release yet. So it is not too late, at most it is inconvenient to change.

Lets all take care and make sure Core understands that them going ahead and releasing software that is known *before release* to break another Bitcoin implementation is wrong and should have consequences.

Look, I'll make this dead simple.

* The purpose of the identifier when transmitting network data is to indicate the manner in which the data is stored. There are a variety of reasons to keep these unique within a protocol, the least of which is to avoid the potential for bugs.
* Using an existing identifier with a different method of data storage creates an immediate demand for a secondary identifier (or some more efficient and difficult to debug hack) within implementations that attempt to optimize.
* The only future solutions are to either use only one type of block compression, or handle compressed blocks as a corner case. **This is protocol disruption.** It disrupts other developers' ability to deploy timely updates and disadvantages implementations that don't have a market majority. Internet Explorer, anyone?
* Claims that such a practice would be pointless are unfounded, since it is in a node's best interest to implement as many efficiency options as possible.
* Claims that the team was unaware of the existence of XThin are laughable, as the team developing XThin attempted to get the groundwork for it included in Bitcoin Core.
* Claims that it is too late to change are also laughable, as the code currently exists in a *release candidate*, the purpose of the original discussion being raised was to get this fixed before release, and the discussion was closed (without discussion).

I would be actively coding for Bitcoin right now, if it weren't for the barrage of instances of terrible stewardship and continuous, active hostility to innovation and growth. But I may contribute to BXT just to spite you.

* Zander has repeatedly produced tangible results based on real-world data that has resulted in active deployments of node implementations that interoperate at a much higher efficiency than standard or compact-enabled nodes.
* Zander has also demonstrated an ability to admit mistakes, make corrections, and react to empirical results.
* Zander and his team have repeatedly attempted to get these efficiency improvements included, or at least supported, and have been virtually stonewalled.
* Your accusations of ""lack of specification and documentation"" are the stinkiest turds in the bowl. *Documentation and specification aren't authoritative, code is.* After all, Bitcoin itself has no specification and Bitcoin-Core is sorely lacking in the documentation department. The cry of the seasoned dev is ""clone the source and dive in"" - and yet you cry about documentation? Yet another obvious fig leaf.

d6getna,chernobyl169,25,"I wish I could be surprised with the levels of deception you will stoop to in order to make it look like there is not malicious activity going on.

&gt; Both xthin and BIP152

It's BIP153 and BIP152, after this stupid drama. At least put them on equal footing.

&gt; have a handshake to determine support

Handshake is not a magic wand, it's a process that can be disrupted.

&gt; (xthin by burning up a scarce service bit

Burning an entire bit of data on a service flag? How dare they! That's an entire one or zero that could be used on something else!

&gt; BIP152 by sending the sendcmpt message)

So BIP153, which consumes a service bit to indicate support for a service, is being implied to be not as attractive as BIP152, which uses a whole message. Language choice here is key: **burning** a **scarce** service bit sounds damaging when it's actually **employing** an **unused** service bit (what the service bits are for). Meanwhile BIP152 sends a friendly **message** which sounds like it is less disruptive, but the opposite is true! It's sending **additional negotiations**, an extra overhead that would efficiently be tramsmitted by the employment of a service bit to advertise service compatibility.

&gt; Both will treat the other exactly as they treat a plain Bitcoin 0.12 peer.

Again, you gloss over what this behavior entails - it could include IP blocking if a node receives messages it considers to be an attack, say, an unexpected message type in large quantities?

&gt; No conflict, no disruption, no failure

And the deception is complete. But let's back up and see where the sleight-of-hand occurs: in the magic wand called **handshake**.

A handshake, as we both know, is a protocol negotiation between two unknown parties. In this case, it is assumed the parties do not trust each other. During this process, the two parties exchange information that indicates how they implement the protocol, including what features and services are supported. The handshake process negotiates which of these features and services are to be used in the connection; thus a system can maintain multiple connections to multiple peers with differing feature sets without loss. (This is here for the layman reading.)

So what happens when nodes handshake? They tell each other what services they support, and respond with information indicating how to proceed in a manner that will be acceptable to each other. This includes the transmission of your ""scarce"" **service bits** and propagation of your **messages**. It all goes on **during the handshake**.

If something goes wrong during this process - say, one of the peers receives information it considers hazardous or alarming - the connection would be severed or renegotiated. This can lead to a host of undesired side effects if the peers' behavior is undefined or asynchronous; if one node is blacklisting another, but the other is re-requesting automatically based on its response, you get a feedback loop that wastes resources on both sides. (Again, this is for the layman reading.)

The handshake is the point at which the protocol can be disrupted. Bad handshakes consume significant overhead - just ask any webmaster with experience about what happens when you get a flood of invalid requests.

Reuse or redefinition of an enumerator is *de facie* irresponsible programming. The implementation of this value has been in use on the network for 6 months. Your implementation is redefining it, on the argument that the definition wasn't submitted for approval in the proper manner. (On the most technical of technicalities, natch!) Sure, *your* implementation is unaffected, no doubt. But this approach *doesn't care about other implementations* - it simply sends its new handshake message to any node that it thinks might want it.

This is behavior exemplary of malicious protocol implementation. The enumerator in question has already been in use. There is no claim of ignorance to that use and no apology or attempt to accommodate. The justification for the redefinition has rested solely on ""it's more popular than the other implementation"".

Well, there was a day that IE was more popular than Chrome, too; notably, for similar reasons.

One argument is that other chains can have features such as smart contracts that Bitcoin will never implement natively. The counter argument that Bitcoin Maximalists state is that such features can be implemented in Bitcoin sidechains.

Since there are also associated connotations with being a Bitcoin Maximalist, it is often the case that they are blamed for certain outcries such as attacking Ethereum or supporting Ethereum Classic. There is an element of truth to this since many Bitcoin Maximalists are vocal in social media.

    Can you expand on your experience in bitcoin and crypto, as well as how far long you are in writing the code for the fork, and if it's being developed in an open source format?

    Thanks!

    Hi Jordan,
    
    Thanks for contacting and for Vice's interest.
    
    I'll be brief:
    
    - I like to remain pseudonymous (see below for short reason)
    
    - I am a Bitcoin user for several years
    
    - I am a long-time software developer
    
    - I have significant interest in cryptography, but no special qualifications in that domain.
      These are not especially required for a fork whose purpose is to scale,
      and for unrelated developments I would always consult and involve experts.
    
    - The fork is developed in similar way to how ""Satoshi"" did:
      1. write code
      2. test it
      3. release it publicly for review and public testing
      4. let the world choose if they want to see it take off
      
    - Due to special nature of a fork (developers coming under personal attack from incumbent - ref. Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, others),
      I've decided to remain pseudonymous and carry out phases (1) and (2) in private,
      and only release the code when ready for public review &amp; testing.
    
    - I'm making it a requirement that official binaries for my fork need to be
      built by independent parties using public, reproducible build methods that lead to
      cryptographically verifiable identical builds.
      In this way, anyone can assure themselves using free software tools that 
      they are running the same, public code.
    
    - ""My fork"" is almost certainly just *one* fork of several that will be developed through the rather spontaneous processes of /r/btcfork.
    
    - All Bitcoin code derived from Satoshi's code (which my fork is) MUST be developed in open source format, ""mine"" is no different:
      a) if you don't open the source up for the world to review and run it, 
         your fork has no chance of becoming the basis for Bitcoin
      b) no-one in this space would trust non-open source with managing their money, rightly so.
    
    - ""My fork"" code is still in implementation, pending the feature of replay attack protection,
      which is an important enabler for fork arbitrage and protects user's freedom to transact.
    
    - An important feature of my fork is that it the change of proof-of-work will be optional
      (I am planning to release effectively two forks: one with proof-of-work changed, one unchanged.
       However, these will be built from the same codebase, so other major features will remain identical.
       This is to give existing miners the option of continued good use of their SHA256 ASIC mining equipment,
       should they choose to run this fork.)
    
    - I am still considering developmental input from various sources incl. forums.
      An example is the decision on the final block size limit.
      
    - Once ""my fork"" is ready and publicly released,
      I am intending to contribute effort to creating a compatible version of Bitcoin Unlimited,
      as I believe it is an important project which can prove that finally, no specific block size cap is needed
      for Bitcoin as a system to self-regulate.
    
    - The market will ultimately decide among the (fork) options out there, including of course the status quo.
    
    Sincerely,
    freetrader

Now, when I say ""sell"", I don't mean sell actual bitcoin, but buying short contracts *with bitcoin*. So, a lot of large traders actually buy more bitcoin when technical decline becomes evident in order to short the exchange later - as in now.

The positive of this market trend is that it allows many ordinary buyers to buy bitcoin for cheaper, as well as that it creates the harmonic momentum in the price chart that eventually catapults bitcoin's amazing rallies.",2016-08-15 01:11:07

d6i5b1f,tsontar,18,"&gt; LN transactions are actually far less safe than 0-conf.

I don't know if I'd agree with that exactly.  On a granular basis, if you accept the stability of the underlying LN network, then a given LN transaction is quite difficult to counterfeit or double-spend (the same is true of a zero-conf in a well-decentralized Bitcoin mining network).

The problem that I see with LN is the risk of systemic failure due to balances being maintained in a web of large hubs.

Since the balances carried across various hubs could be lost in an attack as you describe - where multiple hubs are compromised simultaneously - it's not like you the user can just start over again with a different hub, because you very well may have *lost your balance*.  This is ultimately because the *state of the network is not persisted anywhere* but instead stored in a *mesh of zero-conf transactions* which, if intercepted at both endpoints, can be used to steal your funds.

Fortunately these hubs are all by necessity hot-wallets on live servers, so that helps security.

d6i2o5y,ente_,13,"OP is spot on, and running a Bitcoin-over-Tor node is very valuable.

The more Tor Bitcoin nodes there are, the more robust and independent the Tor part of the network is. At some point, running entirely over Tor will be as good as running clearnet Bitcoin. Right now, with the stated 129 nodes, this isn't the case yet.

- With running over Tor, the user gains extra anonymity. It then isn't possible to correlate IPs with adresses. Running clearnet, this isn't simple (sybil attack), but with watching many nodes and clustering spent adresses over some time, one can already pinpoint IPs.

- Even just running a Bitcoin node on your IP, without a wallet at all, might get you in trouble at some time in some parts of the world. Governmental crackdown on Bitcoin would be one scenario, criminals hacking nodes another scenario, and a mob DDOS'ing IPs of nodes already happened when the blocksize debate was at its sad peak. The most benign scenario might be China blocking Bitcoin at their great firewall, as they do with many popular services already.

- Nodes running over both networks should be more resilient against attacks (sybil attack, again) and splits in the network, where one part of the network sees and builds on another subchain than the other. I'd like to know what would happen in such a case now, if the Bitcoin daemon receives differing data on the two connectiontypes? I suppose the longest chain wins, as always?

- Yes, more Tor nodes and more traffic over Tor is highly valuable for privacy, legitimacy and for whatever the future will throw at us. I consider the Tor project one of our sharpest weapons for privacy and electronic self defence.

I run a Tor relay and a Bitcoin node for several years now. As they are on different servers, I didn't get to route Bitcoin over Tor yet.

Dash appeals to the less intelligent people disillusioned with Bitcoin and Eth. They have great marketing and a G U I. They talk alot about privacy and fungibility but if you look more closely, you will see it just aint true. Further, the core team is not really interested in privacy outside of a product they can use to further the currency they hold massive amounts of premined tokens.

The truth always emerges eventually and people will start moving to Monero (when it is usable by normal people). The only reason Dash is taking off is because it is user friendly (for now, Monero is not). However, it is not real and will come crashing down eventually (if not significantly changed).

The BU team never bothered to inform Core that they would be using this enum, and conveniently left that detail out of their BUIP and public explanations about XThin. 


Core openly discussed their ongoing work on improved block propagation techniques in the Core Roadmap (well before XThin's release) and mentioned that they had a more or less complete specification.

&gt; There is a collection of proposals,
some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some
independently invented, called ""weak blocks"", ""*thin blocks*"" or ""soft
blocks"".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques
(like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the
transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating
size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this
at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but
fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less
complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a
few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem
in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.

&gt;﻿Equation Group Cyber Weapons Auction - Invitation
- ------------------------------------------------

&gt;!!! Attention government sponsors of cyber warfare and those who profit from it !!!!

&gt;How much you pay for enemies cyber weapons? Not malware you find in networks. Both sides, RAT + LP, full state sponsor tool set? We find cyber weapons made by creators of stuxnet, duqu, flame. Kaspersky calls Equation Group. We follow Equation Group traffic. We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files.

&gt;Auction Instructions
&gt;- --------------------
&gt;We auction best files to highest bidder. Auction files better than stuxnet. Auction files better than free files we already give you. The party which sends most bitcoins to address: 19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK before bidding stops is winner, we tell how to decrypt. Very important!!! When you send bitcoin you add additional output to transaction. You add OP_Return output. In Op_Return output you put your (bidder) contact info. We suggest use bitmessage or I2P-bote email address. No other information will be disclosed by us publicly. Do not believe unsigned messages. We will contact winner with decryption instructions. Winner can do with files as they please, we not release files to public.


&gt;FAQ
&gt;- ---
&gt;Q: Why I want auction files, why send bitcoin? A: If you like free files (proof), you send bitcoin. If you want know your networks hacked, you send bitcoin. If you want hack networks as like equation group, you send bitcoin. If you want reverse, write many words, make big name for self, get many customers, you send bitcoin. If want to know what we take, you send bitcoin.

&gt;Q: What is in auction files? A: Is secret. Equation Group not know what lost. We want Equation Group to bid so we keep secret. You bid against Equation Group, win and find out or bid pump price up, piss them off, everyone wins.

&gt;Q: What if bid and no win, get bitcoins back? A: Sorry lose bidding war lose bitcoin and files. Lose Lose. Bid to win! But maybe not total loss. Instead to losers we give consolation prize. If our auction raises 1,000,000 (million) btc total, then we dump more Equation Group files, same quality, unencrypted, for free, to everyone. 

&gt;Q: When does auction end? A: Unknown. When we feel is time to end. Keep bidding until we announce winner.

&gt;Q: Why I trust you? A: No trust, risk. You like reward, you take risk, maybe win, maybe not, no guarantees. There could be hack, steal, jail, dead, or war tomorrow. You worry more, protect self from other bidders, trolls, and haters.


&gt;Closing Remarks
&gt;- --------------------------------------------------

&gt;!!! Attention Wealthy Elites !!!

&gt;We have final message for ""Wealthy Elites"". We know what is wealthy but what is Elites? Elites is making laws protect self and friends, lie and fuck other peoples. Elites is breaking laws, regular peoples go to jail, life ruin, family ruin, but not Elites. Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction? We want make sure Wealthy Elite recognizes the danger cyber weapons, this message, our auction, poses to their wealth and control. Let us spell out for Elites. Your wealth and control depends on electronic data. You see what ""Equation Group"" can do. You see what cryptolockers and stuxnet can do. You see free files we give for free. You see attacks on banks and SWIFT in news. Maybe there is Equation Group version of cryptolocker+stuxnet for banks and financial systems? If Equation Group lose control of cyber weapons, who else lose or find cyber weapons? If electronic data go bye bye where leave Wealthy Elites? Maybe with dumb cattle? ""Do you feel in charge?"" Wealthy Elites, you send bitcoins, you bid in auction, maybe big advantage for you?

Edit C

It looks like these are almost definitely NSA files.  So far, some of these programs are not completely identified.  The ones that have been identified appear to target firewalls, with multiple programs that target the Chinese firewall.

https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/

&gt;While many companies and analysts rush to figure out what exploits were released, with some already publishing their initial analysis, a few of the highlights based on our cursory examination are below. The directory structure uses four letter code names for specific exploits. Some of the codes, exploit names, and relevant details:


&gt;EGBL: EGREGIOUSBLUNDER version 3.0.0.1 – A web-based exploit that targets Fortigate firewalls (various builds of firmware FGT_60-v300) including models 60, 60M, 80C, 200A, 300A, 400A, 500A, 620B, 800, 5000, 1000A, 3600, and 3600A. One researcher notes that Avast calls it CVE-2006-6493, which is a vulnerability in OpenLDAP.


&gt;ELBA: ELIGIBLEBACHELOR – An exploit against an unspecified vendor, affecting versions 3.2.100.010, 3.3.001.050, 3.3.002.021 and 3.3.002.030. This exploit uses the third-party library from Keld Simonsen called ISO/IEC 14652 i18n FDCC-set.


&gt;ELBO: ELIGIBLEBOMBSHELL version 1.2.0.1 – A web-based exploit reported to be against the Chinese made TOPSEC firewall and affects versions 3.3.005.057.1 to 3.3.010.024.1. Some payloads are noted as having been added as far back as 2009 and have their own code name designations, including WOBBLYLLAMA, FLOCKFORWARD, HIDDENTEMPLE, CONTAINMENTGRID, and GOTHAMKNIGHT. Notes in the exploit include information “FOR DEVELOPERS ONLY”.


&gt;ELCA: ELIGIBLECANDIDATE version 1.1.0.1 – A line in the exploit describes itself as “What is the sound of a single thread blocking?” This web-based exploit targets the /cgi/maincgi.cgi script of Chinese made TOPSEC firewalls version 3.3.005.057.1 to 3.3.010.024.1.


&gt;ELCO: ELIGIBLECONTESTANT version 1.1.0.1 – A line in the exploit describes itself as “A packet drops in a router. Does anyone hear it?” This web-based exploit targets the /cgi/maincgi.cgi script of Chinese made TOPSEC firewalls before version 3.3. The exploit also has warnings for the user that the “User may be logged in. PLEASE REVIEW SYSTEM INFO“.

&gt;EPBA: EPICBANANA version 2.1.0.1 – This exploit targets several models of Cisco PIX Firewalls and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices. It uses the pexpect.py Python module written by Noah Spurrier and includes an extensive list of credits for helping develop the module. The affected ASA device images include 711, 712, 721, 722, 723, 724, 80432, 804, 805, 822, 823, 824, 825, 831, and 832. The affected PIX device images include 711, 712, 721, 722, 723, 724, and 804.

&gt;ESPL: ESCALATEPLOWMAN version 1.1.0.1 – A local exploit against an unknown vendor, with one very interesting line in the params.py file. One of the configurable parameters is “callback” and the example in the header of the file says “callback       (“30.40.50.60:9342”)  parse to: callback_ip, callback_port”. That IP address is registered to the DoD Network Information Center located in Columbus, Ohio that is part of the Defense Logistics Agency. This may be a telling piece of information, or an unfortunate sample IP address as we see it used in at least one book on administering data centers. One researcher notes that it appears to be unroutable and potentially just a placeholder.


&gt;EXBA: EXTRABACON version 1.1.0.1 – An exploit against the SNMP service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) devices that affects version 8.0(2) to 8.4(4).
The exploit dump contains many other tools and scripts, along with other wonderful codenames such as BANANAGLEE (impacting Juniper devices), BARGLEE, BLATSTING, BUZZDIRECTION, SCREAMPLOW, and BANANADAIQUIRI.

d6iuhk8,cowardlyalien,100,"No, the free file contains actual exploit code. It didn't come from Snowden's leaks (which were mostly just slides and documents). According to some security firms forensics points to it likely coming from some NSA server that was hosting the exploits. https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/

If I had to guess I would think that the whole auction is a ruse. The leakers have asked bidders to send transactions in a non-standard format that can't be done with a normal bitcoin wallet (they wanted bidders to store their contact details in an OP_RETURN). They also stated that the Bitcoin from losing bids won't be returned and will be kept too. Both of these things obviously deter bidders, nobody has yet to actually include an OP_RETURN in their bid. Also the auction file is actually smaller than the free file, and the free file seems to only contain exploits and implants designed to target firewalls and routers. I suspect the hackers only got exploits related the firewalls/routers and they leaked everything they had and the auction file is fake and empty. I doubt the leakers will even spend the BTC, I think the leakers sole purpose was to leak this info to do damage to the US and the auction is a distraction attempt. Some people (along with me) think this is linked to guciffer 2.0 (DNC hacker) which is almost certainly Russian intelligence.",2016-08-16 06:25:54

**Update 6**

I receive many private messages regarding buying my artwork or make prints or something. I do not sell my work and I will not accept payment buying it from me. Please see **Update 5** for more. I guess many of these messages are quite spammy or weird in my opinion. I do not know the intentions of the people behind them. If you want to donate a euro dollar (or anything) you are free to do so but it is not required and I will not blame anyone. This concept made with love in order to shape the future of Windows 10 as I would like to see it (Many people agree and disagree with this but I will update my work as far as I can). Here is my Bitcoin address (If this violates the community standards mods please send me a message to remove it). As much as I love them, it will be really hard and complicated to donate me doughnuts or kittens. Please don't do it.

**Update 7**

English is not my first language. Certainly, I am speaking the language for a long time but grammar and vocabulary errors will exist and persist. I apologise in advance. I am trying to catch up with everyone :)

**Update 8**

I am preparing a version 2 based on your feedback and suggestions. Thank you very much, everyone, for the feedback. You rock!

**Update 9**

Made it on the front page of Reddit as well in less than 24 hours! Thank you so much, everyone! 

----------------------------------
**MAJOR UPDATE 10**

I got your feedback and I made a good progress. I was able to follow most of the feedback and fixed some annoying things. Some users did not like the multicolour approach which I really respect, that's why I followed a more monochrome tone in the version 2 of my concept. Now, it follows more the guidelines of UWP design. I hope to make more users happy. So here you go:

d6ji4w0,SatoshisCat,72,"I strongly disagree with this ""sidechain"" (which only exists in a federated way today) scaling solution, I actually find it to be quite silly. It feels like people suggesting such solutions really doesn't understand why people want to scale Bitcoin.

The whole _infrastructure_ is around Bitcoin, it won't just change to use a sidechain for commercial transactions. People have a hard time grasping Bitcoin, now they need to be aware the concept of sidechains too. Now, I know that wallets can probably abstract this away but still, the gap will be there.  
In other words no one will move to a sidechain for this purpose, and this is mostly because the network effect is around Bitcoin.

I have a very hard time understanding why people incite that this will/can practically happen. But please enlighten me. The argument seems to basically be the same as ""You don't like Bitcoin and its limitations? Okay go and create your own alt-coin instead"", but for altchains. I for one suggest _improving_ bitcoin instead, and that absolutely includes increasing the block size limit.

Side-note, I have kind of the same view with Lightning Network as well, as it will almost be the same thing (practically), as you will need to lock up your funds to LN.  
But I think the improvements are so significant with LN that it will be practically feasible.",2016-08-16 18:51:57

* https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4wxyhj/snowden_tweets_private_key_hash_then_deletes_it/

Two days(?) before, Snowden [according to RT](https://www.rt.com/viral/355131-snowden-tweets-alive-kucherena/) posts a tweet saying;

&gt; Last Wednesday, the 33-year-old posted this message on Twitter: “Did you work with me? Have we talked since 2013? Please recontact me securely. It’s time.""

While reading through these posts, [I also read most of this](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/28/smuggling-snowden-secrets/) and kept thinking, wow that was all 3 years ago already (2013). 

Now if you put two and two together you might come to the conclusion that these files were leaked by Snowden. Given the fact they are from 2013 and are basically NSA documents. Conspiracy? Not sure. Humans are designed to look for patterns and this stood out to me.

&gt;FAQ
&gt;- —
&gt;Q: Why I want auction files, why send bitcoin? A: If you like free files (proof), you send bitcoin. If you want know your networks hacked, you send bitcoin. If you want hack networks as like equation group, you send bitcoin. If you want reverse, write many words, make big name for self, get many customers, you send bitcoin. If want to know what we take, you send bitcoin.

&gt;Q: What is in auction files? A: Is secret. Equation Group not know what lost. We want Equation Group to bid so we keep secret. You bid against Equation Group, win and find out or bid pump price up, piss them off, everyone wins.

&gt;Q: What if bid and no win, get bitcoins back? A: Sorry lose bidding war lose bitcoin and files. Lose Lose. Bid to win! But maybe not total loss. Instead to losers we give consolation prize. If our auction raises 1,000,000 (million) btc total, then we dump more Equation Group files, same quality, unencrypted, for free, to everyone.

&gt;Q: When does auction end? A: Unknown. When we feel is time to end. Keep bidding until we announce winner.

&gt;Q: Why I trust you? A: No trust, risk. You like reward, you take risk, maybe win, maybe not, no guarantees. There could be hack, steal, jail, dead, or war tomorrow. You worry more, protect self from other bidders, trolls, and haters.


Also, [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group) is basically the NSA.

A regular, vanilla GFE with me consists of frequent chatter, sexiness, goofiness, flirtiness, and nerdiness if you're into that sort of thing! I love meaningful conversation just as much as light hearted banter. If you're into gaming, we can do that together if we share any games in common&lt;3 or just sit back and watch some Netflix and relax together. Our week together will include this, daily photos/videos, good morning and good night texts, and a couple of sexting sessions for when we're feeling frisky ;) it is $200/wk!

If you aren't sure about jumping into a full week, do a 3-day trial with me for $100 to ensure compatibility :) This will include 1 kik session!

Themed GFEs include all of this for the same price (unless stated otherwise), as well as extras that coincide with the theme that you choose!

Themed GFEs

Boyfriend Trainer: This option is perfect if you're just sort of at loss with girls. Be it finding a girl, flirting appropriately, getting her all hot and bothered, or just knowing how to treat that special lady, I am here to help! I have a lot of experience with men, women, sex, and dating, and I am excited to pass it on. During our week together, expect me to give you advice or a guiding hand, and I expect you to either follow it or talk it out with me. This is not for the faint of heart! I will be straightforward when necessary, but mostly kind and encouraging. And maybe we can learn somethings through...how do you say, ""hands-on"" experience? ;)

NB: This is not a domme experience

Workout Partner: I've recently gotten back into the gym since I am on summer break from college, and everyone knows it's easier when you have a buddy! Or in this case, a sexy and fit girlfriend cheering you on ;) I run 3 days per week, train martial arts 3 days per week, and do bodyweight workouts at home on off days. We will encourage each other, set goals, and meet them together! We might even be able to come up with some fun rewards for you if your goals are met ;) hehe!

Submissive Pet: Do you want a little pet to call your own? I would love for you to call me yours. I can be very playful and teasing, but I am a true submissive at heart. I can't wait to see what Master has in store for me!
NB: this package starts at $300/week and terms MUST be agreed upon beforehand.
Build your own: Not totally satisfied with any of my options? Name your price and we can discuss what it will include. I open to any and all suggestions!!

I accept Bitcoin, Giftrocket, and Amazon giftcard (+15%). Payment must clear before services begin.
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: If you overstep boundaries during our time together, I will politely let you know because accidents happen and we can't read each other's minds. But if you disrespect my rules again after they are established, I will terminate our GFE immediately with no refund.",2016-08-16 23:07:50

d6jfd0i,datavetaren,22,"I more or less agree with most of this except for the ""federated 2-way peg."" Actually, just the word ""federated."" The idea that a system can be deemed secure because a limited set of people holding private keys is giving me shills. It's just a matter of time before a disaster happens.

Instead I'd prefer the current miners as the protectors of the network. Instead include the hash of the header of a sidechain (e.g. in the coinbase script of bitcoin in the SegWit model) and keep the 10 minute PoW. This is basically a generalized soft fork to add 2-way pegged sidechains, but the sidechain could (as you say) have unlimited block size. This way, the ""gold"" on the motherchain is never compromised, but that ""big blockers"" can move funds to the sidechain (and back if wanted) should make most bitcoiners happy.

For this to work, at least 51% of the bitcoin hashing power has to accept the sidechain and follow the sidechain rules. But there's of course no mining required in the sidechain per se. The economic incentive is that the miner collect fees from the sidechain as well.

The number of changes to be made in wallet software to keep track of an additional sidechain that is otherwise compatible with regular bitcoin transactions, shouldn't be that complicated.

I think this is basically Adam Back's idea with ""parallel chains.""

I've waited for more than a year to see any scaling progress whatsoever, and all they came up with was a dangerous softfork for segwit (which is not actually released) and RBF (disgusting, only solving problems they created themselves artificially). We have a fully coded solution ready with classic, yet the miners collude to their own detriment and support core (this only works because they are paid off).

d6jzd1i,Dryja,25,"Transaction fees are denominated in satoshis, not USD; if you opened a channel with 1 BTC and the value of 1 BTC rose in USD terms, the fee may also rise in USD terms but not in BTC terms.

Looking only at USD, here's what it would take for $1K/close tx fees:

A close tx is around 300 bytes, so approximately $3/byte for block inclusion.  With segwit, there's around 2M bytes / block, so each block has total transaction fees of about $6M, which is before any coinbase subsidy.

144 blocks/day is $864M / day in fees, or about $315 billion per year in transaction fees.

This is higher than total annual revenue for all credit card companies (which also extend credit!) and all other payment processing industries.  So in this scenario either 1000 USD isn't worth that much and the fees are reasonable in BTC terms (or in 2016 USD terms), or Bitcoin has taken over the world and become the de-facto single global currency.

Seems quite unlikely, but if this happens I don't think people on r/bitcoin will complain.

Scale it down to $100 per close tx and the conclusions don't change too much; fee revenue in the tens of billions of USD per year, which is on the order of a major credit card company.

On a technical level, fees in USD are likely to be much more volatile than fees in BTC.  The USD/BTC price goes all over the place for whatever reasons, which changes the USD fee price even if the BTC price is static.  But changing the fee in BTC terms is the only thing that matters for LN channels.  The only thing that can increase fees in BTC terms is an increased demand for BTC velocity.... except it's not even that.  Fees are per byte, not per BTC sent, so there's lots of room to consolidate payments and move more BTC in fewer bytes.

Right now I'd say fees are mostly being paid by people who don't care, and would rather spend a couple extra dollars than re-write or update their code.  If you look at blocks, there's still a lot of junk, like uncompressed pubkeys, chained txouts being spent dozens of times in the same block, and so on.  This is rational though: if I'm spending an extra $1 a day in fees, I'm not going to bother re-programming software to cut that down to $0.10/day, because it's going to be hours of effort to program, at a value of hundreds of dollars.  If fees go higher though, people will remove those inefficiencies.

My guess is that we'll see channels where the fee to open is well under 1/1000th of the channel value.  Could the USD denominated fee to close go up 100X from that?  Sure, I've seen BTC/USD go up 100X.  Channel might cost $10 to close, which would be forgotten by the user whose channel is worth 100X more in USD terms.  Could BTC denominated fees increase 100X during the time the channel is open, without any change in BTC/USD?  I can't think of any realistic way that would happen.

TL;DR:
Fees don't usually go up much in BTC terms and probably won't.  Similar to how if you have some bitcoins now, you'll always be able to spend them -- If you have a channel open today, you'll be able to close it tomorrow.

3. Weekly RSI looks bottomy (technical term), weekly StochRSI is oversold, and we double bottomed at $565.

4. Segwit is actually, for realz, coming soon™. It will take time to adopt but it's still a massive step forward for Bitcoin.

5. With Segwit and other high priority upgrades coming to pass, and ETH/ETC becoming such a huge fiasco, the core devs have been discussing how they would safely implement a hard fork to 2+ mb. Even devs who were stalwartly against a hard fork before are participating (and CONTRIBUTING) to this discussion. There have been a lot of good ideas. These guys are fucking smart and I'm excited to have them working on Bitcoin. I used to be pro-classic but have changed my opinion on the matter, and think we actually dodged a bullet.

7. The market doesn't seem to care about Bitfinex. I believe their risk of a lawsuit/bankruptcy has gone WAY down. Why? Because by being quick to let people withdrawal, there is now no monetary incentive for forcing them into bankruptcy. The only incentive left is revenge, and it would be expensive revenge at that. Yes, I agree they haven't been transparent enough, but that doesn't change the facts. So long as those stolen coins don't move (this is a big if), I believe we're in for a violent bull run this year.

d6jukm2,todu,14,"We should not cooperate with any of those people who you mentioned. They had their chance. We let them found Blockstream and employ at least 9 of the main Bitcoin Core developers. They chose to abuse the power that we gave them by intentionally making Bitcoin slow and expensive so that they can get customers to their future competing Blockstream products that they conveniently market as fast and cheap.

If the community and Blockstream were a couple, then Blockstream has done the equivalent of slapping and punching the trusting community in the face. Then they broke our legs. The first leg that our Bitcoin used to stand on was ""fast transactions"". Blockstream broke that leg. The second leg was ""cheap transactions"". And now that we left the abusive relationship we had with Blockstream you ask us to welcome Blockstream back into our new home?

I know it's common that abused women or men welcome back their abusive ex partners. That behavior can only end in tears. Blockstream knew exactly what damage they did to us the community and they still chose to keep doing us intentional harm. If we welcome those same people back into our spinoff Bitcoin currency, then they will 100 % sure just keep intentionally damaging our project. 

Tldr:

So in conclusion we should keep saying no to them in every way we can for all eternity. You can't negotiate with someone who only desires to harm you. Blockstream has made its intentions very clear and you have to be blind not to see that.

&amp;nbsp;

Not only that, but I'm very skeptical of the idea that that's all that Bro was doing entrepreneurially. Dirk has *so many* interests, and while he also had a lot more technological advancements to work with, there were still plenty of things for Bro to have pursued in addition to his main interest. Dave was also *really* young when all of this shit started (let's be real, 13 is practically a fucking baby in a lot of respects), so I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out Bro was also managing some shady deep web BitCoin services on the side and Dave just had absolutely no idea about it. At the very least, I'm sure Bro had some additional income besides relying solely on smuppets.

Comme le fait remarquer le Redditeur français et [Edward Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/765513662597623808), cette publication d'outils d'espionnage sur le Web serait une première et le leak supérieur à celui des données des italiens de Hacking Team.

Wikileaks dit sur twitter qu'ils ont une copie de toutes les données

Je suppose que comme Wikileaks est pro-russe ils vont attendre la fin des enchères pour leaker le truc

Comme le dit le Redditeur français en citant Snowden, les leaks vont permettre d'identifier si des Etats alliés des USA ont été espionnés par la NSA (ce qui est le cas, c'est le boulot de la NSA).

S'il y a des preuves de l'espionnage de

* France

* Allemagne

* Brésil

qui sortent

(Grande Bretagne j'aimerais bien, ça me ferait rigoler sur la *Special Relationship*, mais je ne sais pas si la NSA espionne le Royaume-Uni)

ça risque d'avoir des répercutions diplomatiques comme le Redditeur français et Snowden le font remarquer.

Wikileaks risque d'exploiter ça pour éloigner la France et l'Allemagne des USA.

Ca sera intéressant de voir si des infos comme ça sortent même si des ""cyberoutils"" sont moins spectaculaires que les révélations de Snowden depuis 2013 sur l'espionnage du Brésil, de l'Allemagne et de la France par la NSA (ou alors je me trompe et le futur leak est encore mieux...).

I suggest skepticism. We should be cautious of anyone skipping peer review processes, even for security incidents. Poor handling of these situations can lead to unintentional panic where panic of any kind is unhelpful to resolving issues. However, everyone should always be encouraged to check the signatures regardless of alerts, of course. Multiple signatures should always be checked, and not just Wladimir's signature. Use the [gitian signatures repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs) to get other signatures, and always verify public key and signature data through multiple independent channels.

Someone on #bitcoin IRC suggested to write down [some steps for GPG verification of builds](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#verify-other-gitian-builders-signatures-to-your-own-optional) and a link to [the gitian build steps](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md).

And if the concern is about someone targeting Chinese users in particular, then I would suggest a Chinese translation of the same instructions and checklists.

**Edit**: another interesting (although probably unrelated) observation is CVE-2016-6316 see https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2016q3/000395.html which says:

&gt; The GnuPG Project is pleased to announce the availability of new Libgcrypt and GnuPG versions to **fix a critical security problem**. Felix Dörre and Vladimir Klebanov from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology found a bug in the mixing functions of Libgcrypt's random number generator: An attacker who obtains 4640 bits from the RNG can trivially predict the next 160 bits of output.  This bug exists since 1998 in all GnuPG and Libgcrypt versions.

impact:

&gt; All Libgcrypt and GnuPG versions released before 2016-08-17 are affected on all platforms. A first analysis on the impact of this bug in GnuPG shows that existing RSA keys are not weakened.  For DSA and Elgamal keys it is also unlikely that the private key can be predicted from other public information. This needs more research and I would suggest _not to_ overhasty revoke keys.

**Edit**: Also, don't use gpg short ids. Always verify fingerprints. There are gpg short id matching keys floating around for some Bitcoin developers - for example http://pgp.surfnet.nl:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;search=0x2346C9A6 check out the revoked key.

**Edit**: To emphasize, it is insecure for Cobra to give a specific key with a specific fingerprint on a server that he is warning might be compromised (perhaps the server itself or perhaps for other unrelated web reasons). His is a recommendation that should be improved. Instead, use multiple independent uncorrelated channels to look at sources of information to acquire keys, fingerprints, binaries/builds, and signatures. Keep in mind that it is not always easy to tell if two channels (like: internet connection at your house vs an internet connection at your friend's house down the street) are uncorrelated. Perhaps they are both targets to a neighborhood-wide attack? For example, there are many stories from Internet lore where a company purchased redundant internet service from multiple Internet Service Providers only to find that both providers were indeed using the same physical fiberoptic drop.... Go to key signing parties.

**Edit**: man-in-the-middle attacks are a real problem. We should try to encourage people to post security alerts rather than not post them, and that goes for myself as well. I hope that my comment has not discouraged future alerts by any means; it was wrong of me to focus on process concerns in the opening.

Bullish

1. up 150% since the bottom, and like 80% YTD. It's ""allegedly a bull market"" because it clearly is. 
2. Finance - institutional capital dwarfs current, mostly retail demand. Regardless of Bitcoin's TPS limitations, it is still a high-alpha asset that is uncorrelated with other asset groups. For people in finance, that is a golden egg. For however valuable BTC is for retail investors, it is even more valuable for professionals constructing portfolios. Bitcoin's high, uncorrelated volatility and even higher risk-adjusted return on capital is like crack for finance. There is growing institutional interest with lots of products sprouting up.
3. 2 ETFs waiting for approval - we hear about the SEC rule change proposal on Aug 22.
4. Halving - price is now fighting a 4.6% supply inflation, not 9.1%. That's a lot less downward pressure on price.
5. Scaling pressure - the bitcoin network itself is actually a barely functioning piece of shit, and it still manages to blow all other currencies out of the water. *There is so much opportunity cost in the network.* For how well it's performing, we are forgoing so much more performance. When we get better developers and actually scale BTC, the floodgates will open. 

Bearish

1. potential disapproval of ETF products
2. Continued developer failure to optimize; principle agent conflict.
3. Continued cartelization of mining
4. Closed loop where mining cartel supports developer cartel and vice versa - but eventually economic pressure will destroy this link.

It took the Blockstream minions less than three hours to show the real motivation and reason for creating the vague, unverifiable and not disprovable rumor. They even clarified that this ""state sponsored threat"" is extra dangerous for Chinese miners and Chinese exchanges because they want to make them fear running anything else than Blockstream controlled Bitcoin Core:

&gt; We believe Chinese services such as pools and exchanges are most at risk here due to the origin of the attackers. [Quote from the warning that was posted on Blockstream controlled bitcoin.org.]

If you can't get the miners to *want* to run your Bitcoin Core client, then make them *fear* running anything else, and they'll stay with you. No one will notice because we expert programmers are naturally also experts in psychology which is a fake ""science"" anyway. Austin Hill demonstrated how easy it is too fool unsuspecting Canadians with an obvious scam and he was only 17 at the time.

This desperation shown from Blockstream actually is a sign that the miners may not be their allies after all, and are unofficially considering running other clients than Bitcoin Core. Because why would Blockstream embarrass themselves with such a display of weakness by making this move at this particular point in time. If Blockstream would have truly made the Chinese miners their allies, then Blockstream would not have felt the need to create and spread this rumor that even mentioned the Chinese miners specifically.

We big blockers have made our move. We founded /r/btcfork and our first Bitcoin spinoff lead by the pseudonymous identity /u/ftrader. Then Blockstream made this move of ""state sponsored attack against Chinese miners"" FUD. I expect the next move to be played by the Chinese miners. I wonder what it will be.

d6m7olq,wtogami,13,"It is also important for everyone to better understand the purpose of Gitian and how it relates to GPG signatures.  Gitian is a tool that allows anyone to build a given GPG-signed tag from git and get bit-for-bit identical binaries.

https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gitian.sigs/tree/master/0.13.0rc3-linux

For example, here you can see several independent persons signed the same gitian hashes.  This suggests that several independent people all built the `v0.13.0rc3` git tag for themselves and got the same binary output. 

Part of the community-based immune system is for many different people to build.  If their outputs do not match others submitted to `gitian.sigs` then an alarm can be set.

It is important to note that the concern expressed on bitcoin.org here has nothing to do with the Gitian deterministic binary build process.

According to Gupta:

* Stephan Tual: either bad actor and/or incompetent
* Charles Hoskinson: either bad actor and/or incompetent.
* Both Tual and Hoskinson have a history of incompetence.
* ETC isn't any better with Hoskinson behind it.
* Vitalik doesn't like conflict and is conflict averse.
* Bitcoin has become hostage to Chinese miners with government backing.
* TheDAO failure caused people to seek resolution and that's what governments are there for.
* Ethereum needs a dispute resolution system.
* Supposed litigation against TheDAO (I'm assuming he's talking about the email regarding Mass. Securities Division, which doesn't look reliable at all, more like just some text).
* Ethereum has some challenges it will need to get through.
* This was a wake up call for blockchain and crypto space. There is a conflict philosophies within the crypto community now.

My take: 

* A lot of hyperbole about things being really really bad, like really really, really. Seems like he needs to take a step back and realise this is a fairly new protocol and mistakes will happen.
* The whole litigation thing seems overblown. TheDAO token holders got their Ether back. The price of Ether is subject to market conditions and its up to the market to decide what the price of Ether is. Its not a courts decision to decide what the price of Ether was before and after events.
* The only litigation story doing the rounds that Ive heard of is the Mass. Securities Division email, which looks like it was written in notepad. If someone has any info on some other file / email doing the rounds, please post it.
* These interviewers are horrible. I have a lot of respect for Gupta but put someone with a backbone willing to question Gupta a little more and someone with a more level knowledge base.
* The conflict in philosophies has been there from the start, TheDAO debacle just brought it to the forefront as opposed to some crypto kiddies running around screaming ""immutibility"", ""decentralisation"", ""anti-government"", ""crypto to rule the world"". Bitcoin is anti any sort of central decision making or consensus of any kind, thats why its in the mess its in. It seems a balance is needed.
* Dont trust people with your money unless you do background checks.
* Hoskinson sounds like a tool who got kicked out of the Ethereum Foundation or left because things werent going his way and now he wants to jump on the ETC bandwagon to try and steer things his way.

d6nwsyc,seweso,11,"The two big questions are: 

1. Will transaction volume for higher valued transactions keep growing if lower valued transactions continue to get pushed out? 
1. And how will transaction fees and a less usable Bitcoin affect its price?

So the question is not what will Bitcoin do, but what will humans do. I personally think Bitcoin's fees are already way too high for its lackluster performance. And I think most important growth comes from a low barrier to entry. This would mean growth is already impacted and the limit should have been increased about a year ago. 

I would not be surprised if fees stop rising soon, but I also would not be surprised if they continue to rise very quickly. So anywhere between $0.05 and $10 is my guess. 

My predictions:

1. More and more services/software will support alt-coins 
1. The BTCFork will go nowhere (because after a spit it would not actually need a bigger blocksize, and it doesn't provide anything an altcoin doesn't)
1. SegWit will not provide a significant blocksize-limit increase this year

d6ns2wi,barejokez,11,"there are a lot of myths (some with elements of truth) that get perpetuated around this argument. For a long-time, the UK population seem to have been of the opinion that buying property is better than shares etc. i'm not really sure why this is, but as an analyst of shares in property companies, i'd like to think i can be partially objective:

- ""people lose money in shares all the time"". not quite true, but there are stories of mis-managed pensions, or companies like barings bank going bust and leaving their sharholders with nothing. that is a risk, but it exists with houses as well. it is hard to imagine a house being worth literally nothing (though if your tenant burns it to the ground and the insurance companies start arguing over who should pick up the bill, then you might have a few sleepless nights), but then again, neither was barings. the bank was just worth less than the debt it had outstanding, and so the shareholders were left empty-handed. the same can definitely happen to property - the last 10 years have seen bizarrely (IMO) low rates of repossession, but go back further in time and it was a relatively common outcome. the house still has value, but only to the bank. i actually think the risk here makes shares a better prospect - it is so much easier to diversify a share portfolio and reduce your exposure to specific risks.

- ""house prices have outperformed historically."" Well, that's true (depending on your timeline i suppose). Since 1980, house prices have increased 6.9% per annum, which would have made for a decent return. But then again, the FTSE 100 has seen 5.5% pa increases over the same time period (approximately), so is this really a big deal? from a tactical point of view, house prices ar at an all-time high, while shares are not - personally i don't think something trading at the highest price it's ever been is a strong indicator of good value.

- ""you can take out debt on a property to maximise your profit."" Again, true, but so what? If you calculated the average debt of the ftse 100, i expect it would be around 50% LTV (maybe higher), though admittedly that metric is hard to get your head around when thinking about the value of intangible assets (brand names etc). The point is, investments in most shares are already geared in the same way, just at a different point in the business. And yes, debt will help you buy a property (in fact only very wealthy people can buy with cash), but again, shares are more flexible in this regard - you can invest £100 in shares no problem, but you need £50k to buy a BTL even in a sub-average part of the UK. 

- ""i understand property"". Ok now that is important. i would never invest in bitcoin, because every time i think about it, my brain explodes. but i do broadly understand the concepts of share ownership, and what drives them up or down. i also understand what factors might influence various companies, though not in depth. instead, i pay people to know about these things for me - through actively managed funds, or i accept the risk and use passive funds to spread my investment thinly throughout the share univers - minimsing risk. Do you *really* understand property? Do you know how much a new boiler costs, or how much a plumber will charge to install it? do you know what is driving rents up in the local area? who is the biggest employer and are they expanding or contracting? 

i won't go so far as to say which is better - that's subjective and i genuinely don't know - i may well go into BTL in the future if i see a good reason to. what i totally disagree with is the notion that it is a no-brainer - the markets actually have a lot of similarities, but are regarded very differently.",2016-08-19 16:14:43

It isn't too late for you to get on the train before it leaves the station.  Bitcoin is an unstoppable juggernaut that will soon come to dominate the internet of currency.  All you need to do is go to your bank, tell those weasley shit fuckers they are obsolete and you'd like to take your wealth and put it in the future of currency.  Remind them they aren't even a legal thing anyway--none of the money they give you has gold inside it, which makes it technically worthless.  Once they come back from their vault with your fiat, be sure to inspect every bill for microchips or other tracking devices.  After being sure you aren't getting traced, hop into your private conveyance and travel to the bitcoin ATM.  

Now comes the easy part.  At the ATM, just stuff that thing full of the dirty war money the bank gave you and the machine will spit out a barcode containing your new digital wealth store.  I won't bore you with any further details about security or fraud as both are covered very well with a quick search of the internet. Just rest easy knowing that you are no longer part of the system.  Your wealth is no longer going to be used for funding illegal wars or gun-toting goons going around harassing restaurant owners who dare put raw chicken containers on top of pre-cooked hot dogs.    

You are now your own bank and are one step closer to going off-grid in your private sovereign nation.  You never consented to their illegal rules.  They have no jurisdiction over your person.  Fuck them.  Buy bitcoin and they can never control you again.",2016-08-19 00:14:57

d6oc981,rehabilitated_4chanr,19,"&gt;Imagine having to pay the owner of each road you used to get to work every day. If every road were a toll road, not just highways.

Wrong, Businesses would build roads for the convenience of getting their customers to them. Every Business needs a road to get customers. And in the case of housing developments, the roads will be commissioned by the builders. Some of this may increase the cost/value of you home, but almost the exact same amount of money would be taken out of your taxes to build roads either way so they equal out. 

&gt;Imagine not having firefighters, or having to pay them huge sums of money to save your home and family. And if you dont, they watch your house burn while keeping your neighbor who did pay them, safe.

In a Libertarian society there are differing views on this, but I'll give examples of a couple plausible scenarios.

1. The ""less"" government libertarian - Many libertarians believe you keep a small part of government around. Enough to run the parks, emergency service, military, etc. Basically works exactly like today, but those are the governments ONLY jobs.

2. The ""minarchist"" - The people don't want that much governments, however they employ the use of contracts to keep emergency service who are held accountable in the courts. You have more fire ""companies"" who keep their business going by offering quick RELIABLE service, they have comparable prices, where the consumer can choose. Also businesses that run like HOA's could also have hired their own services. There are many options.

&gt;Imagine there were no military or police to stop an outside force from coming in and taking you as a slave, or killing you for your land.

Just the fact that you believe this needs to be a thing, is the exact reason it WOULD exist in a Libertarian society. But let's imagine what that might looks like compared to todays society.

1. ""making you a slave or killing you for your land"" - This is not a lawless society, there are some form of courts in EVERY form of libertarian. How each of them run is too long to explain here, but they all are proven to work, and are logical and fair. Many would argue those courts are actually MUCH better at protecting the innocent then our current courts who heavily favor police and help cover up their actions. If you think separation of church and state is good, then you should also think that separation of police and the courts is good.

2. The amount of funding the military gets will directly equal the amount self interest it's constituents want. Those who live in Libertarian society are able to gauge how large ""Navy.inc"" is, and decide whether they want to donate their money to the non-profit military. If non-profit is too small, more people who are protected by it will be asked to donate more money. If it gets too large, people will start thinking that they don't need to contribute to it getting larger, which is EXACTLY how you should be able to decide where your ""taxes"" go. 

3. It is in the best interest of a company working on subscription membership to not do any work. They are incentivised to not actively start wars, as that costs MORE money, thus cutting into their salaries. However focusing on the most efficient (often diplomatic) ways to solve arguments. 

Now these scenario does have one large ""hiccup"" you MIGHT say. In a Libertarian society happened in the US (and this would take an INCREDIBLE amount of time). It is highly likely we would get rid of the MASSIVE army we have, and would no longer be the main protectors of the rest of the world. This may be a positive or negative for many people.

&gt;No education system, so only those with extra money, (which would need to be something like gold or salt, or silver, because no government means no real set minting of currency.) would be able to learn anything beyond what their parents could teach them.

First, you very easily are able to have a fiat currency in Libertarian society. A company can easily exist that has the ability to print just like they do now, who would have a vested interest in maintaining their currency. They would be incentivised to not allow anyone to make clones or fakes of their currency. These people would no longer be allowed/forced to print/create tons of extra money at will for whatever reason. Also Bitcoin.

Secondly, Societies have a value benefit of educating their constituents. WHY THEY HELL would they not exist, there are PLENTY of business models that would provide a much better service then our schools do today. Again there are so many options I don't really feel like getting into them, but a couple examples are:

1. Non-profit community public - These can be run at the same cost as taxes today. Many people (based on the fundamental concept of volunteerism) would want to see their community thrive, therefore they see the cost benefit of VOLUNTEERING money to the local schools systems.

2. These public schools would be more efficient and would vastly cut down on the bloat we have in our current systems where there is no checks and balances, or accountability, from our public schools.

&gt;Nothing would legally require hospitals to treat you in emergencies. So, good luck with that lost foot. Since without it you can't work, and thus can't pay us back, why should we help you?

Technically yes, you would need to invest in some sort of plan for your health if you want to make it in society. You can't just live freely through life, and expect everyone else to care for you. You have the personal responsibility to invest in your future, if you do not see your future as a priority then no one else will/should either. That being said, costs would be down due to more accountability, effeciency, and be kept in check by competition in the market. When you look at expensive medical procedures that are not supported by the corrupt insurance agencies, you will see what free market looks like. Let's talk about two, Breast Augmentation, and Lasek Eye Surgery. In both of these examples, when the technology was new, these were seen as something only the rich could afford. And it was true, most of these surgeries would cost more than a car (generally the second most expensive item a person will ever purchase). Most people couldn't afford that, however business fought for the top dollar. Then competition came in, and slowly the cost of the surgeries which were ultimately funded and made cheaper by the rich, slowly drops in price to the VERY affordable rates they are currently at. Today society as a whole benefits from the free market and competition that comes with in in being MORE able to afford a quality of life medical operation. We should make our entire healthcare system like that. 

You see, because in a Libertarian society, we aren't trying to avoid paying our fair share. We just think that every single person has the right to how much and where their ""donations"" go.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4xkqbk/core_intends_to_disrupt_the_p2p_network_with/d6onrf9

***

So how do I know gmax wasn't stealing credit? I was a part of the actual conversation where he reproduced the Github bug and publically stated he reproduced the bug in the main development discussion channel on Freenode in front of *literally hundreds* of witnesses, and *logged publically and permanently on a search-engine-indexed website.* I didn't think he was claiming he did those commits. Neither did the other participants of the conversation.

Github subsequently fixed the bug after gmax himself reported it to them.

gmax never said nor implied he wrote those early bitcoin commits. gmax never claimed to have been the one to write them. In no messages about this did he ever claim that sirius_m's commits were in actuality his, and in no messages that anyone has quoted, and no messages in anyone's linked stories, has anyone ever offered any evidence that gmax attempted to claim credit for those commits—in fact, as written, the evidence indicates exactly the opposite!

I have been posting this debunking for weeks now, repetitively, over and over. *Nobody* making this claim has literally posted any evidence. It's manufactured. A lie.

Even all the r\btc self-references to this story are identical in nature. They use peoples' commentary over a long period of time and then claim that is proof; however, it is not proof, it is recursive, self-referential, and invalid—and if you do in fact follow the self-cites backwards, you come up with piles of dead-ends. It's a manufactured lie.

There is no ""stolen"" misattribution! gmax explicitly told everyone what he was doing when he did it! Hundreds of witnesses. A permanent Google'able log.

Nothing anyone has said so far contradicts anything I have asserted about this, ever; nor is most of the evidence even verifiable by most of anyone because of the way dishonest people present this lie—pretty much entirely uncited. Luckily, *I was actually there and part of the conversation.* Yay me. So I was able to find a log without any difficulty.

In fact, if you *actually read the logs* you find that someone else in fact *did* steal commits! Why isn't anyone complaining about that?!

    [gmaxwell] looks like github may be compromised or badly broken: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master?author=saracen

gmaxwell was reproducing the github bug which we were all attempting to investigate and theorize about!

    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; yea, okay. I reproduced the stupidity.""
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; in any case, I went and reserved all the other dotless names in the history. .. looks like it only lets a single github user claim them, first come first serve.""

This isn't stealing someone else's credit; this is reproducing a bug in response to *someone else* stealing credit—he was stating categorically and on the record that the commits weren't his own, and that he was doing something to correct an actual misattribution by reporting it to Github!

Finally, for people who insist that Luke thought the the Github bug was a problem, Luke himself stated:

    &lt; luke-jr&gt; if I cared, I'd have brought it up on my own when I first noticed it (as mentioned in the logs, months earlier than then)

Done. saracen originally actually did steal credit. gmax stopped him from stealing more credit; gmax told hundreds of witnesses and a permanent, Google'able record about it; gmax reported the bug; Github fixed the bug. Github no longer lists gmax *or saracen* as authors of early commits.

d6o5flp,spookthesunset,15,"&gt; 30k people in India use Bitcoin

When you consider that during the Carter administration there were zero people in India using Bitcoin this is really remarkable.  It means on average the growth rate in India has done nothing but go up, which is quite amazing.

You don't need calculus to solve this.  You just need a pre-school education.  Look.  In the beginning bitcoin was zero.  Now it's 30k. In the beginning the price was zero.  Now it is almost $600.  I challenge you to find any fundamentally revolutionary technology that grew faster.  It look tens of thousands of years for the discovery of fire to catch on.  It took tens of thousands of years for us to perfect farming.  Even paper took a while before it went mainstream.  

Bitcoin is amazing.  It is the black swan of technology adoption.  The fact that we are at the cusp of mainstream adoption in less than a decade is nothing short of a complete miracle.

You should buy. Buy a lot.  You'd be crazy not to.  Bitcoin is never gonna be as cheap as it is now.  Five years from now, it will be at least $40,000.  Ten years and a single Satoshi will be worth $40,000.

There are a plenty of ways to be anonymous online and make it very difficult to be tracked. Using a vpn, the tor network, burner laptops and live bootable linux usb's are some things that you might use to protect yourself, but being consistent and never letting your guard down is hard. 

There was a case recently where the owner of the website kickasstorrents was arrested and charged with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering. One of the mistakes he made was not being behind a vpn when accessing the sites facebook page, which led to facebook handing over ip addresses to the authorities.
These ip addresses was then cross referenced with ip addresses obtained from apple from when he bought something on itunes. Apple also handed over private emails which discussed things related to the operation of kickasstorrents.
Ip addresses was also crossreferenced with the US based company coinbase which handles bitcoin transactions.
They also obtianed data used when creating the website dating back to 2009 in which the owners name as well as address was present. This isn't the whole story, and there are some more mistakes i haven't outlined, but i think it gives a decent picture of how someone might get caught online. Much of it boils down to him not using a vpn and trusting US based companies with any sort of personal data because they will hand it over upon request.

d6qhlb5,ArticulatedGentleman,22,"Cryptoeconomics

It's a very weird, small, young, and cross-disciplinary field, of which the most widely known example is [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It's what happens when you intersect economics/game-theory with computer science.

Nowadays you can already do some incredibly weird stuff like write programs that implement all the core logic of a business including finances, yet don't depend on anyone in particular to keep them running. That's doable using [Ethereum](http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html).

Still, for the most part things haven't yet progressed past parlor tricks that on the surface resemble digital Rube Goldberg machines for sending money across the room. I'd credit this to a few reasons:

1. Programming is really hard.
2. Security is really hard.
3. Designing economic incentives that guarantee people cooperate as intended is really hard.
4. Learning how to do something well with barely any precedent available is really hard.
5. Working in a field dominated by ideologues and people looking to get rich quick is really off-putting.
6. Spending the absurd amount of time necessary to gain the expertise necessary for original and valuable contributions to an extremely esoteric field is really unlikely.

And yet, the draw of working on an incredibly novel and difficult problem has lead to steady progress if punctuated by [the scam of the week](https://medium.com/@BlockByBlock/the-ugly-truth-behind-steemit-1a525f5e156) from the ""get rich quick"" crowd and

What's needed is more time and work for all the crippling issues with the field to be gradually smoothed out, and as that happens, much more interesting impacts on society can start being realized.

For starters, what are the consequences of giving everyone access to financial infrastructure that's orders of magnitude more powerful than whatever they had access to before? That includes existing financial institutions, which are very hyped up over ""Blockchain"".

One fun example would be making it practical to automatically buy insurance on regular household products at prices less than what it'd currently cost to fix/replace them, along with publicly listed prices that make it easy to look up how reliable something is with information that's unbiased and prohibitively expensive to falsify. Favorite shirt wore out? Here's a coupon to either take it to someone down the street who patches stuff up in their free time (automatic contracting of that type of service being another example of something newly possible) or get real cash back instead of store credit. All you had to do on your end to set it up was snap a picture of the receipt when you bought it. This whole paragraph something I came up with on the spot trying to think of a good consumer facing one, there are countless other things that will probably stay behind the scenes unless you're working with them directly.

Personally, I've found all this endlessly entertaining since coming across Bitcoin back in 2011, and it's a hobby accidentally turned profession. I think there are huge areas within cryptoeconomics beyond cryptocurrency that are waiting to be discovered with massive implications (my favorite angle is reputation systems and I hope that'll pan out some in the next few years). Cryptocurrency itself also stands to get a lot more interesting as it continues getting easier to use and various economies continue to periodically take a turn for the worse with traditional financial infrastructure left lacking for a while.

tl;dr: Hubris driven armchair economist programmers reinventing financial infrastructure from the ground up and gradually building much more empowering tools than anything currently available.",2016-08-21 20:39:55

(Confidential information can be encrypted with any AES key, but Top Secret can only be encrypted with 256-bit.) It's security theater, like much of what the government does. In reality, 128 bits of entropy is more than enough.

Now apply this to Bitcoin. A 12-word seed provides 128 bits of entropy to an EC private key, which is 256 bits wide. Yes, you can use 24 words to get a full 256 bits of entropy, but there is no practical reason to prefer that. (Do you want it to take a million years to guess your private key or a trillion years?

d6rni5u,ashmoran,13,"&gt; Marc Warne, the founder of Bittylicious, a site where bitcoins can be bought, says … “Bitcoin will be used more in the future because it’s the first time that something not fully controlled by any entity like a government or bank has been used over the internet. It has been around for about seven years now without any fundamental issues.”

How can someone running a Bitcoin trading company be so completely oblivious to what is going on? It has a *massive* fundamental issue that is tearing it apart. 

Nobody interviewed was quoted saying anything about the way Bitcoin is running at an artificially imposed capacity with no clear plan to raise it. Nobody mentioned anything about the widespread censorship on behalf of Core, the centralisation mining in China, or the ongoing manipulation of the miners. These are all major factors in deciding whether to buy bitcoin right now.

&gt; Hrycyszyn warns that, as with all technology, something better may one day come along. “When that happens, bitcoin’s value could collapse to near-zero, probably in a matter of hours or minutes, in a spectacular ball of flames. …”

This is the closest anyone gets to a serious warning, but again, the author of this quote seems oblivious to the fact this is happening *right now*. The market cap history of other cryptocurrencies compared to BTC shows exactly what is happening.

From a risk point of view, this is the worst possible time to buy bitcoin, as it has a real existential threat and competitors rapidly gaining ground.

I can only conclude that the only reason the price of Bitcoin remains as high as it is, is that the vast majority of people have *no idea what is going on*, and this sort of article only reinforces the ignorance. If so, I would expect that if Dave Hrycyszyn's warning about a collapse come true, it really will be sudden, as bagholders across the world suddenly realise their holding has been rendered useless, and panic sell across the board.

This is really bad journalism. Its advice is two years out of date and has failed to pick up any signs of the ongoing slow motion car crash plainly visibly on Reddit. However I don't expect any better any more, as journalists are equally oblivious to how fiat money works and the fundamental problems fiat has.

d6qnb6y,shyliar,12,"If you look around a little you'll find some people saying every cryptocurrency in existence is dead. In general for litecoin people saying so don't back it up with any evidence. It's been one of the top coins for years. Here are some reasons I like it:

- Capable of four times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.

- Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.

- The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.

- Anti-spam.

- Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 1,643 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (1,643 TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

- Continuous development look here at number of releases in past year: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases 

- Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2016: 
https://litecoinassociation.org/data/roadmap.pdf

- Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.

- Great community.

- Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify.

- Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins. http://cryptocoincharts.info/coins/graphicalComparison In fact volume has remained high since last June while maintaining a stable price.

- The speed, liquidity and value of Litecoin is useful to traders seeking arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.

- Soon to be added to coinbase.

- Upcoming release to include a on-chain adaptive block size scaling solution. This will substantially increase the transactional capacity of Litecoin. 

- Fair release. In a crypto world of premined and ICO releases many appreciate this fact. The code was released well before the Genesis block was mined and everyone knew when it would be going live; therefore, individuals could anticipate and get their miners and software ready.

- It's primary function is to be a cryptocurrency.

- It will always maintain the integrity of the blockchain (no hard forks for special interests).

- Security.

LOL. There is not a company in the world who will ever pay an underage high school student ~35k a year to telecommute and be a phone jockey. I know that isn't what you want to hear, but you're getting scammed hard.

This is a super common scam. Here's what's going to happen:

They deposit $3000 into your bank account.

You withdraw $3000 from your bank account, to put you at $0.

You send that money via an untraceable and non-refundable method (bitcoin).

That $3000 check or deposit is going to bounce, because it's fake.

You will then have -$3000 in your bank account and be liable to your bank for the money, because you took it out of your account.

Just think about this scenario for a few moments. Why would they *possibly* need *you* to get them Bitcoins? The entire point of Bitcoin is that it can be bought and sold by anyone, from anywhere, on the internet. So why do they need *your* bank account, and for *you* to buy it? There's not a single logical reason in the world. The only *possible* reason they need you to do that is to scam you.

What you should do is **immediately drop all contact**. Inform your bank what happened. In a few days, that $3000 will disappear because it doesn't actually exist. He won't sue or peruse any legal actions because A) he hasn't been harmed at all so there's nothing to sue for, and B) he's committing several federal-level felonies. Any threats he makes are 100% empty because *you* have done nothing wrong, but *he* has fucked up **bad**.

/r/personalfinance gave you the exact same advice, and you **know** the company is fake, so I don't know what you expected to hear from us.

Unless you work in finance or are an executive, there is never a job where the company will ask you to transfer thousands of dollars around. And even if you do work in those fields, they will never use your personal bank account. Anyone asking you to transfer money in/out of your bank is scamming you.",2016-08-23 10:56:01

so , here we have the blockstream cartel cherry picking Satoshi's intentions and features , depending on how favourable to their plans they are . which incidentially is very similar to how religious people claim that this bit from the scriptures is true , that is more or less a metaphore , and that other wasn't really being serious .

d6t2ygs,bruce_fenton,33,"""Bitcoin computer is not what investors hoped for"" 

Of course - that's not what the plan is.  People who think the endgame for 21 is to try to sell those particular devices should look into it more.

My guess is that, as Microsoft once envisioned a world with ""A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software"",  21 perhaps envisions a world where almost every device has computer chip (cars, ovens, parking meters, drones, laptops, kindles and the biggie...phones!) and that chip is a mini 21 computer...that is mining Bitcoin and, more importantly, enabling the device to make money, pay for stuff and transfer payments.   

This uses the power of Bitcoin to change the paradigm for how we pay for things and opens new doors to things it was not practical to pay for (the ""writers can make 3 cents every time someone reads an article"" concept we were talking about 20 years ago).  

It's really an insanely exciting and huge idea if you think about it.

21 is working at a much higher level and the Bitcoin computers were SDKs for developers to help see what kind of IOT / Bitcoin apps could be made -- it's essentially R&amp;D -- only instead of hiring and managing all those devs and judging what might work...they released the computer for the world to organically build stuff.  

As an added bonus they sold the R&amp;D computers for money - pretty smart.

I'm sure the original business plan didn't say ""please give us $100mm to sell computers on Amazon"".  :)

They have a great team, IMHO one of the very best in this industry.  

Just as people once speculated Circle might be vaporware while they were quietly building one of the best UIs in Bitcoin, 21 - if you look at the job openings they've had etc - is definitely doing good stuff.   

They know what they are doing.  Keep watching.",2016-08-23 20:16:41

d6sitvy,Xekyo,22,"If you take a careful look at Monero, you will see that while it is impressive technology-wise, it is not eating Bitcoin's lunch. [Monero has seen less transactions in the last year than Bitcoin does in one day](http://moneroblocks.info/stats). It is now up to 2 transactions per block, a total of 1684 today.

Monero doesn't have a fixed blocksize limit, so **capacity is unlimited**. As everyone here is well-aware Bitcoin is limited at 1MB capacity at this moment. (/u/ferretinjapan felt I was dropping this under the table, but I just felt that it is already known to everyone, so didn't bother stating the obvious.)   
Assuming that Bitcoin will increase it's capacity limit eventually, which I'm certain it will, Monero's long-term **scalability would be worse** than Bitcoin: 

* Transactions in Monero are about four to eight times as large as Bitcoin transactions. 
* Transactions will increase in size significantly with the planned introduction of RingCT. *Correction: As pointed out by /u/ferretinjapan, RingCT is bigger for small transactions, but actually more efficient for large transactions.*
* Block verification of Cryptonight is much more computationally intensive than SHA-2. 
* Spent transaction outputs never leave the TXO set, while Bitcoin's UTXO set can be pruned of every spent transaction output.

If Monero had Bitcoin's transaction levels right now that would mean that its blockchain would grow by about 340 MB per day, and the TXO at least by 15 MB per day, or roughly 5.5 GB per year. (I'm using the size of Bitcoin outputs here to estimate a lower bound, as I couldn't find out how big Monero outputs are.)

The TXO set has to be kept in memory or loaded from disk by miners in order to quickly verify incoming transactions/block. As block intervals are two minutes, every second longer until the previous block is verified hurts the miner even more than in Bitcoin. While Monero's blockchain can be pruned similarly to Bitcoin's, i.e. pruning of signatures or old blocks, the TXO set cannot be pruned.

So, again: Monero is technologically impressive and an interesting, privacy focused companion for Bitcoin. It's not eating Bitcoin's lunch, neither currently nor in the foreseeable future.

d6sqv3m,LooksAtClouds,18,"I hate to say it, but - it really is ignorant. You are young, you will learn. Start by learning about check processing. You asked what it means when a check ""clears"". Here's a (very simplified) version of the process - as it SHOULD be:

* You deposit a check written by someone with an account at Bank B for $1000 into your account at Bank A.
* You look at your account balance, Bank A shows a $1000 deposit as ""pending"". They will not give you the $1000 in cash or anything else at this point.
* Bank A sends the check to a ""clearing house"" (that's where the ""clear"" comes from). Clearing house contacts Bank B and asks if the check-writer's account has the $1000, and tells them to deduct the $1000 from that account. It used to be physical pieces of paper moving around. Now it is more likely to be a string of numbers sent electronically. This process can take a while (up to 10 days, I think).
* Clearing house tells Bank A that the check was ""good"", and to go ahead and release the funds.
* Bank A removes the ""pending"" tag on that $1000 and lets you have the money.

HOWEVER, in practice, for good/known customers most bank A's will release the money in just a few days. It's a gamble that Bank A is willing to take. WHY? Well, because, if the check turns out to be fraudulent, (i.e. the account at Bank B doesn't have the money - or the account doesn't exist) Bank A is going to get its money back from the customer (you) anyway. You won't have any recourse other than to file a police report &amp; chalk it up to inexperience.

That gap between 2 days and the 10-day clearance period is where the con man comes in. He writes you a fake check and tells you to deposit it to your bank and send money (or bitcoin) elsewhere, you deposit the check, you withdraw the money after a couple of days and send it off. Then the bank lets you know your deposit was fraudulent, they take money away from you, you cry. 

I'd be surprised if you hear much more from this scammer. But maybe you can get the police involved and they can teach you how to string the scammer along so he can be caught, if possible.

Read more about [Fake Checks](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0159-fake-checks). Your bank did you a great service. You should thank them. Go in &amp; visit with a banker and get them to tell you more. Then share that info with your friends. If enough people find out and help educate others, we can greatly reduce this fraud.

Hm? No. So far I haven't seen a level of activity from your team that suggests that you have the skill or background to contribute usefully to that effort.

The point I was making, rather, was not a complaint that you've continually failed to contribute to or collaborate with Bitcoin protocol development-- but that you're simply way behind on those updates and starting at a significant disadvantage. Prompt action is needed if you intend to continue to have an implementation which is even potentially useful to others.

d6vsjhd,Namika,84,"As I replied to someone else down below, most of what you're getting at here is overblown or downright false, and it's a repeated soundbite that armchair ""experts"" have been telling people to try and sound smart. It reminds me of anti-vaxxers shouting at how vaccines are bad because of X, Y, and Z, and then people believe them without ever looking up if X, Y, and Z are actually true.

The petrodollar mattered for a while back in the 70s when the US and the USSR were both trying to establish international markets for their currencies, but that concern is long, long over. Presently, the effect the ""petrodollar"" has on the currency markets is virtually nonexistent. You could overnight switch all international oil sales over to Bitcoin and the USD's value in global markets wouldn't drop more than a percentage point.

&gt;This is one reason why oil and gas is so cheap in the US, and why all other derivative products (plastics, etc) are as well.

No. Gasoline and natural gas are cheap in the US not because of the petrodollar, but because the US is the largest oil producing country in the Western Hemisphere (3rd largest globally!), and because Texas has the largest and most advanced refineries in the world.

&gt;Even though the US itself doesn't import much oil from Saudi Arabia, the rest of the world does. And since they need US dollars to do so, it means the value of the USD remains very high. The petrodollar is a key pillar of the US economy... we have to sleep with this backstabbing shit pile of a country if we don't want to send our economy into total chaos.

The USD is not the global reserve currency not because of the petrodollar, but rather because it's the largest economy in the world and because there are quite simply no other currencies large or stable enough to take it's place. I mean, let's just pretend you're totally right about the petrodollar being the only reason for the USD being the global currency. Alright, now let's say everyone stopped selling oil in dollars! Oh no! The USD lost it's petrodollar support! Without that, according to your claims, no one will want the USD and it won't be the global reserve currency... okay so now *what currency is the new global currency?* The Euro's potential to be a global reserve currency was growing, but ever since 2010 there has been worry that the Euro itself may fail since half of Europe is defaulting and countries are pull out of the EU itself. The Euro's demand in the global currency market has slowly fallen over the past several years and it's in no place to be the new global reserve that everyone wants. Who else is there to replace the dollar? China?  
China's economy is large, but the yuan's value is entirely controlled by China's government and not by the free market, the dollar (for all it's faults) is still a freely traded currency and the markets and consumers ultimatly decide how much it's worth unlike the yuan which has an exchange value entirely decided behind closed doors. Recently during the Chinese stock market crash, overnight the Chinese government just ""decided"" that the yuan was worth 5% less. There was no market input, no trader demand, just ""poof"" and China changed it's currency's value at a whim. The USD has inflation, but it's on the matter of 1-2% *per year*, not 5% value lost overnight. You can't run a global market on a currency that is so arbitrarily defined. And, of course, the other huge issue with the yuan is you're not even able to buy or trade the yuan in large quantities outside of China, making it impossible to use as a global currency.

Long story short, the USD is literally the only currency left standing and is the global reserve currency by default rather than by some sort of ""secret backdoor Nixon deal to make a deal with the devils in Saudi Arabia to ensure US economic power!"". While there was a deal with the Saudis, it's actual effect on the markets today is little more than a conspiracy theory. People love sharing it or telling it to students because the idea sounds really exciting and mischievous, and high school or college students eat it up because it makes them feel like they learned some secret on how the world runs. Teachers like to tell it to intro level students too, because it makes their class seem cool and makes the students think their field is exciting. But, the real world is not that exciting and the the petrodollar is not some all powerful source of US strength, and it's not the central pillar holding up the entire US economy. There are thousands of reasons why the USD dominates the currency markets. Saying stuff is cheap in the US all because of the petrodollar is like staring at a single tree and ignoring the entire forest around you.",2016-08-25 15:57:40

I'm not sure what today's excuse is, but the reasons for stalling have included (partial list):

1. Satoshi's original intent was a blockchain limited to 1MB blocks (appeal to originalism)

2. Investors purchased Bitcoin knowing about the limit, therefore it represents an underlying economic assumption that can no longer be changed

3. Scarcity of space will drive demand, making Bitcoin more popular

4. We need to ""develop a fee market"" so that miners can run on fees before the block reward ends (sometime after year 2100)

5. 1MB blocks are already too large to be considered safe

6. The Great Firewall of China gives more advantage to Chinese miners the larger blocks get, so we need to keep them small to protect decentralization

7. Hardforks are too hard and won't work

8. Bitcoin cannot hardfork *contentiously*

9. Blocks must be kept small to force ""paid spam"" off the network

10. It'll cost too much to store transactions and people will stop running nodes at home

11. It'll use too much network bandwidth and people will stop running nodes at home

12. etc.

If you've followed this you know that [the obstructionism goes back to 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) and that the reasons for not changing the block size have changed repeatedly based on politics.

So those are the *excuses.*  Let's talk about the *reasons.*

For reference, [this is a blog post from Zavain Dar](http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/02/the-2-biggest-emerging-opportunities-in-cryptocurrency/), of Lux Capital, one of Blockstreams primary / early investors.  In this post he is explaining why he invested in Blockstream.  You'll find nothing terribly offensive about it, but this should stand out if you read carefully and think about it (highlighting mine):

&gt; .2) The Bitcoin ledger is the largest and most secure decentralized ledger in the world, but its prominence is almost an anecdotal side effect to Satoshi’s initial goal: a proof-of-concept for decentralized ledgers. As such, **the current implementation has very real flaws that limit the applicability of Bitcoin and its potential to become a global transaction network.**

&gt; Tangible shortcomings include:

(list of things wrong with Bitcoin: difficult to maintain infrastructure, inflexible rulebase, hashrate arms race, 7tps throughput + 10 min average latency, single currency that doesn't allow for innovation)

&gt; From early conversations with Austin and Adam it was clear **they agreed and saw eye-to-eye with the above shortcomings**, particularly regarding core infrastructure. What excited me most about these conversations was their ability to synthesize an understanding and aggressive vision of a future blockchain, its tangible current shortcomings, and a **technological path forward vis-a-vis side chains to immediately address the shortcomings**

Notably absent: **any plan to actually fix the underlying defects**.

Instead, the plan **requires that these defects remain present** so that Blockstream's sidechain solutions can address the 'problems' with Bitcoin.

So basically, Adam Back and Austin Hill (and presumably Greg Maxwell) convinced their investors that Bitcoin cannot fix its underlying throughput defects onchain and therefore as Bitcoin becomes more popular, the network will perforce have to move to offchain solutions, provided by Blockstream.

Fix the problems, and the need for Blockstream goes away.  Poof!

So, therefore, it becomes critically important that Blockstream ""freeze"" Bitcoin in place, preventing any improvements on the mainchain, so that their sidechain solutions (vaporware at this time AFAIK) can find a market.  And thus the endless FUD against any sort of fork, especially one that Blockstream itself does not lead.

This leads one to the conclusion that Blockstream is *trying to stifle mainchain innovation* for its own profit.",2016-08-25 16:47:13

This is already fixed and released at www.bitcoinunlimited.info/download

Yet, his comment ""and only have it running on a dozen or so nodes (which are constantly crashing, btw)""  is certainly psychologically instructive.

A simple check of bitnodes show over 100 BU nodes, and if you look at the bug reports you can see that only a few individuals hit the problem.

So its fascinating -- he's careful not to lie in broad facts but only in scope.  I think that this sort of exaggeration is likely a representative sample and recommend that people as a rule of thumb adjust against his bias every statement he makes by approximately a factor of 10 or so (100 nodes / his claimed ""dozen"").  I think that the reason he behaves this way is probably because Blockstream's business model requires Blockstream dominance of the Bitcoin client.  

In contrast, the BU devs have no such conflict of interest and are simply working for Bitcoin's success as a P2P currency.

For example, we have known of a nasty UX issue in Core since 0.12.0.  I haven't actually retested in 0.12.1 or 0.13.0 but a quick glance shows that the code remains unchanged.

But I will share it now.  Basically, if your transaction is rejected from your own mempool for any reason it will never be relayed to the network or miners but will be debited from your wallet.  One way this can happen is if you provide a very large transaction fee.

So from a user's perspective, you could send a 50BTC payment and because you REALLY want it fast you give a very large txn fee (but still only .5 or 1% of your payment).  The result would be that you get a modal error box, the payment is deducted from your wallet, and the recipient never receives it. 

But it is generally counterproductive to Bitcoin as a whole to run around Reddit and smear the other people's efforts so typically we do not engage in such behavior.",2016-08-25 00:32:31

Look at these forums, people are fed up and no longer fooled.  The innovation and energy is gone from /r/bitcoin although it is still useful as a newbie zone, which is why you are here.

There is still time to change to make Bitcoin and Blockstream into the phenomenon and organization they could have been.  There is plenty of space for both.  But an artificially limited blockchain, in an environment of unlimited (or less limited) altcoin blockchains is doomed to failure even with a Lightning network.  Whereas a blockchain where lightning and onchain scaling can compete on their own merits will be strong.  You have invested a tremendous amount of Blockstream's money controlling expertise in Bitcoin.  Beware that that investment becomes worthless as Bitcoin's market cap and use stagnates. 

I cannot know the future and neither can you; it is a possibility that with repeated onchain scaling, Bitcoin might grow so large that home users cannot sync the blockchain without spending extra for a high bandwidth connection or using a VPS.  But note that users will ALWAYS be able to join in a permissionless manner (we can hide the Bitcoin traffic on a VPS via encryption and HTTPS encapsulation for example) and that is what's most important.  And affordability is a straw man argument -- if you cannot afford a VPS you are unlikely to need to store the entire blockchain personally yourself, and in a 1MB-limited, successful lightning deployment, you could not afford to generate a transaction on it anyway.  But its also very possible that physical advances in storage and network capacity will allow us to keep up.  

But there can be no doubt that limiting transaction capacity will destroy Bitcoin.  You simply cannot grow a technology if it cannot grow.  The recent performance of Ethereum, Monero and other altcoins and the many press releases of new products and services being built on other blockchains is empirical evidence of this.

The destruction of goodwill towards Blockstream that you have caused is unbelievable.   

Its really refreshing and renewing to simply admit you were wrong and move forward in a new and better path.

R3 CEV, a startup working to build new Wall Street infrastructure using bitcoin technology, said it had filed for a patent this week and named its product Concord for the harmony it aims to build among more than 60 banks.

The patent application is the New York firm’s first, shedding some light on what has so far been a widely followed but opaque firm.

R3, launched in September 2015 with a consortium of nine multinational banks, has since grown to more than 60 and includes Barclays PLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

The goal of the firm has been create standards for financial services based on “blockchain,” the open-ledger system used to trade the virtual currency bitcoin. It hopes to sell its wares both to the participant banks and others.

With the filing, the firm is essentially unveiling its plans. What it has built is something that looks in some respects like the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but with significant differences to appeal to banks.

Concord aims to be a universal software platform connecting bank operations both within firms and across markets, aimed at digitizing so-called middle- and back-office functions, like trade clearing and settling, asset registry, and reconciliation, even the recording of cash balances.

If it comes together, the platform could help banks streamline cumbersome operations, lower the costs of maintaining them, and realize billions of dollars in savings.

IBM Set to Launch One of the Largest Blockchain Implementations to Date (July 29)
“I don’t think there’s ever been a time when there’s been so much pressure on banks,” said David Rutter, R3’s founder and CEO, amid post-crisis regulations, a tough capital environment, and pressure to cost costs. “It’s been difficult if not impossible for these big banks to cut costs in a significant way.”

A version of Concord is expected to be launched in the next several months, R3 executives told The Wall Street Journal, with a small number of banks using it to test some services early in 2017. It hopes to launch an “alpha” version by mid-year. “We need to make this real to business users in 2017,” said Todd McDonald, R3 co-founder and chief operating officer.

Figuring out the best way to use blockchain-based tools in the financial-services industry has become a hot topic. Virtually every major multinational bank is involved in one or multiple working groups. A number of firms, including Digital Asset Holdings, Hyperledger Project, Ripple, Microsoft’s Azure, and others are all working on products to take advantage of the new technology.

In many ways, Concord resembles ethereum, the bitcoin offshoot being built as a platform for application hosting. Concord, too, is viewed as a platform that will allow developers to build any variety of applications. But it is tailored expressly for financial institutions, and so has different features and functions.

Perhaps the most important difference between Concord and bitcoin and ethereum is the way transactions are recorded. With bitcoin and ethereum, every transaction is recorded, verified and disclosed immediately in their respective public, distributed ledgers. With Concord, while the transaction is verified via a distributed ledger, it is not publicly disclosed. The details are shared only by the parties involved, or parties to whom they give access.

Maintaining this confidentiality was a key concern of R3’s members banks, said Mr. McDonald.  R3 also worked with and met with more than 70 global regulators during development.

Concord is the result of a “total reimagining of the back office,” Mr. McDonald said. The firm describes Concord as a “shared-services model” that still maintains privacy for banks.

The banks in R3’s consortium have not committed to the new platform, and indeed aren’t bound to use it, Mr. McDonald said. However, they’ve invested money and resources in helping build it, and also had input into Concord’s specifications.

While Concord does resemble other platforms, R3 felt it offered enough unique features that it justifies a patent. One other difference between Concord and bitcoin: Concord doesn’t have a coin.",2016-08-25 00:12:07

The reason for the ""perhaps"" with libsecp256k1 is because when a library is part of many projects, and you copy that library, that doesn't mean you took it from any particular project. So you could argue that Ethereum copied libsecp256k1 from Bitcoin if you want, but, again, that doesn't even roughly imply that Ethereum is somehow a fork of Bitcoin anymore than Bitcoin is a fork of hashcash or miniupnpc (libs and algorithms that Bitcoin uses from others).

###The data for the graphs is accessible here:

https://rudd-o.com/downloads/monero-scalability-problems.ods/view

This page has a link to a downloadable spreadsheet that you can view.  Despite claims by a few liars here, the above is perfectly safe.  The spreadsheet is macro-free, it's free, and anyone can open it with free and open source software (LibreOffice Suite).  If you do not have the software, you can upload it to your favorite cloud service in order to inspect the contents, without any fear of malware.  Downloading the file is safe.  Uploading it to your favorite cloud office suite is also safe.  **Do not let ignorant people scare you into bullshit computer security beliefs.**

Summary of findings:

* At 3 TPS (about Bitcoin today), there is an explosion in data validation costs that makes it completely impossible to run validating nodes except for hard profit.  This is the centralization stage.
* At ~3 TPS, Bitcoin has an edge over Monero because it doesn't require expensive storage technology (like Zeus RAM drives) to keep it going.  And remember those numbers project 3 TPS many years down the road, whereas we already have 3 TPS with Bitcoin using current, shitty storage technology.  I can run a full Bitcoin node today on a bandwidth-limited connection and IOPS-limited drive, no problem — this would **not** be true for a 3 TPS Monero node.
* At 100 TPS, the time to validate a year's worth of transactions exceeds a year.
* At 3K TPS, the space needed to store the minimum data necessary to validate transactions begins to exceed the growth in storage available for the purpose, based on previous parameters.
* Some folks argue that the 3 TPS figure is too low.  I'm open to believing that, but even if the figure was substantially higher, eventually the problems of having to keep the TXO around catch up with Monero.

**Key takeaway: Monero can easily beat Bitcoin in performance, if an algorithm is devised that helps Monero avoid the need to keep the TXO set in memory.  Without that algorithm, Monero remains bound to a low TPS.**

**[UPDATE: someone has come up with an algorithmic rule for Monero's mixing process which would make this problem go away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/4zgqas/i_thought_we_could_theoretically_scale_to/d6wdtlq?context=3)  Progress!**


--------------------------------------

A concern raised by a Monero user / dev:

&gt; We got 180K reads from the database [...] The performance barrier he talks about, when the TXO set exceeds RAM size, doesn't exist in LMDB. We routinely test with DB's of 5x and 50x RAM size. Performance degrades slightly of course, but not drastically.

2. 180K reads/sec from spinning rust or SSD can only happen with very expensive parallel arrays, or with datasets which have a hot set in memory (which won't be the case as the TXO grows far beyond RAM size).  This just proves my point that centralization is forced, at some point in the timeline,  by Monero's algorithmic demand that TXO be kept as a working set (whether in disk or in RAM).
4. LMDB cannot give Monero equal-to-RAM performance, because LMDB only serves as a way to obtain the necessary data to validate the incoming transactions.  Assuming that the TXO does not fit in RAM, you still need to go to disk to obtain the necessary blocks to perform the computations to validate a transaction.  No magical storage or database technology can prevent that.  Even if LMDB gave you a 5X performance edge over paging in and out from disk and into RAM, this is just a linear improvement that will be soon overshadowed by database growth (see next point).
3. Faster-than-exponential growth of the TXO set means that no linear improvement, or even exponential improvement, of computer technology can cross that ~3 TPS hump that we see on the graphs (without a 3 orders of magnitude degradation in transaction validation performance, which is the point of the graph).  It does not matter what LMDB can do for you today, as the growth surpasses what it can do for you.
4. Tweaking initial parameters in the spreadsheet can only serve to delay the point at which the 3 TPS problem occurs, or the 100 TPS problem occurs, or the ~3K TPS problem occurs.
2. Some people are claiming that I have refused to provide the data.  As the link above makes it clear, those are blatant lies.

-------------------------------------------


These conclusions arise from (a) realistic, conservative parameters for computing growth (b) optimistic (in cases, completely vaporwarish) parameters for Monero's scaling, evolution and needs.  So, before anyone says that Monero is going to be the ""money of tomorrow, not of today"", keep in mind that the projections already contemplate the ""computers of tomorrow"".",2016-08-25 14:02:55

We waited for the 2 MB HF as negotiated in the Hong Kong Roundtable agreement until it was breached by Blockstream on 2016-08-01. No Segwit and no 2 MB HF code even today almost a month later. The miners are still not mining 100 % BIP109 blocks which means that they have become allies with Blockstream for some reason. 

Maybe the miners bought Blockstream shares, I don't know. And I and many big blockers no longer care. We created our first spinoff in /r/btcfork and will be changing PoW to avoid attack from the Blockstream allied Chinese miners. Our move has already been made. 

What would we do if Blockstream / Bitcoin Core would suddenly offer a 2 MB hard fork out of nowhere? Probably nothing. They can do what they want with their intentionally crippled currency and we will do whatever we want with our Bitcoin spinoff(s). Our offer of a 2 MB HF compromise has been withdrawn because we wanted Bitcoin to have no blocksize limit at all, and this way we're getting what we originally wanted. We're going our separate ways now. The current Blockstream allied developers are not welcome to involve themselves into our spinoff(s) because they would likely try to sabotage our (competing) project(s) in various ways.

I'm personally phasing out my XBT holdings a little each week and will be 90 % out of XBT at 2016-12-31 (Each week's selloff is larger than the selloff the previous week. My largest single selloff will thus be week 52 of this year.). I'm exiting to boring old fiat until it's been determined which spinoff will be the new dominant Bitcoin. I'm keeping 10 % of my Blockstream-bitcoin just in case I'm wrong and they are right. If Blockstream / Bitcoin Core would surprise us and activate a 2 MB HF before the end of 2016, then I would stop selling my Blockstream-bitcoin and just keep them as-is until the a winning Bitcoin spinoff has become clear.

That will probably take a few years but it may also happen faster than that. But I would never again buy Blockstream-bitcoin as long as Blockstream and Bitcoin Core controls the protocol. Bitcoin Unlimited got 0.5 million USD in funding recently. If the miners vote to abandon Blockstream / Bitcoin Core and they join Bitcoin Unlimited by running their altclient, then I'd consider buying back Bitcoin Unlimited-bitcoin again. I'm not buying any altcoins because they have the same currently unsolved (potential) governance problem just waiting for another Blockstream to appear and take over. If the spinoff(s) all fail, then I'm very unlikely to ever buy any cryptocurrency again unless someone solves the governance-centralization problem in a convincing way.",2016-08-26 12:14:01
d6wxipq,todu,30,"**At first came [Slashdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot) (1997) and it seemed like it would remain the dominant forum forever because it already had all the users** and why would you move to a new forum when you'd be talking to yourself there? Slashdot once (in 2006) had 5.5 million users and still (2012) have 3.7 million users. So it never technically *died*, but it stagnated in growth. 

Sounds familiar? Most people guesstimate the total number of Bitcoin users to about 1 million, and we've reached the 1 MB limit which means we've stagnated in growth.

Then came [Digg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg) (2004) and took the Slashdot users because Digg had a superior post and comment voting system as well as a superior comment hierarchy system. Slashdot also implemented a hierarchy for their comments eventually but it was years after the users had already left to Digg. Digg once had 3.8 million monthly U.S. unique visitors so let's call them monthly users (I don't have good user statistics for Digg). They never scaled further than that and their user base stagnated too. 

In 2008 Digg started bombarding their users with ads and tried to aggressively monetize their site in various obnoxious ways. Because they were the dominant forum and who would leave, right? No one would want to leave to a competing forum when Digg already had all the users. Who would want to talk to themselves. People left from Digg in 2008 to Reddit and I was one of those people.

Just like people left from /r/bitcoin to /r/bitcoinxt and soon thereafter to /r/btc and now recently to /r/btcfork. Blockstream started behaving like Digg for the same reason. Who would leave? Blockstream / Bitcoin Core and /r/bitcoin has all the users. Who would leave, right? Who would want to trade their currency only with themselves. Time to monetize our user base! Let's cap the limit to 1 MB / 3 tps / Full RBF!

Slashdot had and has 1-10 million monthly users. Digg also had 1-10 million monthly users and I assume much less users now. They didn't *die* but their growth stagnated because they refused to adapt to user demands and other forums eventually took their users. Reddit took most of that user base and they didn't abuse their user base, so [Reddit grew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) to this user base:

""As of 2016, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), ranking #11 most visited web-site in US and #25 in the world.""

So yes, these massive user base migrations took 2 decades (1997 - 2016) to happen. But they *do* happen when you don't listen to the demands of your users. Guess what, Blockstream, Bitcoin Core and Theymos from /r/bitcoin do not listen to the demands of their user base. They have about 1 million Bitcoin users currently. Those users have started leaving. I remember how the Digg users that stayed on Digg and refused to move to Reddit laughed at the user that did move. Reddit is so small that it's insignificant they said. Well, massive user migrations take a few years but they happen. Over and over and most project leaders never learn from history.

I didn't mention Facebook because those users come from a different source. Those users never used Slashdot, Digg and Reddit so they don't count when I describe the history of this particular forum user base.

d6xi041,Rannasha,30,"The blockchain is an attempt to solve a longstanding problem in computer science: The Byzantine Generals problem. In essence this boils down to getting a number of participants in a network to agree on something, without there being a central authority and knowing that it is possible for some participants to be uncooperative and malevolent.

These two requirements (no central authority and potential for malevolent actors) make solving the issue rather difficult. If there's a central authority, then it can tally votes from all participants and if there are no malevolent actors, you could imagine all participants forwarding a list where each new recipient adds his name and vote and passes the list on to everyone he is connected to until no more new names are added since the previous time the list was received. At that point, each participant should have, or have seen, a full list of votes and can conclude the decission.

Anyway, the blockchain is designed with the assumption that those things do not work so nicely. The goal of the blockchain is to take a set of transactions and from these, pick those that follow the rules of the network. If there are multiple conflicting transactions that follow all the rules (for example, multiple transactions that spend the same money in different ways), then the first is picked.

How does that work in practice? To add a new set of transactions to the ledger, they need to be packed into a ""block"". A block is essentially a set of transactions coupled with some extra information. This extra information is called the ""blockheader"" or just ""header"".

The header is set up in such a way that changing a transaction in a block will also change the header. In Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies, this is done by including a value in the header that is derived from all the transactions in the block (to be specific: the root of the merkle tree containing all transactions, a merkle tree being a cryptographic data structure). What's important to know is that given a set of transactions, it is easy to determine whether the value in the header matches those transactions.

The next item in the header is a reference to the previous block. For this, we make a brief detour past cryptographic hash functions, which is a concept that is important for this entire subject.

A hash functon is a mathematical function that maps a number of any size to a fixed size output. Since in a computer, data can be represented by a number, a hash function can take any piece of data and map it to an output of fixed size. A very simple example of a hash function is the function that takes a number, adds up all its digits and repeats that until a single digit number remains. This function can take an arbitrarily large number and will always yield a single digit number as result. Of course, in reality, hash functions that are actually being used are more complicated. One application of such functions is to verify that a file you've downloaded was not corrupted during the download. The uploader computes the hash function of the file (choosing one of the many functions available) and posts the outcome online. The downloader can do the same computation after downloading and if they don't match, a problem has occurred.

A special class of hash functions are cryptographic hash functions. These are hash functions that also have the property that they're infeasible to invert. That is, given an output, it is very hard (computationally) to find an input that would produce exactly that output. If you take my example of the digit-adding-hash-function, then given the output 3, I can easily come up with inputs that would have 3 as output (3 itself, but also 12, 30, 93, 156, 749285555644682913, etc...). So the digit-adding-function is not a cryptographic hash function.

Back to blocks and headers. A cryptographic hash function is used on the header of a block. The outcome is then used in the next block to point towards the previous one. So the hash of the blockheader of block X is stored in the blockheader of block X+1.

So participants in the network gather transactions, bundle them in blocks, add a blockheader and send them to other participants. But there's something missing still. Who decides who can submit a block and what happens if multiple participants want to submit a block at the same time?

This is where ""proof-of-work"" comes into play. In the blockheader, there's an extra data field available called the ""nonce"". This field can have any value. But there's an additional requirement, namely that the hash value of the header should be smaller than a certain target value.

So what participants in the network need to do, is build a block and then fill in some value in the nonce-field, compute the hash value, compare it with the target value and if the hash value is larger than the target value, try again with a different value for the nonce. Repeat this until a nonce value is found that does make the hash of the blockheader smaller than the target.

Once this happens, the participant broadcasts the block to the network. All other participants can verify that the transactions in the block are valid, that it correctly refers to the previous block in the chain and they can also compute the hash of the header to check that it's indeed below the target.

Since a cryptographic hash function was used, which can't be inverted easily, it's not possible for participants to start with a value they want as outcome for the hash and compute a nonce-value that makes it happen. The only way to find a block whose header has a hash value below the target is to simply try and try again.

Once a block has been created, broadcast and accepted, it becomes very difficult to change it. If you add, remove or change a transaction, the blockheader will change (more speficially the root of the merkle tree that is included in the header) and because of that, its hash value will change and it will with extremely high probability no longer be below the target value, which means the block has become invalid. The only way to change a block is to redo the proof-of-work calculations and try to find a nonce that works with the changed block contents.

But all the while, the rest of the network is happily chugging along working on the next block in the chain. And participants will always follow the longest valid chain, so unless an attacker can create blocks at a faster rate than the rest of the network, he will be unable to get his version of the events accepted by the others. Effectively, an attacker needs more than half the total computing power to succeed with this attack.

In Bitcoin the hash function used to compute the hash value of the header is SHA256. Litecoin uses Scrypt. And other variants may use other functions. From a computer science point of view, it doesn't really matter which hash function is used, though there are philosophical reasons to prefer one or the other.

In fact, it's not even necessary to use a cryptographic hash function and a variable nonce-value in the header. You can use any ""puzzle"" provided it meets the following requirements:

- Both the puzzle and its solution depend on the contents of the block. Change something in the block and the puzzle should change as well.
- Computing a solution to the puzzle should be difficult, but verifying the correctness should be fast (finding the correct nonce in Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies is very difficult, but once found, other users only need to compute the hash function once to verify that a block is valid).
- The difficulty of the puzzle can be altered. In the context of hash functions and nonces, this means that the target value can be altered. I didn't go into this, but cryptocurrencies periodically adjust the target value depending on the amount of computer power in the network to ensure that blocks are being found at a more or less steady pace.

The above is just the beginning of the story and I have left out many important topics, yet still produced a rather significant wall of text. Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a fascinating subject from a technological point of view (regardless of the economical and political philosophies that often come with them). For further reading, I strongly recommend the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. This is the document that started it all. It is quite readable even without in-depth background knowledge of the subject matter.

d6wvjvp,Nichoros_Strategy,28,"I don't buy this rhetoric. Why people think a cryptocurrency can just be hard forked willy nilly is beyond me. Hard forks tear communities apart, and no one wants it to happen unless there is a damn good reason. I believe that each time a hard fork happens, the next one will be more difficult to pull off, because remember, no one has absolute control, there is however a working consensus algorithm for just about every blockchain, and that is how the Ethereum hard fork went through, people with skin in the game voted for it (the miners). If you don't believe in that, then you don't believe in blockchain.

Now, yes, the core developers of any blockchain have a lot of influence, it's inevitable, we can't avoid this type of power dynamic in this environment, and it is not so bad, it is not like Bitcoin core or the Ethereum Foundation are the federal reserve of their currency. These people are there to provide guidance, which is needed, and you can be sure that they want the price to go up too, so they are not going to go around encouraging forks every week. Every time a fork is even just proposed, by anyone with any kind of clout, the entire community will sniff out corruption like blood hounds, and if some is found, the fork will not go through, simple as that.

""Code is law"" is nothing more than a marketing slogan, it is not an important statement as far as I am concerned, all of these blockchains can edit themselves, it is just a bitch of a process.",2016-08-26 09:44:07
d6w9axg,mtrund,26,"Fuck you Mylan. 

I was without insurance for a short period of time during a divorce (I own a small business) and my insurance was covered through my  ex wife's place of employment to help save $ since it was fully covered through her work. I also did this so I could alleviate my cost of insurance to cover an employee. 

In this short time period of reviewing insurance plans and navigating healthcare.gov, I realized my EpiPen was expired and I needed one for a backpacking trip for my deadly bee allergy. Called my doc and he sent the script to the pharmacy. Total cost for a 2 pack of EpiPen's was just short of $500 which wasn't feasible at the time due to paying my divorce attorney, alimony and having to find a new place to live. 

Ended up purchasing them through a forum from some random guy off the internet for $150 with bitcoin. They were legitimate and all is well. 

The fact that I had to do that pisses me off, a life saving device costing that much is absolutely insane. Mylan's product hasn't change in any way, shape or form. I could certainly swallow $100-$150 without insurance but even then I feel that's too expensive. 

I later learned that I can purchase epinephrine in a 50mL vial for around $20 which could easily be pulled into an intramuscular syringe which is what I will be doing once my EpiPens expire...because fuck you Mylan. This bitch of a CEO makes around $19 million a year and claims to be ""frustrated""? As if she didn't have any say in the price gouging.

The chip takes 75% of the block reward, but it doesn't know what the current block height is (which determines the block reward). To get around this the chip takes a 4 byte integer denoting the current height and uses division to work out what the value of its output should be. Tell the chip it's currently the year 2222 when the reward is zero and it will take zero reward, leaving the rest to you. If they ever gave these out as intended (free or low cost, and they would get their money back) they wouldn't ever see a single dime of the payouts because everybody with half an ounce of sense would see this bug and exploit it.

A lot of people already run a node and a lot of people did for longer, than some core devs even know of Bitcoin.
A lot of people also stopped because they don't care for Bitcoin anymore, because they are tired by the miners talking and doing nothing.

Why should anybody run a node for a network that is supposed to be used by banks for settlements only? Did you ever think about that? Should I start a ""Swift node"" up tomorrow to support Deutsche Bank and it's friends? Just for fun?

Bitcoin could only feed upon it's network effect for so long. Investors and businesses look for alternatives to Bitcoin, the actual investing into Bitcoin is stagnating.

There are enough Altcoins out there and I don't know, what bullshit the core devs told you, but a lot of the altcoin devs are very competent and intelligent. And guess what: They don't use SHA256, your mining equipment will be worth shit, when Bitcoin goes down the drain.

Blocksize **was** a minor issue. A fucking **temporary** spam limit.

&gt; It has given too much opportunities for some people who are altcoin developers but also claiming to be Bitcoin reference client software developers.

Who do you mean? Peter Todd, Mark Friedenbach, btcdrak?

&gt; We have more challenge to solve, for the future of Bitcoin rather than a blocksize thing.

We could start with the easy things, like changing a ""1"" to a ""2"" for starters.

&gt; Bitcoin has a very long way to go to be a world reserve currency.

Good, that people choose to implement a highly complicated SegWit soft-fork with a lot of issues. That will make the way shorter.

SHA256-Bitcoin will never get close to be a world reserve currency. It will be eaten alive, because there are people out there, who are better than Greg Maxwell (who controls Bitcoin, face the facts) and they will make the better product. Longterm, the loser loses and the winner wins. 

I guess some people won't grasp the concept of money as a product anytime in their lifetime. There is no state anymore, that forces you to use Bitcoin. People can choose in a free market and long term, they will choose the better product, not the crippled product. 

Thank's for giving altcoins another push I guess. Maybe I will start to buy a coin different than Bitcoin the first time in my life.

Here is one guy who looks like he's pretty much the only person working on Bitcoin Classic at the moment with seemingly less Bitcoin experience than anyone on the Core team-- yet he's trying. I don't think anyone thinks this is serious competition at the moment. I know nothing of Zander nor the rest of his abilities and I don't mean these comments to be disparaging of him at all.

I'm put off by constant attacks against _any_ client (or developers thereof) that dares to attempt to openly compete with Bitcoin Core. This isn't the first incident and I have no idea who started it in this case (Zander v. Core) and I don't care-- it goes back at least months ago on the mailing list (perhaps further back) but it's not really relevant. Anyone who has ever had the audacity to even _try_ to compete with Core ends up being attacked personally and having their technical abilities called into question in very juvenile ways while being run off by the mob.

I really don't get it at all. If decentralization is such a coveted property of this system I would think alternate clients would not only be tolerated but highly encouraged. Sure, it's a distributed consensus system, but that doesn't mean it needs to operate as a monopoly. My perception of this system at the moment is that a very small subset of Bitcoin Core developers and a few miners in China have absolute control of the network and its consensus rules.

My favorite question for those people, ""Do you have blinds on your windows?"" ""Ya"" ""Why? If you're not doing anything wrong then you have nothing to hide right?""

Using a VPN, Tor, Bitcoin, etc provide the same kind of privacy as putting blinds on your living room window. Sure, they could be used to help conceal criminal activity, but so could blinds on your windows. The police don't kick down everyone's door that has blinds, so why would it be acceptable to hack everyone who wants internet privacy?

People want internet privacy for the same reason want blinds on their living room window -- they don't want creepy fuckers watching them do completely legal although perhaps slightly embarrassing things... walk around with their big gut hanging out, pick their nose, etc.

It's not that you want privacy to do illegal shit, it's that you want the peace and comfort of doing what you do without having to think about what other people are going to think about it. You can't ever relax if you can't let your guard down, and privacy lets us do that.

They did however manage to decentralize development though. Before we had only Bitcoin Core.

They actually showed that a contentious hard fork that leads to a spinoff getting created, does *not* cause any loss of value for anyone. They showed that if you had 1 ETH before the fork then the value of the 1 ETH + the value of the 1 ETC you also got automatically is pretty much the same. 

Before the ""dangerous"" fork you had 10-15 USD if you had 1 ETH. After the fork you got 1 ETH and 1 ETC and those together were also worth 10-15 USD. Thanks Blockstream, you just showed us that it's not dangerous for us to fork you. So we did just that - we forked you (/r/btcfork). We'll see you on the exchanges, small blockers.

d6zyik2,satoshis_sockpuppet,37,"At a certain point you have to admit, that the enemy won. 
And I think we've reached the point, Greg, Blockstream and Theymos have won. 
They have the control over a so-called ""decentralized system"".

""One CPU one vote"" degenerated to ""One farm - one vote"". And out of the miners, exactly 
one is left, that seems to care about Bitcoin, but is a coward. 
The rest consists of complete idiots whose only qualification is to connect  
heating units to to the power socket.
I've been very patient with the miners but they didn't even gave the slightest hint,
that they are going to change anything. And the few that voted on Slush showed me,
that even in the smaller mining department, there are more than enough idiots.

The miners seem to have looked at cores node count and thought that this showed support 
for core.
90% of these node operators just don't know better. We had and have enough nodes
to fork with 60% of the hashing power. The forked Bitcoin would have been worth more
than the crippled chain and node after node, the people would have left Core. But that
didn't happen. I see it everywhere, noobs get interested in Bitcoin, they read bitcoin.org
and /r/bitcoin and start a core node in good faith. This won't change.

It is sad, what happened to the original idea of (a) great mind(s).

It is disgusting, how shareholders have about no weight in this debate. I might be wrong,
but from all the people I know, the longtime holders, who got their coins, when Greg wasn't even
around, no one is supporting core. To me, it looks like a waiting game, when the first
real whales are going to sell and move to other things.

Bitcoins market share is going down and down and everybody, who supports core, is happy.
The atmosphere around core followers is ""creepy"". It's the scary bagholder attitude one could
observe so often, when companies went down the drain. You have to face it: People who still
support core, although they know of the alternatives, are just plain idiots.
Maybe I am to sensitive here, but generally I've had a pretty good gut instinct about such 
behavior in the past and I won't go down with these retards.

I've had some hope for a PoW fork, but the forking idea seems to have ended in ""generally
all forks are super"", instead of just doing one fork. And there aren't nearly enough 
developers to create a reasonable fork.

So I'll let my Unlimited node run for the ""foreseeable future"" and I'm keeping
my sentimentality coins, but I think I'll concentrate on competitors to Bitcoin. Maybe 
there is a good one out there, maybe not. I'll find out.

One thing I know for sure: With lunatics like Luke, pyschopaths like Greg (controlling 
about everybody else in this list), slimeballs like Adam, wannabe geniuses like Todd, 
limited code monkeys like Laan and politicians like Pieter controlling Bitcoin, it won't 
succeed in the future. And I think the mess, Bitcoins code is, isn't just by chance.
I find it very plausible, that they are trying to obfuscate it more and more, to control it.

Bitcoin is a product, these people didn't understand that, or pretend to don't understand
it. And a product will vanish if it's not needed.

A tip for core: Think of the core following idiots, who will want to see
their idol Greg decapitated when he fucked it up. I have no idea, how one person 
can be blind enough, to run a billion dollar economy into the ground and has no problem 
with being responsible for it. The same idiots following him blindly, will hate him with
the same enthusiasm, they love him with now.
I doubt, that they will think too much about that, but dissapointed cult members aren't
fun people. And you might be a bunch of fuckheads, but I sincerely hope, that nobody will 
get hurt physically in this shit show in the end.

Overall: Good job, Blockstream. Only 70e6 $ to fuck up Bitcoin completely, that's quite the success.
One thing I know for sure: I will never use any of your services (if you ever finish anything) and
I hope your name will be remembered for the disgusting piece of shit company it is. And good job 
Adam, for completely destroying your reputation in just a few months.

These ideas are not in conflict: think about the way that Vitalik still contributes to Bitcoin discussions from time to time. This is a highly experimental space, and it's a good thing to have lots of different experiments running at once.

Synereo has a really ambitious plan (for Synereo 2.0; the alpha release is much simpler). They're attempting to build a blockchain that is fundamentally based on the Rho Calculus (a [process calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus) invented by Greg Meredith). According to them, it'll be infinitely scalable by design, lend itself to easy formal verification, and in general be a way better programming environment than the EVM.

Personally, my money is still on Ethereum. I think Synereo is _too_ ambitious, and not likely to reach their goals any time soon. But I'm glad they're trying it, and that they're also contributing to Ethereum in the process. The most likely outcome is that we steal a couple good ideas from them, making Ethereum even stronger.

d6yxohz,ferretinjapan,23,"I only mention XMR in the context of Bitcoin, as I personally find cheerleading distasteful, but if it fits the context of the discussion where something about Bitcoin relates to Monero, then it should hardly be off limits.

If you have questions about Monero you really should make the thread in /r/monero, or even the new stack exchange for Monero.

&gt;I've heard that its added complexity leads to poorer scaling (compared to Bitcoin without the 1 MB block size limit, of course), and significantly higher computational demands for transaction/block validation.

Transactions are larger than bitcoin transactions (on-chain privacy costs more, and there is no free lunch unfortunately). The poorer scaling arguments is purely subjective IMO, for one, Bitcoin is crippled at 3tps, and even with highly centralised miners scaling on-chain will probably never scale to visa competitive levels, or even paypal levels. Monero's flex cap makes that problem disappear, as well as the fee market, and tragedy of the commons arguments, that claim it will result in bloaty, or infinite blocks. Verification does take longer, but this POW also makes it far harder for miners to centralise due to it's high memory requirements, coupled with the fact that another POW (Cuckoo cycle POW) which is even more ASIC resistant can replace it as it is much faster at verifying transactions. There is some considering using this in later forks (which Monero does every 6 months).

Ed: Also consider that Monero devs are actively making Monero scaleable each time they hard fork. Last fork the blocktime was changed to reduce header bloat, in a future Fork, RingCT will make high privacy transaction sizes less bloat prone. Monero, unlike Bitcoin actively works on improving scalability with tangible results.

&gt; I've also heard that light or SPV clients don't currently exist and that achieving them for Monero may be difficult or impossible

They don't exist yet, but from what I'm told, [not impossible](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/228/will-monero-have-wallet-clients-similar-to-spv-so-that-a-fully-validated-node-is)

&gt;There even was a short-lived thread on that other Bitcoin sub about how these issues would quickly become real-world limitations should Monero experience significant transaction growth

[That was by Rudd-X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/4zgqas/i_thought_we_could_theoretically_scale_to/) who fabricated/extrapolated some numbers, then paraded it around as fact. He had a heap of inconsistencies with realworld limitations and practices, and his highly conservative guesses.

Yes, it will be once multisig is rolled out.

d6yxwgc,Digital-Tokyo,21,"**Bitcoin will hit mainstream when people don't know they are using bitcoin.**  
  
Regular people don't care about terms like ""crypto"", ""fiat"", ""decentralized"" or even consider what money really is. They care about ease of use, speed and above all fees. It will come in the form of a streamlined app, or streamlined bitcoin integration into something that already has a ton of users. The amounts on a payment app will show your balance in USD or your native currency. On a sidechain it will run, maybe settle its accounts to the main chain every 6 hours or something like that (many of ways to do it). The fees being lower then paypal, western union, moneygram, bank transfer... is the #1 selling point to getting people into it. Getting bitcoin slicked down in an easy to use Venmo-like app is the key, not the standard libertarian stuff people try to use to get people into it. Make your account linkable to a card so you can use it on basically any Point of Sale device (aka cash register/credit card scanner).
  
**Bitcoin will become like email, you can run your own server and get down to the low level stuff and do everything yourself, or like most people... you will use a service that makes it easier.** With bitcoin it could be similar... I can use a service day to day for ease of use but I can also withdraw some bitcoin to my own personal (and more complicated) wallet if I want for more in depth use.  
  
People started using email over mail as it was faster and cheaper... not because of some tirade against government. (Sidenote: I understand someone with similar beliefs may have helped email grow... it is not the kind of person who made it mainstream) And while that is not the most perfect analogy... I am just saying you are gonna win over people more by a simple ""it's cheaper then paypal, faster then a bank"" then a ""Inflation is theft... use of force... thrown in a cage... slavery..."" stuff I thankfully see a lot less of now then I used to.  
  
None of that is to say some of those libertarian points are not valid... People just don't want to hear it. They are skeptical of Bitcoin enough (as it is a new concept in money) that when someone presents them with these worldview shattering libertarian lines on top of that... it freaks them out, they think you are crazy, and they shut down. **Bitcoin is hard enough to swallow for the average person...** instead of throwing both a new currency and these new concepts at them at the same time why not just talk about low fees and speed. And if there is an app making all this streamlined... they can jump right into it without staring at long address, QR codes and terms like multisig. Then somewhere down the line talk about the libertarian stuff.

TL/DR
Integrate bitcoin into an app that shows a person's native currency. Settle BTC in background or in sidechain. Send money like paypal. Still be able to withdraw in BTC address if you so wish to manage your own funds. Push low fees and speed.

d718mef,bullbearanalytics,20,"Bitcoin Price Update for August 29, 2016  

Market Commentary (BTC):  

Once again no surprises over the weekend as price remains locked in a tight consolidation, although we did get a small break from the 570 - 580 $ range when price dipped into the mid-560's over the weekend.  With a new range in effect from 565 - 585 $ and considering we are going into a long holiday weekend, we think the price action will remain subdued over the course of this week.  Having said that, there are some early technical indications emerging on the shorter term charts that are signaling a potential move to the upside to test resistance at the top of the range.

With that in mind, lets move to the 6-hour chart below for a look at the short to medium term outlook. First of all, notice that price is still within the symmetrical triangle, as well as the pivot area, as it has been for some time, and it now appears to be trapped between volume profile PoC and the near term EMA's.  Speaking of volume profile, it continues to look relatively healthy compared to the longer term charts so perhaps a move up into OTE is not out of the question over the next few weeks, but for now this looks unlikely over the very short term.  

Moving on, we can see that SCMR is painting neutral candles following a ""confirmed reversal up"" candle late in the weekend which has not yet been voided despite little progress to the upside.  Additionally, Willy has reversed back to the upside, RSI is back in neutral territory following a bullish divergence, and MACD and PPO are both showing signs of at least a local bottom around 565 $.  These are encouraging signs that could indicate a small upside bias this week, although we are still not buyers of coins at these levels.

Conversely, we have minor dynamic support sitting at the 554 $ low and resistance around 585 $, however major support is nowhere to be found while major resistance still hangs overhead at 600 $ and 630 $.  Also note that the 200-period SMA remains in a downtrend signaling the short term correction is still not over, while the EMA's flatline around current prices telling us there remains indecision in this market.  

While we are not expecting a significant move beyond the 565 - 585 $ range in either direction over the course of this week, we do think a move up to test that 580 - 585 $ area is a distinct possibility.  Perhaps when we get back to business next Tuesday following the Labor Day holiday in the US we can breakout of this range to test our 545 - 555 $ buy zone or the 600 - 630 $ resistance area.  Until then, we remains patient and neutral.

Remember, in a trendless and contracting market, which we are currently in, buying the dips and selling the rips remains the most relevant strategy for short term and more risk-seeking players.  That said, we remain on the sidelines at current levels considering we want to add to long positions at more favorable risk/reward levels.

GLGT!

d70pznk,riptaway,13,"Before I say what I'm gonna say, I want you to know it's not being said in anger or condescension. I'm not trying to insult you. And it's directed at everyone who asks these sort of questions. You're just convenient. Sorry, buddy :) I don't really hate you. But I'm curious as to why you choose to remain computer illiterate to the point where you aren't googling simple questions. Like, I'm genuinely curious, not being an ass. 

But you really should try and figure stuff out before just asking the nearest person. The reason so many people have trouble with even the most basic of computer operation is because they never stop asking the nearest person. Seriously, next time you find yourself about to ask reddit or whatever how to do something, google it. If you don't understand a step, google that. Keep googling and messing around until you get it. If it's legit complicated or takes longer than 30 minutes, okay, get some help. But ""Hey, man, how..."" shouldn't be your go to for learning about how to use your computer. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life asking some random person how to do simple stuff? Kinda embarrassing, in my opinion.

""Where do I find torrents?""

""How do I change the password on my router?""

Etc. Reasonable questions. But questions that you should be asking google. Not because it's faster. It's probably faster and easier to ask someone. I'm sure it is, as long as they know what they're doing. But in googling for yourself, you learn much more than your original question. You run into issues, have to perform secondary tasks, do things with your computer you've never done, etc. You *learn*. When you ask someone ""how do I send btc to a secondary wallet"", not only are you wasting a wonderful opportunity to learn about computers in general and bitcoin in general, you keep yourself one of the people who asks people ""how do i do that"".

Again, I'm not trying to be mean. But all you had to do was google ""How do I get a secondary bitcoin wallet"" and ""Why do I need a secondary bitcoin wallet"". Would have taken 5-30 minutes(depending on ability, focus, etc) to figure it out, and you would have learned a whole lot about something very important. Even better, you would have become that much more independent as a computer user.

Please stop being lazy. Please figure these things out on your own. I promise if you can spell and have an internet connection, you can learn almost anything. Not only is it lazy, it's also kind of disrespectful. Fixing people's computer's is a job. You wouldn't ask your neighbor to air up your tires, or a guy on the street to fix a button, would you? I get that there are differences, and I'm all about discussion, but the eternally lazy ""how i do that"" just repels me. Because you're too lazy for a 5 second google search and so willing to impose on others you don't even know.

Come on, man. You've created this room in your mind. It's called ""Computer Room"". You have a key but never enter. You just let people in, let them do what they gotta do, then close it again. It's called willful ignorance. You can learn, you just choose not to. And it's a shame. Because aside from the obvious benefits and the fact that you're not a lazy leech when you learn stuff on your own, learning about computers isn't linear. The more you know, the easier it is to learn. 

I understand when my 74 year old grandmother asks me to fix the aspect ratio on her TV. She's never going to learn any more about electronics. I'm sure she'd love to be able to do all the stuff she wants without my help, but she can't, and she never will. But I don't understand why younger people won't at least try to figure something out before they throw their hands up and yell for an adult. I'm not asking you to learn to code, but you can't spend 30 minutes reading about bitcoin and giving it an honest effort? Surely you use computers enough that it makes sense to know how to use google to find out the things you want to know?

As for why you should do all this, learn to google properly, get your hands dirty, figure things out on your own, experiment, get comfortable not knowing how to do something but trying anyway...I dunno. There are several answers. To me, it's...well one, if you know what you're doing, you don't have to count on a stranger. I mean, that's pretty obvious, and a pretty good reason on its own. There isn't always someone who knows how to do what you want to do. Also, you're not wasting some poor guy's time with questions that his 2nd grade kid knows the answers to. I mean, it's cool, I don't mind helping, but it's like...I don't want to walk up to a guy with a flat tire and have him ask me to read the manual and tell him what to do. 

But really, I think you should stop asking people and start asking google because otherwise you're always going to look at a computer as quasi magic. It's kind of an all or nothing thing. You either start fucking around and making shit happen or you just keep relying on other people. And computers are such a huge, integral part of your life that voluntarily maintaining your ignorance about their use...I dunno man. It's hard to put into words. All that power, information, and ability...It's like some guy discovered fire and instead of learning to make your own you just keep going back to his and getting a torch to carry around until it burns out. Except that the torch is a computer and can do amazing, wonderful, awe inspiring things, including drastically changing our society.

Come on, man. You really asked ""how do i do that"" when he *literally spelled out what to do; you could have copy pasted it into google...LITERALLY!* You're so deep into willful ignorance that you don't even try and figure out what he's saying.",2016-08-29 11:25:15

There is no incentive for bank A to use the coin of bank B, or vice versa.  Each bank will want the others to use the coin that they control.  This will lead to many incompatible walled gardens.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin can be used by any person or bank in any country, and works equally well for every person or bank on the network without giving any unfair advantage to any of them.

d71akfg,fury420,52,"A few years back a group of Bitcoin's developers (including like 5 Core devs) got together with some tech, business and VC people and founded a company, then solicited outside investment and received 21M in a public funding round, and then another 55M in a second public funding round in Feb 2016.

&gt;Has a for-profit company hired some of the most influential Bitcoin developers and put them on payroll?
Is that company being allowed to influence Bitcoin protocol development in any way, shape or form as part of having hired core developers?

The issue with answering this is that the most influential Core devs at the company are also the company's Founders, it's not like this is some outside entity just hiring up all the developers for their own nefarious purposes. 

Nobody's yet to provide any actual evidence that Blockstream *as an entity* is influencing Bitcoin protocol development, as the Core Devs that work for Blockstream all already had influence before. 

AFAIK none of the new, non-Core employees are directly working on Core, and Bitcoin Core's head maintainer (Wladimir) does not work for Blockstream at all. 

Edit: 

How does one separate &amp; differentiate between the influence individual Core Devs already had pre-Blockstream, and the influence they continue to have now?

If anything, the ""failure"" of the HK agreement goes to show the lack of centralized control at Blockstream. 

Somehow even the President has little influence, and the Core devs that work at Blockstream are free to hold other opinions and advocate them as part of the decentralized Core.

To work in bitcoin, I only considered one employer: Blockstream.  They were the only ones doing development as their core business (rather than using bitcoin to run an exchange, etc).

In the early Linux world we had a very similar effect: RedHat started up producing a Linux distribution and attracted the highest concentration of kernel developers.  In particular, they had a very strong stance on Open Source for everything: this is one reason why they were so attractive to work for!  But they spent *years* fighting conspiracy theories from people sure that there was an ulterior plan (""The Microsoft of Linux"" was my favorite!).

d71hept,jratcliff63367,33,"Roger posted this on Facebook where we had the following exchange.

My initial response to Roger: ""Bitcoin's best use case is as a global store of value, a Gold 2.0 if you will, with payment transactions happening on other layers which derive their value from the main blockchain. 

A combination of networked payment channels and two-way pegged sidechains can solve all of the needs of the global community, including massive growth and trillions of microtransactions. 

Why this impatience?  It's like we were all given a goose that lays golden eggs and people want to butcher it now because they want a drumstick.""


To which he flippantly replied: ""And flying cars would cure all the traffic jams today too. Too bad none of the things you mentioned exist yet either.""

My follow-up: ""Well, first of all, sidechains and networked bidirectional payment channels do exist, just not yet fully deployed into the ecosystem. 

Software engineering takes time, especially software which handles value transfer in an adversarial environment. We cannot scale the bitcoin blocksize to any major degree without introducing massive risk. 

The bitcoin network should be extremely robust and risk averse. It is not the platform to do risky experiments on. That is what alt-coins and sidechains are for. 

Bitcoin's most important property is not as a payment network but as a way to store and transfer wealth without risk of confiscation by the state. The current core plan is the safest approach. Anyone can spin up an alt-coin with higher transaction capacity, and many already exist. None scale to global transaction levels though. I just think we should be much more conservative. It is more important to me that bitcoin can safely protect and store value than being able to perform low cost  microtransactions.""

Another Facebook user said: ""If that really is bitcoin's best use case, then Satoshi, and Bitcoin, have failed in their purpose.
And both those things you mentioned still require bigger blocks.""

And my final reply:  ""I disagree. Being able to hold and transfer value unmolested by the state is definitely the single most important property of bitcoin. 

No one is intentionally trying to ""cripple"" bitcoin, they are trying to protect it. It's a shame how few people understand how robust networks are built.  You don't keep piling more and more complexity into a single layer. 

Robust networks are built in layers with each layer being well defined and simple as possible. Each layer targeting a specific problem set. Bitcoin will never scale on-chain to global transaction capacity and it will never handle the true microtransaction use case which implies trillions of transactions of miniscule amounts of value. 

All of these things should happen in additional network layers. 

As a software engineer who has written network stacks, this just seems completely obvious to me. I get that non-technical people, maybe they don't understand this, but it is true. A one size fits all monolithic network protocol is destined for failure.""

2) Is this a conflict of interest?  No.  For it to be a conflict one would have to show that what they are doing in dev is counter to what is right for Bitcoin so that it benefits Blockstream.

3) Can the devs paid by Blockstream push something through that the miners and users and rest of the devs disagree with?  No.

4) Is there evidence they are acting in a bad way against Bitcoin?  No.

5) Do they have a long record of respecting privacy, the independence of the protocol and its fundamental principles?  Yes.  
Read the posts by Adam Back, Greg Maxwell &amp; others going back years before Bitcoin even existed. These are the kinds of voices we need more of.  Take a look at how Blockstream has dealt with rhe pro-regulation industry movements and how, while many were fawning over CA AB1326, they were writing to condemn it. 

What particular code / protocol development do you take issue with?

What would make someone assume that because someone is paid by a for profit corporation that they are doing something negative to the code?  

Is this true any more than if they were independent, working for their own company or funded by a non profit or donations?

When Bitcoin Foundation funded dev, people thought this was too centralized.  This was a non profit.  Today MIT also funds development, this is a non profit.  Neither are inherently better or worse because of being non profit.

It's a very good idea to carefully look at what devs and other influencers are doing, who they are and their motivations.

But it's much more important to look at what they do, what they support and their own words, actions and philosophy.

There is nothing at all either bad OR good about a dev being funded by a ""for profit"" or ""non profit"" whether VC backed or sponsored or otherwise.  Judge on what they do.

It's great that Blockstream makes development a priority and really surprising that more companies don't do the same.

d72fg0i,berkes,18,"&gt; All of these efficiencies in working together as a society and all the inventions and innovations of our ancestors are not being directed towards humanity.

I suggest you read [Susan Blackmore's the Meme machine](http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Books/Meme%20Machine/MM.htm). Because it adds another dimension to what you say.

We're only just in the process of replacing one set of memes (religion) for another (capitalism, personal freedom etc). Which is a good thing, if you ask me.

However, seen from memes and gene's point of view, there is no such thing as ""free time"", it will be occupied in no time by yet another set of memes.

More practically put: You and 5 others barter amongst eachother, leaving you 4 hours of free time a day,: free time. Now, a sixth person who, instead of lying under a palm tree, invests that free time in whatever will benefit him, will have a large advantage over you. Up to the point, that you will either be ""forced"" to follow, are subjected under that other person, or simply pressed into irrelevance.

This is a well documented and often studied principle: it is the basis of many cultures being annihilated, conquered and enslaved. Those with a more efficient use of their energy will have a benefit over those who do not. Sleeping under a palmtree, is not an efficient use of energy. Obviously, this applies more to entire cultures than to a simgle person living in a jungle, but the principle is clear.

If you see how genes and memes drive our behaviour, form our culture and shape our society, you could turn that around: a person lying under a palmtree is not as efficient in spreading the memes (culture of lying under palmtrees) as someone who, say, spends that time cutting down palmtrees and making ships from that to build a vast trading empire. So, applying basic market-principles (or gene and meme principles) it would not be a surprise to see the ""trading empire culture"" spread at the cost of the ""sleeping under a palmtree culture"". 

Edit: I forgot the most important part: Applying that to bitcoin. So what could happen is that either P2P exchage proves more efficient than exchanges through centralized systems. It may be; and if so, certainly something like Bitcoin will spread at the cost of that centralized culture. I have strong hopes that is the case, though it will not be soon. And certainly not lead to more time under a palmtree for everyone. It will, simply put, free some energy to be put into other things. In practice, our society would spend less resources on a central banking system and more on other things.

So, while I really envy you, having a such a wonderful time and great eye-opening experience, I don't see us moving there anywhere soon. And even if we did, it would take one culture of hard working factory-""slaves"" to overrule that culture without much effort.

All I know is that SegWit allows for further scaling while also enabling LN by solving transaction malleability. And payment channels are inevitable if Bitcoin ever wants to reach the often cited Visa levels of adoption. So yes, SegWit is a legitimate option. It comes with certain tradeoffs, but so do all scaling approaches. And in the end, none of this means that a block size hardfork can't be done in the future.

d72wm2z,Capt_Roger_Murdock,16,"&gt; hardforking -- something that is very dangerous

Hardforks aren't ""very dangerous.""  They're a more transparent and (in many cases) far simpler (and thus, far *safer*) way to go about updating the protocol.  As I pointed out in the linked comment:

&gt; It's *soft forks* that don't give ordinary users an easy way to effectively not consent to a change imposed by miners. If you don't consent to a hard fork, you can simply not do anything, which means that there's no coordination problem for a disgruntled minority to overcome. On the other hand, if there's a minority group that's strongly opposed to a soft fork, they're now faced with the difficult task of coordinating their own hard fork if they don't want to be swept along.

EDIT: Just want to add that the ""disgruntled minority"" (of hashpower) I'm referring to there might represent the *economic* majority.

Now it's true that soft forks, by their nature, make persistent (or semi-persistent) chain splits less likely -- again, because they make it harder for people who don't want to consent to them to coordinate their opposition.  But that's not a good thing.  There are incredibly strong *natural* incentives that will tend to drive convergence on a single chain (which explains why Bitcoin hasn't split yet despite the existence of this hugely-contentious debate). And so if a persistent split does occur despite these built-in incentives to stick together, that's a pretty good indicator that the benefits of splitting outweigh the costs. If people feel so strongly about ""going their own way"" that they're willing to suffer the accompanying loss of network effect, then that's probably the right result. *Long-term*, I think one chain will likely dominate over the other, but a split seems like a pretty healthy mechanism for the market to express itself and experiment with different directions to determine the best one. 

Using a soft fork as a way to prevent organized resistance to a protocol change is a really bad idea.  It suggests a lack of confidence in your protocol change.  I mean, if your change truly represents an improvement *and* you're able to get a majority of the hash power on board (a very strong Schelling point for the market to converge on), then you shouldn't fear the market not going along with you.  In fact, you should *welcome* people who want to stay on the old (and in your view, soon to be worthless) chain because it gives you the opportunity to sell them the coins you'll automatically receive on that chain to buy more coins on the majority (and in your view, ""real"") chain.

Just remember who's going to have your back next time Ethereum needs emergency help). Only glitch as documented in this thread is that your signing/donation website requires hex addresses all in lower case - no biggie.

* The steps provided are not for noobs and this sub only been up for ~6 hours, so it may take some people 2+ days to notice this happened and get all this working.

* I expect of the 4.172 Million ETC that at least 20% will get dumped in next 2 days.

* That's 800,000 ETC!! The total Poloniex ETC buy Orderbook right now is only 283,500 ETC... so guess what the price of ETC will do when 800,000 ETC gets dumped against 283,500 in next 2 days?

* Guess what the price of ETH will do?

* ETH right now = 0.01955 BTC on Polo. The major resistance level is 0.0228 BTC dating back to  July 22. If it breaks that we have a shot at 0.027, and I bet some of the walls in the way are fake, so probably less than shown is actually required.

&gt;In the current landscape of CS:GO this just isn't possible as there are so many qualifiers, LANs and other online tournaments. For example Gambit opted to play last season's Open division but dropped out half way through as they are not going to prioritise a $3000 League over other bigger events. Smaller teams in the lower division are also happy to exploit the situation by taking free wins rather than work to reschedule with a higher tier team that is involved in multiple leagues at any one time.

Yeah, but not for TSM and fucking Denial. Do you even know how few tournaments these two teams participate in? Let's see what's coming up in 2016 for these two teams.

TSM:

- Northern Arena (finishes before ESEA S 23)

- ELeague qualifiers (3 open qualifiers, each on one of 3 days followed by a 2 day closed qualifier)

- ELeague (assuming they qualify)

- ESWC 2016

- CEVO (dont know when that is, i expect it overlaps with esea)

- Northern Arena Grand Final (if they make it to that)

Denial:

- ELeague qualifiers

- ELeague (if they qualify)

- CEVO

- ESWC (if they quality)

The reality is, these teams don't have much going on. I don't know what shit you are pulling out of your ass, but their schedules aren't packed like top teams' schedules are. If you have something different, let me know, k?

And you barely address any of the other issues. A team winning OPEN going straight to PREMIER? Who's fucking brilliant idea was that? If anything, that's gonna make your league look super unprofessional. There's going to be at least 3 16-0s, I guarantee it. And I have no idea why the IM -&gt; premier change still exists. I don't know if you guys look at the results of your leagues once they finish, but (spoiler!) the IM teams blow. Honestly, I would love to see the thought process behind this whole fuck up. I mean, we all know the real reason you put TSM and Denial in premier. Let's set the stage. You've got this flashy new mountain dew league, aiming to be a launch pad of sorts for new teams to make it into the big leagues, right? Well, who the fuck wants to watch that? New teams? IDGAF! Oh wait, TSM and Denial? I know those names! Maybe I'll watch... Because you sure as hell aren't putting those teams in because their schedules are full! I know Kory works out a lot, but god damn. And why would schedules being full matter? Hundreds of people play ESEA while going to work, school, etc., but as soon as a team has a lot of events WOOOAH we gotta give em a break! Especially since they are laboring all the time at...playing counter strike, the thing they are in your league for.

This just reeks of new age ESEA. The first coming I saw of new age ESEA was clipping old Denial out in favor of Renegades, a move clearly made because Renegades playing would bring more viewers than Denial. Then Virtus Pro being saved from degradation to the premier when you hold a VOTE to see who goes through. Virtus pro. In a vote. It doesn't matter what the poll is for, if Virtus Pro is an option, literally the entirety of Poland will vote VP.

And then you give the standard closing ""Blah blah well work to improve transparency bs"", I thought you were going to start that after the bitcoin scandal? No, maybe it was after Denial was moved down. Oh, no, of course, it was after VP was saved. Haha, that's right.",2016-08-31 15:07:24

**June 2016** we posted [a preliminary version of TumbleBit on eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/versions.pl?entry=2016/575) which did not support payment channels (although Blindly Signed Contracts did).

**Aug 2016** we posted [the full version of TumbleBit on eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575) with payment channels support and a proof-of-concept implementation.

We've been continually working on this project for over a year but it is only recently with the full-version of the paper being released with source code that it has received attention. ",2016-08-31 00:38:08
d72u21e,Capt_Roger_Murdock,9,"&gt; First, this ""Orwellian bullshit"" reaction was not to Pieter's explanation's but to Voskuil's as far as I can see:

Correct.  My reaction to Pieter's statement was that he was ""conflating the ability to spend pre-fork outputs on two chains with a double spend."" Certainly bullshit. But maybe not quite ""Orwellian."" 

&gt;Second, that's not Orwellian bullshit - that's basically how Bitcoin works. If you continue to run your old Bitcoin client version after a softfork, it is not rejecting the new types of transactions (because those - it being a SF - are correct in old rules (despite their new semantics for new versions of clients)). So, by running the same client all the time, you accept the soft forks ""inherently"". Your client might not understand the new semantics, but as far as it is concerned, transactions are valid in its eyes, according to its rules, all the things that that client understands went through correctly.

No, it's pretty clear that the article is not just saying that users will automatically (and sometimes unknowingly) ""accept"" a softfork if they don't take affirmative steps to fork away from it.  That's true, and again is precisely why soft forks are more insidious -- they don't give 
 ordinary users an easy way to effectively not consent to a change imposed by miners.  But that's exactly why the article gets things completely backwards.

I think you have to look at the full context of the article which claims that ""hard forks violate the basic philosophical principles underlying distributed consensus networks and are thus an existential threat to the integrity of their blockchains.""  But soft-forks are totally groovy.  Again, here's the context of how the article is using that Voskuil quote:

&gt;Secondly, a hard fork is a clear attack on the basic security premises and underlying philosophy of Bitcoin. There is no software mechanism to measure user consent to remove consensus rules. There is a widespread misunderstanding in the Bitcoin community which states that hard forks can be enforced as a matter of hash power. This wrongly conflates the nature of hard forks with that of soft forks. Eric Voskuil explains:

&gt;“In the case of a hard fork, a new transaction may be valid despite not conforming to the original rules. In the case of a soft fork, new transactions are valid under the original rules. In other words, holders of a money have not agreed to a hard fork but inherently accept a soft fork… A soft fork can be enforced by simple majority of processing power. In other words a soft fork isn’t actually a change in consensus among people, it’s a change that flows from the people controlling a majority of processing power… The original paper does not articulate a distinction between these rules, loosely referring to both scenarios as consensus. However it is an error to refer to soft fork rules as ‘consensus rules’.”

&gt;So, it is very true that a majority of hash power can enforce *new rules* with a *soft fork*. However, it is clearly inaccurate to say that hash power has any relationship to the software’s *consensus rules.* Miners have absolutely no say over user consent (i.e. consensus rules) – except to the extent that they operate their own nodes.

And again, that's Orwellian bullshit.",2016-08-31 02:23:04

d73zw4r,danknationyte,9,"If DNM's are an underground culture than ""underground"" must not mean what I think it means.

This sub has nearly 110,000 subscribers on a clearnet site. Ross/SR was busted years ago. There are movies about people trafficking shit on the DNM's as a plot point (DOPE). DNM's are mentioned in television shows like Mr. Robot and Bitcoin is becoming a household name.

The markets have not been underground for years now. They are apart of the public consciousness and you would have to be actively ignorant about the drug scene to not be aware of them at this point. ",2016-08-31 23:15:22
