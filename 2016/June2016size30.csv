d3qj85q,tropser,29,"""Although Gavin Andresen pointed to Ethereum’s recent rise in popularity as a warning sign for Bitcoin, that does not mean he is bullish on the smart contract-focused blockchain. When asked for his thoughts on Ethereum, Andresen stated, “I think most of the interesting things you can do with Ethereum you can also do with multi-signature Bitcoin transactions.”

A common viewpoint from Ethereum critics is that, although there are currently more than 200 Ethereum-based decentralized applications in development, there aren’t any use cases that make any sort of practical sense in the real world. Andresen appeared to show sympathy with this view, as he noted, “I haven’t seen a really great use of Ethereum yet.”

Andresen also noted a potential security risk involved with complex smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

“I think there will be a big problem with Ethereum smart contracts that are designed to steal people’s money, because very few people will have the skill necessary to tell if a complicated smart contract is correct.”""

""Andresen Prefers Sidechains Over Altcoins

Andresen also noted that he would even like Dogecoin more if it were a Bitcoin sidechain. He referred to these sorts of altcoins as a “sneaky way” to increase Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit.

In terms of Ethereum specifically, Andresen noted, “I’m watching the rootstock.io project, which brings Ethereum contracts to Bitcoin.”""",2016-06-01 01:20:48

d3rm8xr,oakpacific,25,"Some technical and historical perspective: it's well known in the cypherpunk circle or anyone working in related fields that the first cryptographic electronic money was ecash(also known as Chaumian Cash) invented by David Chaum, and later years of work improving on ecash produced many of Bitcoin's predecessors and finally led to Bitcoin. Part of Satoshi's motives in choosing such a title may have to do with claiming such a lineage, as academic writings often do.

Within the scope of such works, a coin is defined as, according to Satoshi ""a chain of digital signatures"", which you can trace back to the mint(like cash but not entirely identical) and thus unique, in sharp contrast to the credit system used in most of the payment and banking systems around the world, which uses an account and balance system. Funds within the same account become completely indistinguishable, and any transaction sent from an account will have to include a counter  value to uniquely identify this transaction, or it could be stored and resent again to remove funds from this account again and again until it's empty.(The need for a counter value to be associated with an account is part of the reason why pruning is so hard for Ethereum)

Otoh, Satoshi indeed emphasize in the abstract of the whitepaper that his cash allows payment to be sent from one party to another without a third party, so it's no doubt enabling P2P payment is part of his motives as well.",2016-06-01 21:12:28

d3rkc1i,belcher_,19,"Good blog post but

&gt; Once it reaches -3%, you may quite rightly feel that your wealth would be better served in digital assets such as Bitcoin and **Ethereum** that are decoupled from the traditional financial system.

Ethereum is significantly premined, it's permanently-inflationary and has a central dictator. Ethereum's creators receive quite a substantial chunk of newly-mined coins every year, no matter what.

Choosing to hold Ethereum is just swapping one centralized form of money with another.

edit: ethereum currently is also far less liquid and fungiable, as the shapeshift hacker found out

&gt; Yes, it appears the hacker has gotten annoyed that his Ethereum kept getting frozen at exchanges. So he comes back to the store he robbed from, and asks us if we’ll trade for a more liquid asset. We’d be essentially buying back our own Ethereum, and paying him Bitcoin.

People want Bitcoin to remain a viable payment system because a 1Mb limit is completely arbitrary and because proper off-chain solutions do not yet exist. 

Just tell me which sounds better:

1. Prevent an increase for as long as possible
1. Increased and more erratic fees 
1. Decrease quality of service (higher confirmation times during backlog)
1. Split community
1. Destroyed usecases (for increasingly higher valued transactions)
1. Prevent people investing into Bitcoin
1. Make people move to alt-coins
1. Try to transition these killed-off use-cases to Lightning 

Or: 

1. Increase limit
1. Deploy Lightning network
1. Seamlessly transition existing payment solutions to Lightning
1. Profit

d3qphzj,ferretinjapan,17,"Ethereum will never be anonymous enough to avoid what happened to SR as it can't and Vitalik has explicity stated it won't implement anonymity at the protocol level. If you want smart contracts and anonymity, then the horse you should be betting on is Monero, it already has anonymity, even stronger anonymity soon, smart contracts are already being worked on and will be rolled out after, and then transacting via i2p etc. Bitcoin *might* get slightly more opaque transacting via sidechains but don't hold your breath, as long as its cut off at the knees it is crippled and Ethereum is in no way going to be able to fill in the gaps Bitcoin has. Bitcoin and Ethereum are not going to ever be ironcald anonymous in a way that will enable SR traffic, you will literally need a whole new unfettered blockchain to make that happen.

Edit: I see everyone has strong opinions about what they consider to be ""better"" :). Rather than get into protracted arguments about it, I'll just say that I still believe Monero is superior to the many alternatives as it is built on long proven principles in cryptography rather than fancy whizzbang and yet to be proven principles like snarks, elaborate contracts and brand new crypto like zerocoin. And contrary to what others think, if the underlying protocol is not anonymous by default, it will always remain somewhat traceable, Bitcoin and Ethereum will always be at a disadvantage in that respect regardless of how many layers, spaghetti contracts etc you wrap around or embed it with.",2016-06-01 03:40:51

Bitcoin allows a subset of small programs--for example, one that only allows coins to be spent after an agreement by two out of three people. However, the scripting language for this is deliberately limited. 

Ethereum allows scripts of arbitrary complexity, as long as the user can pay for their execution. A smart contract can be a normal multisig as in Bitcoin. It but can also be a more complicated multisig. For example, one where two keys have to agree, but one master one is always required, except that 5 ETH can be withdrawn in a given day without other keys.

d3sfzk9,jratcliff63367,14,"&gt; Honest question: Won't the LN and blocksize increase remove these restrictions?

Here's the honest answer.

Today about 37% of all bitcoin transactions are for less than $5.

About 12% of all transactions on the network are for less than 50 cents.

And, surprisingly, between 1-3% daily are for less than 4 cents worth of value!

Here is a graph which shows the daily breakdown of the value of transactions by percentage over the entire lifetime of the bitcoin network.

http://i.imgur.com/3KjmTiz.png

What this tells us, is that things like the LN are capable of offloading approximately 40% of all transactions from the bitcoin network once it is fully adopted.

This is great, simply fantastic, but it's no single solution.

What makes matters more complicated, is that we are talking about how many **people** can use the bitcoin network.  Even users of the LN must perform on-chain transactions, in a timely manner, to be able to open and close channels.  This creates new on-chain pressure if we want to onramp more users; even if all of their low-value payment transactions happen off-chain.

Increasing the blocksize, whether it is by the adoption of SegWit or just bumping the blocksize outright, doesn't help all that much.

The problem at hand, is how few people actually actively use the bitcoin network today, versus the number of people on the planet earth.

Obviously, this commercial is targeting the general unbanked population of the world, measured in **billions** of people.

The bitcoin network, in it's entire lifetime since day one, has only processed a few hundred million transactions since 2009.

To support more than a few million active users, even if all low value payment transactions are moved off-chain, would require a massive blocksize increase.  If we wanted to support a hundred million people, or a billion people, the increase in blocksize would be astronomical.

The good news, none of this is really a problem today.  We don't have a billion, a hundred million, or even **one million** people trying to regularly perform on-chain transactions today.

The point is, if bitcoin is to grow to support more people, **many** more people, then neither the LN nor a modest increase in the blocksize limit accomplishes that goal.

I am still of the opinion that if two-way pegged sidechains ever became a real 'thing', then it might be one avenue to onramp more users without putting on-chain transaction pressure.

Good morning,

The price made a decent move last night.  

On the dollar based, exchange weighted chart this morning we reversed to a column of Xs.  The price needs to exceed $560 in order to break out.  This change will not become official until tomorrow.  That is the reason it is shaded on the chart.

On my Coinbase chart we broke out after reversing yesterday,  This morning we hit a high and moved beyond the break out point.  The formation is the famous “Bullish Catapult.”  This formation is made when you have a triple top followed, in order, by a double top.  It is the most bullish formation in PnF charting because it indicates a period of consolidation and a break out.  It creates a firm base and then reaches high.

On the Coinbase chart the formation is three columns wide, which is not much.  However, the power of the last breakout—means it could go much higher.  This is reminiscent of moves from 2013.  

I am not predicting a new All Time High at this time.  But I am saying that my optimism is pretty high at this time.  The long pole that we had has been resolved.  There has been a consolidation.  The weakness of the dollar is showing up in the Bitcoin price.

Lets hope that the price catches up in the Far East this evening.

His lie is that there is no way to have both a 2MB hardfork as well as a segwit refactor.  And you can.  Classic has stated in its [roadmap](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/documentation/blob/master/roadmap/roadmap2016.md) that SegWit would be included in Classic as well.

d3u88jq,ForkiusMaximus,25,"In fairness, Greg and the others have raised one halfway decent point among all the weaseling around: what Classic did was probably the wrong way to get around Core. 

Classic framed it as a miner vote, which Greg is calling a coup against ""the users."" Of course he's trying to bullshit that Core = the community, but there is still a grain of truth left after the BS is washed away. The fact is, Bitcoin doesn't work by miner vote; it works - ultimately - by market vote. The miners *should* serve as a proxy for that, *but due to mining becoming disconnected with nodes* (pooled mining) there are indeed like 10 guys who sort of have some possible control over Bitcoin (yes people can just switch pools, but is this the ideal way?). 

The rightful remedy to this situation is to put competing forks up to a *direct* market test: **commence fork futures trading on the major Bitcoin exchanges**. Investors buy and sell 1MB-BTC futures and 2MB-BTC futures until a clear winner emerges. The market speaks. (And in the unlilely event that no clear winner emerges, the market has expressed its value for a persistent split.) In all cases, hodler purchasing power is unaffected.

Then neither Classic nor any other such fork can be called any kind of coup against the users, by any stretch. The 75% hashpower threshold should be removed. And I don't mean it should be increased to 95%. The blocksize cap in Classic should just be 2MB straight up as a flag day (increase to 2MB at this block...or gradual stepwise increase if prefered).

We have had endless debate because both alternatives were flawed: **we should have no miner vote as proxy for a market vote; just a direct market vote**. (In the event that the market chooses a persistent split, the minority chain would have to make some hashing and signing tweaks to prevent interference, of course.)",2016-06-03 17:13:24

- Encourage forks of Bitcoin Core with changes in consensus rules.  Encourage Bitcoin Core developers themselves to make such forks when they feel strongly about a consensus rule change that doesn't have Bitcoin Core Consensus^® (this will itself remove power from Core, which is **a good thing for decentralization**, no single social organization should ever fully control development).

- **Do not** call such fork attempts a coup.  Do not attempt to ostracize or otherwise antagonize the involved developers (Gavin, Mike, Peter R, etc etc.).  Use strictly technical arguments and not personal attacks (Mike Hearn is an agent, wants to destroy Bitcoin, etc.)

- Encourage the community to decide between implementations through the provisioning and distribution of relevant data.  Once the market and/or miners have spoken, integrate any clearly dominant changes into the Core Repository.


- If the economic consensus disagrees with you or Core or any other actor, **accept it or introduce another fork yourself**.


- Stop spreading hard fork FUD.  Things like ""a single hard fork is akin to raising the 21M limit"" or ""any competing client that's consensus-incompatible at some point in the future is an altcoin"" or ""a large number of users will lose substantial amounts of money if a new fork is adopted by the economic majority"" have to go.  They're not fooling anybody and they're majorly poisoning the discussion.


- Denounce theymos and the r/Bitcoin censorship.  It's clearly divisive, counterproductive, and has no place in an arena that requires free and open discussion.  Oh, and stop calling dissenters ""shills"" ""sockpuppets"" ""altcoin pumpers"" and all that bullshit.  I promise you, we are not.


- Keep doing what you're doing.  Write awesome code, make your case to the community, appeal to the miners if you have to, and have faith in the Bitcoin network and the open source development model.

When ANY faction (and that is what Core is, and how Core or anyone else should view themselves) comes to view themselves as the *de facto* leaders, as the intellectual monarchs of what is supposed to be a collaborative and open system, then this makes Core no better than **[the pig characters](https://d2hej51cni6o0x.cloudfront.net/images/covers%2Fanimal-farm.jpg)** (though I do NOT mean to compare you directly to a ""pig"") in George Orwell's *Animal Farm.*

&gt;Cryptographic evidence so far suggests otherwise.

I beg your pardon, Greg—I may not be a cryptographer, but I am not an imbecile. This is not *cryptographic* evidence. This, even by your definitions, is FUD intended to scare-monger and cajole users into supporting Core's vision for Bitcoin. One could argue, for instance, that Bitcoin is the weaker protocol for  having never survived a ""contentious"" hard fork challenge (as opposed to ETH, which does this in its sleep), and for never having survived *evolutionary* changes to its ""Core"" programmer governance model. Shouldn't *that* scare the community, as well?

Shouldn't it scare all of us, too, not to mention, make us all worried for the future of Bitcoin, when reasonable, long-time users like me would be outright censored, banned, and accused of being ""Mike Hearn sock puppets"" (as I have been, much to my confusion), for posting these very comments over in your /r/Bitcoin? Such actions are not needed to defend the truth in any matter, but it is indeed necessary to protect the paper-thin veneer of these lies.

You are no different (and no less less brilliant) than Oppenheimer or Kalashnikov, scientists and inventors who perfected their inventions in a total absence of any connection to the overall social good.

Both are potential options for storing funds offline with their own pros and cons. Multisig has the benefit of the keys never being generated all in one place. Key splitting requires you to generate keys in a secure environment, but allows you to use higher numbers for M and N which is beneficial.

Our cold storage uses key splitting for a variety of reasons (one of them being the pro I mentioned above) but Coinbase also allows customers to create multisig vaults where they are in full control of their private keys https://www.coinbase.com/multisig

Some of these are actually legitimate shows for kids watched by a ton of 2 year olds. Other ones are so copy-and pasted that the videos could easily be made and uploaded by a software program (and the channels' upload rate would suggest it). I noticed that for almost all of videos the like to dislike ratio seems to be aprox. 3:2, this stays true for videos with 10k views to 1.5 billion views. I have found entire comment chains from different accounts consisting of nothing more than random characters and spaces of 1-10 characters. Lots of weird engagement patterns. This is the part that gets me- I don't see why 2 year olds would be subscribing, liking, disliking, and commenting on channels which produce 10+ hour long videos per day that are all almost the exact same thing using the same animations, sounds, and backgrounds, but just with different character models. Also the fact that this is so hugely prevalent with again some videos having over a billion views yet nobody is talking about it- it feels to me like that means there is an effort to try and hide it to some extent.

I suspect there is some kind of bitcoin laundering scheme going on or something of that nature in the cases of the channels that appear to be fake.

After trade fees and funding costs I cleared just a hair over $130k USD in profit from the trade. The position has been open (in part) since 3/3 for a total of ~92 days. I had about $11,200 in funding costs.

It took me about an hour and a half to clear the 1,350 BTC from my books, most of it (but about 300 or so) were market sells. The volume at 21:45 was partly (well, mostly...) me. Sorry for the sell pressure, folks. I was able to get completely out at an average price of $578.28. As my goal is accumulation of BTC, I then spent 10 minutes turning the $130,640 into 225.14 BTC (avg price after fees: $580.26). I had no want of speculating and holding on to the USD to see if BTC/USD fell. I was happy with my BTC profits and so I took it. Admittedly the price turned up after I finished selling so there was a little slippage on the USD-&gt;BTC front.

I am now the proud hodler of 554 total BTC. I'll be leaving 50 BTC in bitfinex for the occasional, low-leverage long, but the rest will be leaving, mainly to a keepkey. I still expect this to go to the mid 600's, It's just... those 90 some-odd days were rough, guys. That kind of exposure really puts a strain on your emotions and your normal day-to-day.
For now, I won't be taking a margin position and will be checking the price much less frequently. I'll set some alarms... maybe at 500 maybe at 700... just so I can check in when the big moves happen. But I can't stare at charts on a screen anymore. I'm also closing on a 3/4 million dollar house in a few weeks, so this peace of mind (and the profits!) are fantastic immediately prior to moving across the country.

I'll be around for a few hours to answer some questions and feel free to PM me, but I hope to be spending a lot less time around here moving forward, at least for the immediate future. I need a few weeks - at a minimum - of good sleep, ""no bitcoin"", no reddit, no getting pissed, no being disappointed... I was happy with my profits and so I took them. No harm in that, but if you have a long It's not really a suggestion to sell. I just couldn't take the ups and downs any more and had enough on the line where I felt it was time to take some profits and re-evaluate. If bitcoin goes to $2k, $5k, $10k... still plenty of time to get back on the train. But for now, I need sanity.

d3wmkqz,bmisterxster,38,"I am honestly trying to be as positive about LISK as I can. Here is my summary:

Cons:

* Sidechain approach contradicts dapps interactions, so a lot of cool smart-contract applications are impossible (especially stablecoins). See also https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ma7h3/why_doesnt_each_ethereum_dapp_have_its_own/

* The team seems to be very mediocre compared to ethereum. The LISK leader is just young newgrad without any achievements/experience (yet) except LISK (Vitalik was IOI medalist, got Thiel fellowship, and have a lot of great blockchain theory posts/contributions).

* Rootstock IFAIK is going to do the same thing as LISK (sidechain based dapps) but using bitcoin, and much more professional team.

* LISK mostly is rebranded Crypti. This project was unsuccesful (no one used it) and the fact of rebranding and issuing of the new coin is scaring.

* Despite sidechains (arguably) can help with scaling of dapps, LISK transactions are not scaling and have the same problems as bitcoin/nxts etc. So
it will have blockchain bloating problem in case of VISA-like transaction traffic.

* I have doubts about LISK PoS, mainly because of I have doubts about their team. It is very easy to make it vulnerable.

* AFAIK LISK didn't go through any serious security audit.

* LISK doesn't have any white paper.

* I don't know any LISK application which can't be done in ethereum (but I know vice versa applications).

Pros:

* It scales better now (before ethereum sharding is ready). But with less security (arguably) and no synergy.

* Diversification - who knows maybe this sidechain approach turns out to be useful after couple of years. 

* There are still not many (or maybe no at all) useful ethereum dapps (but in theory I belive some of the ethereum applications should be very successful (MakerDAO)), maybe it is really too hard to develop them on ethereum and with LISK some of dapps could be created faster? Also recently Mike Hearn said that
with ethereum it is still hard/slow to develop dapps as with bitcoin (https://medium.com/@octskyward/developing-apps-for-block-chains-1635cd05b47#.ubhvjcuh3).",2016-06-05 16:36:02

Details:

On 1 Feb 2016 you posted:

&gt; even a year ago I said I though we could probably survive 2MB

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43lxgn/21_months_ago_gavin_andresen_published_a/czjb7tf

(If you hover over where it says ""four months ago"", it shows that the date when you wrote the comment ""even a year ago I said I though[t] we could probably survive 2MB"" was on ""Mon 1 Feb 2016"".)

So this means it was sometime in 2015 (not ""around 2014?"" like I erroneously posted) where had been saying that you thought we could probably survive 2MB.

I will fix my post (using strikethrough to preserve the original), to reflect your correction.

Meanwhile, the question remains: Why do you now insist on 1 MB actual blocksize, when you previously said ""even a year ago I said I though we could probably survive 2MB""?

Also, the main question in the OP was about the potential massive conflict of interest about you being the CTO of a company which is part-owned by AXA, whose CEO is the head of the Bilderberg Group - which represents the legacy financial elite, who would be expected to *oppose* Bitcoin becoming ""p2p electronic cash"".

Your recent flip-flop (from previously saying that 2 MB blocks might be ok, to now insisting on a 1 MB actual blocksize limit) would help companies like AXA and the legacy financial elite represented by the Bilderberg Group.

Don't you think it's reasonable for people to (a) wonder whether they may be imposing contractual or non-contractual pressure on you, directly or indirectly, to insist on 1 MB actual blocksize, and (b) request further clarification from you on why we should trust someone in your compromised position to be making this kind of ""decision"" for the rest of the community?

d3wjzv1,catsfive,14,"Sorry your comments here are hidden. I have upvoted each and every one of your replies, and am grateful (more than I can bear to say without sounding like a 'tard) to be speaking with someone at your technical level. I've tried many times in the past to follow some of your more technical posts, but I have to acknowledge my limits. There are many of us like that in here, but let me assure you, the cream of /r/BTC's hivemind is under no illusions as to where you and the other Blockstream programmers are taking Bitcoin. Or, are we? I'm genuinely trying to *understand* the roadmap, here.

Greg, I'm almost 50, and, in my career, I've worked with (and directed) more than a few programmers. The most brilliant of them literally *live* for a work environment where they get to follow their passions and solve puzzles all day. They literally revel in the idea that someone else handles the complex (and usually ""bullshit,"" in their eyes) ""politics"" of why they are doing what they're doing, and the more ""pure research"" their job feels, the more 'actualized' they feel at that job. We are trying to get you to look further upstream into the political side of the programming you are doing. Bitcoin has some complex political considerations.

The biggest issue that /r/BTC cannot understand is the blocksize issue. Put simply, it's this:

- **1 MB forever,** and Bitcoin becomes a slow and expensive settlement layer, supported by sidechains.

- An adaptive (or elegant, maybe, whatever you prefer) blocksize solution, and Bitcoin becomes a transactional ~~monster~~ powerhouse, with *specialized* sidechains focused on important, but specific use cases.

NO ONE that understands Bitcoin at the levels that, say, I do, or someone even more technical, is confused about these two distinct (but granted, perhaps oversimplified) outcomes. The first outcome suits and benefits Blockstream's current investors. Though it comes as a surprise to me, but I have to accept at face value that you may not have investigated the business practices of these investors very clearly. But there are many of us who have devoted (literally) *years* of their lifetimes educating ourselves as to who they are and in understanding what, let me assure you, would be their very underhanded and insidious ways of doing business. There are many levels.

**The first outcome benefits Blockstream's investors. The second outcome disintermediates them.** Perhaps we *are* indeed ""conspiracy theorizing"" you far more than we should, here. But, you would have to agree (and any objective observer would) that the *connection* between Core's outright REFUSAL to implement ANY blocksize solution (although there are several clients with legitimate, working examples that Core could integrate right now), coupled with the connection to Blockstream's investors, that makes Core's continued refusal to increase the blocksize look very, very suspicious. We are not loons, or 'theorists.' These are legitimate concerns that continue not to be addressed in any legitimate and rigorous way.

I run a Classic node (sorry, and no personal offense intended). But I would go back to running a Core node in a *heartbeat* if Core would implement some sort of blocksize increase (outside of SegWit). 

I'm sorry that these replies are so long. I'm not trying to ""rant."" But these are legitimate questions that Core and Blockstream need to address if this community is ever going to come together.",2016-06-05 14:32:56

And indeed, there is such a possibility when the Chinese currency started to decline. The value of bitcoin had a low volatility for a while, making it a good subject for hedging. 

Will Chinese investors eventually find their way to Ethereum? On the one hand, I suspect they just want to hedge against a falling Yuan, and bitcoin may be better at that. On the other hand, the step from owning bitcoin to owning ether is small. ",2016-06-05 00:36:45

It did it again at $150, $200 and $220. Four weeks later the price was $1200 - almost a *550%* price increase. 

Bubble behaviour can defy all expectations, and so long as Bitcoin reigns supreme in liquidity, market capitalization and adoption it's fully conceivable that we could see $3000 before the Ethereum brigade have even figured out how to get their ETH back out the DAO.

When it finally is submitted as running stable code, I don't doubt that eventually BU and Classic will integrate it. Many aspects of SegWit do make some sense.

If I would be a troll now, I'd say 'on purpose', however I am NOT inferring that.

And there's a lot of toxicity on /r/Bitcoin, too. Over there, even the mods are toxic - which creates a much more awful climate. Can we at least agree on that?

And regarding your post on forum.bitcoin.com:

&gt; (Even in a more general sense, if you think an increase in monetary value is the primary driver for the typical FOSS developer, I can only assume you haven't met many of them.)

Holders are specifically interested in increasing the value of Bitcoin!

That is the main driver. What you are saying here is what we're suspecting all along - that Bitcoin development is being used by some as an ego platform or for other reasons not tied to appreciating coin value - more than to create a successful, appreciating currency.

We think of that as misaligned incentives. Not bad per se, but if becomes the defining thing about Bitcoin development, it is.

That is not to say that there are no people genuinely believing that few transactions keep the network safe somehow. Most here argue, however, that there are other tradeoffs to consider and a crippling small blocksize is a risk in itself. Do you follow these discussions?

&gt; And now you are taking it to another level. You are effectively taking credit for the work these developers are doing. We should all be thanking you for showing them the light. Please.

He's not taking credit, he's saying that holding Bitcoin increases its price and therefore *helping* to finance development. You assert he does so in a twitter DM and his previous forum post. I fail to see that. Can you point it out?

Bitcoin can and will keep the ""(C)opyright the Unlimited/Core/Classic/..."" line in the source, rather than ""(C)opyright Roger Ver, and all the other holders and financing guys"".

&gt; However, you're also the most severe case of Dunning-Kruger I've seen in my entire life. 

I hope you can see that this is bordering quite a bit on trolling.

&gt; Someone who doesn't know how to properly construct a transaction (that's assuming you weren't intentionally lying), shouldn't have anywhere near as loud an opinion on one of the toughest security engineering challenges on planet earth. 

That is a myopic view on security. A finance guy is usually good - I suppose - with money. He only needs to know it works on a high level, he doesn't need to know which random generator to use, or which ECC signature scheme is best.
Those are certainly important parts in keeping coins safe - however they have already been designed to a large extend.

Safety of Bitcoin is *also* it not being taken over by Altcoins. Put down the blinders and see that he certainly has a point when he's saying that we shouldn't cripple the possible transaction rate now.

&gt; So far your contribution to this debate has consisted of wishful thinking, cherry-picking six year old Satoshi Nakamoto quotes, and taking screenshots of stuff you don't like - that's not counting the toxicity. Speaking of division of labour, I'd prefer you'd just stick to promoting Bitcoin.

I am 'in' Bitcoin since the slashdotting in 2010. I remember the vibe, the expectation and I have read the whitepaper and all of Satoshi's interactions. Satoshi very evidently had on-chain scaling in mind and you'd need to erase his posts from the internet to really succesfully rewrite history here.

And it is not as if we're not able to compromise. Most want an immediate increase to 2MB now. We came down from BIP101, and are now even lower than what Adam Back once proposed.
We are also not asking for an increase since yesterday.

d3wzb1s,spookthesunset,12,"&gt; I really wanted to buy some Butts when the price was ~$445 a couple of weeks ago because I knew it's headed +$600 but I still am not comfortable with the whole Butt buying/selling process.

It is headed to the $10k mark very shortly.  If you look at the Riēchtworth-Bōrcht line, you can see the upward band of sun-moon retainer that is almost always a dead giveaway that bitcoin's price is about to explode.

I recommend you sell every asset you own and go down to localbitcoins with a wheelbarrow and walk away with a truckload of bitcoin. You should run, because every minute you wait means another wall street fat cat will buy in at a price lower than yours.

I've been working on a bitcoin fullnode written in node.js for months (to my knowledge it's one of the very few alternative consensus-aware nodes). So, I browserified it and hacked this up over the weekend.

The only part that makes it ""less"" than a full node is the fact that it has to use a websocket-&gt;tcp bridge to connect to the p2p network. The proxy doesn't do anything special though. It's just a pipe: the browser is still parsing all the packets, etc.

d3ybecf,nullc,30,"For example,  a miner takes an unspent coin, and generates two transactions spending it where their txids the same initial 64 bits. This takes a few seconds of computation with the test tool I created after PeterR claimed that producing 64 bit collisions was computationally infeasible.  They then send each of the transactions to a non-overlapping random set of half the nodes.  They keep doing this over and over again, dividing the network into thousands of little partitions of nodes with the mutually exclusive transactions that share the same 64 bits of transaction-id.

They configure their own mining to not process any of these transactions.

Now, when some other miner gets a block including some of these transactions, the collisions will make the Bitcoin unlimited reconstruction fail, requiring a time consuming fallback to less efficient transfer. But the attacker's own blocks would transfer unimpeded.

This kind of potential vulnerability was understood years ago and I published designs that avoided it-- which BIP152 compact blocks uses.

d3z8p5k,aminok,28,"Great point by Hearn:

&gt;Bitcoin needs users, lots of them, for its political survival. There are many people out there who would like to see digital cash disappear, or be regulated out of existence. They will argue for that in front of  governments and courts .... some already are. And if they're going to lose those arguments, the political and economic damage of getting rid of

&gt;Bitcoin must be large enough to make people think twice. That means it needs supporters, it needs innovative services, it needs companies, and it needs legal users making legal payments: as many of them as possible.

&gt;If Bitcoin is a tiny, obscure currency used by drug dealers and a handful of crypto-at-any-cost geeks, the cost of simply banning it outright will seem trivial and the hammer will drop. There won't be a large scale payment network OR a high-value settlement network. And then the world is really screwed, because nobody will get a second chance for a very long time.

Recent events hit this point home.

This week, Richard Stallman, a staunch supporter of authoritarianism, and famed founder of the GNU Project, released details of his upcoming project: Taler (Taxable Anonymous Libre Electronic Reserve), a totally centralized financial surveillance tool for the state, and its website very clearly implies that cash/electronic-cash should be abolished:

https://www.taler.net/

&gt;Unlike BitCoin or cash payments, Taler ensures that governments can learn their citizen's total income and thus collect sales, value-added or income taxes. Taler is thus a currency for the mainstream economy, and not the black market.

***

&gt;One of the key goals of Taler is to provide anonymity for citizens buying goods and services, while ensuring that the state can observe incoming transactions to ensure businesses engage only in legal activities and do not evade taxes (such as income tax, sales tax or value-added tax). However, we also want to stay out of the immediate personal domain, so sharing funds within a family or copying coins between devices should not be subject to monitoring by the state.

&gt;In Taler terminology, we distinguish between transactions where the exclusive ownership of the value of a coin is passed from one entity to another, and sharing whereafter control over a coin is shared by multiple electronic wallets (which may belong to different individuals). In Taler, the receiver of a transaction is visible to the state and thus can be taxed, while sharing is invisible to anyone not involved. Once a coin is shared among different individuals, any one of those can try to spend it, but only the first spender would succeed. Thus, sharing requires a strong trust relationship among the individuals involved, and thus represent interactions in the protected immediate personal domain, and not commercial transactions.

Mass adoption of electronic cash, as soon as possible, to make it impossible for the fascists of this world get it banned, is the best chance humanity has.",2016-06-07 18:09:52
d3y9b7r,yolotrades,27,"&gt; Think of people like yolotrades and the likes who cashed out a ton of coins already and bought consumer items LOL I mean imagine cashing out 100 grand worth of coin only to see it approach ATH. It will add a lot of meaning to the phrase 'Get Back! Get back in!'

I think you should know what you're talking about before you open your mouth. I still have 550 coins, I didn't cash out the USD... I turned it *into* bitcoin. When I said I was gonna buy a car I didn't mean I was going to cash out my bitcoin to do it. That's a fucking amateur move, son. I have a down payment in USD already in my bank account (because I'm not a broke ass cunt) and the profits / recent rise make me feel comfortable enough financing the rest. I've done the 100% cash for exotic cars thing before, and all you're doing is paying the depreciation up front at the cost of the interest. In this case, obviously bitcoin should appreciate more than the interest, so why the fuck would I *sell* it for a depreciating thing instead? Also, this isn't happening for ~3 months anyways.

If it goes to $700 from here I still make another $66k just on appreciation of my holdings. Will I be a little sad that I didn't let the *leveraged* position go a little longer if that happens soon? Sure. Will I beat myself up over it? Fuck no. I took six *figures* in profit, and still have $320k in bitcoin that I own *outright*. No margin call can take those away from me. I'd say I'm doing quite alright, bro.

d3yf349,nullc,17,"&gt; We do not recognise the BIP process as authoritative -- instead it is a fake standards process entirely captured by Core/Blockstream

Hi Zerg.   You're confusing comments.  Use the BIP process or don't-- your call, but you don't have a specification at all.  And that makes compatibility and review much harder and less likely. 

&gt; While Core has been off specing, we have been running a 7 node

Compact blocks has been running for months too. We just don't find it appropriate to announce to large fanfare things that don't even have a specification.  I'm usually the first to agree with the importance (and, frankly, harsh reality) that its the code which is normative, but this doesn't diminish the value of having an actual specification.

&gt; It is an amazing coincidence that after so much time Core suddenly decided to produce a competing implementation

You have the history backwards here.  This kind of efficient block relay was Core's proposal and we have been working on improving and [refining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/block_network_coding) the design for a long time in the background.

d3z8nzq,Mdk_251,15,"First of all, I want to reassure you - that's not how hackers work.

If you were indeed hacked, they would have either locked your PC and requested ransom for opening it. Or would have used it as a bot (e.g. for bitcoin mining, or performing hacking attacks).

Think about it logically: if a hacker wanted your driver's license, he would have just copied it remotely to his computer. Why would he need to open the directory using your browser, and then leave it open in your screen?

Much more likely is it was one if the following:

1. You opened it and forgot about it (maybe you were trying to open something else before you left your desk, and clicked it on accident)

2. Someone else in the house opened it (maybe by accident)

3. Some program opened it (for example, a scanner may open the scanned result once it scans something).

EDIT: I've worked a number of years for a large cyber security equipment developer. I'm not saying that what I stated above is the god given truth, only that over 90% of cyber attacks on the internet are perpetrated by large multi-national criminal organizations, who don't chase after every individual user, but instead utilize completely automated bot networks which scan for known vulnerabilities and achieve results using their scale, not a personal per-user approach. It's much cheaper for them, than to try to hack people one by one, and start browsing their folders (using their own screen, no less) in hope of finding incriminating data.

Of course anything is possible, including OP's buddy (or SO) playing a prank on him, or his house being haunted. But consider this:

How did the hacker know when he left his computer? Why hadn't he noticed the hacker using his mouse beforehand? How did the hacker know which directory to open? Why hadn't the OP caught the perpetrator in the act? Why didn't the hacker cover up his work? Why would the hacker want his driver's license, and not bank login info, or compromising photos that he can be blackmailed with? Why would the hacker (visually) try to look for data, when he could have used his control to install malware on OP's computer which would have given him full access? It would have been quicker, and would have allowed him to extract any data (including OP's keyboard keystrokes) while remaining undetected...",2016-06-07 18:07:53

But I do think that the ridiculous and despicable tactics you mentioned plus the stalling itself plus the empty promises, the resulting community split and so forth did harm Bitcoin more than any increase, including a scenario where we implemented a - I guess from your perspective quite aggressive - blocksize like 20MB.

I think most are also o.k. with those picking up much of the slack - should they work out.

A few more details: 

- This allows every voter to check that their vote was counted (does the blockchain have my vote transaction on it?) without exposing personal information to anyone else. 
- Valid votes are transactions that move a token from the government's token pool, through some intermediary wallets, into a candidate's address. This policy ensures that only vote tokens are counted and not bitcoin in general.",2016-06-07 08:16:52

If there are any other major core contributors who are involved with strategic planning and implementation for BTC, i may have missed them. But will you honestly say that the 7 of you blockstreamers are not an oligarchy in control of core? You've already purged the most productive and insightful developers because they didn't agree to your vision - do you think other will speak up?

When you buy things from individuals you run the risk of getting a stolen or fake product, one needs to use their brain to deduce if the risk is worth it. Unfortunately rational thought is in short supply.

Millions of transactions go through, good sellers get thousands of positive rep, shit sellers get banned and keep posting with zero rep.

Buy from the sellers with good feedback. Like you do on ebay. Use your brain. If you decide to skimp out and buy something way below market value, you should not be so cognitively handicapped to think that nothing could be amiss. 

Reminds me of a retarded kid in /r/bitcoin who bought thousands of dollars of starbucks cards for 20cents/dollar with bitcoin, sold them on ebay with his real info and then went to jail. His reddit post made it sound like he was really confused.... It took a lot of stupid to think everything was a-ok with that scheme.

/g2a just needs a disclaimer about how much verification their sellers require. This should be more than enough to keep everyone but the most retarded people from becoming surprised.

d40ov5z,_amethyst,28,"Lemme throw in my two cents (sorry, my 0.0000347 bitcoins) from an interesting perspective. 

Those people are a huge problem. They're the reason Bitcoin does so badly in PR. These people who swear that bitcoin is the greatest invention ever need to fucking stop with that. 

I invested in bitcoins when they were worth nothing (literally started playing with them when a bitcoin was worth 18 cents; they're currently almost $600). I made a small fortune from it. More than enough to pay my way through college without ever taking out student loans. I learned a lot more about computers from spending years fucking around with bitcoin mining. I should be the poster child for ""Bitcoin is the greatest thing ever"" people. But, **no, I don't think this is the most groundbreaking invention in the history of economics**. 

I think it's pretty cool, and I *do* think that bitcoin (or something similar to it) is going to cause drastic changes to certain areas of economics and finance over the next few decades, but it's not going to overhaul the entire international economy the way that most bitcoin nerds think it will. Standard national fiat currencies aren't going anywhere for a long time (not in my lifetime, at least). And whatever it does change, it's going to take a long time to change it. Maybe bitcoin, or something like it, will become the only valuable currency on earth, but definitely not in my lifetime. Maybe not for centuries. 

It's great for high-speed international transactions. I've done those before and it's pretty cool to send $10,000 across the planet in ten seconds for less than a fraction of a penny. It's going to put Western Union out of business someday. But that's about it. 

But the nerds who love bitcoin really really piss me off. I've basically left the entire community. I leave all my bitcoins stored safely and convert them to dollars when I need to. I've stayed away from the community for the last few years. It's just ridiculous. The ""bitcoin is the greatest invention ever and fiat currencies are evil"" circlejerk got old fast for me. I miss when the community was just a few open-source tech nerds like me, back when we all got excited to see the price hit 50 cents, before it was run over by straight men who would suck Ron Paul's dick in a heartbeat given the chance. If I hear one more bitcoin nerd sing the gospel of Gary Johnson one more time, I swear to god... 

The community is also kind of toxic to women. I've been to a handful of real-world bitcoin meetups and I felt incredibly out-of-place as a woman, even though I knew more about bitcoin than 80% of the people in the room. Lots of condescending ""omg a grill let me explain the magic of bitcoins to you"" mansplaining. It's more painful when they start explaining it to me and then I have to correct them on basic information. And then getting asked if I have a boyfriend just got too weird for me. 

I've been to a lot of tech meetups and I've gotten my share of mild harassment and condescension and awkward looks. But this was like none other. 

Also I could feel some men behind me staring directly at my ass the whole time. Which is weird because my ass is seriously not that great. 

For now, when non-tech friends ask me about bitcoin, I *drastically* downplay how great it is. I never tell any of them how much money I made from it, knowing that they might think it's a get-rich-quick scheme, or that it'll make them just as wealthy (news flash: it won't). I seriously don't advertise this thing. ""Well, if you want to invest a little bit in it, you can, but be careful"". ""Never invest more than you're willing to lose"". ""There's a small chance that there will be a massive bug in the software and the entire thing will come toppling down in milliseconds"". ""It's a pretty cool technology but it could topple at any time"". ""It's better for buying and selling things than it is as an investment tool"". 

I think I'm one of the few people with a serious investment in bitcoin who thinks like that. I might be the only serious bitcoin investor who doesn't preach the gospel of bitcoin like we're nearing the End of Times. They're frustrating to deal with. 

**tl;dr: bitcoin is pretty cool, but not the greatest thing since sliced bread, and I should know. It's definitely going to change a few things about the world, but it's not going to be the end-all-be-all of finance the way most of the community thinks it is. And the community is full of irritating condescension and idiocy and delusion and misogyny and I tried to survive it but it was just too much for me and it drove me far, far away.** ",2016-06-08 19:17:52

Overall, the FAQ here probably answers most questions (http://www.falcon-net.org/faq).

Our overall goal is to help aid decentralization by reducing the network latencies between miners and full nodes. It's healthy for Bitcoin to have alternative dissemination techniques and networks designed for those techniques. In particular, the trick we use was not being employed or even considered by others, so we built and are deploying this prototype. We are looking forward to a healthier, more decentralized ecosystem.

We are actively looking for sponsors to help defray the costs of running the network. And more generally, as one of the main academic efforts in the area of cryptosystems, we are also looking for bright people to join our program as students and more broadly tackle the big open research problems in this space, and more immediately, to join our nascent open source projects, whether that's Falcon or one of the many others underway.

d412gig,elux,35,"New, fast relay network for Bitcoin coming out of Cornell.edu http://www.falcon-net.org/

&gt;#Benefits

&gt;Falcon is a novel, fast relay network for disseminating Bitcoin blocks. It connects miners and full nodes and ferries blocks using a novel technique to reduce orphans, which in turn helps miners get the most for their effort, and helps the network efficiently convert the spent energy into security. And ultimately, Falcon helps Bitcoin scale.

&gt;#How It Works

&gt;Falcon gains its benefits from a novel technique called application-level cut-through routing. This technique effectively decouples the speed of disseminating blocks from the size of the network.

&gt;#How It Differs

&gt;**Falcon is 10X to 1000X faster** than alternatives. By reducing the latency between the miners, it helps even out the playing field between miners and aids miner decentralization.

He says he ""assumed the worst about people"" or something to that effect, just as those lost souls on both sides of the civil war. However, his charge was only half wrong... There IS blatant North Korea style censorship on /r/bitcoin. Erik wasn't wrong about that. He was only wrong about the one specific instance of his own post. But he wouldn't have been so jumpy in the first place if there wasn't factual censorship happening on /r/bitcoin. 

Lastly I'll say I think Theymos has every right to censor as he does. He's moderating a *private* forum. The ironic thing, though, is I don't think it helps his cause.

Claiming any sort of technical urgency is disingenuous *at best*. Simply pay your four or five cents and the transaction usually makes it into the first block. **Stop spreading your nonsensical and downright irresponsible FUD.** SegWit and lightning will arrive soon enough, and the network will be better off for it. If it is determined that an increase in blocksize is necessary *after* SegWit and LN are released, and the data assessed, then we'll cross that bridge. Again, there is absolutely no emergency; taking the time to scale properly, while preserving all the things that make bitcoin great, is the only responsible way forward.",2016-06-09 04:31:13

This makes sense because you wouldn't want someone creating ""dust"" spam by sending small amount of coins. BUT the code still only enforces the same mintxfee if you send to many small outputs.

I'm going to assume you're being serious, but this is a VERY ignorant statement to make.

Cryptographers and mathematicians are primarily focused on research. Applied cryptographers are like applied mathematicians - they focus on the actual application of the research. Finally, you have computer scientists, software architects, and developers with multiple levels of competency who take the application and make it usable.

In addition, the term ""maintainer"" has a very specific meaning in open-source software development. Of course, I wouldn't expect advocates of Dash and Ethereum to know how open-source software development works, so here is a good starting point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintainer

d42w140,ErikBjare,12,"Hi there, great to see your interested in getting started developing. A couple of weeks ago I also wanted to learn how to develop contracts. 

I was already somewhat familiar with how blockchains work (in theory) and had been using Bitcoin for a while and following Ethereum closely. The next natural step for me was just to start checking out the language and it's API. So that's what I sought out to do.

In my initial searches, I stumbled upon some awesome links. These were very easy-going with plenty of explanation and hand-holding (which is great for beginners, obviously). Not sure you need to read all of it, but you should write code that does most of it and when you're not sure, look how they did it.

Here is the glorious series by the Ethereum team:

 - [Create a Hello World Contract in ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/greeter) - Slowly getting started, you now know how to run a contract.
 - [Create a Token in ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/token) - Getting interesting, you now know why it's ~~trivial~~ easy to create a cryptocurrency on ethereum.
 - [Create a crowdsale contract in ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/crowdsale) - By now you are truly starting to understand, and you could probably write stuff yourself given the time and previous examples, but just do a little bit more...
 - [Create a democracy contract on ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/dao) - You may now realize this is pretty badass. You finally understand the fundamentals of *DAOs*.

Then there seemed to be [this handy resource](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/). It was indeed handy, especially [this part](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/contract_tutorials.html).

But, what was obviously missing was [some kind of Solidity reference](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). While it wasn't perfect, it's good as introduction. Odds are you'll stumble in there when you try to understand errors in your code initially. 

I also re-found the [Ethereum Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial). It has a lot of introductory and background information (but limited practical examples) which I recommend highly.

You might also want to check out (and preferably implement) examples of how to hook up your contract data and events to webapps (perfect fit if you're a webdev). Make sure to glance over the [JavaScript API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API) to learn what tools (APIs) there are to your disposal.

Fun stuff to do for projects:

 - Easy: Lottery/Ponzi
 - Hard: Exchange/market for a certain token or ether (or: prediction market with an assigned oracle)

That's what I did, and I would now consider myself rather good at understanding Solidity code (comfortable in reading contracts written in Solidity) and know how to slowly write (probably) badly written dapps without looking in reference material every 15 minutes.

And again: **great** to see interest in development, hope you have a blast just like I did (and do).

Good luck!

If the market can absorb these offerings from old buyers looking to get out breakeven, it will go higher. But it needs a lot of volume to do it.

The market is not as young as 2013 and probably will not be making people rich overnight like that ever again. (IMO)

I'm sure this will fall on mostly deaf ears, but my suggestion is to wait until Bitcoin goes on sale--this usually happens a few times a year after the price has come down very quickly on high volume, usually accompanying some drama or bad news.

Its a statement from Greg, as usual its completely off-mark as he seems to again have no clue what he is talking about.

There is no requirement for a miner to have validated the block before he can start mining on top of it. As long at the block *is* validated at some point in the near future.

This is a very common approach in most of computing, its typically called ""optimistic [something]"".

The entire point is that you can do it perfectly, which guarantees you 100% of the time will be slow (and lose lots of money due to it). Or you can be an optimist and guess, delaying the actual verification. Which means in &lt; 1% of the times you will be slow because you later notice your optimistic guess was wrong.

The fun and irony of this whole situation is that because Greg resists this common sense logic, people had to hack and work around this stupid way that Bitcoin has been doing it for years. The result was that when a softfork deployment went wrong  they had to advice everyone to wait up to 30 or 100 blocks before accepting the results. Greg will tell everyone this was because the miners were not validating.

The truth of the situation was that miners were given tools that didn't work and would cause them to lose lots of money, and so they build their own.  And to this day Greg tells the miners that the fault was theirs for not using ""his"" way of doing things.",2016-06-11 23:27:06

&gt; Re the attack: That's not quite correct. There are two main attack vectors in this protocol that I'm aware of. One is that **anyone with a couple of seconds of cpu time** can construct a double spend transaction pair that has the same short ID. They then send this to different parts of the network. They do this a bunch of times, splitting the network into thousands of little partitions, and then the thinblock transfers fail silently due to the collisions, and have to fall back to regular transfers. A miner could use this vulnerability to improve their profits: by being sure to mine none of these transactions their blocks won't be impeded while everyone elses would.


https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4lwtgp/part_2_of_5_xthin_blocks_are_faster_than_standard/d3rem3l

I apologize that I included the word ""several"" incorrectly, but I'm sure we can agree that 40 mins of execution time on a 24 core machine with 128 gigs of RAM isn't really ""anyone with a couple of seconds"".  It's more ""anyone with a couple of minutes of CPU time and lots of RAM willing to tie up that hardware"".  It's still a cheap attack, I grant you that, but the language could be a bit more precise.

I didn't see your blog comment until now.  I apologize for the confusion if you thought I was referring to that.  I will approve it momentarily.


&gt; It's necessary for reliable software engineering, however... as there are several other ways that collisions can jam the protocol, and the attack only hits one of them. And also much easier to do (e.g. you cannot test BIP152 with a collision tool, because it's not vulnerable in that manner) and the increased ease lets testing go deeper; e.g. what should be done is testing with a network of several nodes all fragmented with several sets of orthogonal collisions.


I'm not disagreeing that it's a nice, robust, clean test.  What I'm more interested in is a real-world analysis of the attack you described.  I want to know how big of a deal is it, what is its potential effect on the network is vs. its cost to run, and other related data.  I think considering you described the attack these real-world metrics would interest you as well?


I'm also interested in the ""several other ways"" you describe.  I can only think of one, and it involves accidental collisions.  Any references on this?",2016-06-11 11:01:33
d44a4d6,AlLnAtuRalX,10,"&gt; Uh...there is no dispute over whether this is possible. 

Never said there was (even though on some mailing list somewhere there actually was ;)).  


&gt; Your tool also isn't what was asked for: it doesn't find colliding pairs of valid bitcoin transactions. 


My tool is exactly what /u/nullc coded up when he described his attack (actually it's more; his tool only supported Birthday, whereas I support all 3 efficient collision detection strategies, including two that are constant memory).  It can be trivially adapted to generate colliding pairs of valid Bitcoin transactions.  As I said in another comment:



&gt; You can trivially modify to work with Bitcoin transactions by modifying f(x). Particularly, instead of a prefix, you'd have the transaction data as both a prefix and a postfix, and you'd throw your x in wherever you want the nonce to go (in this case a useless output).

&gt; If Peter R. wants to try this on his Unlimited testbench I'd be happy to make the modifications, but I don't want to attempt the attack myself as I'm not running the hardware, making such an attack legally dubious at best.

d446shs,VP_Marketing_Bitcoin,10,"&gt; Just trying to be a pragmatic voice having traded this market since 2013 and witnessed every ""to the moon"" rally up close. There was only one (November 2013, from $200 to $1200) and it came when nobody was expecting it. Now I see a flood of new buyers waiting around to get rich. Not good.

I'd take caution in saying things like ""no one expected it"" in late 2013.  People were generally bullish as hell, far more bullish than anytime sense.  A quick glance through media publications during the run up should tell you enough.  Forget $1.2k.  People thought we were going straight to $10k and never coming back.  The top posts on r/bitcoin quite regularly were all about the price. 

I would argue that the Bitcoin market is *still* afraid as hell of the previous bubble!  What you do see now is a wealth of Ethereum hype, and a surprising volume of discussion around Ethereum as the successor or replacer of Bitcoin.  Of course this discussion is typically found in the Polo troll box or in the mainstream media, not among developers of either platform.

Very recently, The Economist published an article about how this Bitcoin spike (25% maybe?) is likely short-lived, and that the world has been, as they say, ""Etherised"".  The Wall Street Journal said similar, along with many others.  Mike Hearn announced to the world that Bitcoin failed and that he'd dumped his stake.  Viewed as a Bitcoin ""insider"" to many, Hearn told anyone who'd listen to expect an eventual, slow collapse in the Bitcoin exchange price.  This announcement was widely publicized, and many believe it.  

I would argue that there's more new money looking to ""get rich quick"" in Ethereum or The DAO than Bitcoin.  Ethereum just moved something like 1500%; it's the ""hot thing"".  A great majority of the public doesn't understand what Ethereum even is, or why it was designed as it was.  Many more are being told by the media that Bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, dead and that Ethereum will replace it's application as an efficient and scalable ""money"".  They're jumping in today with, arguably, *significantly* more optimism (or temporary delusion) than anyone new jumping into Bitcoin.  Ethereum hasn't had a real bubble burst like Bitcoin did to instill that fear.  Ethereum holders are in heaven, still high as a kite; Bitcoin holders are nervous as hell, awaiting a retrace.  They're so used to it now, and their judgement is influenced by it.  Everyone appears to be awaiting a big dip, or they're stock piling Ether until proven wrong (some leveraged).

Anyone new coming into Bitcoin is probably hoping for a 20% move (lol).  Ethereum buyers are hoping, some expecting, a 1000% move (Bitcoin's market cap, or higher).  Is this actually that irrational?  Bitcoin's market cap is ~$9B; Ethereum's market cap is ~$1B.  If The Economist is right, that's an 800% move to where the successor makes it's pass.  A reasonable mentality for some may likely be...

d44ynk2,VP_Marketing_Bitcoin,61,"The ""Machine Payable Web"".  

This is one killer app that I think is far more probable than most people give credit.  If Balaji is correct, this would create significant, persistent demand for bitcoins.  You could no longer argue that Bitcoin's price theoretically has no ""floor"", or that Bitcoin lacks unique, real-world utility (""intrinsic value"").

This is what many critics still don't understand.  There are, perhaps, 1000s of potential Bitcoin ""killer apps""; the Machine Payable Web is just one.  Many of these (arguably most) have little to do with traditional payment use cases, like online consumer purchases.  In fact, many have nothing at all to do with ""money"".  Statistically speaking, it's highly likely that at least *some* of these will come to fruition in the decades to come, even if the far majority of ideas put forth never materialize.  Each use case that demonstrates real-world utility and matures will ""push"" Bitcoin's price floor higher, given the additional, persistent demand for bitcoins it introduces.  Inevitably, this will have the affect of altering public perception of Bitcoin's ""intrinsic value"", even among the less imaginative and ill-informed.  Take Paul Krugman, for example.  That simple fact might make Bitcoin *more trusted* as a long term store of value.  There's a tipping point where Bitcoin's utility, in the public's eye, becomes better understood and more widely acknowledged.  A clear, albeit overdue, consensus emerges.  This has already happened with the Internet.  It seems reasonable that this shift in perception, and the establishment of such a ""floor"", will have the impact of reducing any remaining fear in Bitcoin as a store of value.

Similar to gold, we might then expect Bitcoin to trade at some multiple of it's ""real demand"" across these various applications.  You'd expect the price floor to move up with time, as more such applications come along, introducing additional, persistent demand, independent of speculation and event-driven ""shocks"". 

As an analogy, it might be helpful to reflect on the Internet and some of it's ""killer apps"".  Many of these applications matured decades apart and many more have yet to come.  A significant portion of those that exist today weren't even possible, either to pursue or even predict, in the earlier days (~1990s).  A few of these killer apps first required the emergence of some other innovation or fundamental shift, like the rise of smartphones, ubiquity of internet access, faster connections, etc.  Think Google Maps, Uber,  Netflix.  Others simply required sufficient *time* for a fundamental shift to occur in certain social attitudes and perceptions.  Think Spotify, Facebook, eHarmony, Airbnb.  

In many important ways, the Internet and Bitcoin are quite similar.  Both are Egalitarian.  Both enable permissionless, open innovation by any network participant, without prejudice or special privilege.  And both are tightly intertwined with very fundamental and interrelated concepts.  At it's core, the Internet was never just about ""web pages"" and ""hyperlinks""

First and foremost, the Internet concerns *information*. Foritcoin concerns *trust*.

Someone could quite reasonably say that BU independently came up with things (though history suggests otherwise), but to claim our work was derivative is really scummy.

&gt; Important to notice is that the attacks nullc explained against xthinblocks with partial hashes is also a viable attack against compact blocks.

This isn't the case.

&gt; When I asked them about their mitigation technique (they used xors on the hash) nullc explained the issue. I then disproved his solution being actually capable of solving the issue at all based on the fact that an xor is many magnitudes cheaper than doing a hash. So a brute force that has to do an extra xor is effectively the same cost as one without. 

This betrays a profound misunderstanding of the basic software engineering / crypto engineering relevant to this system. Nothing about BIP152's protection is related to computational costs. The protection comes from making the reduction to a short ID _keyed_ with a value which is both completely unknown to the attacker and different on every node in the network.

It's starting to become a real problem -- the homes will sit vacant, making the rental market shrink, and the properties won't be taken care of, which can hurt the value of the surrounding properties.  Also, in my personal opinion, I don't think it's such a great municipal policy to be okay with selling residential-zoned real estate out from under our own citizenry.

It allows them to circumvent government policy of limiting transfer of personal capital overseas to ~$50,000 a year, I think the number is.  I sympathize with private citizens who fear the communist government will steal their income -- but I take a dim view of them screwing over our economies in the process, and it is often used as a way to hide shady income streams.

Luxury real estate is also becoming a popular way to launder dirty money, as it is one of the few things where you can hide behind a shell corporation, since there privacy protections for home buyers -- check out the Planet Money podcast episode #703.

**EDIT:** All that said, I have no idea if there's even a single shred of evidence that the Chinese are using Bitcoin to accomplish this.

d45zmb5,WhoIsSuzyCreamcheese,11,"Dude, the reason ancaps are downvoted here are because you're unoriginal.  I read pretty much the same exact claim three days ago in one of the weekly ""I'm an ancap answer my Wikipedia-level understanding of socialism question"" threads.  We get some high school ancap who thinks they must have got the true logical answer every couple days.  People like you are just like the entry-level leftist anarchists who dog every post in /r/Anarcho_Capitalism with posts about building roads.  

Let me just pre-empt every likely response you have: human nature, no market price coordination, property is natural/ voluntary, voluntariness objections in general; then we'll get into the really garbage stuff like the ancap need to define everything and consider that its practical reality, boring references to the failure of Marxist states (we're not Marxists, not that ancaps could tell the difference between a Leninist and a Maoist anyways) and anarchist regions like Catalonia (at least we have literally any historical examples of our ideology in practical realization), insistence on capitalist innovation and progress (even though we're living in a corporatist world), etc.  Maybe some references to the terrible ancap history tradition, where highly aristocratic Ireland, which had a powerful king and legally bound classes, is a libertarian paradise, and the fact that there is no totally central lawgiver means ancient Iceland was a bastion of polycentric law (it wasn't, as literally anyone with qualifications in history can tell you).  I was an ancap for a long time, bud.  It's just silliness.

&gt; Leftist anarchists (more accurately just communists claiming to be non-authoritarian, also called 'libertarian'-socialists, etc.) vehemently oppose anarcho-capitalism because they believe capitalism is authoritarian/hierarchical/oppressive, and they see that we are making solid progress every day to create a free society.

Typical ancap understanding of history. There have only been anarcho-capitalists of any description for 50-60 years, and that's being charitable.  Anti-capitalist anarchism (and individualist anarchism, which is often not pro-socialist but no more is it pro-capitalist, if you read actual anarchist individualists) is coherent for at least 200 years, with very clear precedents going back 300-400.  Anarchism is anti-capitalist.  Period.  Get over it.

&gt; and they see that we are making solid progress every day to create a free society.

I'm genuinely curious - do you believe this?  Where are ancaps, and like specifically ancaps, making any progress at all?  You're an absolutely non-existent movement as far as actual street presence goes - take a look at any European demo and count the piss-yellow flags, for example - and there is not a place in the world where a Libertarian Party is even relevant.  The American party isn't even that fucking relevant, and its the only one that comes even close - Ron Paul drew higher numbers as an independent Rpublican in 2004 and 2008 than any polling numbers Johnson has ever come close to in 2012 or 2016 (and neither of them have ever beat the party's 1992 numbers).  I'm sure you'll insists that innovative capitalism is the cause, but if you think any political, business or social faction gives a single shit about anarcho-capitalism and actually implementing it, you're just completely disconnected from reality.  Not a single one of those Galt's Gulch projects has ever worked - the closest one (Chile) was ultimately a scam and got a few thousand from Wendy McElroy and some other well-knwon libertarians.  The Seasteading Institute literally said they were looking to start buying vessels in 1998, and haven't ever gotten so serious about actually trying anything ever again.  Bitcoin never hit anything even vaguely like popular penetration, and its users and influence have fallen steadily over the past few years, losing out to less private and more easily accessible alternatives.  As I said, I was an ancap for a long time - what wildly unrelated phenomena are being used to support the ideology now?",2016-06-12 23:21:41

d45dmbt,nullc,10,"&gt; Listen to his solution for malaelibility.

What he says is: ""It's just that past block N, if enough nodes agree, then you're not allowing non-canonical formats of transactions. You don't need over 100 lines of code for that.""

This is fractally incorrect.

The now abandoned [BIP-62](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki) introduced the concept of precluding non-canonical forms as a way to deal with malleability.

BIP-62 never purported to solve malleability generally, but only when users intentionally limited themselves to a subset of transaction types: ""The first six and part of the seventh can be fixed by extra consensus rules, but the last two can't. Not being able to fix #7 means that even with these new consensus rules, it will always be possible to create outputs whose spending transactions will all be malleable.""

The BIP, in its last state before being abandoned, proposes 7 new consensus rules. Several of them were quite complex on their own, and collectively they require hundreds of lines of patches to consensus code. Worse, we kept finding more and more cases that had to be handled so except for the narrowest possible class of transaction usage it was difficult to be sure that the malleability was avoided in any particular use-case.

The concern about the size of changes to consensus code is also interesting from the perspective that Bitcoin XT's 'dynamic blocksize hardfork' was about the same amount of consensus code changes as segwit, but doesn't seem to have drawn his complaints.

There is also an important mode of malleability that BIP-62's approach can do nothing for: Co-signer malleability.  This is where you and another party have jointly paid into a 2of2 escrow, if you need payments out of that escrow to be non-malleable then the BIP62 style approach fundamentally cannot provide it. Some multi-transaction protocols, like lightning, can work around this issue but others cannot.

The inclusion of the signatures in the IDs used to reference transactions for later spending is an obvious design mistake that many people have lamented.  BIP-62 attempted to work around the resulting malleability problems with a long list of hacky rules which addressed the matter incompletely and at the cost of considerable complexity (to the point where it was difficult to tell what was malleable and what wasn't). Segwit fixes the design in a clean and compatible way.

And this is the opinion of the very same people who came up with the idea of trying to cut off non-canonical forms as a fix in the first place.

On scaling, Mr. Falkvinge simply asserts that segwit is a bad scaling tool; but doesn't even suggest an alternative.  Since I'm not clueless, I assume he is referring to BIP109 (and the ilk) but these proposals do not improve the scalablity of the Bitcoin system, they simply remove a safety limit without making the system more scalable. Segwit improves the scalablity in real and meaningful ways which reduces the risk of the capacity increases it provides. Among other improvements, segwit allows new sync modes that do not fetch old signatures which will not be validated, it allows more capacity without a commiserate increase in bandwidth to SPV clients and without increasing the worst case increase of the UTXO set size, and it eliminates the quadratic-in-tx-size transaction hashing costs. These changes reduce the potential for harm from increased load on the system.

Later, Mr. Falkvinge states that segwith ""also needs more users to upgrade""-- and this seems perplexing to me, since the filtering transactions by canoncial forms has required _all_ users to upgrade (though I'm not aware of him complaining about that), and segwit has no such requirement-- users can upgrade whenever they want to (or not), and gain advantage of additional capacity (and resulting lower fees) on their own terms.  He also states that hardware must upgrade which is simply untrue, he also advocates hardforks but ignores that generally a hardfork requires a coordinated flag day upgrade from everything that speaks the Bitcoin protocol.

The segment of the interview I watched didn't seem to add anything new to the discussion. Rather, it seems to repeat a number of common misunderstandings from this forum which are at odds with the simple facts of the situation. I think it's unfortunate that Mr. Falkvinge has seen it fit to speak about this issue without making a serious effort to get a complete and equal understanding of the situation. I hope his efforts in the domain of public policy are more wisely handled.",2016-06-12 07:50:42

Having been burned by these types of moves before, I have become much more conservative in my trading. When a market starts going straight up, it is far too risky for me to enter unless I am already in at a much lower price.

Richard Wyckoff taught his students that the most important thing to know about the market is the trend. Trends are borne of sideways trading ranges: periods of relative dullness (where supply and demand are largely equal) that explode into activity when one side gains the upper hand. He was a pioneer in the use of trend lines to measure the angle, or stride at which the trend was moving. They measure the angle at which supply is greater than demand, or vice versa. Future market penetrations of these lines (or failure to) give important clues as to whether the market is near an overbought or oversold condition.

In Wyckoff's own words: ""We consider the market, or a stock, as having developed an overbought condition when, as a result of the too rapid acceleration of a rally or an advance--or because of lack of intervening corrective reactions or resting spells during a prolonged advance--the price reaches a position where it is vulnerable to realizing sales and subject to the danger of a general withdrawal of experienced buyers.""

Conversely: ""We consider the market, or a stock, as having developed an oversold condition when, as a result of its failure to experience normal corrective rallies or adequate resting spells during a down swing--or because of the too rapid acceleration of a reaction or a decline--the price reaches a position where it becomes highly sensitive to short covering and to a general withdrawal of experienced sellers.""

Not luke-jr here and a big block supporter.

Assuming 1 TB costs $20 to store forever, 10k nodes, and 500 Byte transactions. These are conservative assumptions and it is reasonable to use bigger numbers. Each transaction consumes 500 Byte on each full node, forever. There are also other costs like slower lookups, so again, this is only a lower bound.

Using the above numbers, each TX consumes 5 MB across all nodes. 0.000005 TV times $20/TB is 0.01 cent per TX for storage.

I expected it to be way more. However, add to this the traffic cost - each new full node in the future has to download the TX. Traffic prices vary widely, so I'll assume $20/TB again. Assuming a lot of churn (new nodes replacing old nodes) of 10k nodes/year, that's another 0.01 cent per year, ""forever"" until the traffic prices drop so much that it becomes irrelevant. Assuming 10 years for that 0.1 cent.

Keep in mind that if you assume that Bitcoin becomes successful, you'll have more full nodes. Still, even multiplying the above numbers by 10 and multiplying storage cost by 10 again to account for SSDs and long-term cost barely justifies today's tx prices.

I honestly expected this to be way more because block chain data *is* expensive since every node has to store it. It could be argued that the fees should cover this cost to discourage people from causing it, or that it shouldn't because the fees only go to miners while the cost is paid by node operators.",2016-06-13 14:32:30

On scaling, Mr. Falkvinge simply asserts that segwit is a bad scaling tool; but doesn't even suggest an alternative.  Since I'm not clueless, I assume he is referring to BIP109 (and the ilk) but these proposals do not improve the scalablity of the Bitcoin system, they simply remove a safety limit without making the system more scalable. Segwit improves the scalablity in real and meaningful ways which reduces the risk of the capacity increases it provides. Among other improvements, segwit allows new sync modes that do not fetch old signatures which will not be validated, it allows more capacity without a commensurate increase in bandwidth to SPV clients and without increasing the worst case increase of the UTXO set size, and it eliminates the quadratic-in-tx-size transaction hashing costs. These changes reduce the potential for harm from increased load on the system.

Later, Mr. Falkvinge states that segwith ""also needs more users to upgrade""-- and this seems perplexing to me, since the filtering transactions by canoncial forms has required _all_ users to upgrade (though I'm not aware of him complaining about that), and segwit has no such requirement-- users can upgrade whenever they want to (or not), and gain advantage of additional capacity (and resulting lower fees) on their own terms.  He also states that hardware must upgrade which is simply untrue, he also advocates hardforks but ignores that generally a hardfork requires a coordinated flag day upgrade from everything that speaks the Bitcoin protocol.

The segment of the interview I watched didn't seem to add anything new to the discussion. Rather, it seems to repeat a number of common misunderstandings from this forum which are at odds with the simple facts of the situation. I think it's unfortunate that Mr. Falkvinge has seen it fit to speak about this issue without making a serious effort to get a complete and equal understanding of the situation. I hope his efforts in the domain of public policy are more wisely handled.

&gt; Yes, malleability will solve itself sometime in the future.

This sounds like magical thinking. The system doesn't change itself, except via all of our own actions.

&gt; I think this difference between a ""soft"" and a ""hard"" fork is largely an artificial one

The distinction is simple, and perhaps explained with a concrete example:  Right now ~96% of hashpower is targeting a soft-fork that ""Bitcoin Classic"" developers haven't yet caught up with-- BIP-68, initially proposed a year ago, and deployed in Bitcoin Core for a couple months now. Yet Bitcoin Classic continues to work and will continue to work after the activation, the classic developers (against' Core's advice) even thought it was okay to rip out all the warnings about the detected unsupported soft-fork.   Had this change been a hardfork triggered by hashpower at 75% (as classic advocates), all users of classic would be kicked off the blockchain this feature activated on, and exposed to double-spend attacks by slowly mined classic compatible blocks. Users would have to change to different software, or perhaps a hasty and untested upgrade might be pushed out to get it back online.  I think the dozens of people running that implementation-- and other customized versions or infrequently updated forks-- should beg to differ that the distinction is artificial.",2016-06-14 13:34:50

d48eubv,BobAlison,54,"Rick makes the same argument I've heard before. Namely, that Bitcoin's best hope at protecting itself is rapid mass adoption. That way, it can't be regulated out of existence or corrupted.

There are many problems with this idea, not the least of which is that nontechnical people find the responsibility of managing private keys absolutely horrifying, once they understand the great responsibility that comes with the great power.

That's why so many people continue to use exchanges as banks to hold ""their"" bitcoin, despite repeated warnings of the risk they're taking, and overwhelming evidence that this is a bad idea.

And with the centralization pressure this brings, it becomes all too easy to coerce these new bank-like institutions into censoring transactions, instituting black lists, bitlicens-style nonsense, and worse.

In many ways, premature mass adoption is the worst thing that could possibly happen to Bitcoin.

d48m08f,venzen,25,"Good point about mass adoption and the thinking man's conclusion that ensuring as high a degree of decentralization as possible is the primary consideration whenever attempting to improve Bitcoin.

Falkvinge implies that SegWit's primary design objective is to scale Bitcoin, which it is not. Nor are malleability fixes. These are only aspects of a package of related impacts proposed by SegWit: 

1. fraud-proofs and multisig security
2. linear scaling of sighash ops
3. reduced UTXO growth
4. blocksize gains
5. efficiency improvement for nodes and the network
6. [and more described by the Core developers](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)

But let's cut to the quick of what seems to be the underlying assumption driving Falkvinge's criticism: 

Even shallow inquiry reveals that the notion, that *increased adoption must necessarily lead to a proportional increase in price*, is **a fallacy**. The notion seems logical at the initial moment of brain-connect because we sense that its a case of simple supply and demand, yet, surpisingly, markets only tend to bubble during their price discovery phase, and then tend to plateau despite increased adoption and participation. One of the reasons is that **an increase in the number of participants does not only mean an increase in the amount of buyers, but also an increase in the amount of sellers**. Every buyer will, at some point, and for some reason, also sell.

It is evident from posts here and across most media that there is a commonly held misconception that increased adoption will permanently send bitcoin price to $10k and $100k levels. From this perspective, well, of course, then speculators should do everything within their means to encourage increased adoption. Only, the tenet of the belief (that adoption in and of itself ramps price) is neither supported by real world examples nor observed market dynamics. The 2013 bitcoin price rally above $1000, for example, was driven by only a fraction of the number of participants that are evident in the 2015 chart, yet the larger number of participants (adopters) could not get price above $300 for most of 2015. Hence, price rises and falls based on the balance of buyers to sellers and not on how many participants there are in the market. Savvy?

The custodians of Bitcoin, the Core developers, do not have, as a primary objective (or responsibility), the task of increasing adoption and, therefore, price. The Core developers' primary objective is optimization of the **consensus mechanism**, of ensuring **maximum decentralization**, **security**, and *adherence to the whitepaper design*.

If Falkvinge's sole criticism of the excellent SegWit code is that its contribution to scalability does not ramp adoption fast enough, then it is probably because he mistakenly believes - like Andresen and Hearn - that a more aggressive scaling mechanism will ensure more rapid adoption and that the final outcome will be a large and permanent price increase. There are logical fallacies all along that chain of supposed causes and effects. If the hoped-for price increase is to be only temporary, then that is even worse: **roping in new adopters** so aggressive speculation in exchanges will leave them as **bag-holders** at the climax (and logical sell-off conclusion) of the hype.

If Falkvinge's criticism has nothing to do with price but only scaling for the sake of increasing adoption, then, in the end, I agree with [BobAlison](https://www.reddit.com/user/BobAlison)'s comment above: slower adoption equals more security and sure-footed development in the long-run.",2016-06-14 20:42:10

Perhaps it's a comment on the rate of increase-- and I would agree that there is likely a strong socially supportable upper bound on the rate that the price can increase (above which Bitcoin is too obviously redistributive for people to tolerate). But we've been here before, and have the halving. We've also had months of active price suppression via FUD which are clearing up (slowly). I'm not surprised to see the price going up, at least.

Sound financial advice is to have a plan, set in advance, and stick to it. If your plan said sell some Bitcoin at condition X or price Y, great. Otherwise, stay the course. Emotional times such as when there are big price swings are the worst time to be making decisions.

Prudence and planned moves are great. Tweets? That stuff adds churn for no good reason. Caution can also be encouraged by reminding people to not get worked up and to have a plan.

There will be no consequences. Remember that the agreement is binding on miners but not on Core. Greg Maxwell's decisions are binding on the dipshits.

If you break the agreement then Core doesn't have to produce a 2MB hard fork and they can blame you.

If you don't break the agreement, then Core doesn't have to produce a 2MB hard fork and they can laugh at you.

Maybe /u/luke-jr will write a 2MB hard fork pull request and /u/nullc will reject it. Then they can say that they didn't break the agreement, and you will have to keep to the agreement and run whatever code Greg Maxwell tells you to run.

Or maybe you will remember that you were bluffing and would never ever run Bitcoin Classic because you spit on Gavin and would never run Bitcoin Unlimited because you spit on them too. You don't spit on Core. You obey Greg Maxwell.

Greg has given you a ladder that you can use to climb down and save face. SegWit is the 2MB fork. Repeat that phrase and you can stop your futile quest to make bitcoin usable again.",2016-06-15 03:23:28

&gt; My personal belief is that that it is a stroke of genius from the US government:

That's an overly complex plan. If they intend to not pay back their debt, they could just default. What is the rest of the world going to do against a military that's bigger than the next 40 countries combined?

Or if ""defaulting"" is too aggressive, they can inflate their debt away by holding gold. Why bother with bitcoin that may or may not exist 20 years from now?

If their plan was to put all their eggs into bitcoin, they'd have already bought in. The current price clearly indicates they have not bought in. An organization with millions of employees does not just ""quietly accumulate"". Word would get out.

 - It was Russia/China/Iran

But the reality is that the reason people attack the US from seemingly those states is because there's no data sharing. So people who want to attack a US-based system will buy capacity in Russia because they know Russia won't cooperate with a US investigation.   

But the origin of the attacks and the final hop are entirely unrelated. The attacker could be located in the US, Europe, Asia, or anywhere else but still be buying Russian server capacity with bitcoin. So the US claiming Russian/Chinese involvement is technologically ignorant, sure, the final hop is in those countries but those countries didn't attack you.   

As to their claims about how technologically skilled the attack is, in some cases the attacker is skilled, but in some cases they're just trying to cover complete incompetence by making the attacker sound like some TV show evil villain or some foreign army.    

In this context there is little gained from working for a state or foreign intelligence service. You cannot hack better with cash, that isn't how this works, you just need to invest time and have the prerequisite knowledge.   

In this case someone just used an off-the-shelf piece of malware which you can readily buy on Tor black markets, sent an email, and some moron ran it. I hardly think that requires the Russian FSB or whoever the US imagines doing this.

Combined, this means that if we use Xthin with something like Bitcoin Unlimited, then blocks could already be 20 MB.

Classic's 2 MB proposal was a pathetic peace offering after a pathological process which had dragged on for years with toxic Core/Blockstream devs who never even wanted to negotiate in the first place.

Screw that. It's time to move the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) back where it belongs, and start demanding 20 MB blocks now.

128 bits is considered a sufficiently large key for cases where the attacker has to try all 2^128 combinations, as is the case with a secret key. 2^128 is an ridiculously large number, so there's little worry of anyone brute forcing 128 bit keys (the Bitcoin network has done around 2^80 hashes in its entire existence, hundreds of trillions of times less work than brute forcing a 128 bit key).

However certain uses of hash functions are susceptible to the [Birthday attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack) because the attacker only needs to find two messages with the same hash digest - surprisingly a _far_ easier task than a direct brute force. The way the math works means for the same level of brute force security, you need twice as many bits against a birthday attack, which is why you see 256 bit hash functions in systems with 128 bit secret keys.

d4abzr2,Emocmo,22,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Good morning,

The price rebounded on the Coinbase chart, but not on the Averages chart.

On the averages chart we actually reverted to a column of Os.  This indicates that much of the selling was done outside of the USD.  We touched a low of $661.  The return to a column of Xs will happen if we exceed $690 on the Bitcoin Averages Chart.  The formation is only two columns wide, so movements should be pretty moderate.  We would have to drop down to $510 to break down, so I am not thinking that is likely today.  

But, after a long pole warning the low could be 1/2 the height of the pole column.  This column took us from $520 to $710. A drop back down the poles would put the possible drop down to $630.  Because that hasn’t happened yet, I am thinking it probably is not going to happen at this time.  But, I mention it because we must respect the chart and the process.

On Coinbase the chart reversed to a column of Xs yesterday.  This reversal took us as high at $685.  Our new break out point is at $720.  Is this pattern follows the last several it is likely that we will not break out, but rather spend a few days consolidating.  I am not expecting anything to blow up today, unless there are folks trading based on Fed Decisions.  I am pretty sure that group is small.  However, those decisions could lead to further issues with the Yuan.  That seems to be an ongoing discussion.

(As I type this Coinbase went over $690.  So that moves us up one more box)

We reverse on Coinbase at 656, and break down under $640.  

The trend on both charts is in the $470 range.  I am comfortable that barring all out panic somewhere, our trend will remain intact today.

Prediction:  I think we continue to repeat the pattern of the last couple of “pops.”  That would be a decent run up, and the formation of a flag.  Then after a few days, another pop up.

The last two pops were uncharacteristically sharp.  Its been a while since we put several of those together in a row.
Remember 1 week ago, we were trading at $573 for a low.  These “pops” took us to $720.  That is a lot to digest.

Saying ""the mempool"" is inaccurate.  Everyone has a different mempool, and those mempools are of different sizes and have different transactions in them.  If there was a single mempool, we wouldn't need proof of work, mining, blocks... we wouldn't need Bitcoin.

If you run bitcoin, and would like a smaller mempool, you can set it in ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf by adding the line:

maxmempool=2

Then your mempool will never be more then 2 MB.

If instead you would like a multi-gigabyte mempool, that's also possible by setting maxmempool and minrelaytxfee in the config file, and creating millions of 0 fee transactions.

I don't like the idea of a hard fork in general.  But considering the severity of the situation, I'm not sure that the alternative (do nothing) is the best path forward.

Let's think about what would happen if we don't hard fork:

1) We turn our backs on our fellow Ethereum community memebers and do nothing to help them!.   We would first lose 10's of thousands of DAO token holders who would have their ETH stolen be turned off of Ethereum for good.

2) The press and negative PR would be horrible.  ""DAO HACKED. $150Million stolen!"" DAO's unsafe!""

3)  The hacker would run off with 15% of outstanding ETH.  They could dump that on exchanges and price crashes close to $0

4)  We suffer long term loss of confidence in ""Smart Contracts"" from the general public and mainstream media

5) Bitcoin and Rootstock gain hugely being seen as more secure

d4cvumh,ydtm,41,"This is why complexity in cryptocurrency should be avoided like the plague.

In particular, we should **never** add dangerous, unnecessary ""features"" like recursion or Turing completeness to Bitcoin. 

Just **Alice sends Coins to Bob** is a perfectly good system for store-of-value and method-of-payment. 

So many devs want to be ""heros"" by adding lots of fancy shit, but we should politely tell them to go elsewhere to do their tinkering, and leave our Bitcoin alone. 

Also, in general, we should prefer simple solutions (moderate blocksize increases in line with what the physical hardware will support) instead of complicated solutions (SegWit, Lightning Network). I do think SegWit is good, but bigger blocks are simpler, and should be implemented *before* SegWit, because bigger blocks require almost no code changes, whereas SegWit is hundreds of lines of new code in the reference client, plus similar changes to lots of other software as well (eg, wallets).

Finally, hard forks should be preferred over soft forks. With a hard fork, everyone gets notified and has to do a clean upgrade - and a hard fork also allows devs to do a lot of cleanup in the code. With a soft fork, some people upgrade and some people don't, and you end up with a bunch of slightly different versions running on the network, and devs have to go through lots of contortions in the code, which make things messier.

Summary:

- no Turing completeness

- no recursion

- KISS (prioritize bigger blocks over SegWit)

- upgrade via pre-announced, clean hard-forks - not sneaky, messy soft-forks

d4d1v0b,aliensyntax,32,"As Vitalik has explained in a previous talk, Ethereum is politically and technologically decentralized. It is, however, ""logically"" centralized. It is logically centralized because it is engineered to provide universal security standards that protect the network. 

In this case, the language prescribed to encode the contract logic into the network had an unforeseen vulnerability. A vulnerability like that would normally be fixed in future updates. The question is whether or not this a normal situation. 

As we all know, Ethereum is in beta. Mistakes will happen. Bugs will need to be ironed out. There is no debate about that. It's not the responsibility of the community or the Ethereum foundation to protect users from every little mistake that takes place. That is the price of admission for a highly experimental technology. In the grande scheme of things, a handful of users losing all of their holdings is insignificant. It would be an unreasonable burden to have everyone fork the network whenever something bad happens.

That said, I do think it's overly simplistic to assume this is the same kind of situation. What we're talking about is not about a handful of unfortunate users getting burned by a bad contract. What we're talking about is the sheer magnitude of the exploit and people's trust in the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem in this particular context. 

The DAO being drained of its enormous holdings has profoundly negative direct and indirect consequences that affect everyone. Since it affects everyone to a lesser or greater extent a burden of responsibility is placed on the community and the Ethereum foundation to a lesser or greater extent to preserve people's trust in the security and resilience of the network. 

This is part of the implicit social contract as I understand it. 

Basically, this is a social consensus issue that can only be resolved if the foundation and the community are mutually aligned on the solution. The foundation has already taken the first step in proposing the path forward. And in my view, they are doing exactly what is in the greater interest of everyone. It is the correct technical answer to this issue and it doesn't violate decentralization. 

I fully expect the foundation to act this way. They have a leadership role for a reason. We trust them because they know what they're doing. This isn't a game to them. I personally feel perfectly aligned with their plan and I don't own a single DAO token. To me, this is what the Ethereum ecosystem needs. Of course, it's not up to me or the foundation. It's up to everyone to make the right decision. Whether we're merely commenting or actively running a node, we have a voice. That doesn't mean we're a hive mind that will go along with anything the foundation recommends. We have complete autonomy as a whole, so long as we stay in alignment with each other.

I deeply hope we don't turn into the Bitcoin community with pointless in-fighting. I hope we're better than that. There is too much toxicity and divisiveness in cryptoland already. Think about it. We have a unique opportunity to demonstrate our political will in an entirely decentralized manner at this very moment. We can do that if we coordinate with other based on common sense. Not because any one group has an absolute monopoly of control. But simply because there are enough of us to think, stay calm, and act responsibly. ",2016-06-17 23:31:46

Usually people ask me about it, out of politeness and mild curiosity, but last night they asked a ton of follow up questions.  After the game a dealer set up a coinbase wallet on his phone.  He wanted to buy right then (during the game the price had moved up $40), but he couldn't without going through their process which he will do but he wanted in ASAP, so he bought $200 from me (or had me buy for him with my account) on the spot.  He is the third player to buy some for the first time this year.  He asked me to start keeping up with what I would tip him and start tipping him in bitcoin!  Then another player asked a ton of questions and told me that his brother in law told him about it (his in-law uses it to buy drugs).  During the game another player said he lost a friend over not getting into it and talking his friend out of it when it was around $1.50.  Interestingly now it seems ""too high"" for him I guess, because he still doesn't own any.  If people thought in terms of market cap instead of price per coin, you would have to realize on a global level this is totally cheap right now if it is going to be a long term currency of any sort.

d4d16v4,Tulip-Stefan,26,"Etherum is a blockchain, like bitcoin.

Ethereum allows you to create smart contracts. For example, i can create a contract to pay 10 Ether to bob next week, provided that the account balance of Jane is above 100 Ether. The possibilities are large. You can also store data in contracts.

The DAO is a contract on Ethereum that stores tokens across different account holders. For example, I, Bob and Jane are ownership of a contract of value X DAO tokens. If more than half agree, the tokens can be moved to a different contract. It's a bit more complicated than this, but it is supposed to be used for trustless crowdfunding.

The DAO contract contains a flaw in which Ether is spend before the validity conditions of the contract are properly checked. So i can actually extract funds from the contract without Bob and Jane agreeing. This flaw exists entirely because the DAO contract contains bugs and is not a flaw of Ethereum itself.


The crux in this situation is that the developers do not allow users to create new DAO contracts. Instead, you must ask a developer to code review your DAO contract before it can be launched. As it shows, they're unable to review their most important contracts properly.",2016-06-17 23:15:28

d4e6h63,Tvgiafi,33,"Why is the price of eth still so high? The collapse of the DAO and the resulting uncertainty together with loss of confidence should have sent it crashing down much harder. My theories:

- I think a big part of eth holders are also dao investors. This seems obvious with 15% of ether supply being held in that contract. But the ether in the dao is still inaccessible to them, and can't be sold yet. So a lot of etherians can only sit and watch for now.
- A majority of the remaining suppy is held by people involved with the premine. They hold such a large percentage of all the ether that they know they can't sell without completely wiping out the price. They could even have contractual obligations that prevent them from selling before a certain date or something like that.
- Some large investors in eth might be doing damage control right now, propping up the price to retain investor confidence. The supply being held back due to my first two assumptions would make this even easier for them.
- A lot of the inexperienced eth investors are still in denial about the severity of what happened, and they expect everything to go back to normal next week. To the moon!

My suspicion is this will all change very drastically once thr dao holders are able to get their ether out and sell it. That's when the real panic starts and even the moonkids will realize that this isn't just a small bumb in the road.

If it all plays out like this, then not only will a lof the demand from ether find its way back to bitcoin, but the whole narrative will change in favour of bitcoin again. Maybe Fred Ehrsam will even write a new blog post about how Bitcoin isn't so bad after all? Yeah... probably not.

d4f800u,Bitcoin_forever,40,"In few words, here are the steps:  
- Dec 2014 Start pushing all my clients (I am IT freelancer) to pay my services in BTC  
- Jan 2015 my first client pays me in BTC (wallet to wallet)  
- Feb 2015 other clients start paying me through cashila (they send fiat to cashila bank account and I receive BTC)  
- Feb 2015 start convincing my landlord to accept the rent in BTC. He accept it starting with the next month payment  
- Mar 2015 closed all my bank accounts and plastic cards. I still have a residual to pay for car buy credit but that I still pay using a friend: he pays monthly in fiat from his bank account and I give him BTC accordingly. He want to slowly get in Bitcoin train so this is a win-win situation.  
From this moment I live exclusively on BTC, paying directly with my BTC wallet or using cashila/mycelium to pay fiat bills. With patience and dedication I found/convinced online merchants that will accept BTC for my regular shopping. I convinced some other local merchants from my community and now many people here are using BTC. Besides that many people say that they can't find places where to spend their BTC, I have an opposite opinion/experience: there are many merchants that will not announce it with drums and press release, they just accept it. You just have to ask or look closer.  
""The secret"" of large adoption is not mainstream media or gov or big companies that announce that accept BTC. The important thing is to start small, from your local community and go further...  
It is possible to live on BTC but first of all you need to be prepared mentally. Getting rid of fiat is not a easy step, many people can't even imagine a world without fiat. For me is just history.  
Yes many will say that I'm lucky, but I think we all have to look for our ""luck"" and build something around us, in our community and not wait for other to do things for us.

d4f1byn,Regularity_,19,"It's my time to shine! I'm actually about to be a senior, so... more drugs in school! I'll try to keep it less dumb this year.

First thing I did was drinking in school freshman year. That was just dumb. Never got caught for that.

I did a tramadol (150-250 mg) a lot of times in school during my sophomore year, and it was wonderful. I took them all the time in class, and no one would notice. I was taking them in first period once, and my teacher said, ""Come up and get this. Your little snack can wait."" That one scared me a little, but he never found out.

I did (and bought) Adderall a lot of times in school, sophomore and junior year. The guy I know only had extended release, and that shit would keep me up all night sometimes even if I took it at 8:00 in the morning. Coming to school the next day after jerking off all night instead of sleeping was not fun.

My friend got etizolam during the spring of my sophomore year. I blacked out in class. My teacher asked me if I was drunk. I said no and proceeded to sleep through the rest of that class. I'm sure she knew something was up, but she didn't do anything about it. I blacked out another time while taking one of those checkpoint tests that didn't count for anything.

I got most depressed and anxious during the first semester of my junior year, so I started doing all sorts of shit at school. Mainly, this included big doses of Adderall (up to 90 mg XR one day, 60 mg IR another) and getting stoned before school. It was really uncomfortable to be high in school, but it made the day pass faster sometimes, so I did it anyway. Another friend of mine started selling phenibut, so I had some fun with that. I acted pretty crazy (mainly, the filter on what I would say turned off) after taking doses of 2-4 grams. I snorted phenibut (HCl) in class a few times when I believed that it had a much higher bioavalability when snorted (this probably isn't actually true). I also drank energy drinks before school sometimes, but caffeine could do bad things to me in terms of anxiety then.

Junior year, I took etizolam a few times and mostly slept through classes. My friend got us clonazolam in January of this year, each of us having 50 x 0.5 mg pills. I basically got addicted to those. I took relatively reasonable doses in school sometimes, but ended up having to quit when I totally blacked out one afternoon and my parents took me to the hospital. The next day, I had to explain what happened, including all the depression and anxiety shit, and I spent the next week in inpatient. My parents threw out the last 32 clonazolam pills I had.

I got back into clonazolam about a month after that, and my friend got it in liquid. He gave me some in a dropper bottle. It wouldn't come out. I put water into the dropper and squirted it back into my water bottle. I took a sip; half an hour later, I took another; 15 minutes later, blacked out for the rest of the day. I apparently drank the rest at lunch and somehow made it through my last two classes, until the very end of the day. I either walked into a wall or a door, but anyway, my teacher had to take me to the office or something to make sure my mom could take me home. Ugh, I hate just thinking about all of that. Anyway, I got five days of OSS for that.

Since taking the rest of his clonazolam, my friend said he wouldn't touch benzos again. Of course that wasn't true. He ran out of money and bitcoin, so I got him a $50 prepaid debit card to buy bitcoin to get clonazolam. It was my clonazolam, but he was holding onto it because he was the ""responsible"" one between us (we ordered it to another friend's house, and she wouldn't let us get it unless we were safe). So we took it at school for the first three days that we had it (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday). This was very close to the end of the school year. On that Friday, I had slept through my third period class (online class which I had finished) and half of fourth period. I woke up, checked the time, and somehow walked to my fourth period band class from across the school. We weren't doing anything in band, and I didn't even get marked absent for showing up halfway through it. I don't remember a lot of that day.

That weekend, my friend's parents had noticed him acting ""strange"". They had told him to tell them what he was on or that they would take him to the hospital. He confessed and gave them the (MY) clonazolam, which they, of course, threw away. I just... He didn't ask me or tell me that he was taking the clonazolam over the weekend. He just took it as if it were his own, then got caught by his parents, then freaked out as if getting caught by his parents was the end of the world. I mean, it sucks that he was caught, but he could have offered to try to pay me back, or at *least* apologized. That just was not a good situation, and benzos are really horrible for us.

I got kratom at this time as well. I tried it twice in school, and that was just warm and pleasant.

Anyway, now it's summer break. I took most of my kratom to enjoy some social events, but I have two 3.5 g doses left. I'm drinking a lot of coffee to deal with the boredom, and smoking weed late into the night.",2016-06-19 13:01:54

I keep all my bitcoin  offline but keep around 2 BTC on my phone in Breadwallet. Love Breadwallet. The problem is I sent 1BTC and it didn't confirm for half a day. Extremely irritating and embarrassing for me (Breadwallet doesn't let you set a fee). So I had to jump onto a machine that has Electrum  (luckily I keep a few btc in that particular wallet), sent *another* BTC and set the fee ridiculously high.

But I don’t have money to throw around, so on that angle I do sympathize with those who have money in this little hole.

Bottom line (and I only bring it up because you referenced it), things like this and Mt.GOX, and other problems that have and will happen, are directly because these things are still in their (relative) infancy. Money (as ""cash"") has been around for thousands of years and we still have problems with it. Fractional reserve banking has been screwing over the economy, if you see it that way, for hundreds of years, and this new technology has only been tried for a decade or so... welcome to the beta test for the next few hundred years (I hope)... mind the bumps.

As I wrote, I do sympathize with those on the losing side of this, but... I think your counter-arguments miss their mark in a few very critical ways (and refuting my points should only strengthen yours, so have at it!).

1

&gt; What was the original purpose of [smart contracts are immutable and that transactions on the network should be permanent and unchangeable]?

Well, the principal is that smart contracts are immutable and that transactions on the network should be permanent and unchangeable. I think that’s pretty obvious.

&gt; If in the future, a bank wishes to incorporate a public blockchain for storing some of its reserves, which blockchain do you think it would choose? A blockchain that rewards hackers for stealing money, or a blockchain that can retrieve that money and return it to its rightful owner. I think the answer is obvious.

Yes, a bank would not want to use a public blockchain where third-parties can arbitrarily vote/decide that transactions are no longer valid. “Rightful owner” is a perspective and an opinion *at best*. At worst, when you can vote, even among those who maintain the actual network (miners/exchanges/etc), you remove a core principal of financial accounting whereby transactions, once engaged, cannot be undone.

When a bank “returns money” to the “rightful owner,” they are generally using other funds to replace them — i.e. insurance. Things like the FDIC, Lloyds of London, etc, exist to ensure that us average people don’t lose out.

I think a huge lesson here is that there should be some kind of built in “disaster plan” — some kind of insurance fund that would be used to solve this problem. Rolling back the ledger is a poor substitute for proper insurance.

2

&gt; What needs to be remembered here is that any change to Ethereum HAS to have the full backing of the majority of the Ethereum community.

My understanding is that they only need the majority of miners and, if the “open letter” is to be believed, the “hacker” is willing to create a bribe to induce miners to vote their way. In other words, you have two groups of people — the “hacker” and “the DAO investors” — both with mutually exclusive interests attempting to sway the opinion of these people in their direction.

Holy shit, your final remark “MAKE ETHEREUM GREAT AGAIN” is *super* on the mark — this is political.

I cannot fathom an argument where “the code is the contract” should become “the code is the contract unless a very important investor makes a mistake in their contract in which case… etc.”

&gt; Could forking this time lead to a slippery slope where we could end up forking the blockchain for ""bad"" reasons? I think the answer to that is entirely up to the community. 

It shouldn’t be. Ever. That’s kind of the point. It loses its fungibility if, at any moment, the many can act to displace the few. I guess you have to decide if you want pure capitalism and something between that and socialism or communism. I don’t think it’s as extreme as communism, but the idea that the state (Ethereum) should act by consensus instead of by rule of law (res public) is frightening.

If this situation was foreseeable, which either way doesn’t mater, maybe a rule could have been established — maybe a rule *should* be established, to make it clear to all participants what to expect and when changes should happen.

&gt; if Etheruam(sp) goes mainstream, hard forking would be become a much harder thing to do.

Here’s the thing, it shouldn’t be possible at all. Unless the reasons for drastic measures are clearly defined, no one should take something like this seriously (although they might do so regardless).

3.

&gt; First of all, they are not being ""bailed out"" the fork will return to them money that was rightfully theirs from the account of the thief. A ""bail out"" is when the money of a third party (e.g. taxpayers) is used to restore the loss of an individual or an institution. There is quite a difference.

No, you’re bailing them out (i.e. rescuing them from a bad financial transaction) by reverting or otherwise voiding the contract they agreed to. This happens all the time in the real world, but it happens through courts and arbitration between the parties involved. The government and/or banks rarely step in between a contract.

The *real* problem is that the government, in collusion with banks, manipulate the money supply all of the time. If you happen to not know much about fractional reserve banking, and the various levels of M* supply, then seriously look into them. If you *do*, then you should know that the US government has been bailing out the entire economy for *years* by simply printing money and injecting it into the system (okay, okay, they “borrow” it from the Fed — semantics).

Most “first world governments” have inflation *targets* and use various influences to manipulate inflation. There’s a whole rationalization for this, but the net effect is that dollars in your pocket are always getting less valuable.

&gt; Secondly, the idea that we should not retrieve the funds from the thief because investors knew they were ""taking a risk"" is illogical and lacks moral clarity.

But that’s not what happens in the real world. In the real world, we buy insurance as a hedge against risk. Those who sell insurance assume the risk and feast when all is good but starve when disaster strikes. We’ve had forms of insurance for literally *thousands* of years. The more risk adverse you are, the more insurance you buy — it’s that simple.

The argument for the fork asks for all of the rewards of taking risk without any of the, you know… risk.

If you were a Merchant of Venice with valuables bound for Tripolis, and all of your ships run aground or otherwise flounder, should those who invested in your venture simply walk away? Does the government step in and nullify the investment bond? No. You and your insurance (in the case of the play, the now rich young friend who owes you dearly) comes to your aid and *that* is what compensates those who have lost in the investment (and if it’s not good enough for them, apparently you take everything from them and force them to change their religion)… WHATEVER. HORRIBLE ANALOGY, I’m sorry…

&gt; If you open up a shop, and it gets robbed, do you let the thief get away because you ""knew the risk"" when you chose to start a business?

You don’t how that works do you? You should always let them get away. Let the police use evidence to track them down, sure, but if you own a shop, don’t take the personal real risk of injury or death just to recover some money. But as a responsible shop owner, you have insurance that assumed the risk of losing money to a robbery. Your insurance pays you (and yeah, maybe your rate goes up because there is more risk, but that’s kind of the point).

&gt; The point is that investors didn't lose because of ""bad market predictions"", but lost because of a malicious actor who stole their money! 

What’s the difference?

&gt; Which of the following two headlines

Let’s face reality first: you can use language to twist whatever narrative you want. It’s not what gets reported, it’s how it gets reported.

Your first headline is an outright lie. Mt. Gox was a totally different thing and it’s not even clear that Mt. Gox was really hacked. Bitcoin as a whole shrugged it’s shoulders, and hey… did you see how horribly fast they crashed and burned (hint, they didn’t).

&gt; 2) Ethereum community retrieves stolen ""DAO"" funds through blockchain ""hard fork"". All investor funds are safe.

But that’s not what I understand is being proposed. How about this headline:

“Ethereum community reneges on contract; alters blockchain in favour of large investment fund”

Oops. That sounds 10x worse than either of your headlines and is entirely accurate.

&gt; If we are trying to go mainstream, our community should be seen as a positive force that can fix a wrong when it occurs.

I think the real lesson here is that the blockchain should be immutable, but that there is risk in the world. I am fascinated by the experiment being done but the DAO and I would hate to see it die, but I think it just learned a really painful lesson: you don’t trust alpha/beta/pre-release code to the tune of millions of dollars. 

&gt; A hard fork would be the best way forward. I think once we do it, we would be wondering what all the big fuss was about.

Truth is, I think, if it was small enough and still beta enough, this would be an easy sell. But it’s worth enough, I think, that it’s too big to fork.

But hey, I’m not rich enough to lose out. :/",2016-06-20 02:06:36

This vocal minority is largely composed of libertarian radicals, short traders, Bitcoin trolls, etc. Their presence has never been as strong as it has been in the past days. I've followed the Ethereum community very closely and I've never seen this kind of immaturity, rage, and all around disrespectful and toxic behavior.

d4fncfr,somethinghorrible,11,"&gt; I was asking what the purpose was. the word is ""purpose"".

I'll agree that it's kind of disingenuous to throw back, verbatim, the stated purpose. I think what you're asking for is intent (because they stated the purpose on the websites), but that's all word play.

&gt; Every blockchain has the ability to be forked. The majority will always have the ability to decide what is the ""true"" network for any decentralized network the exists. 

True. But then you have Ethereum and New Ethereum, and now you have miners on one side and on the other. You've fractured the network because of one bad case. Those on either side hope their side gets the most support, because otherwise they lose out entirely.

I think what's really important, if a fork is the consensus, is to very carefully establish the criteria for such an action. It can't be arbitrary and, I fear for stability if it's merely by consensus and not by some clear established rule or policy.

&gt; It's funny how anti-forkers say that forking will turn Ethereum into a network where transactions will be ""arbitrarily"" reversed for ""arbitrarily"" reasons.

The soft-fork is worse than a hard-fork. They're trying to establish that the community (of miners) can at any time decide that any transaction they don't like will be frozen and locked out. That, to me, sounds like a pretty dangerous feature.

&gt; Hard forking the blockchain is not an easy task as you can see. Transactions can only change if the change is in line with the values of the community.

Here's where I'm a bit lost on the technical side: I get how the soft-fork works -- dropping/ignoring any block that reduces the value of this ""bad"" transaction. But how does the hard-fork work, with the promise of restoring Eth to the original participants/wallets without affecting the rest of the network?

Is it inserting a new transaction that routes the Eth accordingly and then, because the majority of miners agree, then it's accepted as a valid part of the blockchain?

Or will the record be modified?

I'll go reading after I post this, so feel free to call out my ignorance here.

&gt; How can the hacker bribe the miners if his funds are still locked in the child DAO?

Bitcoin -&gt; Eth, Eth that they may already own, Eth transactions that are only valid if the blockchain is not forked. Seems pretty reasonable to me, but I defer on any technical mertis that trump my understanding.

&gt; Will it is, and this IS pure capitalism because nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to use Blockchain Technology.

Yes, but once you're a member of the community, if the community can alter your transactions because they dislike the nature of them... well... Eh...

I think we can all agree that the ""hacker,"" had they proved this on the test network and secretly revealed/fixed the bug ahead of time, then they would be lauded as someone who really stood up and did the right thing.

But we can all agree that exploiting weak parts of a contract, even in the ""real world"" is a shitty thing to do. The problem, I feel, is that the community, without clear rules or policies (when you toss out the ""code is the contract is the code"" policy), get to act as judge, jury, and executioner. I think it's obvious that people who are invested are going to act in their own self interest, it's just a matter if they're considering their own short-term interest against a long term one.

I think it's silly to assume that miners are *not* invested in Eth. That means they have a real stake in the outcome of all this. If the validity of a block in the chain can be voted on by those who control the chain, well... good luck with that. Seriously.

Banks don't get to vote amongst themselves if, for example, someone passes an invalid cheque. It's why there's a clearing period -- to allow the receiving bank to return the cheque and for the originating bank time to either clear or repudiate it.

Here, it seems, in the Ethereum network, there is no repudiation against bad transactions. Miners may be given a choice to repudiate by consensus, which just feels so wrong by me. It opens a huge can of worms that, to me, changes the nature of things. But I can see why someone might disagree with that.

&gt; As for this specific case, I think it is quite reasonable considering the early experimental stage we are at and the fact that investors have lost over 40 MILLION DOLLARS (how many times will to need to repeat that??).

I think the larger the sum is then the more careful and precise the approach must be.

I find it disingenuous to cry ""experimental stage"" and then fawn over the size of the loss. There was $40,000,000 worth of some asset entirely in non-cold-storage? That, to me, signals a degree of trust in the protocol. Say those two things together: ""Trust,"" and ""Experimental Stage"". Hmm...

That sounds like the leadership of the DAO needs to get their PR machine cranking. 

But no, the ""protocol"" didn't break. The instructions that were encoded, however, were obviously flawed. But, as their website *still* states: ""existing simultaneously nowhere and everywhere and operating solely with the steadfast iron will of immutable code.""

Maybe they should add in the term: ""tested and proven"" to their mission statement, I dunno.

I think we can agree that contracts need more provability and transparency (source code is not in the blockchain?). Is this a case of a contract being written in Latin whilst the general population reads English? I wouldn't agree to a contract I couldn't read, and that's part of the problem I see here.

&gt; Last time I checked we also try to get back what was stolen whenever there is a robbery.

No, law enforcement does that. If they get anything back, it will likely go to your insurer who compensated you for your loss. We don't all jump in a time machine and alter the past, but that's just for giggles.

Yes we should *remove* bad actors from urinating in the pool (as in, the real world, we remove bad actors into a place called ""jail"" where they are supposed to sit and think about their actions). And maybe a little chlorine, in the way of a hard fork, is necessary. But you're still polluting the water, one way or another.

A problem with anonymous decentralization is also a lack of trust in other actors. Honest Q: how much should you trust other people when they are entirely unknown to you? I really don't know how to think about that problem.

&gt; I think my headlines were more realistic than yours, but that's another discussion.

It's a fair headline. But as I wrote, it's not *what* gets reported, it's *how* (and, I will add, by *whom*).

&gt; Blockchains can't be completely immutable and they shouldn't be because of updates, bugs, DAO's etc.

Ack, I made a typo. I had intended: ""I think the real lesson here is *not* that the blockchain should be immutable, but that there is risk in the world.""

As in - I don't think we've come to an agreement on the immutability of the blockchain, however I think we should be able to agree that tossing $40,000,000+ into an automated contract in its infancy, may have been a bit overzealous and risky. *That* is a discussion for the DAO and it's members to resolve, however.

CSV allows some of the same capabilities of a defunct Bitcoin feature called ""replacement,"" which was designed to allow the terms of a contract to be updated before confirmation.

But this is about what we want this platform to be.   It was billed as a decentralized contract system, the advantage being that you can build robust contracts that can't be broken, that don't need courts to decide the validity of, which can be used by anyone in the world.

I live in Japan and had not had issues with withdrawal from MtGox.   Their explanations of the problems made sense.  But at the end of the day I took a calculated risk and lost money.   I remember longing for some kind of bailout.   Maybe Satoshi himself would come and save the day.   But that was a fantasy.   The reality was I took a risk, I lost, I moved on, its well in the past.   The Dao holders should do the same.

Central planners influencing the PoW constituents to overturn specific contracts is a huge moral hazard.   I'm very disappointed that people are buying into this idea.   Its completely unfair, surely there have been, and will be further losses from other contracts, and likely they will not benefit from a fork.

Also, (if) it's even possible in their system shows that it's a failure at being in interesting cryptocurrency at all. That not only is it a bad idea, it shows they Just Don't Get It, or do and don't care.

I would mostly be indifferent-- Ethereum does a lot of really ill-advised things in my opinion (including the bad smart contracting design that basically guarantees this sort of mistake will be made often), but that is their own business. Unfortunately, much of the public conflates these systems as equals, and so I can envision my future for the next several years working to undo the damage done by that competing systems imprudence, hilightning that Bitcoin is a different system which would not behave in the same way.

Some people argued that would /never/ happen, even if hardforks were easy and frequent events.

1) Why is BFX reliant on the datacentre switching for internal comms? I'd understand if you were going offline because your inbound is broken but by the looks of it this looks like internal LAN traffic is unstable which leads me to ask;
1a) Why are you using a switching interconnect you are not in control of?
1b) What measures are you taking to alleviate non-Bitfinex actors intercepting or otherwise ""screwing with"" your internal network traffic?

**Confirmed by BFX** internal switching does not appear to be in their control, from twitter:
&gt;1) Internal networking issues between our servers seem fixed allowing us to reliably run our backend and trading engine.

/u/zanetackett Could you please clarify?

2) For those with margin positions, you have now been down 3hours with no ETA. In that time BTC has gone down 1.5%. LTC has gone down 10%. ETH up 5%.
2a) ETH shorters are now ~$200K in the hole in a market which can barely handle that sort of liquidity.
2b) BTC/LTC longs are between $570K (1.5% of USD borrowed) to ~3.5mil (10% of USD borrowed) in the hole. What is Bitfinex plan for those ""caught in the crossfire"" after your ""close monitoring"" didn't work out so great?

3) What is your DR plan? Clearly your datacentre has issues. Clearly you are managing millions in liquidity. If you were a bank it would be a mandatory requirement to have a clear DR plan and a defined set of recovery timelines. What is your RPO and RTO? That's a somewhat rhetorical question since your terms essentially say ""not our problem"" but honestly, if the ""leading bitcoin exchange"" doesn't have an effective DR plan then all this talk about Bitcoin ""growing up"" is nonsensical.

d4hnzaw,throckmortonsign,19,"You know, CSW included this article in his press kit given to the economist. They even attribute the paper to him (link  http://www.economist.com/news/briefings/21698061-craig-steven-wright-claims-be-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin ): 
&gt; In an article in the press kit accompanying the publication of his blog post, he takes aim at Gregory Maxwell, one of the leading bitcoin developers, who first claimed that the cryptographic keys in Mr Wright’s leaked documents were backdated. **“Even experts have agendas,” he writes, “and the only means to ensure that trust is valid is to hold experts to a greater level of scrutiny.”**

This phrase appears exactly the same in the article published.

The scribd document was published somewhere around March 30th-31st. At the same time a number of accounts were registered on reddit.

* /u/Praxis_
* /u/logicgates1
* /u/surpr1ze00
* /u/bitc01ner

All of these accounts were created within a day of each other (March 30-31st). The first one is the first mention I can find of the paper. All the other accounts discuss the paper or attack Greg.

So what's more likely:

* A person, a conman, uses the exact list that is used in the current **default** to produce a backdated key with the intent to defraud people. When someone figures out that this wasn't the default list at the time the key was purportedly produced, he writes or commissions someone to write a long paper to explain the discrepancy away.
* A person, in 2008, produces 2 keys that are created within a day of each other. One of which uses the prior default settings and another which uses a future default of the software (which the developers of the GPG software hadn't even picked yet). Then he only publishes the latter key widely including on the bitcoin.org and a number of other locations, but leaves the supposedly more secure key unpublished. He then can't sign with the less secure key due to not having access to it for some reason so he uses the other key (produced at nearly the same time) which he somehow has access to. Then Greg Maxwell points out the key (which no one has ever cited before) appears to be backdated based on the cipher suite used. Thankfully, some anonymous do-gooders take it upon themselves to write a 19 page paper explaining how there is a way to produce a key by changing the defaults (which Greg already pointed out in his original post).

It's obvious to anyone with a modicum of sense and has used GPG that the key is backdated. It's beyond a shadow of a doubt.",2016-06-21 14:36:34

d4hhr7k,Shmullus_Zimmerman,18,"I have a small amount of ETH just to play with the platform. 

Anyway, I've been over on the ETH redit today trying to get these guys to see that the moral hazard introduced with a fork to reallocate funds is beyond insanity.   

They're currently working on convincing themselves that the possibility of a 51% attack means that the system was designed to have a mass hysteria / sympathy induced fork to blacklist/lock up tokens, to reallocate transaction outputs, and to change the rules of the entire system.   

One yahoo is even suggesting that the fork should adopt a universal functionality allowing, as to all future contracts, and on the request of any ETH holder, and 51% vote, the substitution of any existing ETH smart contract with the 51% group's designated replacement code.    (My comment in that thread is that if they're going to do that, they should change the name of the ETH programming language from 'Solidity' to 'Tentatively.')

A couple  things come to mind as the ETH mess relates to bitcoin:

First, IF a fundamentals breaking fork DOES occur at ETH, I think it means we at bitcoin have to take a much closer look at our assumptions about miner collusion and 51 percent attacks, particularly as that topic relates to miner centralization and concentration.   The assumption has always been that miners won't do anything to damage the long term concepts of the currency, but if a fork happens in ETH that assumption will be disproven:  It will show the miners can be caught up in a hysteria type of situation and act against self interest where the pressure for such benevolence is high enough.   

Second, I believe the research that is going on now in terms of confidential transactions should be bumped in priority.   If a 'blacklisting' fork occurs in ETH, then we should be sure that BTC is not even susceptible to such nonsense.   I speak not merely of resisting the precedent but completely negating it.

d4h5cio,ivanraszl,18,"Roger is right. I've read every pro and contra argument for months now. And I went back and force on my position. The only reason I'm not a 'big blocker', is because I want to trust the professional integrity of Core. However the arguments for small blocks are weak.

I buy the argument that hard forking could create a bad precedent where majority miners with the help of Core devs can start modifying the code to fit their needs.

But, this benefit is offset by a huge downside. It's inconceivable that we will never want or need to improve the Bitcoin code with a hard fork. We can't do every improvement in the future with hacks and soft forks. This would slow development, create unnecessarily complex code that is hard to review, and much code debt over time. Such complex code will make it prohibitively hard for new developers to join the project in a meaningful way. This process will result in the reduction of decentralization of Bitcoin.

This process cements the position of the Core team more, because they will be the only few people on Earth who understand the code. The community will suffer from a sort of economic Stockholm syndrome, the same way how many people 'trust' the government because they don't understand it fully, and they are at its mercy.

I also buy the argument that the blocks are only full when there is 'spam'.

But, even if the blocks are not yet full, they are getting full naturally because of real use. Even if one raises the fees to resolve the confirmation delays, at one point certain users who can't afford higher fees will be priced out of the network. This will limit the number of users who can use Bitcoin, thus the potentially possible network effects will not be realized, and the value of Bitcoin as a network and as a currency will stay below its potential.

The argument that bigger blocks reduce decentralization is not straightforward. The reduction of nodes because of faster growing blockchain will likely be offset by new users who will want to use (not priced out) Bitcoin because of the bigger blocks. There are already services that allow you send money from USA to Bangladesh for a few dollars. Bitcoin is still competitive and will be a better option for these purposes as long as the fees are well below a dollar, especially for small amounts. We already priced out people and systems who want to send amounts below a dollar. It is likely bigger blocks will increase node count, not reduce because Bitcoin becomes bigger and more relevant in more areas of life.

Sidechains are a solution, but even if we create sidechain solutions to increase the capacity we still need bigger blocks to accommodate the opening and closing of channels, not to mention the many other services that also build on top of Bitcoin, like immutable registries, etc.

Also, it's not clear how effective sidechains will be to replace on-chain transactions. If people really wanted to send 'Bitcoin' over sidechains they can sort of simulate that already by both of them creating a Coinbase account and sending the Bitcoins within Coinbase. Granted they have to trust Coinbase, but even with LN they will have to trust the operator of the channel to a certain extent.

Miners even in China clearly indicated that larger blocks (up to 10MB) won't affect their operation negatively. And with every month bandwidth is less of a risk as internet connectivity is improving everywhere at a rapid pace. Having more users and collecting more fees would be a benefit for them, because it solidifies their customer base for a longer time.

Finally, even though I have tremendous respect for the Core's work, I can't shake the feeling that there is an undeniable conflict of interest in the system. Blockstream (BS) and Core share a big number of developers. BS has a higher chance of success if people use the Lightning Network (LN) developed by BS. People are more likely to use LN if Bitcoin on-chain transactions do not work reliably anymore because of capacity issues. Thus, there is a clear incentive for BS to keep Bitcoin's on-chain capacity small to create demand for LN and consequently make BS' success more likely.

I could be wrong on all these points. Regardless, I'm positive Bitcoin will overcome any issues that lie ahead as the community is strong and smart. Together we can tackle any issue on the long term.",2016-06-21 06:08:31
d4j2lf9,nullc,88,"The best way to be vulnerable is to be too sure that it couldn't happen here. We have to have a clear continued commitment to being clear about and upholding the values that make Bitcoin valuable in the first place.

It's not a question of exposure, many well known figures in Bitcoin have been exposed when various services lost funds. You didn't see any of them advocating these sorts of moves one of the reasons is that people were clear about what made Bitcoin valuable long before it had a market price. But this commitment has to be continually renewed through or words and actions, by how we communicate about Bitcoin to others and in how we use the system. The community changes over time and the purpose of Bitcoin can change with it.

All of this is a question having the option to chose a money which is primarily autonomous, self determined, and following clear dependable rules, for better or worse, rather than a money which primarily politically governed and may be more convenient at times but is fundamentally less trustworthy.

A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. It's time we had the same thing for money.

Bitcoin has a community of users, developers, supporters, that existed before there was a meaningful market price, who came here for for reasons like the above. No user of ethereum came to the system before it had a price, as ethereum was premined and sold before it event existed-- that doesn't mean that none are principled (or even that most aren't) but the dynamics are different. If we don't remember and don't prioritize accordingly-- if we shy away from the values that make Bitcoin valuable in the long term for short term reasons as we chase new audiences and wider adoption-- the Bitcoin community could lose sight just as well.",2016-06-22 15:09:32

Not to mention that there are plenty of plays to make on relatively illiquid exchanges, like putting orders on the book to catch spikes and paying low or no fees as a maker. In short, *be the liquidity you want to see*.

You know what the worst part of all this is? Giancarlo Devasini, Raphael Nicolle, Phil Potter, and the rest of the merry gang at Bitfinex are laughing all the way to the bank while the market licks its wounds. Even Zane Tackett will probably get a little bonus (or at least a beer and a day off) for the admirable job he did at putting condiments on a shit sandwich. Why? Putting aside all the conspiracy theories on insider trading, etc. (which I personally think are unlikely), just look at the insane volume on Bitfinex since they went back up -- the fees they raked in almost undoubtedly more than made up for their hours of downtime.

So, it'll be business as usual for Bitfinex moving forward...without so much as a ""sorry for your loss"" from them to their own customers or the rest of the market. Is this really the sort of exchange you want to give your business to?",2016-06-22 08:08:59

Etherium is another cryptocurrecy that uses it's own blockchain. It is different from BTC in that you can put code into it's blockchain and the code will be run. The code is called a 'smart contract'. Somebody created a huge smart contract called TheDAO which allowed investors to crowdfund TheDAO and then vote on which startups to invest the fund into. TheDAO raised 150 000 000 USD worth of ETH very quickly. But just yesterday, somebody found a flaw in the code of TheDAO's smart contract which allowed them to move about 50 000 000 USD worth of ETH from TheDAO's main fund into an address that they control. So they ""stole"" a bunch of money from the investors of the DAO (there are about 25 000 of them). But it isn't really ""stealing"" because he simply exploited a flaw in the code and the investors knew the risks before they put money into it.

Now there is a discussion happening about how to respond to this. They can either A) Do nothing and let this guy walk with 50 mill or B) Get the majority of ETH miners to agree to fork the ETH blockchain, effectively erasing the transaction where this guy took the funds, then return all ETH to DAO investors and disband the fund.

Option B would be bad for Ethereum's and crypto's reputation overall because it sets a precedent that a few leaders can undo transactions in an apparently decentralized network if they don't like them.

If this is the case it makes it rather trivial for the opposing army to come in, gain trust, and then yell loud enough for the army to retreat.

d4k8hj3,el33th4xor,56,"Hi there,

I'm the professor to whom you said ""grow the fuck up,"" because I called for the community to censure the people who got us into this mess. I have seen your reddit comments on this board before, and they are remarkably on point, except this one. So let me fill in the backstory of how we got to the point where we are at, and why this comment is uncharacteristically way off base.

You will recall that Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir and I were originally very concerned about attacks on The DAO. Our paper named at least nine different attacks, and called for a moratorium until at least the most egregious ones could be fixed. We did not know at that time that a hacker would come along and use some of the vulnerabilities we identified, as well as others we had not foreseen. I worked around the clock to get our cautionary paper out. This required actual, tangible, personal sacrifice. But I felt compelled, because I could see that the DAO code was not where it needed to be, and that a DAO failure could be catastrophic not just for the DAO, but for eth, and maybe for cryptocurrencies or the idea of smart contracts. 

Yet when we disclosed these vulnerabilities, we faced immediate abuse from the SlockIt team. Stephan Tual posted that we were seeking attention, and Griff was abusive on two different occasions on a Skype channel. For reasons I don't understand, perhaps because I'm an academic and Stephan thinks I am an outsider (which is incorrect, we have been involved in eth before its official inception), the abuse has been specifically targeted towards me. 

I ignored this initial abuse because I happen to like Vitalik, Vlad, the rest of the Ethereum gang and care for Ethereum as a project. But after the hack occurred, Griff and Stephan went from just being abusive into defamatory accusations that are beyond the pale. I had had an internal conversation with a student where we had discussed the possibility of a reentrancy attack, and we wrongly concluded that splitDAO was not vulnerable (we were not alone in this: Stephan wrote at the time that the DAO was not vulnerable to reentrancy bugs). In the private channel where we were discussing how to respond to the hack, Stephan and Griff accused me of knowing but not disclosing the bug. This escalated to accusations that **I was the DAO hacker**. Griff tried to boot me off of the channel, despite everything I had done to help. Christoph would apologize to me in private email, but Griff, who reports to him, was continually abusive. Some of you may have seen Vitalik's open support for researchers -- this was a direct reaction to the unprofessional conduct at SlockIt. Let me repeat: **I worked hard to help them and the community, and they responded by accusing me of a felony.**

I don't care about the straight up libel. What irks me is the SlockIt team's general assumption that I, and my colleagues, should work for free to fix their mistakes, that we are responsible and accountable to them even though we never performed an official review, and that, in general, the entire community owes it to the SlockIt team to make their project a financial success for them. 

You can all see where we are today. The SEC is most definitely going to be taking a closer look at smart contracts, the DAO hacker is still not fully contained, Ethereum is in the headlines, but for the wrong reasons. I am still very optimistic about eth's future, but what the SlockIt team put all of us through in their greed is unconscionable. 

It's in this context that I made the case to excise the bad code out of the blockchain, and to excise the bad apples from the community. Specifically, I mentioned Stephan and Griff, not Christoph -- I believe the article gets it wrong, or if I said Christoph at the talk, I misspoke. 

Currently, the offer on the table for people like Stephan is: ""**heads I win, tails the community loses.**"" He can overhype any broken product; he captures the upside if it works, and if it breaks, he gets a bailout. Faced with these odds, any rational person would come back again and again to the same trough and see what he can take away from the generous community. 

When an athlete is caught cheating in an event, we do not take away just the medal from that event. If we did, a cheater would have a positive expectation to win: if you get caught, you lose nothing, and with some probability, you make it big. This is why every professional society, from cyclists to bankers, places sanctions in place for actors who bring the bad kind of attention to that area. Doping cyclists don't just lose one single medal at the event in which they doped, they get a ban to think over what they did wrong.

In many cases, that timeout is sorely needed: entitled people who believe that an entire community will hard fork the blockchain to make up for their mistakes as if this is a trivial thing, that experts to whom they have shown no respect will somehow work for free for them, need some time to get a bit of perspective before they collect more cash from the community with their next gig. 

So I stand by my decentralized, open call: in the Bitcoin world, we have seen the same actors come back repeatedly with scam variants. Unless we put some social measures in place, people can abuse a community repeatedly until they strike it rich. I think it's a proportionate and reasonable reaction to give people, who have caused this much heartache for this many people, some time to think over what happened.

I saw this thread very late, so my response will not be seen by anyone, but regardless, I hope this clarifies my position. If you disagree, you are welcome to put your life savings in Stephan Tual's next gig. ",2016-06-23 10:39:12

d4kjv4h,CJentzsch,47,"As outlined in my recent post (https://blog.slock.it/what-the-fork-really-means-6fe573ac31dd#.v62yc1l8p), I am in favour of a hard fork.
Of course my opinion is biased, but nevertheless, I want to make an important non-technical but social argument.

Imagine the Ethereum dream come true and we have decentralized ""banks"", insurances, notary services ... in 10-20 years. What if there is a fundamental flaw in the ""banking dapp"" or one other system critical dapps out there. Do we want to let the system run and the world burn down, because the machine has said so, or do we want to intervene as humans to correct it so it works as intended again.
I think the world will trust this system much more, when it knows that humans can fix things. I actually think the hard fork is not only important for the DAO token holders, but actually to show the world what consensus means on a blockchain. Not tyranny of the machines, but the voice of the people.

Also people need to learn what a hard fork in Ethereum actually means. Since we are dealing with accounts and not UTXOs (as in bitcoin), hard fork does not mean to do a rollback of blocks and transactions, it *only* touches the flawed code, everything else will continue as usual. Except for an update of the clients, nothing needs to be done, exchanges and other services using Ethereum can just continue without break. Technically the hard fork is far less scary and ""hard"" than many think.",2016-06-23 17:13:34

d4ji72m,tsontar,36,"The cost of mining has nothing to do with the number of transactions that can be sent over the network. The two issues are mostly orthogonal.

The cost of mining is proportional to the ""value of security"" afforded to the network.

As an example, in the early days of Bitcoin it was possible to attack the network with bloated blocks. By creating a giant block, a miner could make other miners choke when trying to validate the giant block. Meanwhile the attacker could go on mining. (As a result of this attack the network adopted a hastily-coded and not well thought out block size limit that is the reason for the problem you're asking about, but that's a different post.)

The reason the attack was even practical in the first place is because it cost practically nothing to mine, and it also cost almost nothing to mine a block that the rest of the network might reject. So it didn't cost much at all to crank out attack blocks: the mining was cheap and if your block for rejected you lost $5 or whatever in block rewards.

Today a similar attack if unsuccessful would cost a miner something like $20K in power, overhead, and lost rewards. That's a huge cost to attack, which means the network is more secure.",2016-06-23 00:58:29

New version 1.1.0

The choice for this number has been discussed and this seems the most
practical by far.
At first we wanted to follow the Core releases, but they have different
core-values and push out hundreds of lines of new code in a bugfix release
which feels dirty to have to inherit.  The result of that is that this
feature release with the soft fork code from Bitcoin Core has received
a bigger feature bumb.  And when that disconnect between versions started
it also stopped making sense to stay close to versioning of Core.
It was time to review the numbering scheme altogether.

Using a less than 1.0 version was a practice that open source has used
for many years. A result of the ""Release early, release often"" stance.
If memory serves me well, when I talked about this over beers with
Erik S Raymond he explained it such;
The idea was that when the app reaches the set of features required
for the user with the lowest demands to use it for its intended usage,
thats when you call it 1.0.

Bottom line, Bitcoin is certainly far past its 1.0 release, so I marked
the first Classic release as 1.0 and then this release is Classic 1.1.0",2016-06-23 00:21:52

Let's be clear, paypal will NEVER integrate payments with BTC because will be a nonsense. Why should I move my BTC to a paypal account and pay fees and get funds seized, when I just have to use my BTC wallet.  
Remember WHY Bitcoin take over back in 2010?! I think everybody forget that important thing: Wikileaks get paypal and VISA account blocked so they started to accept BTC!

E.g. the contract starts off with some state committed to in the scriptpubkey defining it, and if it intends to persist, it requires the spending transaction produce an output with a copy of the contract and a commitment to the new state.  Somewhat like a monad-- it makes the state very explicit.  And also lets you do things like optionally keep contract state out of the blockchain, and keep only commitments to it there..

d4lhmet,BobAlison,38,"&gt; Freezing funds has already opened a Pandora’s Box - what is Vitalik going to say to the friendly FBI agent at the door, asking for help with a big hack on an exchange?

Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation have deliberately and conspicuously placed themselves at the head of a large financial system. As it gains traction, this system will be used increasingly to issue what looks like securities, transfer what looks like drug money, or secure what looks like stolen property.

These are all problems for Bitcoin as well. But as we've seen, the lack of a clear top-down organizational system has made it nearly impossible to do anything but work at the periphery. Ethereum is providing ever more leverage for law enforcement and investigators to move much closer to the protocol itself.

Governance may be the single trickiest issue in cryptocurrency. Gavin and others repeatedly argued that Bitcoin needs a strong leader. Now that the Ethereum Foundation has set the wheels in motion toward exactly that end, we will all have a chance to see what it leads to.

d4lb832,Duanenielsen,28,"If anyone could pull out of any contract because they didn't understand it, then what does it mean to enter into a ""contract""?  This is not some abstract concept, this forms the very basis of a society of laws.

The reality is, there is not ""forgive and forget, and let's move on"" in any financial contract you will ever enter into.  Yes, people sign contracts they don't understand.  No, ignorance of the contract terms is not a viable defense in any court in any land.  A poorly written contract, that allows a third party to come and take your money, is just a poor contract.  Likewise with the DAO.

Hard forking, is the equivalent of going to the government and saying, because I didn't like that contract we all signed, lets go and change the laws, and lets make those laws retroactive.  This pulls into focus 2 issues.

1.  Who is the government in the case?  Are ""Vitalik, Vlad and the other devs"" suddenly, Judge, Jury, and Executioner?  If so, does that mean Ethereum is now a centralized system?  If it is, then what does that mean for those holding ETH as opposed to say Bitcoin?

2.  Retroactive laws in real life are generally recognized as not being a good idea, as there are all kinds of scary side effects.  For example, I could make owning a dog illegal, then retroactively charge everyone that owns a dog with a crime.  You see the moral hazard there?

I view my DAO investment as an investment into an experiment.  

I'm against hard fork, because I believe that if failure does not have consequences, then people will not truly learn.  The writer of the DAO made a mistake, the investors into the DAO made a mistake.  If we say ""hey Vitalik, buddy, bail us out here"", what did we learn?  We learned that Vitalik will bail us out, so as long as we invest in the same as him, then we can invest with less risk.  Likewise, don't invest in anything Vitalik is not in, because he probably won't hard fork stuff he's not invested in.

If instead we conclude, the DAO failed and we failed.  Then the real issues come into focus... What can we do to make DAO's secure?  Now we can create a strong incentive for everybody to compete to create a DAO that is both secure against malicious attack, and functional, instead of relying on the whims of the platform developer.",2016-06-24 05:47:01

This is supposed to be a trading forum but for the last few weeks, it has been serving as effectively a sentiment indicator for contrarian trading. It has been a mess of moon, $10, panic and euphoria.

Do not play with more than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin may make you successful but you are not going to be a millionaire in 2017 with the 20 bitcoins you bought today. And pay off your credit debts. Compounding interest works both ways!

To give a personal example - I sold at 790 bfx and had fiat-btc buys placed from 730-650. Panicked and loaded up at 701. Went margin short at 730 with a close out price of 601. Panicked again and closed the short at 690 after the trading halt ended and went long at 700 ....Obviously got halted again so my stop was skipped but been holding that but I have always kept emergency stashes to reduce liquidation price or a plan to sell some of my position as we violated certain levels and got closer to my liquidation. Long story short, panic caused me to lose out on profits but planning will prevent me from getting stopped out and losing everything.

d4ndt10,slvbtc,23,"Why would I pay 10 cents every time I took money from my bed side table and moved it to my wallet.. or when my wife gives me change to buy groceries.. or when I give my kid his allowance.. etc etc..

All the original use cases (bitcoin replacing cash) are dead if fees are high.. in that scenario it is only replacing traditional banking.. so high fees equal digital banking, not digital cash.

Even with Gold I can take a 1 ounce coin and give it to the person standing next to me without paying a fee.. so gold is better than bitcoin in that sense.

At the end of the day, if there are fees that are noticable in size then cash is better to use than bitcoin.

Bitcoin only makes sense if fees are small or unnoticable. Otherwise btc is only targeting overseas long distance money transfers, Not the other 5 billion people on earth using cash to trade.

What person in africa or the philippines or india will use btc if every time they move money from their cold wallet to their hot wallet it costs them a large amount. 10cents is 4.6 philippine pesos, low salary is 1500 pesos per week (thats not the ""poor"", just low salary workers). So just THREE transactions can cost 1% of your weekly salary! That is ALREADY UNACCEPTABLE and the fee market is just getting started. Imagine you wanted to perform just 20 transactions per week, thats 6-7% of your weekly salary! So bitcoin is ALREADY far worse than traditional banking already offered in the philippines! 

A fee market absolutely destorys the ability for the 5 billion underbanked poor living in undeveloped countries to use bitcoin.

The price of btc will always be high enough to subsidize miners even when there is a reward of less than 1 btc every 10 minutes.. and if you dont believe that, then you dont beleieve in bitcoins success in the first place.

Fees should only be a measure in place to prevent extremely large amounts of small transactions from one person as a malicious ddos style attack against btc. And in that case fees should be unnoticable to people.. only noticable if you are trying to attack the network.

The DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) is a decentralized investment fund on the Ethereum network, which is kind of like Bitcoin but it lets you run code as well as move money.  The DAO is implemented by a set of ""smart contracts"" that allow the system to listen to user votes and transfer money automatically without needing a trusted person in control.

Apparently, there was a bug in the DAO's contracts, and hackers used it to steal $60 million in Ether (the Ethereum currency, basically like Bitcoin) from it.  Now the question is, should the developers roll back the fraudulent transaction?

Some people say ""Yes, this was clearly fraud, we should prevent fraud."" Other people say ""No, the point of the network is that code is law, regardless of what the code is. If the code allowed this to happen, it is legal.""

This blogger is pointing out that, while they think they've created a decentralized network free of government control, they still have a ""government"" in the form of the coders who wrote the network itself, who have the power to make the network do whatever they want.

d4np9ft,_amethyst,18,"**A large chunk of people (at least a million) will live under a government run entirely by computers**. It's kind of a weird prediction, but I think it's quite possible. 

Major reasons are in bold. There's a tl;dr at the bottom. 

You think I'm crazy? Well... you're right. But hear me out, okay? This was completely impossible just a few years ago, but parts of it (not all of it, but *parts* of it) could be done already today. In no particular order, let's look at a few of the most important jobs that governments have: 

First, we've got **elections**. Computers, in a universally-trustable system, are infinitely better at this than humans. If each person is given one vote and can be sure that their vote (and everyone else's vote) is counted and counted equally, elections are more stable and fair than they are today. 

Okay, here's where it gets weird (in case this prediction wasn't weird already). **Machine learning is becoming far more powerful than it's ever been**. I work with this stuff every day (for far tamer stuff, just image processing), and I'm 100% certain that we'll be able to replace judges and lawmakers with computers in 50 years. Have a computer write the laws. Have it analyse every law ever written to find inconsistencies. Have it analyse every court case on record to find possible outcomes of new laws. Have it be the judge in every court case. Have it analyse all the information we've ever collected! 

Next reason: **predictability via surveillance**. Look at all this shit the NSA has on us! I know reddit really hates their spying (and I do too), but at the same time, as someone who works in machine learning, the NSA's treasure trove of personal information would be *incredible* to work with. It scares me that it's there, but oh man I can't even begin to tell you what we could learn from that. Patterns we couldn't possibly imagine. Where people go, what people do, who we talk to, what we like and dislike, everything you've ever done online. We could have a computer with the most incredible understanding of human nature we could possibly imagine. Given enough information on every citizen, and given enough computing power (if Moore's Law holds up for the next 50 years, this prediction is solid), we could use all this information to eliminate the entire need for elections. Have a computer analyse each and every person, and just make the government the best it can be for everyone. 

We couldn't possibly do this today, because computers simply aren't powerful enough, and because humans can't do any of this. Remember,  

* **humans aren't physically capable of reading every legal document in existence or all the information that the NSA stores**, and  
* **humans are biased** (theoretically, a computer system like this can be made to be non-biased, although it'd be a bit complicated)

**Newer technologies involving blockchains** (including Ethereum and Bitcoin) could be pretty disruptive if given the chance to run a country. 

* Ethereum (or something like it; it's very new, so I'm not going to claim it's the end-all-be-all of it type) can manage contracts and smart contracts, and the possibilities are only just being discovered, and could easily be expanded upon.  
* Bitcoin (or something like it; it's also new and certainly has its own problems) could be used to replace a financial system for an entire country in full. A similar system to Bitcoin could be created to allow democratic changes to be made to the system (""should we raise inflation? put it to a vote!""; this can't really be done with Bitcoin, but could theoretically be done with a similar system). 

In keeping with that topic: **fairness and corruption**. **It's (essentially) impossible to bribe a computer**. Campaign finance reform could be swept away with this. Each human gets equal influence over the government. A computer-run government is a government that can't be bribed. 

A similar point: **peace**. I'm trying to write this without mentioning ongoing problems in politics right now (have you heard? America's having some sort of election!), but let's not pretend that we haven't gone to war under false pretenses before. **A computer system smart enough to learn from the mistakes made in the past (you know, like humans are *supposed* to do) could avoid that risk**. 

(*Sigh*. Okay, all I'm saying is that a fair and ""diplomacy-first, bombs-only-when-necessary"" computer system wouldn't have invaded Iraq.) 

Okay, my final argument: **it's already happening**. Not ""AI governs all"", but let's not pretend that computers aren't fucking *everywhere* already. Police have them sitting on their dashboard. Tax agencies use them to calculate taxes. Email is the main way politicians communicate today. We're still learning how to use these new inventions properly, and we're constantly making mistakes, which is why we're still hesitant to move into an entirely computer-operated world too quickly. 

But given 50 years? Yeah, this is entirely possible. In my mind, probable. In 100 years? Maybe 200? No doubt in my mind. I'd bet every dollar to my name that this will happen eventually. 50 might be a bit soon, but it's not too crazy. 

Are there arguments against what I've said here? Of course. I'm just one nerdy asshole on the Internet who needs something to think about while my subway train is underground. I'm a computer scientist, not a future-predictor. But this isn't the craziest idea out there. 

The idea that a million people might live under an entirely computer-run system of government isn't crazy. [There should be be about 10 billion people on earth then](https://populationpyramid.net/world/2060/). The idea that (oh golly I'm bad at percents!) 0.00001% (?) of the world could live like this isn't the craziest idea in this thread. 

Sorry for rambling. My home's wifi doesn't hit my bathroom, so I have a lot of free time to think about stupid shit like this while I'm pooping. 

(edited for clarity, if you can believe that. This was even a bigger mess when I first posted it.)

**tl;dr: people will live under an entirely-computer-operated government. With advancements in machine learning (that's the main one), blockchain-based technologies, surveillance (I'm not saying it's a good thing), and more, and with the predicted improved computing power of processors in 50 years, it's entirely possible that we could replace human-run governments with computers. It's a non-corrupt, fair, more peaceful, and** ***much*** **smarter thing running a country, rather than those messy, pesky humans, who always mess things up.**

&gt;As we were completing the newest version of the Daemon DAC contract, and working with existing vendors to open a store using the new system. A bug was found in the DAO (Slock DAO) contract code. We decided to wait to launch but as circumstances have now changed, we now find ourselves at a fork in the road.

&gt;Down one path, the Daemon DAC can not be operated on Ethereum. Who decides and for what reasons can a contract be ignored by miners and in the future stakeholders? It is not an option to allow vendors to put their life at risk by letting others decide if their money is spendable, it was the reason we stopped using paypal a half a decade ago.

&gt;Down the other, the Daemon DAC can operate safely, knowing that the code published will be the code run indefinitely as published.

&gt;Either this statement is true or it is not, there is no grey area. We need assurance from the Ethereum network our contract will be safe.

""This also infers that, technically, exchanges today are thinly traded. If I wanted to buy $50m in Bitcoin, what would prevent me from shorting the market by with $2–5m, forcing the price down and then buying $50m in volume from OTC traders who have clients panicking? Market manipulation, although seemingly unlikely, is entirely plausible in a thinly traded market where large trades happen outside the exchange. This will change if and when the Bitcoin price and market cap is sufficiently large and liquid enough that 10k BTC trades (enough for an OTC tranche) would not move the price significantly.""

For all we know the amount of 'sell and stay in fiat' aside from miners has been tiny. If that's the case, halving could have a massive effect.

In reality it is a uncompromising religious vision for what Bitcoin needs to become. It doesn't make economic sense, because it doesn't have to. It is literally ""my way or the highway"". This is literally what they say. If Bitcoin becomes X, we will quit.

They will destroy Bitcoin exactly to the amount as they can. If they do an X amount of good, and then get away with X amount of bad. And if they make sure that going against their vision also bears a significant cost (with DDOS attacks, FUD, censorship etc) then they can even get away with more shit.

**A Call For Core Developers to Clarify Their Stance on 2MB Hard Fork**

Before we dive into it, please be reminded that this piece of writing is an effort to improve understanding and engage in discourse in an open, candid and transparent fashion.

This is no veiled threat, neither is it moral grandstanding.

Use of inflammatory language, argumentum ad passions, FUD, or downright character assassination will be out of the question, as they will only be counterproductive to the aforementioned purpose.

We will try to stick to basic facts that are clear and least controversial thus hopefully steer clear speculation as to one’s motives. If you take issue with the veracity of what we believe are facts, we are happy to discuss.

With the tone of this piece thus having established, let’s start with a brief recap of the events that eventually led to this:

In December last year, amid the heat and noise of the blocksize debate, representatives from both the Bitcoin Core developer community and the industry at large, including some executives of BTC companies and some large miners (the majority of whom, by coincidence, are geographically based in China) met in Hong Kong at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop and subsequently, the first Bitcoin Roundtable conference. At the second of the two events, on Feb 21 this year, an agreement was reached and signed by the attendees including both Core developers and industry insiders — this document, published online, came to be known as the Hong Kong Consensus.

The reaching of such an agreement is a significant event and is widely perceived a positive development, especially given a new round of skepticism and criticism set off by the rage quit of former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. Now with the Consensus signed, criticisms, such as Bitcoin has a fundamental and irremediable governance issue and that the Bitcoin community is at a civil war with itself with two camps dueling each other to death, were put at bay, at least temporarily. One may even argue that it serves to rekindle hope by showing Bitcoiners that in a time of crisis, the community are willing to discard their differences, and make compromises when greater good is at stake.

In this Consensus document, one part stands out:

*We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.*

*This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.*

Many perceive this as the outcome of the political arm wrestling between the Chinese miners and Core developers. The developers, in order to secure the support of the vast majority of hash power, strategiclly promised the miners 2mb hard fork. The miners, leveraging their hardware assets, had a chance to express their demand face to face to the developers and even had the later make a promise in written form.

There is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important in this document, actually if people were not serious about it, they wouldn’t have taken the trouble to assign a deadline to it:

*The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.*

Now with June approaching its end and June a few days away, there has been increasing concern whether the Core devs are ready to deliver on their promise, or any effort have been made during the past months towards this end. Some may feel compelled to ask: Were the Core devs who signed the document sincere in their promise or just squeezing the situation for all it’s worth?

Whatever the answer is, the Chinese community present at the Roundtable and signed on the Consensus saw the 2MB hard fork as a key negotiating point and something important to their interest. Today, this stance hasn’t changed.

Arguments were sometimes made that the Chinese didn’t hold up their end of the bargain — for instance, some mining pools gave users the option to mine Classic blocks — which was seen as a breach by some; however, this doesn’t negate the fact that people like HaoBTC made a strenous effort in fending off criticism from Chinese Classic supporters and Blockstream conspiracy theorists.

Diminishing the importance of mining in the Bitcoin economy, or calling the Chinese miners as whole corrupt and detrimental to decentralization is not a valid argument for its obvious falsity, not to say that it is not helping solve the issue — some of the Chinese attendees, such as HaoBTC, are heavily involved in mining, but are also run other services such as exchanges and wallets. Today, few would doubt that the Chinese bitcoiners account for a significant chunk of the economy and a legitimate constitution of the Bitcoin political system.

While we are under no illusion that the Consensus is a binding, enforceable legally enforceable document, we see it at least an authentic expression of the intensions of parties involved — If things have moved on to a point that some signatories now feel they have to reconsider or rescind their positions, it would be fair that they make public anouncement to such effect so the rest are aware of such developments and take actions accordingly. It would be disingenuous and unfair to keep others in the dark. As a signatory of the agreement, we (HaoBTC ) are interested in hearing any comments from the Core devs, especially those that signed on the document, regarding the current status of affairs.

Thanks and Best regards,

The HaoBTC Team",2016-06-28 06:53:37

d4qxr24,Thisisgentlementtt,31,"A few words on the halvening.

Some background: I am a real world hedge fund manager. I was very lucky to listen to my dealer and got in on Bitcoin early.

Bitcoin is a beast of its own kind. It helps to understand other assets but in the end other assets differ fundamentally. Demand and supply decide the price. Demand can be either “real” or “speculative”. In the long run, or how you define real and speculative, it does not matter very much. If there is more demand than supply, the price goes up - and vice versa. 

Now comes the important part: apart from Bitcoin, when the price of an asset increases, the supply (production) will increase. This increased production dampens the rise of the price. This is the reason why you do not see multiple long term 10-100x price increases in traditional assets, but they are normal in Bitcoin.

The halvening: I would argue that the demand for Bitcoins is growing. But even if it did not, the halvening will have a large impact on the price. Cutting the supply of a freely priced asset to half, is so “crazy” that it simply does not happen in the “real world”. I am expecting 10-100x returns easily after the first year after the halvening.

The biggest mistake people make is that they compare the number of mined Bitcoins with volumes on exchanges, and thus think the number of mined Bitcoins is not a big deal. The volume on exchanges and mined Bitcoins are two totally separate things. Traders can trade no matter how many million Bitcoins a day, and it will not matter in the big picture of long term price discovery. But every mined Bitcoin needs to be bought with hard earned money (by a real life person at the market rate in country x) for the price of Bitcoin to stay the same.

d4q8346,WeGotCactus,30,"More interesting speculation about manipulation by OTC players.  
  
Quoted from HyphyBTC aka hyphymikey over at [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1528973.0):

&gt; --Most buying is done off exchanges and OTC. By a wide margin too.
&gt;
&gt;--China is not leading this market.
&gt;
&gt;--Chinese exchanges with zero fees are being used to ""control"" the market, because bots are linked to these exchanges and people think China is leading the market.
&gt;
&gt;--Bitfinex is linked to Chinese exchanges to provide liquidity. Just like when BFX was linked to Stamp. That is why some full orderbooks are not shown. When a large drop occurs on Chinese exchanges the volume stays within the same range, while Bitfinex drops with larger volume than normal. This is a combination of bot manipulation and Bitfinex offering liquidity.
&gt;
&gt;--The rise to nearly 800 was one entity, the OTC sellers and buyers waited until this entity was done and then plopped up over 25K BTC in ask walls, now it's up to 35K. The 35K BTC is a mix of real coins and borrowed coins for sale. You can see this by looking at the full order book, you notice the amounts for sale at XXX.37 repeatedly at every dollar interval? There are other patterns you will see as well.
&gt;
&gt;--The OTC buyers put sell pressure on BFX to keep the price down, so their OTC purchase will save them millions, by only making people who look at exchanges think we aren't mooning yet. Without their ""fake"" sell pressure we would be at ATH.
&gt;
&gt;--OTC firms do not care about this ""manipulation"" because they get a percentage in BTC and know that they will sell much more BTC OTC when the price is reasonable and not mooning. OTC firms might also be in on the fake sell pressure.
&gt;
&gt;--My guess is currently someone wants to buy OTC in the $650 range, or an OTC firm is seeing an influx of customers and is easier to just have stable prices for everyone Brexiting or running from their fiat market.
&gt;
&gt;--The Bitfinex ""malfunction"" was deliberate. Using statements from above you can see that dropping the Chinese exchanges prices are easy, causing all the longs on BFX to be force liquidated. Well guess who bought up all those coins that were liquidated while also putting the price back in their range? BFX has a ton of fees in BTC to sell, and guess how they do it? That's right, mostly OTC. And if a buyer says ""no way I'm paying $700+ for those coins when the price has only been at this level for a week"", then BFX has only one thing to do, bring the price back down in the OTC range.
&gt;
&gt;--Long term holders like myself, 4+ years, know this is going on and don't really care about exchange rates YET, because one day millions of small buyers who will only use exchanges will overpower any manipulation put forth by OTC markets and online exchanges.

And..

&gt;Money managers of multi-millionaire and billionaire families have to time to play around on exchanges. Its their job! Do you think these rich families are doing all the work?
&gt;
&gt;A first time OTC buyer without a money manager might not take the time to ""play around"" on Chinese exchanges. A multi-millionaire who buys BTC monthly, or is buying over time might think it is well worth it to suppress prices themselves. OTC firms on the other hand have the biggest advantage of price suppression.
&gt;
&gt;Also, Bitfinex is where I see the suppression happening not the Chinese exchanges. The Chinese exchanges are being used more for BOT MANIPULATION, i.e. I have a buy wall on BFX but nobody will sell into it, so my bot on the Chinese exchange drags the price down using a very little amount of coins, then the price on BFX drops right through my buy wall. The volume on Chinese exchanges is so high that the only way it is possible is if you buy and sell to yourself over and over, to manipulate the price. This only started happening when zero fees exchanges came around. There aren't millions or even thousands of people buying bitcoin a day, most of the volume is a few whales prying bitcoin from all the small minnows that are trying to trade. 
&gt;
&gt;I lot a few hundred BTC margin trading before I figured this all out. Now I keep a significant amount in cold storage, try to think like the manipulator, and buy the dips. Ive made back the BTC I lost and some since then.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: and the whole working in unison thing isn't happening. Most OTC buyers only buy once or maybe twice. They only need to ""manipulate"" for a week at most, or until their buy/sell goes through. Then the market moves suppression free. When the next billionaire buyer comes along, they then do what they need to get their good price. The only ones who do this over and over, or non stop, are OTC firms and buyers who continually buy, and there are far fewer of them then ""normal"" OTC buyers. I am not saying that there isn't a coalition out there, but I'm more sure about the rest.

The only idea I disagree with – there is no such thing as fake selling pressure. It is just real supply/demand manifesting in different ways, ones that are not wholly transparent because of the manipulation happening. But there does exist some real notion of true supply and true demand, we are just not privy to it. If everyone was buying/selling on a single exchange with no OTC and no wash trades, I would argue we'd be sitting roughly in the exact same position as we are today (though the exact shape of the chart and volatility would differ some). Supply is supply and demand is demand. If someone wants to sell 25k btc and someone wants to buy 25k btc at a certain price, and cost for the broker to achieve that price via manipulation is small enough, that doesn't change the fact that there was X amount of supply, and it was met by Y amount of demand at Z price. The ""how"" is unimportant.

My hunch though is that OTC volume is bullish overall, because as others have pointed out, big OTC buyers are probably HODLers, and big OTC sellers are probably miners and exchanges. Shifting more and more coins to HODLers is what creates lack of supply which is what creates the possibility of bubbling.",2016-06-28 04:15:46

We will try to stick to basic facts that are clear and least controversial thus hopefully steer clear speculation as to one’s motives. If you take issue with the veracity of what we believe are facts, we are happy to discuss.
With the tone of this piece thus having established, let’s start with a brief recap of the events that eventually led to this:
In December last year, amid the heat and noise of the blocksize debate, representatives from both the Bitcoin Core developer community and the industry at large, including some executives of BTC companies and some large miners (the majority of whom, by coincidence, are geographically based in China) met in Hong Kong at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop and subsequently, the first Bitcoin Roundtable conference. At the second of the two events, on Feb 21 this year, an agreement was reached and signed by the attendees including both Core developers and industry insiders — this document, published online, came to be known as the Hong Kong Consensus.
The reaching of such an agreement is a significant event and is widely perceived a positive development, especially given a new round of skepticism and criticism set off by the rage quit of former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. Now with the Consensus signed, criticisms, such as Bitcoin has a fundamental and irremediable governance issue and that the Bitcoin community is at a civil war with itself with two camps dueling each other to death, were put at bay, at least temporarily. One may even argue that it serves to rekindle hope by showing Bitcoiners that in a time of crisis, the community are willing to discard their differences, and make compromises when greater good is at stake.
In this Consensus document, one part stands out:
We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.
This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
Many perceive this as the outcome of the political arm wrestling between the Chinese miners and Core developers. The developers, in order to secure the support of the vast majority of hash power, strategiclly promised the miners 2mb hard fork. The miners, leveraging their hardware assets, had a chance to express their demand face to face to the developers and even had the later make a promise in written form.
There is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important in this document, actually if people were not serious about it, they wouldn’t have taken the trouble to assign a deadline to it:
The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
Now with June approaching its end and June a few days away, there has been increasing concern whether the Core devs are ready to deliver on their promise, or any effort have been made during the past months towards this end. Some may feel compelled to ask: Were the Core devs who signed the document sincere in their promise or just squeezing the situation for all it’s worth?
Whatever the answer is, the Chinese community present at the Roundtable and signed on the Consensus saw the 2MB hard fork as a key negotiating point and something important to their interest. Today, this stance hasn’t changed.
Arguments were sometimes made that the Chinese didn’t hold up their end of the bargain — for instance, some mining pools gave users the option to mine Classic blocks — which was seen as a breach by some; however, this doesn’t negate the fact that people like HaoBTC made a strenous effort in fending off criticism from Chinese Classic supporters and Blockstream conspiracy theorists.
Diminishing the importance of mining in the Bitcoin economy, or calling the Chinese miners as whole corrupt and detrimental to decentralization is not a valid argument for its obvious falsity, not to say that it is not helping solve the issue — some of the Chinese attendees, such as HaoBTC, are heavily involved in mining, but are also run other services such as exchanges and wallets. Today, few would doubt that the Chinese bitcoiners account for a significant chunk of the economy and a legitimate constitution of the Bitcoin political system.
While we are under no illusion that the Consensus is a binding, enforceable legally enforceable document, we see it at least an authentic expression of the intensions of parties involved — If things have moved on to a point that some signatories now feel they have to reconsider or rescind their positions, it would be fair that they make public anouncement to such effect so the rest are aware of such developments and take actions accordingly. It would be disingenuous and unfair to keep others in the dark. As a signatory of the agreement, we (HaoBTC ) are interested in hearing any comments from the Core devs, especially those that signed on the document, regarding 
the current status of affairs.

Thanks and Best regards,
The HaoBTC Team",2016-06-28 03:23:35

d4qbfyd,LovelyDay,19,"&gt; Please show me evidence that 2MB hardfork will be a smooth upgrade

Consider the hardforks in Monero. Litecoin. Ethereum. And most other cryptos of your choice. Smooth as butter. Point is, the spectre of calamitous hardforks has been vastly overdrawn. We should take advantage of Bitcoin's young age to show a successful precedent. If anyone has the best strategic position to do so, it's Core + the current miners. Pity you folks want to waste that opportunity.

&gt; Please show me evidence and the economic impact to all nodes running the software and additional bandwidth requirements.

Consult the recent Cornell position paper which has shown that upgrades to 4MB would be safe for the majority of the network. Based on real measurements of block propagation across the Bitcoin network, the authors calculated that at an average block size of 4.1 MB, 10% of the network nodes would be unable to keep up, while at an average block size of 37 MB, half of the network nodes would be left behind. They suggested that the size of blocks should not exceed 4 MB.

&gt;Please guarantee that no money will be lost during the contentious activation period.

Money is being lost right now due to missed growth opportunities. If a major world crisis happens, Bitcoin is not ready to absorb the influx. Who's fault?
Take a good look at the comments from business leaders who are saying they want to, but can't invest right now in Bitcoin because it's not fit for the scale of their businesses.

Just the other day Steam dropped 0-conf support again. Does that tell you anything?

&gt;Please provide proof that all the nodes NOT running classic, will suddenly upgrade to prevent being stranded and double spent against.

Why would we want to force nodes to upgrade? It may be that they want to run on a &lt; 1MB chain forever. At that point they can fork off hard and preserve their small block utopia.

Basically, the attacker monitors the queue and issues transactions at the right rate and with the right fees to occupy 50% of the top 1 MB of the queued transactions.  

It is hard to tell how much that would cost, since it would depend on a section of the the demand x fee curve that hasn't been explored yet.  But I would be surprised if it is more than 100 k USD/day.  

Raising the limit to 2 MB would make the attack 3 times more expensive.  Raising it to 20 MB would make it 39 times more expensive.  At that point it would probably be more economical for the attacker to rent 51% of the mining power from 2-3 Chinese pools...",2016-06-28 21:12:04

d4s5c8s,throckmortonsign,38,"Hint: When people say things like ""'I've seen a number of people [say X]"" or ""Numerous people from [X] have directly told me"" your next question should be ""Who?"" If you can't answer it yourself, then you should ask the author specifically who they mean. Let's try it:

&gt; Recently I've seen a number of people in the Bitcoin ecosystem commenting that they think that Bitcoin blocks should always be completely full.

Who? If you mean Luke-Jr or Greg Maxwell, then you are completely misrepresenting their point. If you mean, someone else I profoundly apologize. Their (GM/LJ) point usually goes along the lines of this: ""The demand for a globally available, consistent database and for storage of information [whether it be of economic value or not] is always in high demand, and therefore no matter the size of the block it will always be full."" This pretty much says the opposite of the what Ver is saying, yet if you look at the arguments superficially they look similar. 

* Blocks should always be full
* Blocks will always be full

Now of course, the second cannot be true because you can think of absurd situations where blocks could potentially be 8 GB and very few nodes or miners could provide useful services at that high of a bandwidth.

&gt; I would never dream of telling the current Bitcoin Core team the correct way to build a cryptographic consensus network, 

Then don't.

&gt; but the small block proponents are having loud and vociferous opinions on economic subjects while **remaining in a state of ignorance.**

OK. Emphasis is mine. Does he mean to imply that every single small block proponent is ignorant on economic subjects? I highly doubt that. I read a study about a year ago that I think nails a big portion of the problem down, here is the quote (h/t Szabo's twitter. source: https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00951358/document [warning: PDF]):

&gt; In the latter case a question arises: why don’t miners limit the size of what they include
in the blocks themselves? The reason is the following. When a miner tries to solve a block,
the transactions are already in the network. In this case, he is a Stackelberg follower and
he has an incentive to include all transactions in the limitless block he tries to solve. He
could announce before solving a block that if he indeed solves a block, he will not include
all transactions. But this announcement would not be credible. Indeed, since miners
are in competition with distributed hashing power, the transactions a miner would not
include would certainly be included just ten minutes later by another miner. **Including all
transactions whatever the fee attached is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of
the game we described.**

Emphasis mine again. The author is a PhD Economist. It's important to note that this paper is a bit of simplification of the system. In fact, Peter Rizun wrote a paper where he points out that fear of orphaning pressure (among other things) provides miners a natural incentive to limit the size of blocks (something of which Bitcoin Unlimited has taken and run with). Things that miners already take advantage of seem to break the underlying assumptions of Peter R's paper, though.

Another person who often argues from economic standpoints is Paul Sztorc who has a masters in statistics (also ""Worked directly under [William Nordhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nordhaus) as a member of a research team to provide appropriate
statistical input in the design, execution and analysis of studies concerning macroeconomic research."" according to his LinkedIn), but seems to have arrived a ""small blockist"" viewpoint. His ""Measuring Decentralization"" post is a pretty good read (CONOP is a particularly useful idea to understand, and does quite a good job of addressing the negative externalities of a large blocksize): http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization/

Another argument from Ver's article:

&gt; Today we have around 5,000 full nodes around the world, with a user base of just a few million people. If Bitcoin is allowed to scale to have hundreds of millions of users, or even a billion users, there will be a much larger pool of people to draw from to run full nodes. 

In June 2011, Gavin Andresen gave a presentation to the CIA regarding Bitcoin. Here is a copy of it https://s3.amazonaws.com/gavinandresen-bitcoin/GavinAndresenCIATalk.pdf

&gt; There are somewhere between 20 and 30 thousand nodes connected at any given time; any given node is connected to between 8 and 150 mostly-randomly-selected neighbors.

This was 5 years ago. The amount of Bitcoin adoption at that time was probable ~1% of the adoption that we have now, yet then there were 20 to 30,000 nodes on the network. In 5 years, we have nearly increased adoption 100-fold, yet we have 1/4 the number of validating full nodes on the network. At that time there were few choices in software, but there were some. I know because I was there. I do not think it's right to expect businesses like Coinbase, Bitpay, et al to run nodes because we have seen examples of large Bitcoin business that **DID NOT** run bitcoin nodes due to technical and economic reasons.  I also remember there came a time when I turned off my full node because it was too taxing on my network, disk, and hindered my general purpose PC enough that I would routinely stop the node before starting a game. Eventually I turned it off for years (I have since started running a full note again - directly as a result of advancements made possible by the likes of Pieter Wuille and Hal Finney). 


Sorry for the wall of text, please excuse typographical and grammatical errors... I'll try to recompose this at later time to make it a bit more coherent.

I will point out that I'm not a small 1 MB block proponent. I think that a reasonable increase as long as there is a degree of safety is OK. The problem is what is ""reasonable"" - I don't think the science from either a technical or an economic point has advanced enough to answer that question. I suspect that a flexible limit with some sort of anti-gaming mechanism has to be employed. From an empiric standpoint, I think we are well on the way to understanding a little bit more because SegWit will necessarily tax the P2P network more.",2016-06-29 12:58:38

- Approximately 14% of ether at risk from 1+ attackers. Vitalik considers that amount of ether problematic for PoS at this stage.

- On the investment side, this is problematic for those pitching ethereum projects. No return of funds will drastically reduce funding for Ethereum, directly from lost funds ($150m-ish) and indirectly (existing and external investors are both spooked). In particular, future internal investment from Ether holders will be substantially reduced. 

This fund became too large because it was the de facto Ethereum project fund, one you could withdraw from at any time. It was pooled money.

This has considerable consequences for the entire ecosystem, whether you like it or not. It's not just the value of eth, it's the development of core tech and projects. 

Fork or don't fork, there are risks both ways. Be anti-fork but do so understanding the situation as a whole. It sucks but it is what it is.

&gt; Only someone who lacks an understanding of economics or business would want to turn away paying customers.

Or here, where utterly demolishes the main argument of the small-block supporters, showing that they are totally backwards when they claim that ""bigger blocks will mean fewer nodes"":

&gt; Today we have around 5,000 full nodes around the world, with a user base of just a few million people. If Bitcoin is allowed to scale to have hundreds of millions of users, or even a billion users, there will be a much larger pool of people to draw from to run full nodes. This means that there will likely be a much larger absolute number of full nodes, even if it's a smaller percentage of bitcoin users that are running these full nodes. When it comes to censorship resistance the absolute number a full nodes is the most important characteristic, not the percentage of users running a full node.

There is simply no way that Core/Blockstream can rebut any of these arguments.

Roger Ver has clearly explained why Bitcoin needs - and will soon get - bigger blocks for simple on-chain scaling.

It's too late now for guys like /u/nullc or /u/luke-jr or /u/adam3us to even respond to this now. They have tried, over and over for the past few years, and all they've been doing is destroying their own reputations - as developers, as business people, and as human beings.

They brought this on themselves, and they have only themselves to blame for destroying their own reputations - and almost destroying Bitcoin in the process.

- the 4x greater adoption would almost certainly more than make up for losing those 10% of nodes

So, in summary, using these rough figures, we could estimate that **Core/Blockstream is currently artificially suppressing adoption to be 1/4 of what it could be, and artificially suppressing the price to be on the order of around 1/16 of what it could be.**

Multiply USD 600 by 16, and you get 10,000 USD per coin. 

A price of 10,000 USD per Bitcoin would give a nice healthy market cap of around $150 billion.

That's the kind of adoption where it no longer becomes realistic for any government to try to stop Bitcoin, and where big investors and companies can routinely use it, along with small users as well - all doable directly on the blockchain, with 4 MB blocks. 

Right now, if 15,000 high-net-worth individuals were to each buy 1000 BTC (at a current price of 600 USD / BTC - ie, spending 600,000 each), then there would be no more coins left.

I am sure there is potentially already enough demand from such high-net-worth individuals already to seek a safe haven such as ""bitcoin the new digital gold"" - but I cannot blame them for taking a wait-and-see attitude now, with the artificially restricted blocksize due to a myopic centralized group of Core/Blockstream devs.

The simplest way forward is: **Change a 1 to a 4 in the code now. This only loses 10% of current nodes, while also opening the possibility of 1 BTC = $10,000 and market cap = $150 billion. 

(And this isn't even factoring in Xthin - which can give another 5x effective blocksize increase, for a total of 20x bigger blocks effectively - eventually allowing around 400x higher price or $240,000 per BTC? - provided of course that the ""e = mc^2 conjecture"" proves to be correct.)

Here are some links which with more details on these arguments:

&gt; If Bitcoin usage and blocksize increase, then mining would simply migrate from 4 conglomerates in China (and Luke-Jr's slow internet =) to the top cities worldwide with Gigabit broadban[d] - and price and volume would go way up. So how would this be ""bad"" for Bitcoin as a whole??

&gt; It may well be that small blocks are what is centralizing mining in China. Bigger blocks would have a strongly decentralizing effect by taming the relative influence China's power-cost edge has over other countries' connectivity edge. – /u/ForkiusMaximus

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ybl8r/it_may_well_be_that_small_blocks_are_what_is/

So, in the end, with much higher price and adoption, nobody would be crying over losing 10% of the original nodes running on Raspberry Pi's on slow internet connections, and new participants would more than compensate for those lost 10% nodes. 

We are probably **already** sacrificing way more than 10% adoption - in terms of people stopping or avoiding using Bitcoin, due to artificial blocksize scarcity causing transaction delays.

Look, I'm the biggest pessimist in the world. But even I believe:

**The only rational way forward is to not be afraid to grow big.**

**With 4 MB blocks, we'd go from 5,000 nodes to 20,000 nodes, and from 600 USD to 10,000 USD, and from 10 billion to 150 billion market cap - while sacrificing 10% of today's slow nodes.**

Everything in life is a tradeoff, everything in life has upside and downside. 

I think most people would prefer this kind of tradeoff and upside/downside risk: sacrifice 10% of the slow nodes, in return for massive upside in price and adoption - instead of stagnating in the paranoid doom and gloom being peddled by Core/Blockstream.

d4sdont,n0mdep,11,"Bitcoin has been growing at a consistent rate for some years. Price is closely correlated to that growth in volume over time. Even with SegWit, Bitcoin will not have the capacity to continue that growth. Meaning ever higher TX fees and more instances of poor UX (people's TXs being delaying or getting stuck).

Bitcoin's network effects are incredibly powerful but those people - the ones who can't use Bitcoin because they have been priced out (already happening) - will necessarily look for an alternative. For argument's sake, Litecoin. They will create their own network effects and there is a risk that Bitcoin businesses and exchanges will then adopt Litecoin, strengthening its network effects. I'm no Eth fan but consider that a whole bunch of Bitcoin only companies quickly moved to accept Eth based on the recent uptick in interest. Not just Coinbase. A bunch of other exchanges too. And companies like Bitwage, BlockCypher, Lamassu. These things can happen quickly. So what if Litecoin (I'm no Litecoin fan either) successfully scales, offering a much cheaper alternative to Bitcoin? What if Bitcoin's LN takes years to come to fruition?

d4tubhm,ThomasZander,41,"I'm going to assume you are responding to this;
&gt; There is plenty of issues that could use improvements. It turns out that the original developers don't really like writing unit tests and the code lacks any organization to make unit testing practical or easy. With some small changes such efforts could be made much easier.

What core is doing is that most of the tests they write for new code goes to the QA directory. These are tests that essentially start up 4 bitcoind instances and communicate with the json/rpc port to make them do stuff.

While this is valuable and nice, it is not unit testing. Its typically called black-box testing. Notice that I do believe the quality at the end will benefit from tests that core writes, I'm not arguing otherwise.

What my point in the quoted paragraph is, is that I want the Bitcoin code itself to become less messy. Which means that if you change one method to do something a little different that you don't end up changing the behaviour of something completely unrelated.  The way that development can be done safely by a larger amount of people is that they can just focus on one unit (a class or maybe 3 classes) and make that work properly.  And this is really not possible in Bitcoin right now.

So, the goal is to make the code more structured, have less interdependencies between many sections of code and make it easier to learn because of that structuring.

And for that, you need **unit** tests. Black box tests won't help improving the system.",2016-06-30 20:59:20

Currently, if you want someone to pay you, you have to give them a Bitcoin address. You shouldn't reuse addresses for privacy reasons, so the next time you want them to pay you, you have to give them an address again. That's pretty inconvenient.

What if your wallet could automatically give out new addresses for you? That would be easy for the sender, but what if you are the recipient of those automated communications? If you received a payment address through text message or push notification, would you blindly trust it? What if the address has been modified in transit?

BIP75 makes these types of interactions possible by encrypting the whole exchange and letting both parties provide a public key to prove their identity.
