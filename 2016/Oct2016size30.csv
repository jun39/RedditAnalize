d89jgkw,nimble2,45,"Wow, now **that** is an interesting scam.  You might want to repost on r/scams.  WRT getting your money back, I can think of a couple of options (not that I hold out any hope for you).  First off, when and how did you pay?  If you paid by credit card less than a couple of months ago, then contact your credit card issuer and contest/dispute the charge based on the fact that you didn't get the services that you paid for.  If you paid using a physical check, then you can follow that money to the bank account that it ended up in, and you can potentially sue the owner of that bank account.  If you paid by bitcoin, then you are SOL.",2016-10-01 22:43:21
d89cx1o,AndThenHeSays4,36,"That's great. I did a bank wire from USA to India for $3,000 USD and the process was terrible. My programmer said he didn't get the money so I did a trace. Apparently it was just stuck at the Central bank. Once I saw that I contacted them immediately through my banker and ONLY THEN 3 weeks after the wire was placed did the Central bank inform me I needed to fill out their form. The info on the form WAS THE EXACT SAME THING required for any international wire when you fill in the info, except it had a Central Bank watermark. Sheer bureaucratic idiocy that has perpetuated from the British colonial days to the present. Either that or these Central bank guys are just incompetent/lazy. After I submitted the form, I didnt hear back from them for another solid 5 business days. So I said fuck this and  recalled the wire. What's next?

Well, the programmer said that we could try Bitcoin...I didnt even know that was an option!! He sent me a wallet address and I had that transaction done in 30 seconds with basically zero cost to me, as opposed to expensive wire fees.

If this picks up in India that's game over!! It will be so easy to pick up people to do quick coding work and you wont have to jump through hoops or pay a bunch of money at once in a wire. You can pay daily or weekly with the click of a button!

Same use case can apply to other restrictive banking countries like Argentina, Belize, etc.",2016-10-01 16:33:29
d88g3rz,todu,26,"I suggest spending some of that money to research how to avoid getting another hostile takeover of Bitcoin node software development like the one that Blockstream did and is doing. The biggest problem and threat to Bitcoin so far, that I'm aware of, has been the centralization of node software development. Whoever takes control of that, seems to automatically get control over the miners and economic nodes as well.

How do we make Bitcoin more resistant to this kind of attack? If we just change a king of Bitcoin to a different king, then we have not invented democracy. The new king is just as easily corrupted to act in their own self interest that's also against the best interest of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency as a whole.

I don't know if this is a solvable problem or even if it would help to throw some money at solving it. Maybe it's just best to make Gavin king again even though he doesn't want to and then never allow him to resign again. But that would maybe be inhumane.

Or maybe it's just inevitable that whenever a Bitcoin currency starts misbehaving then a Bitcoin spinoff takes over. Maybe that's the checks and balances of protocol development that goes bad.

I think Gavin suggested creating an organization like the IETF for Bitcoin node software and protocol development. Could this idea be worth pursuing? Would it be good to pay for this kind of research or would it just attract the wrong kind of researchers if pay was offered? One of the reasons that Linux is better than Microsoft Windows may be the very fact that a product attracts the best brains if the development is not made for the purpose of getting a salary and / or stock ownership appreciation. It may seem counterintuitive but paying for some kinds of things will sometimes get you the opposite of what you want. Maybe this is one of those cases, maybe it is not. I don't know. 

This is more of a social sciences than a computer science problem and I don't know much about the social sciences. I've just observed that their problems seem to affect us too considering what Blockstream has done to our project. ",2016-10-01 01:14:54

d88mrl8,snowkeld,19,"This was my personal account at a small local bank. I own a business that trades bitcoin, but I do not use their bank for any business related transactions. They called me and asked about details of my employment, then mailed this the same day.

Seems crazy they would prohibit people from having accounts based on what their job is..

Update:

I got a call back early this morning. They didn't change their decision or anything and it was explained to me that the account was closed because I made ""bitcoin related transactions"" which would be sending some money to my personal coinbase account.

He tried to tell me that there are regulatory tracking requirements for such transactions, which I know there are not and told him so, then he changed is to a hypothetical issue if there where some kind of audit process performed. So I told him that this is the same type of transaction as if I sent my money from their bank to any other regulated financial institution, like sending a transfer to a credit union account and having my bank account closed in response because the credit union is a competitor.
The response to this analogy was about virtual currency regulation, and I did not send very much and know well the laws involved, so I explained that both the amounts I sent would require no special licencing in the state of Maine, or federally, and even if it did the financial institution actually selling bitcoin is not your bank, which is akin to closing my account because I purchase liquor with my bank debit card from a store, and my account is closed because the bank does not have a liquor licence. This is when his tone changed, he either seemed to give up on lying to me, or he didn't get it to begin with and all of a sudden ""got it"".

Anyway, I don't care that much about the account and it is being closed anyway. I think this stuff is going to start happening a lot more in the US, and I wonder what the repercussions will be like for the banks, and how long it will take for them to stop fighting it.",2016-10-01 03:40:38
d88q5l4,nullc,19,"The history is no mystery.

In 2012/2013 Matt suggested using BIP 37's bloomfiltered block for more efficient block relay.

In November 2013, Pieter [implemented it](https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commits/partialsync).

But [we found](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ib8sm/we_need_a_new_place_to_review_bips/d2wwbm0) that using BIP37 alone couldn't work; and it needed a new protocol. (link also shows us explaining the idea to Mike Hearn).

I begin working on a new protocol (bottom of link above), and commenced research which resulted in a broad idea called [block network coding](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:Gmaxwell/block_network_coding)-- which was improved and refined over time.

Gavin posting about that, caused Emin Gün Sirer to recommend IBLT for set reconciliation. There was a lot of [noise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2d7ofh/technical_discussion_of_gavins_o1_block/) on that, with people calling it ""O(1) block transfer""-- which largely stopped other work on this domain for a few months, but it has ultimately nowhere primarily because hidden overheads killed the efficiencies and actual use of it was quite complex. 

Early efforts to implement the full network block coding in 2015 after it was clear IBLT wasn't going anywhere showed that it was too CPU costly except for users on very low speed links. So I begin working on cut down versions which would be simpler and more cpu efficient.

I broke the protocol into two design sketches:

https://people.xiph.org/~greg/efficient.block.xfer.txt  (basis for BIP152)
https://people.xiph.org/~greg/lowlatency.block.xfer.txt (basis for FIBRE)

Mike picked up the thread of using BIP37 bloom filters, but was apparently unaware that it had been implemented and why it was unworkable. He posted an implementation of it, without crediting that the approach had come from core (I can see why that didn't seem important). 

I posted the proposed [Core capacity plan](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) in early December 2015 that cited the upcoming thinblocks as a justification for segwit being acceptably safe, expecting something based on efficient.block.xfer to be done by or shortly after segwit.

(Around this time I became aware that Hearn had unearth the zombie BIP37 based scheme, when Bitcoin XT started accusing Bitcoin Core of having intentionally sabotaged it because of unrelated changes that they merged from core onto XT without understanding them which made it more obviously broken.)

Core research/arch people was mostly working on segwit at this time from November to march.

Late January BU developers tried integrating Mike Hearn's work but that the BIP37 based approach didn't work, started on their own proposal ""xthin"" -- apparently unaware of the parallel efforts (mike didn't mention them) and the very first posts on xthin said ""I don't think they have any interest in any enhancements that could be used as an argument to raise block size""-- as a reason for not asking or looking. 

By the beginning of March 2016 they had an implementation running, though it was a [huge spiraling patch](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/pull/147). Once it was running it was heavily marketed, often with insane claims like saying it had a hundred fold bandwidth reduction (exacerbated by the fact that its internal accounting was initially wrong).

On March 9th, contributors on the Bitcoin dev list found out about ""xthin"" and asked Andrew stone if they'd be interested in writing a BIP or other specification for it but they declined.

Meanwhile, in Feburary/March Matt had been [working on](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/commits/udp-wip) a version of the low-latency proposal with an eye on also supporting the efficient transfer proposal. Given the 0.13 release timeframe, I asked him if he could focus on the efficient transfer so we could get it done ahead of segwit. He did, and he went and pretty much immediately had it working-- implemented considerably improved version of my design sketch. He and I spent much of the next month testing it and testing it with other people in small scale use and refining the implementation. On May 2nd Matt posted a draft specification to the list which was later assigned BIP152.

The BIP152 spec resulted in a lot of public discussion, including comments from Tom Zander (who wanted us to use UTF-8 to encode variable length integers because he was unaware of the varint encodings already in Bitcoin) and PeterR -- who complained that the protection we had against collision attacks was pointless and that we should remove it (xthin has no such protection for its short IDs), his argument was that 64-bit collisions were computationally infeasible to produce. I refuted this by responding to his message with a collision. (Xthin remains vulnerable to collision based DOS attacks).

The proposal was updated in various ways in response to commentary, including reducing it from the two varint types that Zander complained about to just one (the normal bitcoin p2p one, not UTF-8, however).

On [May 18th Matt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8068) opened a pull request against Bitcoin core,  and on April 27th he published the final version of BIP152 specifying it in detail. Other implementors (e.g. Nicolas Dorier) worked on alternative implementations to verify the specification.

On May 30th BU began publishing a series of articles giving testing results for Xthin.

BU began work in 'eXpedited' on June 3rd-- BIP152 has a minimum block transfer latency of 0.5 RTT.  Xthin has a minimum block transfer latency of 1.5 RTT.  eXpedited is BU's updated thinkblock approach that can achieve 0.5 RTT too, I'm unable to tell when and if it's started working because I've been unable to find any messages talking about results.

BIP152 support was merged in Bitcoin Core master on  June 22nd, and began widespread use.

On July 7th Matt published [Bitcoin FIBRE](http://bitcoinfibre.org/) an ultra low latency relay mechanism based loosely on the low.latency document I wrote that transfers blocks world wide at speeds consistently very close to the speed-of-light-in-fiber physical limit, at a cost of very high bandwith use... He previously had it operational as part of his relay network.

On July 20th Bitcoin Core 0.13 release candidate 1 was published.

On August 1st, BU0.12.1 was published which fixed the bloom filter behavior in xthin that had been making it have [very poor performance](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip010-passed-xtreme-thinblocks.774/page-7#post-13624) outside of short duration tests (the fixes were done some time before, and think included in their May tests, but not 'released' until later).

On August 12th, BU finally started writing [a spec](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/0.12.1bu/doc/bu-xthin-protocol.md) for xthin.

On August 13th Tom Zander posted claiming [Bitcoin Core intends to disrupt the p2p network](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4xkqbk/core_intends_to_disrupt_the_p2p_network_with/), because it turned out that BIP152 and Xthin both use inventory type 2 to represent their compacted blocks. Although BIP152 clearly specified its ID usage and had multiple xthin developers comment on it (Xthin had no written specification until the day before), none raised this as a concern until immediately before 0.13's release. Fortunately, both protocols negotiate the encoding actually used for those message first, so it was harmless, and someone could easily write software that spoke both if they wanted to (for whatever reason).

On Aug 23rd Bitcoin Core 0.13 was released, at the time of the release I observed over 100 nodes offering BIP152 and under a dozen nodes supporting xthin.

&gt; but xthin was done and extensively tested

Only if you a use a very different definition of done: No specification, little public design discussion, only a single implementation, collision attack vulnerability left in place. No release candidates-- just tossed over the wall and fixed up later.  I think it's awesome that they went out and _did_ something, but unfortunate that they ignored most of the prior work that would have made their work much stronger and instead adopted an adversarial poise based on prejudice and misunderstanding. (like... asserting we'd never do anything like this, when known to them we'd proposed the stuff their work was based on!)

d88t2c5,nullc,14,"&gt;  in a production client

I kind of dispute that it was in a production client-- it was in crashy software run on very few nodes, and until 0.12.1 it was terribly inefficient. But it's easy to be first if you discard process, quality, documentation, specification, attack resistance, etc.  We're not in a race: the release cycle of Bitcoin Core is such that  BIP152 already went in the earliest possible release, even had the work started promptly in December when it was roadmapped.

&gt; One thing you missed is that what made Xthin different to previous ideas was /u/bitsenbytes novel use of the bloom filter to hugely reduce

It was proposed in 2013 by Matt: ""&lt; BlueMatt&gt; send a list of txn in your mempool (or bloom filter over them or whatever)!""

We didn't do something like that in BIP152 because it _requires_ at least one round trip where otherwise we can achieve 0.5 RTT -- so it's incompatible with achieving the lowest latency... and because the extra size makes it incompatible with achieving the lowest bandwidth.  The result is kind of oddly in the middle, it's not bad but it's a _LOT_ of complexity and surface area for the scale of improvement it brings, especially with the bad experiences we've previously had with BIP37 DOS attacks.

When it first came out, very few people were mining it and those who were didn't have pro setups or anything, it was mostly side projects and such. The algorithm for how difficult it is to mine a block of bitcoin is partly based on the total amount of computational power in the network. So in essence it was much, much easier to mine larger amounts of bitcoin when it was starting out. 3000 btc would have been very easy to come by mining on a home computer, but at the time btc were valued at cents/btc, because not many people wanted them and they were easy to come by. The first real-world transaction using bitcoin was 2 pizzas for 10,000 btc. ",2016-10-02 06:37:07
d89pst0,evoorhees,107,"As one of the ""old timers"" in Bitcoinland, I am also a huge advocate for and fan of Ethereum. It's true that many in Bitcoin are opposed to Ethereum, but in fact it's not so much about ETH specifically as it is about anything that is an ""altcoin.""  It is not Bitcoiners who hate Ethereum, it is Bitcoin Maximalists, which is a distinct subgroup of Bitcoiners. 

The root cause of the hatred is a combination of tribalism and myopic vision. The tribalists have, unfortunately, started advocating Bitcoin *because it is Bitcoin* instead of because of its virtues and utility. They lose sight of the utility and meaning of the specific technology brand (Bitcoin) and instead focus on the brand itself.  This is a sociological phenomenon that occurs everywhere... nationalism and religion are great examples (many Americans worship the US flag more than they do the principles that the flag was supposed to represent).

Ethereum is beautifully in line with the important principles of Bitcoin. They are compliments. But myopic tribalists are unable to see Ethereum's utility because... it's not Bitcoin and thus it's evil.

In any case, my plea to the Ethereum community is not to make the same collectivist mistake... don't assume all Bitcoiners are anti-Ethereum, just because some are. The Bitcoiners who best understand the purpose and utility of this technology, broadly speaking, are going to be allies to Ethereum and any other decentralized system that empowers people.

Edit: also, to be frank, I am quite sure that if many of the Maximalists diversified, even a little, into some other assets like Ethereum, they would be far less hostile. They won't admit this, of course.  If any Bitcoin maximalists are reading this, give it a try: put 5% of your BTC holdings into ETH and see if you opinion changes over the subsequent weeks.

(1) The paper has a strong assumption that the cryptocurrency is perpetually inflationary. While this is true for Monero and Ethereum it is not true for Bitcoin, and it means even if everything else in the paper held the results would become geometrically less effective over time and ultimately not hold for Bitcoin.

(2) The paper assumes that the level of mining centralization cannot increase. The primary substance of the analysis in the paper is that in a given network there will be some level of fee-per-byte below which the increased risk of orphaning matches the fee level, resulting in an equilibrium. This equilibrium, however, is unstable-- when operating at it, miners can opt to further centralize and significantly increase their income due to having a lower orphaning rate for all the transactions they were already including as well as being able to to collect more. Each increase in centralization would increase the income. The unique stable equilibrium in the paper's model + ability to centralize is where miners centralize all the way and can economically accept every transaction they receive since no more orphaning against third parties would happen.

Effectively, the main argument of the paper is that orphaning will control load. No argument is given for the resulting load being one that anyone could afford to validate, but worse-- to whatever extent orphaning is economically significant miners can more effectively mitigate it by centralizing instead of shunting transactions. Dr. Pinna argues this more formally in the post I linked.

(3) Peter R makes a strong assumption that an increase in the block size increases orphaning. This is an erroneous assumption that arises from a misapplication of information theory.  The author was aware of widely deployed techniques such as the fast block relay protocol (relay network, created in response to orphaning induced centralization) which send less data than the transaction size at the time a block was found than the size of the transactions themselves. However, he mistakes these techniques for compression, and argues that while there may be compression it must be finite and so the relationship must remain (but with the blocksize increased by a potentially arbitrarily large constant factor).  I pointed out that these techniques are not really compression but a early and inefficient form of preconsensus (a class of techniques which which include things like weak blocks). The idea behind preconsensus is that miners, through some mechanism, come to agreement about which transaction data they will include long before the block is found (perhaps several blocks ahead). Then, when a block is actually found, only a constant amount of data must be communicated (a nonce) regardless of the size of the block.  [As an aside, Bitcoin-NG, in parallel, proposes a kind of preconsensus for the same block race mitigation reason, but they use a 'temporary miner identity' based technique; while I'm more interested in mining based preconsensus.]

Any one of these points alone would bar applicability of the work to the Bitcoin system. (1) could be argued to be the weakest, since Bitcoin is inflationary today-- but especially with efficient relay, the resulting 'limit' would be technically and economically equivalent to unlimited long before Bitcoin's inflation was zero.  From a policy perspective, since inflation freeness is a primary value proposition it is in all our interest to not drive the system towards a state where perpetual inflation may be required for its survival.  (2) has the most impact in the short term, because the improved relay technology in (3) is not yet in production, this means that Peter R's argument that orphaning would be an effective control on blocksize is equivalent to an argument that without a blocksize limit we could expect even worse problems with mining centralization.

A disposable R&amp;D network was in use, specifically to avoid disrupting testnet as Ver did.

&gt; which is exactly what it's for

No it's not-- it's for testing downstream software. It tests implementations only as a last resort.

Moreover, BIP109 (and the software ver was running) were released to production long before anyone even began testing it on testnet. Had Bitcoin Classic's timeline been followed the faulty software would have been running on mainnet long before.

1- we don't need new laws
2- theft and fraud are already illegal

Enforcement: If you are genuinely concerned about consumers, stop crimes like OneCoin

That's why it also says ""enforcement agencies"" not lawmakers or regulators (though many regulators are also enforcers) 

Does this make sense?

You can't see that there's a conflict of interest between a moderator of many bitcoin forums, who regularly promotes the Blockstream/Core agenda and censors most opinion/news about competing protocols, having financial ties to an employee of that very same company? Dubious financial ties at that, considering Slickage never delivered any type of new forum software, even for half a million dollars.

What level of proof will finally be enough to convince people, do you need to hear it from Theymos' mouth before you can entertain the possibility? Thankfully, as a human being I am equipped with faculties of reason and am able to make logical inferences.

1. Theymos is friends with Warren Togami.
2. Warren Togami has contributed code to bitcointalk.org before
3. After 'years of searching', theymos settled on 'the most capable dev team' at Warren Togami's recommendation. 
4. Theymos has paid this team $100,000 per month since early 2014, and is still making payments. 
5. Although not publicly disclosed, Warren Togami is a member of the dev team that he convinced Theymos to hire and pay ludicrous sums of money to, as evinced by the fact that he has an email address and contributes code to Slickage's repos. 
6. Warren Togami is also an employee of Blockstream, concurrently with his ongoing duties for Slickage.
7. Theymos actively deletes any posts from \r\bitcoin that are critical of Blockstream or Bitcoin Core, which Blockstream heavily supports and contributes to. 
8. Theymos also actively deletes any posts from \r\bitcoin that speak positively of any alternative implementations of bitcoin, and also bans entire companies for even speaking positively of them (See Theymos vs /u/bdarmstrong).

Short of seeing Theymos outright admitting embezzlement (and why in the world would he do that?), I think we can look at the eight **facts** presented above and conclude that something fishy is going on. Can we know the exact nature of the relationship between Theymos and Blockstream? No. But we can use our brains to see that obviously something is not right.

d8fgl98,eeksskee,29,"I thought this was mostly fair wrt ETH, even though I disagree with much of it, and well-written.  I appreciate that it lacked vitriol, which alone adds to its credibility.

But he quotes Satoshi Institute (ye gods), Greg Maxwell (3x!), Theymos (from 2.5yrs ago!) in one sentence as proof that many people have said it won't work.  Later comes quotes from an anonymous HN guy (from 2! years ago!) and Peter Todd saying multiple clients is madness.  Most of his case rests on appeal to authority and appeal to theorycrafting on how people have already figured out what will an won't work in this new space.  As an aside, I still don't see how multiple clients could ever be bad -- I feel like we just saw examples of it being more robust.  

I don't think he made a persuasive case for anything.  Specifically, he makes no case for **Short ETH, Long BTC**.  There is nothing that ties this to the relative value of ETH vs BTC, which sits around 10%, and nothing that is persuasive or illuminating.  It's a rehash of what he has tweeted (he links to maybe 10 of his own tweets), what Maxwell has rage reddited, what Todd has concern trolled, but nothing ties it to price or value.  If anything, if you take his Part 1 critique at face value, it makes ETH at 10% of BTC's price look like a bargain.  

Any short ETH / long BTC needs to actually make that rel val trade have context.  He listed a bunch of weaknesses about ETH.  Ok.  Great.  But why does that mean BTC isn't worth 50% less than it is today?  Or that ETH should be worth 20% of BTC and not 10%?  Actual evidence is useful, rather than biased theorycrafting.  This wouldn't pass muster at a sell-side bank in an equity think piece --&gt; it's not an actionable document.

The one piece of numerical context he puts in, he jumbles:

*""…In the last six months Bitcoin Core had 800 non-merge commits from 91 authors across 469 merges, while go-ethereum [geth] had 247 from 22 authors across 105 merges.
Based on these numbers, one could say that Bitcoin displays four times as much activity and diversification compared to Ethereum.""*

Apples to oranges.

How many commits and non-merge commits from how many authors did Bitcoin have when it was $1bn in size or 1 year old?  Wouldn't you have to include Parity just to start?  As a handsome man pointed out to me, ""it's an insane way to look at things. Early lifecycle commits are usually bigger, while late lifecycle changes are minute. Why isn't he comparing lines of code, development debt, or any measure of code quality, density?""

Any short on ETH should focus on the fact that most of these dapps are likely to fail.  That the technology is likely to fail (big attack surface being point against it, one of many).  Or that even if things work out, it will take years before you see anything.  

He cites some weaknesses that he can't grok or handicap or translate it into anything other than feels.

People die as a result of these actions, because they are shut out from independent trading.

I find it inexcusable.

**Edit/Add:** It seems Blockstream's people genuinely don't understand what a $0.12 fee for a transaction, as opposed to Satoshi's pool of free transactions, does to the over one billion people who live on less than two dollars a day.

What happens is they can't afford the transaction at all. This means they can't afford to buy food, water, and other necessities - not because of the cost of the food, but because of the cost of the *transaction*. This means they die. Literally. Usually their children die first.

Bitcoin _held_ - past tense - the promise of enabling these people to financial transactions, while it was still aligned with Satoshi's vision.

(And yes, these people usually can afford a cellphone as a one-time purchase.)

d8gaxei,Falkvinge,25,"&gt; How can this [unmaintained software breaking] happen? I thought that - being a softfork - segwit is backwards compatible.

I'm developing solutions based on bitcoin, so perhaps I'm more acutely aware of this pain point than people who are developing bitcoin itself. But [this writeup](https://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=951) is more to the point. Quoting:

""Second, Segregated Witness breaks much of the existing software deployed across the cryptocurrency industry. Block explorers are likely to be one of the most noticeable losses - as soon as the first Segregated Witness transaction is mined, many explorers would go offline. Having created block explorers for 200 coins myself, I assert that handling non-standard transactions is an extremely complex task. Coin clients don't keep track of balances for all addresses, so the only way to do that is to rewrite your software to understand the new data format, and then reindex the entire blockchain.

In our case, it took over three months before we were able to get a successful run of our block explorer code where there were no math errors or missing transactions. Because the transactions are summed since the beginning of time, bugs don't appear until days of indexing have occurred, and since it isn't apparent where the sum is wrong, debugging consists largely of guessing. The only way to confirm that the new code works is to delete the database and reindex again - and that assumes that one knows that the totals are right. We have 1.1TB of block explorer data for coins whose blockchains total about twice the size of bitcoin's, so that means constant reindexing of 500GB of linked and summarized data. Many analysis services would fail (or worse, return erroneous data) because developers can't afford the time to upgrade them, leading to increased centralization of many critical Bitcoin functions.

But it's not just block explorers that would suffer. Exchanges, which often have custom implementations of the Bitcoin client, would need to modify production code that has in some cases been working for years with no issues. With huge amounts of money at stake, well-managed companies don't just change code in production without extensive testing. The cost to do this upgrade will be enormous, and that's why I believe that uptake of Segregated Witness would be far less than the Core projects.""",2016-10-06 20:43:53

d8fjbr2,cdecker,22,"What ends up on the blockchain is just the aggregate of all transfers that were conducted over the channel, not individual transfers. We're also using onion routing such that intermediate hops do not learn the sender, the recipient or their position in the path, so as long as a single hop in your route is not colluding to trace your transfer, you should be safe. Routing random other payments through your node gives you plausible deniability. Even nodes with a global view of all the traffic could not collude its information into individual transfers.

Comparing that to the current blockchain in which every single payment can be seen by everybody, and many examples exist in which addresses have been clustered, and even individuals have been identified, I'm pretty happy with our setup.

Opening channels may leak information that is true, but only if the endpoints are actually sender and recipient. If we were to just open random channels with other nodes then an observer could not learn anything about the transfers performed over these channels.

The comment about size was not well formulated, I meant it gives you more flexibility as to what amounts can be transferred. The current Bitcoin fees make transfers below a certain threshold very expensive, while in lightning they just work.",2016-10-06 05:47:15

d8flbek,cdecker,12,"I think we mostly agree here, we do not claim to provide perfect privacy, it's an improvement over having every transaction in the blockchain. And you're of course right that traffic analysis can unmask some usage patterns, just like TOR can be used in unsafe ways. But I'd argue that lightning is far more private than Bitcoin in its current state. I should probably have specified that I am referring to transfers that are common, so they can hide in a large number of similar transfers :-)

We will probably also see papers with interesting ways to unmask users, and I'm looking forward to it, since it allows us to improve. One of the nicest features of lightning is that we can improve our protocol locally, without needing everybody to agree, so if we find a bug or something that can be improved, we can easily roll it out.

Randomly opening channels isn't as bad as one may think. Erdoes-Renyi Graphs, i.e., graphs in which each edge is equally likely to be created, have a very low diameter with some other very nice properties :-)

And finally about micropayments: especially in the case of full blocks we need a solution like lightning. Full blocks increase the fees, pushing more and more use-cases into infeasibility, since they'd simply be prohibitively expensive. So a system that allows you to bundle any number of transfers into two transactions that are settled on chain is extremely valuable. You are of course right that if I open a channel, only do a single transfer over it and then close the channel, then I'm no better than bitcoin, but a good channel will transfer its coins back and forth millions of times, and if we shave some minute fees off of every transfer we can afford the on-chain settlement fees.

I agree with you that many are seeing lightning as a silver bullet, solving everything, which is unlikely. I think it is a great tool to have in our toolbox, and we will see what use cases it is used for and which use-cases are better handled by Bitcoin :-)",2016-10-06 06:29:25

d8hvu8c,jeanduluoz,24,"Everyone likes segregating witness data (segwit). People have a problem with the specific implementation and parameters of segwit, particularly because there are other solutions out there. But to just answer your questions in a brief summary:

*Why the current segwit implementation is unpopular*

1. **Governance**: Hard forks are opt-in. During a hardfork, everyone in the network chooses one fork or the other (or does nothing and has coins on both forks). Everyone is free to choose their fate. In a ""soft-fork"", you are forced into a network change even if you didn't consent. Soft forking is non-consensual, whereas hardforking is.

2. [**Technical debt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt): the segwit solution is kludgy, basically tricking old nodes, which never see the segwit data. They think the new blocks are always less than one MB, while upgraded nodes enforce the new size limit. There's a lot of funky, hacky stuff going on (more on that later) that is costly to developers, code maintainers, and the actual ability of the network to scale going forward. 

3. **Misleading the community**: A lot of stuff here. First segwit is not a blocksize increase, even though you've probably heard that 1,000 times. It's one of many solutions to transaction malleability, which is great. It also enables lightning, which is great. But it does nothing to increase the blocksize, as many core devs and others claim. it does increase the TX throughput rate, which is ultimately the thing that matters - i don't understand why people make an effort to lie and twist words about how segwit increases the blocksize, when it's clear that it doesn't do that, isn't meant to do that, and doesn't matter.  There are claims of doubling or quadrupling the blocksize instantly - all incorrect. At 100% adoption, it will at best increase TX capacity by about 70%. That's great, but adoption will take a while, and therefore an TX throughput rate increase will only occur at the rate it's adopted. 

4. **Central Planning and failed economics**: Segwit provides a 75% discount / subsidy to multisig transactions. We now have a 2-tier caste system for transactions - subsidized ones by our central planners who believe they should ""nudge"" people into behavior they approve of, and plebian transactions, which are discouraged. Net neutrality is alive, but blockchain neutrality is dead - we now have some transactions that are ""more equal than others."" Also, segwit TXs are artificially inexpensive, which leads to non-optimal outcomes as expensive transactions are consumed at a higher-than-efficient rate due to the artificially low costs. Plus, the institution-level hypocrisy and inefficiency of relying on a small oligarchy of central planners to determine how a community interacts. 

5. **Inefficient**: We get ""bigger blocks"" but can only use 40% of the data, because we duplicate a lot of the data in segwit. So blocks are now ""4MB"" because that is semantically true based on the restructuring of segwit transactions. This is where the ""1.6 MB equivalent blocksize increase effect"" comes from - we need to move around a maximum 4MB of data due to the data segregation, yet we only get to use from 40% of that because much of the data is duplicated (40% * 4MB = ~1.6 MB). This is very kludgy and inefficent, and poses severe technical debt down the road. Everyone agrees block sizes will need to increase at some point. Yet when blocks grow, for example, 2MB-equivalent blocks will require moving 8MB of data, 3MB-equivalent blocks require moving 12MB of data so forth. This makes scaling with segwit an absolute nightmare. 

6. **Too little, too late**: max, segwit offers a 70% tx throughput increase a year from now when we reached capacity 6 months ago. It's a matter of priorities. Blocksizes need to increase regardless, and they need to be market-determined. We had no max blocksize for the first year or 2 of bitcoin, and it was intended as a temporary kludge. Now we're building more kludges around past kludges. 

7. **""On-Chain"" scaling**: Scaling ""off chain"" by relying on lightning doesn't scale bitcoin. It just builds another network. It's kind of oxymoronic to describe anything as ""off-chain scaling"". I'm scaling off-chain with coinbase and circle transactions rightnow. 

*Other Options to increase TX throughput rate (better than segwit IMO)*

1. Flexible transactions

2. xthin / compact blocks: Both very successful 

3. Dynamic blocksize to allow an efficient, competitive market rather than central planning.

4. Headfirst mining

There's a lot of stuff out there that has similar or better scaling effects to segwit, and are far less costly. Segwit is great to solve TX malleability and enable lightning, but scaling became a serious issue soon after segwit was planned. Segwit got shoehorned into serving as a scaling solution, when really it's nothing of the sort. It was set up for failure as a scaling solution from the start.

Anyway, that's a super brief answer that leaves out a lot of details, sorry for the wall of text. You can go over to /r/btc and post any question you want - people will be sure to help you out. There's no censorship, so feel free to say whatever you want.

Segregated Witness encoded transactions appear to be spendable by different people than they actually are spendable by.  A non-upgraded block explorer on a Segregated Witness network would look like it was a free-for-all.

Incidentally, this is why you should not use Segregated Witness for your transactions.  The reason is that someone is undoubtedly going to fork Bitcoin if adoption looks likely.  If you upgrade to a Segregated Witness version, your change will be lost on the fork.  If you have 25BTC and pay someone 1, the 24BTC would be replayed on the non-Segregated Witness fork, which will retain some value (or even take back over), and become the property of the first to claim it.

We saw in Ethereum Classic that people like me who believed that ETC was a scam were still able to make a thousand dollars by selling out ETC.

d8iwdr2,Itchy_Craphole,43,"Welp... Lets see.... 

Two things today... 

Looking at futures it appears we are primed and ready to make a monthly high. Looking at the rest of the charts, 3d squishies are growing and that upward trend sure looks pretty... 

 It seems the consensus among this echo chamber is bullish, and rightfully so. I do believe we are approaching another blip upwards. It may fizzle out in the 700-800 range with months more consolidation afterwards, or it may garnish media attention as countless other world currencies tumble and markets around the world react, pushing us up to test the ATH... who knows....  Right now, there are many annalists and experts openly speaking of a doomsday in the making, and to be honest, it does appear as though the writing is on the wall. 

Right now, I think bitcoins biggest advantage, is it is viewed by some as a hedge against a potentially spiraling market. For example, hearing Gross discuss alternatives for protecting your money and mentioning gold quickly followed by bitcoin. I liked hearing that. Even if they aren't actively endorsing it, I want more people to say what he said. That is what is going to drive people to purchase, not the blocksize and the array of other complicated fundamentals that need to be addressed. For the average investor or even the big booku bucks investor, at least for the short to medium long term, that is what will be the driving force behind the next wave of user... I think while there are many other competitors out there, bitcoin still remains the top dog and the one most investors would feel comfortable investing in. 

Hopefully... again very speculative, but if cards and chips were on the table that would be my bet.  

Now, with all that being sad and the inebriated rambling behind us.....

**___________________________________________________**

 Following the 2013 bubble my life changed significantly. I owe a great deal to bitcoin, and don't hate me for saying it but dogecoin as well. Profit is after all profit.

 Two years ago I was able to move into a house too large for just myself down by the beach here in South Carolina....Honestly its been great :D

However tonight, having decided not to evacuate, I ride out this hurricane which is about to hit in the coming hours. 

I have prepared for a rowdy night, and am certainly expecting to lose power, for how long who knows. 

Regardless, I have charged all my jazz and have back up bat-packs, Ill likely be posting/trading/reading this sub off the dimly lit mobile for a few days or week. Ive got a freezer full of ice, and frozen food, and two heavy duty coolers to preserve meat and stuff as long as possible. I have a shit ton of canned and non perishables and two tanks of propane for the grill. My bathtub is full of water, along with countless other plastic storage containers. I have a main hallway which I can close the six oak doors to and am entirely blocked off, within that hallway I have even rigged up a lil panic room of sorts in a closet. The bug out bag is ready and has all my important documents and my dogs latest vaccinations and whatnot. My main concern is the storm surge and ultra high tide they keep talking about, I know sandy took everyone by surprise... lets hope all the hyperbole and fear mongering the Weather channel and other news outlets have been spewing for the past week is an exaggeration. So yeah, see ya guys around, best of luck with all your trades!  No one miss me too much while I am away! :D

Luke warm coffee is better than no coffee. Also, I'm out of sugar, used maple syrup instead. 7/10 not bad. 

Still very windy outside but looking at more live feed radar maps, storm seems to be passing into North Carolina. No substantial storm surge or flooding in my neck of the woods, however a flash flood emergency has been issued an hour ago for my area and is still in effect... a few miles away some areas no longer have boardwalks and inlets. There is an island in one of the marinas that is inhabited by a few dozen goats. It has been reported to be completely underwater, but rumor is someone evacuated the goats and peacocks two days ago, so phew. Idk why but a panic went through me when I heard about goat island flooding!!! Good to know they are likely ok...  

 Jub Jub is content with his bone and is making a mess with chunks and slobber all over the living room. Only tree downed in my immediate area is my neighbors  and it seems to have caused no damage.  Will be checking in on a friends dogs up the street in a few hours.

d8j2uar,joskye,14,"Relative to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in terms of progress, scalability, adaptability, resilience, unrealized potential, realised potential, functionality, capability, projected capability, adoption, real world use, developer interest, financial sector interest (need I go on) Ethereum is completely undervalued.

We need to factor in the next biggest crypto at one point was xmr which was much more limited in functionality. The biggest competitor to ETH is AMP which is vapourware presently for at least another year. 

The question is, does bitcoin with all its problems and limitations deserve a 600usd valuation per coin?

There is an argument to say all cryptocurrency is overvalued but if we live in an actual universe where ETH is under 20-30usd at any point that bitcoin is valued at 600usd, then it is a point at which ETH is clearly undervalued.

Frankly speaking ETH holdings even on current bear slope have resisted continual faster devaluation of GBP and will do against the USD, Euro and Yuan should these suddenly decline. With the exception of gold and certain stocks, Eth is as good if not a better long term investment than these fiat currencies and bitcoin at this point.

I imagine in the current bear trend we will hear the voice of bear sentiments loudest but fundamentally nothing has changed since devcon 2 except for continued news that large financial organisations clearly see more real world utility in ETH or private forks of it than other cryptocurrencies. If this cannot convince the markets, so be it; they can live in a world of pump &amp; dumps and scamcoins.

The fact is ETH is trailblazing innovation so the bumps it is receiving along the way speak well to it's investor confidence given how little it's price has been truly rocked along the way. 

No one else is doing the kind of stuff Ethereum is so if the markets wish to penalise it for the inevitable problems it will encounter and overcome (with a track record for already doing so) then they are effectively penalizing the progress of cryptos as a whole.

d8is49c,p2pecash,14,"Theymos controls /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org. The information there is what gets picked up by the media, so by extension, he controls the majority of the dialogue around Bitcoin that reaches the mainstream.

Greg worked as a moderator at bitcointalk.org, and is also the CTO of a company that is widely recognized as killing all efforts for native scaling and strangling Bitcoin's organic growth.

Both Theymos and Greg have denied that there is any connection between these forums and blockstreem, despite aggressive censorship and banning of anyone who posts information that contradicts blockstreem's business plans (I've been banned three times and censored more times than I can count, so I speak from experience).

Theymos took donations to fix bitcointalk.org that appreciated to over $1m dollars while he still had control of the funds. He 'paid' the development shop where this Togami character was listed as a founder most of that money to produce forum software, but no code was apparently written or demonstrated publicly.

Now this Togami character works at Blockstreem.  

Theymos says Togami never worked at Slickage, yet his [github history](https://github.com/wtogami) says otherwise.

So does [this record](http://archive.is/Ja5hB) showing Warren with an @slickage email address!

d8i2ant,thieflar,12,"&gt; the capacity increase from adopting SegWit is not uniform over all transactions

The capacity increase from SegWit is that *all* transactions get their signature data discounted by 75%. So any transaction that includes a signature (i.e. just about every single transaction) will get a 75% discount on the signature portion of its data. All transactions benefit from this.

The thing is, some transactions use more signature data than others (an obvious example being multisig transactions). So these transaction types will benefit *more* (relatively speaking) from using SegWit, because more of their transaction data is able to be discounted.

&gt;Therefore, while a blocksize increase would have a linear effect on capacity

That's not strictly true, though, as we can see with SegWit. SegWit *is* a blocksize increase, there is no escaping that. Pre-SegWit, any block that was larger than 1MB which a miner tries to publish is rejected by fully validating nodes and considered out-of-consensus. Post-SegWit, blocks that are larger than 1MB which miners try to publish can be accepted by fully validating nodes. As a consequence, blocks will be larger than 1MB, so the max blocksize will have been increased.

A hard-fork to increase max blocksize (a la Bitcoin Classic) would indeed have a linear effect on capacity, yes, but that's just one method of implementing a blocksize increase.

&gt;the effective factor lie somewhere around 1.7 (which could equally be achieved with a 1.7MB blocksize limit).

Not exactly. It couldn't ""equally"" be achieved with a 1.7MB blocksize limit, because a 1.7MB blocksize limit...

1) Wouldn't allow blocks up to 3.6 MB (which SegWit does).

2) Wouldn't help with the balancing of incentives regarding UTXO set growth (which SegWit does).

3) Wouldn't solve transaction malleability (which SegWit does).

4) Would require a contentious hard-fork (which SegWit does not).

5) Would (potentially) open up new attack vectors (e.g. large-sigops attacks, where transactions are published that take more than 10 minutes to verify)... which SegWit prevents.

____________________________________

If I'm not mistaken, though, you understand these points. Your main objection, if I understand correctly, seems to be the fact that relatively-signature-intensive transactions stand to benefit more from SegWit than others. But this indicates a narrow perspective, in my opinion. Consider this hypothetical...

What if Bitcoin originally came with two types of transactions: **nice** transactions and **mean** transactions. Nice transactions are quicker to verify, smaller to store and transmit, and easier to format or display. Mean transactions take longer to verify, are larger and more expensive for the network to deal with, and more difficult to work with in terms of formatting and parsing. Besides these factors, both types of transactions are functionally equivalent. For some reason (perhaps due to an oversight by Satoshi), both types of transactions cost the same amount in terms of fees, and neither is prioritized for block inclusion, so making a mean transaction costs no more than making a nice one.

In this scenario, it's clear that it would be better (and easier to scale) if everyone used nice transactions, but for whatever reason (maybe it's just easier), people tend to use mean transactions just as often as they do nice ones. Then someone comes along, let's call him Wieter Puille, and comes up with a clever mechanism by which we can distinguish these transactions and change how they're handled. In the end, he finds a way to increase the blocksize to 100MB, but 98MB of this is reserved for ""nice-only"" transactions because having more than 2MB of mean transactions in a block causes other huge headaches for the network.

In this scenario, the blocksize would have been unambiguously increased -- if everyone used 100% mean transactions, it would only increase by 1MB (from 1MB to 2MB -- a mere 100% increase), but if everyone started using nice transactions (which we would expect, if they're cheaper after his solution is implemented) then we would see a blocksize increase of 99MB (from 1MB to 100MB -- a 9900% increase). In reality, some people would keep using mean transactions out of laziness or lack of education (while the rational actors moved on to nice-only), so we would likely see the blocksize increase somewhere *between* 1MB and 99MB, and we wouldn't be able to predict this perfectly ahead of time -- but we could make educated guesses about the final effect ahead of time.

Nothing about the above scenario would mean that the max blocksize wasn't increased -- it clearly was. Just because it provides *more* of a benefit to nice transactions doesn't mean that it isn't a blocksize increase. It would also (both in my hypothetical and in real SegWit) set things up nicely for smooth scaling down the line, by balancing incentives properly for scalability and safe capacity increases later on that wouldn't be possible if the network stuck with primarily-mean transactions.

This comment got way too long, way too fast. Sorry. Hopefully you see my point, though.",2016-10-08 01:40:56
d8ingis,todu,12,"The first unconditional Bitcoin fork, or Bitcoin ""spinoff"" as we call it, is already being developed by /u/ftrader over in /r/btcfork. It's based on the Bitcoin Unlimited source code.

At the same time and independently of the above, I think it's only a matter of time until Bitcoin Unlimited has hard forked Blockstream and Bitcoin Core off of the network with enough support from the current miners to sustain a healthy network and currency. I think that miners will sooner rather than later start mining at Roger Ver's new Bitcoin Unlimited mining pool that uses the Bitcoin Unlimited default blocksize limit setting which is 16 MB.

The current miners have all suddenly (after 2016-08-01) stopped complaining about the small limit. That does not mean that they suddenly started supporting Blockstream and Bitcoin Core. If that would've been the case, then I'm sure that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core would have announced such support publicly and proudly. 

They simply do not have support from the current miners. So my guess is that the current miners are preparing to use Roger Ver's Bitcoin Unlimited pool to activate Bitcoin Unlimited on the current network. Maybe that's the ""[Terminator plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4qk7et/wow_chinese_miners_revolt_and_announce_terminator/?st=iu0gz9oj&amp;sh=a05b7dd5)"" that was rumored 3 months ago.

d8kb1ud,exmachinalibertas,18,"&gt; I may as well not even be using bitcoin...

Well, not really.  There's an important distinction between something like the lightning network and something like Paypal or Visa.  It may be off chain, but it still requires your digital signature.  You're still in control, it's just that you don't announce publicly to the network that you're in control.  Your coins still can't be moved or forged or anything.  And at any point you can publish the current state of your coins to the network and make everything back on chain.

Here's a simple example of a simple payment channel:  I want to watch a movie you have, and you charge by the minute.  You give me your public key, and I give you my public key, and we make a multisig address that we both can verify as accurate and requiring our key.  I put a bitcoin in the multisig address on-chain.  Then off-chain, every minute I make a transaction sending from the multisig address to your address 0.01 bitcoins, and 0.99 back to my address, and I send this transaction to you privately, without broadcasting it.  Then the next minute, I make a new transaction, double-spending that first one, sending you 0.02 and me 0.98.  Again, I send that to you privately.  I do this over and over every minute, with you getting incrementally more, without broadcasting any of them, just sending them privately to you.  I can't ever broadcast an earlier one (which pays me more), because I don't have a copy of the that has your signature.  You however have my signatures, and you will obviously sign and broadcast the one which pays you the most, which is the most recent one.

Eventually, the movie will end, or I will stop sending transactions (and you will stop sending me the movie), and you will broadcast the most recent transaction I send you, which will pay you the appropriate amount.  That's the only on-chain transaction.  As far as the Bitcoin network can see, there were only two transactions -- the initial funding of the multisig, and the last payout that paid you and send me the leftover change.  But in reality, I was sending you transactions over and over, and at any time, you could have stopped everything and shipped the most recent one back on-chain.  At no time could I defraud you or steal my money back or do anything that would have harmed you.  Your money was still safe, and you could broadcast the transaction to get at your money any time you wanted.  You just didn't, because we had a mutually beneficial arrangement and you wanted to wait for the next off-chain transaction I sent you.  But if that didn't come on time, or if there was any other problem, you could have immediately put everything back on-chain by broadcasting your most recently received transaction.

That's a simple version of what the lightning network does.  (There's more to it, and it's more complicated, and unlike in my example, any party can at any point put stuff back on-chain, and there's economic incentive so that nobody can benefit by doing anything other than what they're supposed to do.)  But you get the idea:  one or two on-chain transactions to settle a whole lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes.  And even though it happens off-chain, it's still secured and never at any risk.

Does that make sense?  Do you see why it's *significantly* better than Paypal/Visa types of things?

Don't get me wrong, I prefer on-chain scaling and I run and mine on a BU full node.  But the lightning network is in principle much much different and better than Paypal/Visa.  Just because it's not on chain doesn't mean it's not secure.  You're still leveraging the Bitcoin network's security.",2016-10-09 19:21:22

Removing the blocksize limit + using the existing micropayment channels is good enough to make Bitcoin available to billions of people and keeping it's valuable characteristics. 

There is one thing we know, that works just fine: Bitcoins blockchain. Nobody has found an attack for it in 7 years (crazy that it's been so long). And people want to give up on that working principle for a very complicated solution with known and unknown attack vectors, which isn't close to being ready.

And I still find the idea of ""locking funds"" and using a very unstable ""fee market"" for settlements highly troubling. I have no problem to put 10-100$ a month into a payment channel to pay for video streaming or something like that. But I don't want to lock up all my money in a (possible unsafe) Lightning system just so I can transfer it.

Lightning is possibly a lot better than the current micropayment channels, but it doesn't replace onchain transactions and nobody knows how safe it will be. Remember the integer overflow in Bitcoin?

What developments? Most of the chatter seems to be laughing and joking around, not ""talking shop"". This is a stark contrast to the Satoshi's Vision conference. Every conversation I overheard there was more on point, with much less laughing and joking around. At SV there was this vibe of ""we're here to save bitcoin"" and everyone was very focused on figuring out what it will take to fork or whatever. At Scaling Bitcoin is just a social gathering with some boring presentations you have to sit through. BTW, I sat in the back and could see everyone's screens. The guy right in front of me spent the entire conference sending emails. Occasionally he would close his screen to look up, then 5 minutes later would go back to his email. I don't blame him, the talks were very boring.

&gt; I am of the opinion that Fungibility is extremely related to scaling.

How so?",2016-10-09 05:50:58
d8jq9oi,freework,12,"&gt; but so far I have found most of them to be incredibly exciting and they give me a great deal of optimism about what's ahead.

The LN, and Sidechain presentations said nothing new. Neither projects have a release date. Both talks were technical blabble that went nowhere. Some of the speakers, I must admit were very good speakers. The cadence in their voices and smoothness in delivering what they were saying was very good. They sound like they know what they are talking about, but if you listen past all the polish and focus on the words that they are actually saying, it's all complete bullshit. I guarantee you 6 months from now when they have the next iteration of these Scaling Bitcoin conferences, the LN and Sidechain presentations will be the exact same way again: 100% technoblabble with no release date.

&gt; and Bitcoin doesn't even come close by comparison.

Bitcoin is already fungible enough. If online crack dealers can move millions of dollars in BTC without getting caught, the rest of us will be all right. It turns out despite the fact that every coin has it's complete history attached, it is very easy to ""tumble"" coins so that the history is obscured. Someone at the conference brought up the idea of sending BTC to an online casino and then immediately withdrawing the funds to ""clean"" your coins. TumbleBit is overly complicated and not even needed.",2016-10-09 07:21:01

I genuinely believe that the Nakamoto consensus, the key innovation at the heart of decentralised blockchains, actually functions.

The permissionless, utterly unrestrained ability to fork Bitcoin is a foundational principle and its primary means of defense against political capture.

If for any reason such as bribery, violent coercion, or simply disagreement, Bitcoin development should be crippled or diverted down a harmful path then there is nothing to stop the economic and functional system majority from forking and thus routing around the damage.

Bitcoin was designed in full recognition that as it grows there will emerge an abundance of often entirely contrary teams of devs who all envision themselves as stewards or saviours of the system via their particular pet theories and projects, as well as nefarious entities with ill intent such as certain nation states and legacy financial institutions.

In reality Bitcoin devs are readily replaceable, all of them, with only the ability to fulfil bitcoins desires and never the power to dictate them.

Developers remain at Liberty to present code to Bitcoin and ask ""is this what you want?"" but can not declare ""this is what you're getting"".

d8lmwco,nullc,17,"One of the great challenges there is that the security vs time tradeoff for a given block interval depends on network parameters that are hard to observe and change over time.   If you use too long an interblock interval, nothing bad happens-- security grows slightly slower. If you use a somewhat too short interval security is significantly damaged.

The tradeoff in security gain per time vs block interval relative to propagation time looks something like this-- http://people.xiph.org/~greg/fn_secure_shape_napkin.png (iignore the actual specifics of the graph-- I'm citing it just to show the general shape of the tradeoff that I'm describing)  so ideally you'd want to be at the peak, but since we can only get it approximately right, we should strongly prefer being slightly too long vs slightly too short, because too short can result in a pretty rapid drop off..

We've certainly had periods where blocks were taking a _very_ long time to propagate-- until various improvements, like caching and the relay network solved the issues... but the conservative interblock interval in Bitcoin kept things from going off the rails. I find that hard to argue with, but it's easy to argue with if you forget that we don't just need to work on average, we need to work in adversarial conditions, all the time.

In alpha software prior to Bitcoin's release, the target interblock interval was 15 minutes, and it was reduced to 10 minutes for release.

[What is... DOG BEAR?](http://press.invincible.ink/what-is-dog-bear/)

Dog Bear is a game of generating and playing out a Metal Gear Solid-style sneaking mission. Dog Bear is a few good secret agents sitting around a poker table, answering The Boss's question, ""Well, that was a hell of a mission. How *did* you survive all that?""

Dog Bear uses a deck of cards to generate your code name - whether you're Eel Octopus, Whisky Flying, or Autumn Shark - and flesh out your character with traits like ""Never backs down"" and ""Eyepatch"" and ""Secretly a dog"". The cards also determine your mission - whether you're in an abandoned prison complex trying to kill a school of cyborg piranhas before the dangerous eco-terrorists can unleash them, or infiltrating an arctic cold war bunker to rescue an intriguing scientist from misguided bitcoin thieves.

It's The Boss's job to weave these elements into a mission and determine what obstacles you face, and your job to use the cards in your hand to overcome those obstacles. The four suits have different uses as both tactics and obstacles:


* Club: Fight

* Diamond: Tech

* Spade: Sneak

* Heart: Feels

That's right, when faced with a guard you try to face them in head-on combat, or spray them with knock-out gas, sneak past them, or... you might explain to The Boss that you knew this guard - you grew up with him, and you didn't know how he ended up with these terrorists, but you knew you could win him over to your side. However, when you play a card to overcome an obstacle, The Boss will flip another card off the deck to see if you succeed. If the opposing card is higher, The Boss will explain how your attempt was thwarted, or how it only led to more complications, based on the suit of the higher card.

Dog Bear is not a challenging game - after all, you all made it out of the mission and back to The Boss for your debriefing. There are ways to help your teammates that make failure very easy to avoid, unless you want to fail to see where it takes the story. Dog Bear is a game of ridiculous scenarios and shocking plot twists, where no matter how stacked the odds are against you, you know you'll find a way, *some* way, to get out alive.",2016-10-12 23:55:01

you know that's bullshit right? 

One of the generalized concepts you need to understand about these offchain solutions is that the mainchain cannot be aware of what's going on real-time on them. It's called fire walling them off so that an attack on them (which is clearly easier since they are NOT Bitcoin) cannot blow back and disrupt the mainchain.  also the data processing requirements from monitoring two chains would be prohibitive. Therefore, you are stuck self monitoring/securing your tx's while your coin is locked away over there. For instance, with LN you have to hire a monitoring service in the event that your counter-party tries to broadcast a prior mutually signed tx that steals money from you.  Or monitor it real time yourself which sucks. Same with SC's. If an attacker publishes a SPV proof to steal your money, either you're prepared to intercept that proof within X number of blocks or lose your coin.  BOTH of those scenarios represent a distinct change in how the user has to operate (more work) , and no, it's not as simple or easy or secure as Bitcoin Itself. Nor is it as cheap.

Currently, the only sane way of defining a cryptocurrency is to point to specific full-node software. For example, the ETF could say that they recognize Bitcoin as the currency resulting from Bitcoin Core version 0.13.0 with SHA-256 hash [...]. Because the ETF exactly specifies the software version and hash, this does not delegate authority to the developers of this software, but it does exactly identify a unique currency.

It will eventually end the same way as any ponzi: the price will go to zero, and by then thousands of people will *necessarily* be left with losses adding to a billion dollars or more.  But the total sum of profits and losses, of all those who played the game, will be zero -- or  rather negative, because of all fees and other cots.

&gt; What is your real motive?

d8q730u,MentalRental,21,The definition is easy. Bitcoin is the daily average longest blockchain that has a genesis block of X.,2016-10-13 22:22:56
d8qar6w,ydtm,20,"My opinion:

It seems that Bitcoin, in is current state, is actually saving ""too much"" data about each transaction: *individual* cryptographic signatures for every *individual* transaction's sender, receiver, and amount.

This seems to be what is preventing Bitcoin from achieving optimal privacy and fungibility and compactness.

Mimblewimble **_minimizes and ""collectivizes""_** the data within each block - saving a cryptographic signature only for the overall ""collection"" of sender**_s_**, receiver**_s_** and coin**_s_** in that block.

So **_by being simpler and saving less data,_** Mimblewimble would immediately provide three massive benefits:

- much more privacy

- much better fungibility

- much smaller blockchain (since a single ""collective"" signature per block is much more compact than a bunch of ""individual"" signatures for each separate transaction in the block).

This seems like the ""sweet spot"" of what we really want with Bitcoin. We don't care about the specific individual history of every single transaction which a coin has traversed. We only care about whether that coin ""exists"" and who can spend it.

**[KISS](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=KISS+%22keep+it+simple%2C+stupid%22&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web)**

On those rare occasions where something comes along in life (and programming) where **_it's waaay better because it's waay simpler_** (and when this improvement and simplicity is based on real math), then it's important to pay attention, to understand:

- What does this say about the *current* solution? (Are we saving ""too much"" data? Is our whole ""underlying architecture"" too-specific, too-detailed?)

- Could this innovation could actually be used?

**Compatibility**

I also understand that ""Mimblewimble is not compatible with certain 'additional' features of Bitcoin, such as the scripting language."" 

This leads me to question:

**_Maybe a scripting language shouldn't be at the base level of a cryptocurrency?_** - if that scripting language is damaging privacy, fungibility and compactness by requiring saving the history of each individual transaction's sender, receiver and amount. 

Fundamentally, a cryptocurrency should do what a ""normal"" currency does: it should simply **_allow people to move fungible tokens around privately._** 

Any ""scripting language"" should be considered later - as a possible ""add-on"". Not as a ""must-have"" (if insisting on having that scripting language at the ""bottom level"" is what is preventing privacy, fungibility and compactness).

If I find a new mathematical foundation which is *better* and *simpler* and *more efficient* than a currently implemented project, I tend to take the radical approach and rewrite the project from scratch, using the new math (and this approach has always paid off massively).

So I think **the best Schelling Point for a longer-term Bitcoin hard fork might be to do a _ledger-preserving spinoff_ to a simplified Bitcoin based on Mimblewimble.**

**Sidechain ... then Spin-off?**

I would favor the approach several people have already suggested: intially implementing Mimblewimble as a *sidechain* of Bitcoin.

Long-term I would imagine that sidechain could lead to a *(ledger-preserving) spinoff*.

(Note that the terminology [""spinoff""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.480) has a specific [meaning](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Abitco.in%2Fforum+spinoff&amp;ia=web) when used with Bitcoin: *a spinoff preserves the original ledger*, initially duplicating each person's coins on the old and new ledger so they can eventually ""trade into"" whichever of the two chains which they prefer.)  

Is there any provision for what happens when a sidechain ""works better"" than its mainchain?

Because that's what I think could be the long-term result with Mimblewimble. It's so much better and simpler.",2016-10-13 23:50:40

Bitcoin is a currency, not an investment. Predicting it to go up in the future is purely speculative. It's fine to have some, though, but just keep that in mind.

What's this invested in? Just a money market fund? Put it in something. 

&gt;226 car payment (lease, no money down)

The only good reason to lease a car is if having a relatively new and fancy car is a genuine passion of yours and not something you can compromise on. Personally I don't like cars, so I'd ditch the lease once it expires and spend ~$10k on a gently used car that I could use for at least a decade.

This sub can get touchy as fuck on cars one way or the other so look out.

&gt;this does not include monthly costs such as food

Make a monthly budget that includes food and any entertainment you spend on. This post doesn't paint a complete picture of your actual spending/saving.

And as far as your stock picks and mention of a trading account, it seems like you're actively investing. That's your choice but it's one I'd never make myself.

The people involved with ViaBTC are strong on several levels:

- they understand programming

- they understand markets / economics

- they understand politics

Somebody involved with them is also very, very good at writing, as can be seen in [that amazing article on Medium.com they recently published](https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/why-we-must-increase-the-block-size-and-why-i-support-bitcoin-unlimited-90b114b3ef4a#.kju12wrdu) - originally in Chinese on their blog which I can't read - but the translation into English at the link above on Medium.com was amazingly well-done, in terms of both content and style.

That article is highly recommended reading - one of the best things written in recent memory on how to scale Bitcoin - again covering all aspects: the programming, the markets / economics, and the politics.

The people involved at ViaBTC are way, way smarter than the people involved with Core / Blockstream.

This is why people who join forces with ViaBTC (scaling Bitcoin the safest and easiest way, using Bitcoin Unlimited) will win. 

Blockstream / Core can barely manage to convince people that they ""understand programming"". 

They know mostly old stuff involving cryptography - which is already basically solved for Bitcoin. The challenging new stuff involves scaling, network topology, markets, economics - and they are pretty clueless in those areas.

Most of the people at Core / Blockstream are complete idiots when it comes to markets / economics and politics.

Their whole approach is ""legacy"":

- get $76 million in funding from companies like AXA

- appoint a scammer as a CEO (Austin Hill - now gone) - plus a couple of guys who never really understood the market and economic dynamics of Bitcoin (Greg and Adam).

- use centralization, censorship to try to control the community

- fly around to meetings and congresses where promises get made (and broken), and nothing actually gets accomplished

Totally the wrong ""fit"" for a company claiming it wants to work in the cryptocurrency space.

It's amazing people have given Blockstream any ""legitimacy"". And I imagine any devs there who have some real talent *must be frustrated by the rigid culture there.*

d8qbqw1,ydtm,34,"Authoritarians being authoritarian.

Satoshi defined Bitcoin as *the longest valid chain.*

u/theymos, being an idiot (and a low-level government flunky in some backwater state in the American Mid-West) wants to define Bitcoin as *a particular implementation / website which he and his buddies control.*

Again and again, the losers associated with Core / Blockstream demonstrate that *they do not understand what decentralization means.*

Seriously u/theymos is revealing massive, massive stupidity here. 

If the SEC officially mentions a particular implementation / website for Bitcoin **in law** - then that would **the kiss of death for decentralization.**

Bitcoin (like most other internet things) should be a *protocol* (with multiple implementations) - not a single (fragile, centralized, attackable) *implementation* (which *de facto* or *a posteriori* sorta kinda defines some kind of poorly specified protocol - based on ""whatever it happens to do when it runs"").

This hasn't been done yet - but that's merely due to the laziness and incompetence of the Core / Blockstream devs.

Eventually - it will be done: Bitcoin will be defined by a *specification* - not by any particular *implementation.*

Advanced programmers already know how to do this using languages such as Coq, Maude, and others typically related to the OCaml and Haskell family. (Plus Synereo project also takes this approach.)

Just because most of the devs associated with Core / Blockstream don't know about these advanced approaches, doesn't mean they aren't being used (with much success) elsewhere - eg, energy, military, etc. 

This kind of approach should also be taken in any serious financial application as well. (Otherwise, you could end up with the DAO.)

Most mission-critical software *does* come with a (formal, verifiable, algebraic) specification - making it possible to mathematically prove that any given implementation satisfies that specification - providing major guarantees in terms of safety, as well as often major efficiency improvements (due to the refactoring needed to re-express an implementation, which is often in ""spaghetti code"" in some low-level language like C++, as a specification, in a clean functional more-compact higher-level language permitting formal verification).

If you're not expecting to live to 65 you need to reconsider some of your other life choices. :)

Other people could give you better advice on the pension, since that is really independent of Bitcoin.

Putting _all_ of your retirement savings into a currency or speculative asset is probably bad financial planning: The goal of retirement money isn't to make a fortune, it's to be able to support yourself comfortably in all possible cases. To achieve that goal it's best to own a mixture of different things; and Bitcoin could be part of that mixture but it shouldn't be all of it.

You can reason about retirement savings with some fairly straightforward calculations, e.g. in python:

     #!/usr/bin/python
     balance = 17000
     age = 45
     retirementage = 65
     monthlypay = 380
     assumedinterest = 1.06

     while age &lt; retirementage:
       balance *= assumedinterest

       pay = min(monthlypay * 12, balance)
       balance -= pay
       balance *= assumedinterest
       paid += pay
       years += 1
  
     print('paid %f over %d years'%(paid,years))

I assumed a 6% return there, which is aggressive esp if the payments are assumed to be inflation corrected.  I think a lot of the personal finance people assume 4% in order to be secure against markets as bad as have ever been seen so far.

    The proposed fund, if approved, would be the first exchange-traded product

    form (unlike commodities) nor an issuer that is currently registered with any regulatory body
    (unlike securities, futures, or derivatives), and whose fundamental properties and ownership can,
    by coordination among a majority of its network processing power, be changed (unlike any of
    the above). Moreover, as the Exchange acknowledges in its proposal, less than three years ago,
    the bitcoin exchange then responsible for nearly three-quarters of worldwide bitcoin trading lost
    a substantial amount of its bitcoin holdings through computer hacking or fraud and failed.

* What are commenters’ views about the current stability, resilience, fairness, and efficiency of the
markets on which bitcoina are traded? 

* What are commenters’ views on whether an asset with the
novel and unique properties of a bitcoin is an appropriate underlying asset for a product that will
be traded on a national securities exchange?

*  What are commenters’ views on the risk of loss via computer hacking posed by such an asset? What are commenters’ views on whether an ETP based on such an asset would be susceptible to manipulation?

---
---
---

    According to the Exchange, the Gemini Exchange Spot Price is representative of
    the accurate price of a bitcoin because of the positive price-discovery attributes of the Gemini
    Exchange marketplace.

* What are commenters’ views on the manner in which the Trust proposes
to value its holdings?

---
---
---
---

    According to several commenters, there is a need for the Exchange to provide
    additional information regarding “proof of control” auditing, multisig protocols, and insurance
    with respect to the bitcoins held in custody on behalf of the Trust, in the interest of adequate
    security and investor confidence in bitcoin control.

* What are commenters’ views on these
recommendations regarding additional security, control, and insurance measures?

---
---
---
---

    A commenter notes that the Gemini Exchange has relatively low liquidity and
    trading volume in bitcoins and that there is a significant risk that the nominal ETP share price
    “will be manipulated, by relatively small trades that manipulate the bitcoin price at that
    exchange.”

* What are commenters’ views on the concerns expressed by this commenter? 

* What are commenters’ views regarding the susceptibility of the price of the Shares to manipulation,
considering that the NAV would be based on the spot price of a single bitcoin exchange? 

* What are commenters’ views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin
market, and thus the suitability of bitcoins as an underlying asset for an ETP?

---
---
---
---

    The Exchange asserts that the widespread availability of information regarding
    Bitcoin, the Trust, and the Shares, combined with the ability of Authorized Participants to create
    and redeem Baskets each Business Day, thereby utilizing the arbitrage mechanism, will be
    sufficient for market participants to value and trade the Shares in a manner that will not lead to
    significant deviations between intraday Best Bid/Best Ask and the Intraday Indicative Value or
    between the Best Bid/Best Ask and the NAV. In addition, the Exchange asserts that the
    numerous options for buying and selling bitcoins will both provide Authorized Participants with
    many options for hedging their positions and provide market participants generally with potential
    arbitrage opportunities, further strengthening the arbitrage mechanism as it relates to the Shares.

* What are commenters’ views regarding these statements?

* Do commenters’ agree or disagree with the assertion that Authorized Participants and other market makers will be able to make
efficient and liquid markets in the Shares at prices generally in line with the NAV?

Service:
Chan is very fast and accurate. Took the time to verify what i wanted and had simple instructions. Paid through circle app. No extra fees and quick transfer from bank to bitcoin. No issues with transaction. QC pictures came within a week and shipping was about 4 days. Boxes were not double boxed and came pretty beat when they were here, so if you're a box-head you might want to get shoes somewhere else.

Sizing:
I heard PK's Yeezys were bigger than the retail ones. I was lied to. from the look of things they are very similar to retail. go .5 size up from your true size.

Quality and comparison:
I put a quick comparison on imgur but long story short they are very good. 

Upper: shape and pattern are straight up on point. Small things like that there is less suede coverage on the inside and slightly lighter color of stripe but no one will look at that unless you're trying to finesse someone, but then you deserve to get caught.

Sole/Mid-sole/Boost: The back definitely has discoloration but my RETAILS HAVE SIMILAR DISCOLORATION. The discoloration is slightly darker than the retail ones though. That slightly darker color also extends to the back of the bottom sole which is slightly darker than retail. Boost looks whiter than retail which looks a bit off white, not a big difference. It is also more detailed, looks like Yeezy v1 boost. Also not a big thing unless you're trying to play with someones feelings. Feels very similar to the real thing though so I can only assume they're using that ""Real Boost"" stuff everyone is drooling over.

OVERALL:
Great service and a good shoe. I honestly don't believe any one will call you out if you have these.

While the answer he gave may have some issues (""it can be and should be""), I'm skipping over that for a better response. 

&gt;Gold as a currency base was great

Was it though? Gold has price stability in the long run, but lots of volatility in the short run. That volatility can be deflationary, which in part led to the bank runs of the '30s and the Great Depression. It also prevents the central bank from being able to pursue effective monetary policy during crises. For more, see mr. bernke's (thank) [paper on this](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11482.pdf). 

&gt;but in contemporary times we really should be looking towards bitcoin or other blockchain powered cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has the same weaknesses as the gold standard. It's [volatile AF](http://i.imgur.com/WWzGXy5.png). There's only so much of it created, so you can't increase the money supply during a recession. 

&gt;Pretty much solves all the realistic problems of using gold as a currency along with other of dozens of benefits, such as bitcoin immune to counter-fitting or imitation, creating/printing out of thin air, highly fungible, deflationary as opposed to inflationary etc etc

d8t14ks,DanielWilc,29,"Over a year ago most core devs apart from Gavin were not very public.

Gavin was very public and was seen as project leader, Satoshis heir etc.

Naively, increasing block-size to allow transaction seems like an obvious thing, I and most others thought so 2 years ago.

Gavin could not convince the devs to accept his proposal about urgent need to drastically increase block-size i.e. 20 MB. 

So he went to the public to make his case and go around the core devs. Many people took his side and core devs were presented as blockers to what seemed like a no brainer to increase the blocksize.

At that point many people started to hate the core devs as the core devs were lobbying against Gavins block size increase. 

Mind you with hindsight the main concerns of core devs were correct: 20mb was to big and the network would not have been able to handle it. Gavins activation threshold of only 75% mining power in the face of strong opposition meant a contentious hard fork that would result in split currency. Gavin said split currency could not happen because of economic incentives. Ethereum hard fork proved him wrong.  

I think part of this is that people want to get rich off of bitcoin. They are under the illusion that if we only increase the limit we will get a 'tsunami' of new users that will make them wealthy. They think the current limit is stoping adoption. Bitcoin devs by stoping the increase are getting in the way of them getting rich, and that is probably a big motivation for the hate.

d8scokm,jratcliff63367,22,"&gt; Doesn't the fact that they use threats speak volumes about their suitability to be in control of this technology?

That's a fair point.  However, I clearly understand that their primary motivation is to *protect* bitcoin from attack; and a controversial hard fork is without question a form of attack.

There is obviously a clear difference of opinion about the level of risk involved in increasing the blocksize for on-chain transactions.

I am highly sympathetic to this point of view. I have a substantial personal investment in bitcoin so, the whole 'store of value' use case is certainly my own personal highest priority; as I believe is the case for the majority of core and core supporters (of which I am one).

There is no question that raising the blocksize an excessive amount does, in fact, represent a real risk of attack by the state.

On the other hand, a small modest blocksize increase is probably safe.

I believe, long term, that the real scaling solution, the one that can solve everyone's needs worldwide, will happen (and must happen) off-chain.  Likely through a combination of sidechains and networked payment channels.

To raise the blocksize today because we are impatient for layer-2 solutions to come online does seem like a dangerous thing to do.  It's not like it's something we can later 'take back'; once the blocksize is increased, it will be part of the permanent record forever in the blockchain.

I do not believe that low value payment transactions need to, nor should be, recorded for all of history into the blockchain.  It seems wasteful and a poor use of a limited resource.

You do realize that when you sync the blockchain you are getting a full and complete copy of every single Satoshi dice bet ever placed for all of recorded bitcoin history as well as a full and complete record of every single DDOS attack ever performed against the blockchain?  They cannot be erased.  They are part of the permanent record.

Increasing the blocksize to make room for even more low-value payment transactions is not a good plan in my personal view.

All I can say, with absolute certainty, is that core, and core supporters, believe completely that they are protecting bitcoin from attack.  

This notion that raising the blocksize is 'no big deal' and that 'cheap transactions for all' has no cost or risk, is naive and short sighted.

We have been given a great and incredible gift.  We have a worldwide distributed peer-to-peer network that allows people to both store and transact value without interference from the state.  It is a bearer bond of the sort that would make Swiss Banks jealous.  Yet, we want to increase the blocksize so more people can perform low value and low fee transactions?  I don't think that is a good ideal at all.

It's as if we were given a goose that lays golden eggs, yet the community is impatient and wants to kill the goose today so they can have something quick to eat.  That may be satisfying in the short term, but in the long term we risk losing everything.

As the blocksize grows, it becomes ever an easier target for state actors and regulators to interfere and upset.

Yes, layer-2 systems are going to take a while to come online.  In the interim, some of us may have to resort to using 3rd party off-chain systems until they are ready.  But, putting the bitcoin network at risk because people are impatient for cheap on-chain transactions is a bad ideal in my opinion. ",2016-10-15 06:57:02

No, it doesn't hold true for QC. The vulnerability is that QC could possibly calculate the Secret Key from a Public Key. However, you have to have the PK to pull that off.

People need to realize that what happened to Ethereum **cannot** happen to Bitcoin. 


Because of the time between blocks and the difficulty adjustment that only adjusts itself every 2016 blocks a minority chain will **never** survive.


If people would keep on mining on a minority chain there will be almost no blocks at all and it might even take a whole year for the difficulty to adjust itself.

d8tntay,ydtm,21,"ViaBTC is right again.

There are two big reasons why LN is not Bitcoin:

(1) The main characteristic of Bitcoin is its **network topology** (mempool, hashing, mining) - not its cryptography (elliptic curve, SHA356).

However, LN only uses Bitcoin's (relatively mundane) *cryptography* - not the (groundbreakingly innovative) *network topology* (ie, the solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem using Nakamoto Consensus).

(2) LN has a cool-sounding name, and lots of talk about a so-called ""implementation"" that's underway - but this is doomed because LN lacks an actual mathematical specification (eg, in some language like Petri Nets, Linear Logic, the Pi Calculus). 

The poorly written LN whitepaper provides a kludgy and **incomplete** informal (ie: non-mathematical) example of *some parts* of how an LN transaction might work - and all LN implementations are therefore also **incomplete** - since they're based on the only part of Bitcoin that LN does: the *cryptography*, and they don't use Bitcoin's *network topology* solution (that's the whole point: they can't, because by definition they're offline/offchain), and they also never figured out how to create workable network topology for LN (because that's a hard problem, which might not even be possible: something along the lines of solving the Byzantine Generals Problem using Nakamoto Consensus *offline/offchain*).

They say ""hey we're working on decentralized routing / pathfinding for LN"" as if it were merely some *minor* missing piece - but that's the most important part of the system actually. 

So they they have no clue on how to provide the most important part of their payment network: a *network topology* for that network - because that's the really, really hard (actually, it's probably impossible).

But none of this matters to them. They have $76 million to play with, from companies who would be happy to destroy Bitcoin's network topology and replace it with whatever fucked-up disaster of a kludge LN eventually turns out to be - probably some centralized mess routing through Blockstream and the legacy fiat finance companies that own Blockstream. 

They'll manage to get something out the door, with great fanfare, calling it ""Lightning Network"", but it will *not* be anything like the Bitcoin network (permissionless decentralized incentivized consensus-building).

This is why Lightning is totally irrelevant, and any so-called ""scaling roadmap"" which relies on it should be ignored / rejected as illusory / harmful.

As a merchant I have cash flow concerns. I'd need a large chunk of that monthly income to pay employees and suppliers. 

Can't do that if it's all held up in a bunch of payment channels. It would be necessary to regularly close all of those channels to release the funds. 

LN could actually help here if enough people use it. I as a merchant could receive 100m payments through LN and presumably those funds are then available to send elsewhere on LN. I could send funds to my suppliers and employees, or cash out through an exchange without the Bitcoin ever leaving LN. 

That said, I think the better solution is to increase capacity on the blockchain. Make Netflix a pay as you go service with a top-up feature that presents a btc address and current balance built into every Netflix player. As long as you have a positive balance, you can keep watching. Balance gets too low? Top up. Zero-conf would be acceptable as well since the risk of loss is a question of 10-30 minutes of free viewing. 

Users will probably maintain a positive balance good for a few months (eg. I'd probably top up in $50 increments or $100 increments like I do with my Bitpay Visa), which would reduce the number of on-chain transactions.

I also disagree completely.   But I want you to not focus on the Ethereum and instead apply your whole argument against Crypto in general.  Bitcoin is clearly the first mover of adoption and growing but it is STILL after 8 years struggling to get acceptance on a large scale.  Take any other coin ever in the history of the space and NONE even comes close.  

]The promise of blockchain is real. The massive amount believers just don't know it yet what this whole thing is just yet.

&gt; Yes, I am aware that it's (Ethereum development) still an order of magnitude higher than for BTC.

This observation you made is really the basis that makes Ethereum wonderful to me.  They are funded very well for something like 4 years. I think the development is going to escalate as the team engages metacognition and discovery into their process.  The attacker is really tasking the team and will continue to do so. The more the discover and mitigate now, the better.

The DAO was  an amazing lesson to the developers, to the community, to everyone that watches crowdfunding stats.  It also slowed them down quite a bit too.  I don't talk shit on ETC because really I'm sure every single one of us had the uh-oh moment that Ethereum might be in real trouble. Well, I got news for you, it's still in trouble. But that's true for anything in this space.  We don't even know what we don't know at times and hackers and attackers will have to be dealt with in ANY coin to achieve success.


Every single person in the Ethereum space as a developer first worked with Bitcoin and have a goal to make Ethereum execute the dream of blockchain.  It's a swiss army knife. It's going to be meticulous and well crafted with lots of tools. If you think it's slow paced just look how long it took to build the internet.  We might be compared to the [Bulletin Board System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)  in our evolution within Cryptocurrency.  

There is no immediate satisfaction with a building a revolution.  But you've already listed quite a few amazing projects that seem to be much more robustly supported by their followers than we would have ever thought considering the DAO only back in June.

When I got my S1, the S2's were just coming out so people were getting rid of their old ones. I was getting $13+ after electricity a week, vs 0.63/week now. Then I got my two S3's from some dude who had an entire house who filled with nothing but antminers. I think he said his electric bill was something like 2k a month and he was upgrading to the new ones because it had better hashes/watt. I think I was getting $2-5 a day with them.

d8vic1x,harda,27,"From the blog post:

&gt; SegWit [...] strips the regular block out of most meaningful information and moves it to the extension block. While software that isn’t updated to support SegWit will still accept the blockchain, it has lost all ability to actually understand and validate it.

1. Arguably the most important information in a block is the movement of bitcoins, as with just this information we ensure that no bitcoins have been created out of thin air.  Validating signatures is important too---to ensure nobody steals someone else's bitcoins---but by removing signatures from the regular block but leaving in the information about the movement of bitcoins, it becomes possible to use large amounts of proof-of-work as a reasonable proxy for signature verification, providing a useful way to reduce the amount of data a almost-fully-validating node needs to download to get a complete and accurate copy of the blockchain.  I wrote more about that [here on Bitcoin.SE](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/41208/can-a-blockchain-be-created-that-forgets-transactions-whose-outputs-have-been-sp/41224#41224) even before Pieter Wuille's original talk about segwit at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong.

2. Software that isn't updated to support segwit will still validate all non-segwit transactions in the blockchain.  Miners can even continue producing non-segwit blocks (blocks with no segwit transactions) after segwit activates (see BIP141, ""If all transactions in a block do not have witness data, the commitment is optional."").

&gt; An old wallet won’t understand if its owner is being sent money. It won’t be able able to spend it.

This is not true.  Old wallets will continue to receive payments to the addresses they generate, which will be non-segwit addresses.  The wallet will be able to spend those bitcoins by creating non-segwit transactions.  As BIP141 says, ""A non-witness program (defined hereinafter) txin MUST be associated with an empty witness field, represented by a 0x00. If all txins are not witness program, a transaction's wtxid is equal to its txid.""  In other words, a transaction that doesn't use segwit is exactly the same as a transaction any wallet will produce today---that's complete backwards compatibility.

&gt; A node is unable to validate the transactions in the blockchain as they all look valid no matter what.

Only segwit transactions look like anyone-can-spend transactions to old nodes.  Non-segwit transactions look like transactions always have to old nodes, and those nodes will fully validate them.

&gt; Overall, while SegWit can be technically qualified as a soft fork, it puts anyone who does not upgrade at risk.

This is not true in the least.  The only increased risk for users who don't upgrade is that they may---just maybe---see a slight increase in the number of stale (orphan) blocks.  This is unlikely, as segwit has been designed so that all miners following current standard transaction relay rules will produce valid blocks after the segwit soft fork goes into effect; this is thanks to segwit's good design as well as the design of BIP9 versionbits, which achieved this goal for the BIP68/112/113 soft fork in June 2016.

&gt; If we compare to a block size increase to 2Mb, it becomes apparent that the value delivered to users is inferior at only 1.7Mb. On the other hand, the cost for miners and nodes is higher as they need to be able to process 4Mb blocks.

This is a fair point that miners need to be prepared for the worst case, which is different from the normal case.  However, it is already the case that worst case blocks take longer to verify than normal case blocks.  (For example, see [this post](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=522) from /u/rustyreddit .)  Segwit corrects some of these validation disparities directly (for example, the case above is corrected by allowing multiple signatures in segregated witnesses to sign the same hash) and also is being released at the same time as other scalability improvements such as compact blocks which help mitigate the additional costs in at least the normal case.

&gt; In the same vein, SegWit introduce an economic incentive to produce more witness data than non witness data. It is argued by SegWit supporters that it is an incentive to reduce the UTXO set growth. It may well be, but just as the block size limit does, it is going to destroy the economic information required to price the UTXO appropriately.

1. Perhaps a nitpick, but segwit does not incentivize the production of any type of data; it just allows more of one type than the other to be stored in a block.  (For comparison, the fact that tap water is often cheaper than bottled water doesn't incentivize drinking water; it just allows you to get more water from one source than the other for the same price.)

2. I don't believe segwit's weighting formula is an incentive to reduce UTXO set growth but rather a reflection of the underlying economics: witnesses (whether current scriptSigs or future segregated witnesses) are never part of the UTXO set, and so it's reasonable to allow transactions to include more witness data than UTXO-affecting data.  The 1/4 weight given to segregated witnesses reflects (as you mentioned above) the limits of what is acceptable under the worst-case scenario where 4 MB blocks can be produced; it's not an arbitrary number but rather the limit of what we can safely do now.",2016-10-17 18:35:23

d8v8of5,SirEDCaLot,21,"Let's look at the timeline more or less from the beginning.  

Many people (including Gavin, who for the record is Satoshi's chosen successor) had been calling for attention to the block size issue back as early as 2012.  However they were all ignored by the rest of the Core devs, and since Gavin had stepped down as lead maintainer of Bitcoin-QT (what Bitcoin-Core was then called) it was no longer his decision to make.  

-----

Around August of last year, Bitcoin XT was released by Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn.  XT was the first alt-client to start a safe hard-fork-based scaling process that, when a majority of miners adopted it, would increase the block size limit to 8MB and then double it every few years after that.  It's worth noting that this timetable was a compromise after talking to miners, Gavin had wanted an even more aggressive increase schedule.  XT got some limited traction, and lots of community members ran Bitcoin-XT nodes, however then someone started DDoS attacking all XT nodes.  

Shortly thereafter, a series of high profile meetings were announced called Scaling Bitcoin.   The first one was in September 2015 in Montreal, then another one in December 2015 in Hong Kong.  The plan was that ideas would be presented in Montreal, and then discussed and debated in Hong Kong.  This is where the idea of SegWit was first presented.  
It's also important to note that at this workshop, Jonathan Toomim (u/jtoomim) presented research showing that with then-current software and Internet connections, block size could safely be increased to 3-4 MB without any ill effects (this includes issues with China's Great Firewall).  
However nothing was decided at Scaling Bitcoin 2015.  As a result, many community members felt (both before and after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops) that the workshops were nothing more than a stalling tactic designed to push off any actual decisions.  

Once it became clear that Bitcoin XT was not going to happen (miners felt it was too aggressive, and some users didn't like certain other features it included, and ongoing DDoS attacks chilled support from nodes), development was mostly shelved and Mike Hearn quit Bitcoin development.  

-----

In mid 2016, Gavin again came back with Bitcoin Classic.  The idea behind Classic was to ONLY have a one time hard fork increase to 2MB (almost everything else was a carbon copy of Bitcoin-Core).  This would be a compromise palatable hopefully to everybody including the miners, that would prevent blocks from becoming full.  

Shortly after this, there was a private meeting in Hong Kong between several Bitcoin developers and most of the major Bitcoin miners.  This is the meeting LukeJr is referring to.  This meeting was supposed to be informal but ended up going until the early morning, and what emerged was [this agreement](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff).  It's worth a read.  

Long story short- Core will have a 2MB hard fork ready around July, SegWit should be ready around that time also, and in exchange miners will support SegWit and only run ""Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems"", aka not Classic.  

There was controversy surrounding this for a few reasons:  
1. Only a few Core developers and miners were invited.  Other stakeholders, such as non-Core developers like Gavin Andresen, or influential Bitcoin users like Brian Armstrong (CEO, Coinbase.com) were not invited.  That left a lot of people feeling like important decisions were being made without their input.  
2. This happened just as miners were starting to adopt alternative software that would trigger a hard fork.  Since the meeting was held in private, it was assumed by many to be a last ditch attempt by Core to persuade the miners not to implement a hard fork.  
3. This meeting produced an agreement, but that agreement was of questionable validity.  
a. Adam Back (President of Blockstream, a company that employs many of the Core developers) was at the meeting, and as such he was assumed to be representing Blockstream.  However he then signed the agreement as ""Adam Back, individual"".  This made the miners wonder if they were actually negotiating with anyone in authority or not.  He then changed his signature to ""Adam Back, Blockstream"".  
b. Greg Maxwell, another Core developer, famously referred to the Core devs who attended the meeting as [""well meaning dipshits""](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1330553.msg14835202#msg14835202).  He went on to claim that what those Core devs promised the miners was ""seemingly impossible"".  

It's worth noting that the Core devs in attendance said that SegWit would be ready in July 2016 and a hard fork to increase the block size limit would come at some time thereafter (or at least, this was the impression that the miners got from the meeting).  SegWit is still not deployed, and there is (to the best of my knowledge) no serious discussion or plans for a hard fork among Core devs.  

It's also worth reading Luke's comment [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4q3ztw/a_call_for_core_developers_to_clarify_their/d4q6ryh?context=3).  He makes it clear that the Core developers present ""were not acting as representatives of the Core dev team"", that no hard fork was promised, that the July 2016 SegWit deadline was just a best guess not a promise, and that the miners have no leverage to make demands.  Furthermore, he explains that some Core developers feel that any sort of hard fork (including a safe one) is somehow unethical, implying that it's unlikely that Core will deliver a hard fork anytime soon.  

-----

More recently, there was another Scaling Bitcoin workshop, this one in Milan.  To the best of my knowledge, this workshop did not accept any presentations that were in favor of hard forks.

d8una04,pokertravis,17,"&gt; Some people have called the prospect of limited block space and the development of a fee market a change in policy compared to the past. I respectfully disagree with that. Bitcoin Core is not running the Bitcoin economy, and its developers have no authority to set its rules. Change in economics is always happening, and should be expected. Worse, intervening in consensus changes would make the ecosystem more dependent on the group taking that decision, not less.

&gt; So to point out what I consider obvious: if Bitcoin requires central control over its rules by a group of developers, it is completely uninteresting to me. Consensus changes should be done using consensus, and the default in case of controversy is no change.

I think its an important letter.  I think this might be confusing to people though.  As I understand it, the author believes that Core does not impede the free will of the economy, and if it did the author would be uninterested in the project.

The author is also explicate that we should not subscribe to the fud that is the big-block argument/brigade.

&gt;and the default in case of controversy is no change.

d8v7cg1,JollyMort,17,"Just a few things... (adapted from [here][23])

It is the only private cryptocurrency in use **today** which is truly [fungible][1] as **all** transactions are private and created equal.

It satisfies the 3 important properties of electronic cash: decentralized, private, digital.

[The Currency Triangle][2]


These are the major features that distinguish it from all the rest, on a protocol level:

1. Nobody inspecting the blockchain can tell from where the funds came (untraceability). This even includes the recipient (you). Just by opening your wallet, even **you** don't know from where your funds came, unless you provided the sender with a paymentID unique to the transaction, or you kept track yourself by some other means (ie if you send from an exchange you can match a transaction just from the timestamp, unless you receive a lot of trandactions regularly). This is achieved by utilizing [one-time ring signatures][3]. While commonly referred to as [""mixing outputs""][4], it works a bit different than what the name suggest. The sender can pick almost any random output on the blockchain to ""mix"" with. This takes care of the sender's privacy.

2. Nobody inspecting the blockchain can tell to where the funds went (unlinkability). This even includes the sender (you). Just by opening your wallet, even **you** don't know to where you sent some funds in the past, unless you kept track yourself. This is achieved by utilizing [stealth addresses][5], where the sender generates a one-time destination from the recipient's address. Unlike with Bitcoin, no Monero are actually sent to the address itself, but are sent to something derived from it (the stealth address). All stealth addresses look the same and this takes care of the recipient's privacy. The owner of an address is the only one able to know which stealth addresses ""belong"" to him, by means of a [private view key][6].

3. With the introducion of ringCT (January 2017), nobody inspecting the blockchain, except the sender and the recipient, *will be* able to tell the amounts involved in any transaction other than coinbase transactions (when new Moneros are mined). However, the network is still able to prove that only coinbase transactions can increase the supply. The HF to enable this is scheduled for January.
Note: It's not yet enabled on the network but it's just around the corner as the software already supports it and rCT is currently live on testnet. All we're waiting for is the block [1220517][7], when rCT transactions will be allowed on the main network.

4. [Dynamic blocksize][8] and [tail emission][9]. I'm putting the 2 together because the latter is needed for the former to work. Miners are free to increase the blocksize, *but*: if they will increase it for too much too fast, they will lose the coinbase reward (but they will get more transaction fees). The tail emission (of a fixed 0.3 Monero per block) is there to ensure there is always someting you can take away as a penalty. This will result in some residual inflation of `&lt;0.87%` which will reduce towards 0% as time goes on. This has the added benefit of compensating for ""lost"" coins forever (someone dies, loses the wallet etc.) and providing a minimum incentive to maintain security of the network by mining. Also note that it has a [smooth emission curve][10], avoiding shocks like ""The Halving"".
5. It's [auditable][11]. By giving your private view key to an auditor, he would be able to see all the your incoming transactions. However, to know the correct balance he would also need to know if you spent any of those (which he can't just with the view key). For this, you'd have to compute a key image for your every incoming transaction, and send those to the auditor. With this, the auditor could establish your current balance. Nice part is, that if you receive something new, the auditor can't know if you spent this new output without kindly asking for the matching key image. This gives the user certain control over how he's being audited and who can know what.

Other things that are worth highlighting are:

- A healthy, mature community and dev. team working towards a common goal of transacting freely.
- [Scheduled hard forks][12]. At the current schedule, every 6 months (with the ringCT getting a one-time push for January instead of March). In the future, the frequency will likely be reduced to 12 months as the project grows more mature. Monero already had 2 successful HFs ([1st][13], [2nd][14]). As per [advice by MRL][15], the first HF set a minimum requirement on the number of outputs to ""mix"" with, ensuring privacy of the network. The 2nd one ensured that coinbase transactions amounts are rounded as to prevent ""random"" non-mixable outputs appearing on the blockchain, further improving privacy.
- Separation of the wallet and node software, which makes it a much better foundation to build upon.
- Utilization of [LMDB][16] for blockchain storage, which is cutting-edge technology with significant performance advantage over anything else.
- The cryptography has even been looked at by academics ([Monero Research Lab][17]), one of which devised the ringCT scheme.
- CryptoNight PoW, which is an ASIC-resistant algorithm and to this day no known ASICs exist. It's not specific to Monero as there are other CryptoNote currencies out there, but it gives an advantage over some other ones.
- (future) [Kovri][18] integration. This will enable node communication over [I2P][19] (The Invisible Internet Project), further increasing privacy by hiding user's IP addresses. It's worth mentioning even though it's not in production, as it is being [heavily worked on][20] and is not just some idea floating in the air.
- (future) Implementation of [0MQ][21] protocol for improving the way the node communicates with other processes, which is being [actively developed][22]. Currently, RPC is used, which will still be supported for backwards-compatibility. This will be very important as a building block for future development of APIs, payment processors, exchanges etc.

If Core operated the way you think, in other words, people wouldn't have to switch to BU just to have the option to signal acceptance of larger blocks. 

It is *Core* that has set it up as this situation where the only way to up blocksize is to go to another team for the upgrade. *Core* has chosen to make it personal. *Core* has chosen to leverage their inertia as historical Satoshi repo in an attempt to jink consensus in their favor. BU leaves it to users, and if an ""activate bigger blocks upon reaching 95% threshold"" option is popular I think they will include it as that is the spirit of the implementation. 

I just don't think anyone but Core really thinks Bitcoin is so fragile as to require such a huge sacrifice (5% can veto *everything*) when the investors are in control anyway and WILL take the matter to fork arbitrage on exchanges (like with ETH/ETC) once their patience runs out, a scenario Core and its self-contradictory policies are doing the most of anyone to bring about.",2016-10-18 10:13:47

And that assumes no miners on the minority chain give up in the interim.  The minority chain would face another challenge as well - blocks only being discovered 1/10th as often, or approximately every 100 minutes.  6 confirmations would take about 10 hours on average.

d8wpqj6,nullc,16,"&gt; What are the worst things with that proposal?

It rips the sequence numbers out of the protocol, breaking payment channels.

It mixes up the consensus rules with the serialization.

It adds redundancy to the encoding with signaled fields which must always be a particular value, which creates additional error cases which must be handled and opportunities for consensus failure (when something accepts a syntactically valid but prohibited encoding). The rejection appears to require implementing the parser in exactly the same way as he does (a common result when you must get identically accepting identically rejecting parser and have a redundant encoding).

It leaves hardware wallets with the same problem they've had with having to transfer all the prior transactions.

More aesthetically, it calls itself 'flexible' when its actually objectively less flexible. Perhaps this isn't much of a complaint, but it offends me.

The specification for it is nowhere near complete enough to implement it, which also made it very hard to analyze. 

It's incompatible with _all_ existing Bitcoin software, so any use of it would be highly disruptive. Having gone through this with the transaction format change in elements alpha, I cannot recommend it. ... The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.

Its spec/implementation depends on no v4 transactions ever being included in the blockchain, which can be included by miners at any time right now... 

On testnet it spontaneously catches fire and rejects the chain, its author doesn't even seem interested in investigating why.

Yet it's promoted as something that could be used today... :-/",2016-10-18 11:55:20

In its latest filing, a seventh amendment to its original filing, the brothers said State Street, based in Boston, would serve as transfer agent, while San Francisco-based Burr Pilger Mayer will act as auditor.

The transfer agent acts as a fund’s administrator, responsible for recording ownership changes, calculating the daily net asset value, and maintaining records.

Burr Pilger Mayer, meanwhile, will conduct monthly “proof of control” exercises, essentially an audit to show that all the bitcoin reported as being held by the fund are legitimate. The exercise will be carried out by Gemini, the Winklevoss’s exchange and trust company that will act as the ETF’s custodian, and results will be verified by Burr Pilger Mayer.

    With a Bitcoin ETF, Risk Isn’t Virtual (Sept. 7, 2014)

Bitcoin is a digital currency that isn’t backed by any government or private entity. It was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto.

The price of bitcoin in its earlier days was wildly erratic, and indeed is still volatile. However, since a spike in late 2013 and crash in early 2014, it has been more stable. This year, it has generally been rising, and is up about 48%, trading recently at $635.

An SEC-approved ETF could attract more mainstream investors to the asset, but that isn’t a sure thing and it is unclear how the SEC will rule. There has been a fairly competitive race to get a bitcoin ETF out to the investing public, and it is seen as a key conduit for the digital currency to gain exposure to more mainstream investors.

There is already a bitcoin ETF on the market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust from Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments. It trades over the counter and hasn't been approved by the SEC. In addition, another offering from a firm called SolidX is awaiting SEC approval.",2016-10-19 06:46:21

This unsafe practice is not excused by calling a rollback to older software a ""hard fork"" and then giving an example of other hard forks that could be written to do similar bad things.  There is a big difference between running older software that was previously known to work correctly vs. running new software that was deliberately crafted to do malicious things. The difference is obvious to anyone with operational experience and security awareness.

I don't see ""backward compatibility"".  I see a security risk between new data formats and older software.  People who run your new software unwittingly create data structures that are incompatible with older software, thereby creating the hazard that their bitcoins can be stolen by a thief. 

You are on notice.  If coins are stolen through an exploit caused by poor security design, you, your company, and the Bitcoin Core program will be utterly discredited. There will be consequences from supporting and distributing software that contains known security risks.

You have the intelligence and knowledge to understand what I have said here, unlike some of your sycophants who recite mantras without understanding.   You are willfully ignorant and/or actively dishonest. I do not trust you.

d8yx0j2,vbuterin,22,"With my calculations in bitcoin, in the worst case a single block can contain ~25,000 reads+writes (~40 bytes per UTXO to spend, assuming the UTXO is OP\_TRUE, ~40 bytes per UTXO to create). That's ~42 per second, and you want to be processing blocks much faster than they're coming in so you _really_ want something like 420 per second. Each leveldb read is several disk reads, an SSD read is ~100 microseconds (see http://www.thessdreview.com/featured/ssd-throughput-latency-iopsexplained/). So with no memory caching in bitcoin you're within an order of magnitude, but an order of magnitude (on top of the previous order of magnitude to account for needing to process blocks fast enough to have a reasonably low uncle rate) means it takes a week to sync a year. So if you want to have reasonably fast sync times you do need the memory caching. Ethereum actually isn't much worse; the BALANCE attack would do ~13000 with our eventual planned 5.5m gas limit, which is ~933 per second, and if you compensate for the higher gas limit that goes down to ~360 per second which is an order of magnitude off. Our current problem is basically that reading is done inefficiently, making O(log(n)) hops through the entire state tree, and we're working on solving this; once it's solved then there's nothing specific about ethereum that makes things much more difficult.

&gt; My naive understanding is that you want an pair (opcode -&gt; gas price, gas limit) such that time/memory for a transaction stays under a reasonable bound.

Yes, that's basically it. The challenge is that the benchmarking so far was not done in a worst-case setting. That said, the attacker is quite kindly helping point out the defects in the original 1.0 gas schedule and it's getting to the point where after the next fork it should be fairly robust.",2016-10-20 01:31:01

I think the facts simply disprove this view.  Back in December, the Bitcoin technical community found a useful capacity improving compromise in segwit and build [significant backing for it](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases).

In response, Bitcoin Classic was launched, which promoted BIP109 which would give roughly the same capacity but with hardly any of the risk mitigations or other improvements that were essential to building a big consortia.  If their focus was on capacity, they could have helped get segwit built and deployed, but they didn't.  Instead, they eschewed an easy road to capacity-- and their proposal is _still_ unfinished: Bitcoin ""Classic"" recently [ripped out](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/1f18a92c1c5fee5441dd8060022d7ecb80d2c58d) half of BIP109 after the surprise interoperability failure with Bitcoin Unlimited on testnet, and still no one has bothered to write an updated specification for what classic actually implements.",2016-10-20 04:16:27

d8yw8tq,thezerg1,19,"I don't think that you are really thinking this through, and you are falling into the fallacy of proposing a not-provably-correct control system that is actually just an appeal to developer authority and subsequent hope that everyone follows the rules the devs set.

You specify that there ""just has to be global consensus..."".  What if the majority of miners falsely signal and then ignore larger blocks?  The honest minority nodes get orphaned and so lose money.

What if the majority of miners ignore the signal and produce slightly larger blocks causing the ""honest"" nodes blocks to be orphaned?  This last attack is EXACTLY the attack you suggest against BU, except rather than having to produce a huge block, the miners merely need to produce one that's 11% bigger -- so propagation effects will not help.


You need to understand Fischer's ""impossibility of distributed consensus"" result: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf

This is only side-stepped in Bitcoin due to the fact that consensus is technically never achieved.  There is always some chance, no matter how tiny, that a large blockchain reorg could happen.

As I showed above, its actually your proposal that ""hopes no one does anything bad"".  The BU proposal recognises that all actions are possible and seeks to discourage them and prepare miners.

Finally, I strongly recommend that you not have ""almost my entire networth"" in any one thing, especially Bitcoin, and especially when you may not understand or have fully internalized the FLP paper.

d90d3kx,val_br,26,"That's a deep rabbit hole... nu promit sa-ti dau raspunsul perfect, dar iti dau cateva exemple din experienta personala. Edit: 2 categorii - ce sa nu faci si ce sa faci.    
A) Ce sa nu faci:  
1. Eu n-as tine banii in banci romanesti. Toate bancile o sa-ti scoata ochii cu 100k de euro garantati de stat etc. [Ei bine, si in Cipru era o garantie similara...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012–13_Cypriot_financial_crisis).  Daca stai sa citesti fine-printul din legislatia fondului de garantare o sa vezi ca sunt niste conditii foarte proaste, de exemplu ca statul iti va returna banii in lei indiferent de valuta din cont la un curs stabilit tot de stat. Pe scurt, bancile nu-s mai sigure decat alte plasamente.    
2. Liability/popriri. Desi teoretic nimeni nu-ti poate lua banii din cont fara o hotarare judecatoreasca, practica ne arata ca nu-i tocmai asa. ANAF-ul are o problema majora cu ce numesc ei declaratii de impunere - hartii prin care se pot pune popriri provizorii care iti iau banii din cont pana poti dovedi in instanta ca nu datorai banii aia.   
Doi la mana, poti avea incredere in judecatorii romani? Am un prieten care a provocat (din vina lui) un accident rutier cu daune minore si niciun ranit. Un judecator l-a condamnat la plata a ~50k euro daune morale, asta dupa ce platise daunele cauzate prin asigurare. Vrei sa fii expus la asa ceva?  
Sa fim seriosi o secunda, secretul bancar nu exista - daca ai bani in banca si cineva vrea sa-i gaseasca o sa-i gaseasca.  
3. Fara intermediari (in limitele bunului simt). Fondurile de genul BCR Obligatiuni/Erste Bonds sau cum se mai cheama acum investesc banii aia in instrumente financiare care sunt oricum publice - adica poti sa le cumperi direct de la emitent. Vrei sa cumperi obligatiuni ale Germaniei de exemplu (desi nu recomand ca au roi sub 1%) du-te sa le iei de pe siteul Deutsche Bundesbank. Vrei actiuni la Boeing/BRD/buticul din colt, ia-le de pe bursa... oricum vei trece printr-un broker, pe care l-ar fi folosit si BCR-ul. Singura diferenta daca folosesti un fond e ca vei lasa o parte din profit in comisioanele fondului.  
4. O sa ai si esecuri. Always. Nu tine niciodata mai mult de un sfert din ce ai intr-un loc.  
B) Ce sa faci:  
1. Cu &gt;10k recomand sa investesti pe pietele mari de afara - SUA, Anglia, Germania. Toate sunt deschise pentru cetateni romani, sunt sigure, ne-expuse la probleme romanesti si usor accesibile (pe internet).  
Gaseste-ti un broker serios de genul www.interactivebrokers.com, www.tradestation.com, platforma saxobankului sau chiar brokeri romani. Principiul de alegere e simplu, cu cat un broker sta mai mult pe piata cu atat e mai sigur.   
2. Fa-ti temele, verifica ce merge/nu merge pe piata. Gaseste 2-3 chestii care par bune (actiuni, obligatiuni, obligatiuni private). Pune brokerul sa cumpere si astepta. Eu de exemplu am cateva mii bagate in actiuni la Boeing si General Electric, roi de ~8% pe an cu varfuri de 10-11%.  
3. Daca esti dispus la ceva risc si bataie de cap in plus ai suficienti bani sa cumperi diverse imobile de la executori. In Bucuresti un apartament cu 2 camere executat costa cam 20k, banuiesc ca in Neamt gasesti si mai ieftin. Tranzactiile prin executor sunt absolut sigure dar trebuie sa astepti 2-3 luni ca sa se finalizeze. Daca vinzi pe credit dupa asta mai astepti 2-3 luni pana se aproba dosarul cumparatorului la prima casa. Am un prieten care face chestia asta si scoate profit de ~40-50% pe tranzactie.  
4. Citeste despre bitcoin. Merita si ca lectura pentru cultura generala, plus ca e o investitie rezonabila ca profit (dar evident riscanta).",2016-10-21 00:02:05
d90p8nd,Bitcoinopoly,26,"The problem is that he doesn't even give us his opinion. Everything he says has been carefully planned by Blockstream. Look at how he said that BS has absolutely no interest in when SegWit activates nor do they have any control or influence over that whatsoever. That is not even possible. They've made little to no money with their federated sidechains and Elements. Banks and exchanges (outside of BTCC) are developing their own blockchain-based solutions (see R3.) The only possible way that a ROI could happen is if LN becomes a huge hit, and the only possible way for that to happen is if SegWit activates. So the one lynchpin in their entire operation, the one crucial piece to the puzzle that would cause everything else to come apart if it didn't fall into place, is just of no interest to them and they aren't doing anything to try and control it?

Putting aside the astounding lack of any logic or reason in that argument, all that one has to do is look at the unbelievable amount of time G-Max spends, hours per day, almost every day, sometimes seven days per week, campaigning for SegWit/Core and against BU at all of the largest bitcoin forums, conferences, and chat rooms. So let us take this in perspective; the CTO of a tech startup spends probably 40 hours per week, or more, running around the internet and the real world to do PR for something where his company supposedly has no interest or control. I would say that this situation doesn't make any sense at all, but it is G-Max so it actually makes perfect sense. His real opinion is that BS has an overwhelming dependency on SegWit and is desperate to control the miners, the users, and everybody involved in bitcoin by any means possible to make sure it sees activation.

* If it gets activated, they gain years of near zero network growth by blaming the ecosystem for not adapting their tools.

Those miners who fail to do so will go out of business due to bad decision making or being attacked by other miners who wish to preserve the value of their investments. 

Attempting to draw any parallel between LN/SW and BU is intellectually dishonest. LN/SW absolutely do indeed require massive amounts of hope, prayer and faith. BU requires absolutely none.

This year, 2016, is the very first year where they have been constrained and can no longer raise the size of the blocks due to top-down developer constraints from Blockstream Core. 

We have a very clear record of miners choosing the upper limit on blocksize working very well for bitcoin. The price went from $0.001 to $1000 during that time and things used to work very well. Then we hit the limit and so did the price. Functionality has suffered greatly as well. Nobody has ever seen a Lightning Network in action on a large scale, not even for a single day.

Swiss bank accounts used = privacy

America fucked that up (along with more recently the panama 'leaks') so they could turn nevada, south dakota and wyoming into tax havens. 

Worse for some bully reason they force the swiss to comply to US law (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and hand over all detail of US Citizens fucking their privacy model up. So Switzerland turned around and said ok, and as this is obviously to protect US citizens (not, its a grab on private wealth) we wont offer any financial services to US citizens.

Now Bitcoin comes along and everyone can have 'a private swiss bank account' (Obama) - RELEVANCE.

The US want to turn the US into a tax haven grab as much private money as they are desperate for more cash to flow in and will accuse you of being a terrorist if you dont bank with them (not that youll get you money back if you have massive funds, civil forfeiture, assumed terrorism bs etc.)

The US is literally the worst place in the world to store money (we all know this or we wouldnt be here).

This is completely relevant as the article states:

""Many banks decided it would be easier to not accept American clients than comply with the regulations.""

So New York Bitlicense Regulation, the sniveling little shit Lawsky that pretended to be a friend, etc. 

Let's see how this plays out, because the US is out cold of a banking powerhouse that respects privacy and didnt fuck itself in the financial crisis (Switzerland).

And ironically New York is out cold of a financial powerhouse that respects privacy and didnt fuck itself in the financial crisis and removes most of their financial cartel out of the equation (Bitcoin) whilst they come to the realisation that private blockchains dont work (hence the ECB announcement during the week).",2016-10-22 03:29:08

d92sf7t,2348957234,13,"&gt; introduce a mechanism that attributes tx fees of block N to miner of N+1 under certain condition that need t.b.d. (to be studied closer...)

Bitcoin Core has done this since 0.10, called fee sniping protection. Transactions produced with it are nLockTimed to a future block so that they can't be re-mined into a block at the current height. 

&gt; introduce a ""trusted layer"" on top of pow that identifies and rejects orphans/selfish miners' blocks... in some way the disincentivises tactical mining.

Mike Hearn [suggested in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coj3uBrnxIg) amongst other things that miners should give their passport or other government ID to be able to participate in the network. At this point you should just skip the expensive mining bit, and have those people act as a multi signature who can sign blocks. This sort of thing isn't compatible with a decentralised network for obvious reasons.

&gt; Include POS elements somehow...
 
Proof of stake isn't really viable, no matter what is claimed the simple fact is that it boils down to grinding (proof of work) in many situations, and the solutions people propose just obfuscate that fact. Only proof of work is able to provide a non re-playable consensus mechanism, it's the bit of game theory that makes Bitcoin operate in the first place, to do a decentralised consensus without it would be a revelation far beyond that of Bitcoin itself, and as far as I can believe, impossible. 

PeerCoin for example needs a central issuer to sign all the blocks for them, Ethereum keeps coming up with increasingly complex systems and phrases like ""weak subjectivity"", which is to say you should phone a friend to ask them if you think your view of the network is correct because proof of stake can't actually do that for you.

What I do know, is this debate has been taking place for 18months+ and the technology has yet to scale. 

The fact that certain discussions aren't allowed to take place on this sub should be a real eye-opener. Whether you're pro-small blocks or pro-big blocks, the whole ethos of bitcoin is one of liberty and freedom. When this sub doesn't allow certain opinions and views for bitcoin scaling, I think that's a little hypocritical and short-sighted. I see pros and cons for both sides of the argument, but when one side is censored to the point a new subreddit needs opening, something is very wrong. 

Maybe someone can enlighten me, but one of bitcoins greatest feats is PoW. If the vast majority of transactions take place off-chain, is there a proposal in place to provide PoW off-chain?

Didn't Satoshi himself predict that nodes would ultimately end up being hosted by server farms? Doesn't SPV help counter the need for nodes reading the entire Blockchain?

These are genuine questions, I know a little about a lot, but certainly no expert, so would invite the experts here to enlighten me on the pros and cons for small-blocks with off-chain scaling, vs bigger blocks.

These include:

(1) Having a meaningfully limited blocksize relative to transaction load.  In this case, by meaningfully limited I mean such that there is almost always a backlog sufficient to make variance in the arrival times of blocks and fees moot. (If fees were nearly isotropic this alone would be enough, to the best of my current understanding... and most of the time we have several tens of megs of backlog, though not with remotely isotropic fees)

(2) Have wallets nlocktime new transactions that they create so they can only be included in the next block on the network or even later.  This is implemented and deployed today (IIRC as of Bitcoin Core 0.11). This creates a population of transactions whos fees can only be obtained by moving forward.

(2b) adjust timebased locktime handling so that there is not an incentive for miners to dishonestly move their clock forward to allow them to accept not yet mature transactions. (Done, per BIP113 and locked into the network).

(3) Arrange for miners to pay forward a share unexpectedly high fees, removing any disincentive to include unusually high fee transactions.  One proposed construction has been to consider the income gained for the next block as opposed to the income gained in the next two blocks including any prior forward payments, then pay forward 1/3rd to 1/2 of the difference to future miner.  Full exploration of this requires an extensive game theoretic analysis. -- especially difficult to do when we're talking about incentive dynamics in a system which is quite different from the one we have today.

(4) Make transaction fees paid by a transaction conditional the causal of the history of the chain they're included in (e.g. transaction commits to a recent block, and will not pay fees if included in a chain without that block), instead of just the height. (requires extensive incentive analysis... I'm less confident this one is interesting, though it's one of the oldest proposals in this space beyond the observation that the blocksize limit helps)

There have been a number of other proposals related to these concerns over the past four years; though many of them suffer from problems where some kind of fee behavior is enforced by the network that leaves users and miners with a local incentive to bypass the fee mechanism (e.g. by paying miners directly with transaction outputs, or entirely out of band).

I'd love to see someone to time to analyze the efforts so far or similar proposals instead of taking an an easy route to promote perpetually inflationary cryptocurrency (and Ethereum, in particular).

d95aoft,yishan,400,"/r/jailbait was less of a free speech issue than an operations issue.  The reason it was banned is rather intricate, but if you understand reddit, you'll get it:

First, something most people don't understand: naked pictures of underage girls (or boys) are not necessarily child porn.  A naked kid in a bathtub is not child porn.  A 17-year-old girl flashing her boobs is not child porn.  Child porn has a somewhat complex definition involving pre-pubescence, intent, and context.  Most people don't know this nuance of the law, but do you know who *does* know it well?  Pedophiles.  

The reason child porn is so serious is mainly because it is *evidence of a crime*, like if you have a picture of a 17-year-old having sex, it might be depicting them having sex with someone much older, and you need to report that.  It's not *necessarily* illegal per se (the laws are changing now though; but this is what they were at the time).

As a result, the pedos know exactly what IS legal and what is not, and on public sites like reddit, they are *very* careful to only share legal stuff.  Like 17-year-olds flashing their boobs but not having sex, like maybe they are just at a European topless beach or something.  So that is the kind of stuff being posted on /r/jailbait.  Because *jailbait* gets you put in jail if you have *sex* with her, not if you look at a naked picture of her.  That's the jail part.

Ok, so this subreddit gets popular, and reddit checks with its lawyers, who at the time are Advance Publication's lawyers, a big media company who knows their First Amendment shit inside and out, and these old, conservative lawyers say, ""Nope, this stuff is definitely legal, you are in the clear.""

Ok!  So /r/jailbait is totally legal!  And the mods are scrupulous about keeping it legal!  No problems, right?

Here's what happens: the subreddits gets super popular.  News articles say, ""Huge jailbait forum on reddit!  Horrifying!""  Guess what happens?  Some of the people who come are pearl-clutchers, but most of the people who read that are other pedos, so they're like ""awesome! reddit has jailbait!  I'm all over that!""

You know the thing about how ""when a subreddit becomes a default, it gets ruined?""  Because a ton of new users flood in and start posting content that doesn't really respect the rules (or traditions, or nuanced meaning (c.f. /r/cringe)) of the subreddit?

So these carpetbagger pedos start posting a TON of content, and some of it *is* illegal.  But some of it isn't.  But because it's a flood of content, the mods are overwhelmed and can't moderate it.  When mods can't moderate, the duty to moderate gets kicked up to the admins.  Especially when it's a legal-or-not issue, it HAS to be moderated.  Like, if there's a ton of shitty content in /r/cringe, that's fine - the bad stuff still isn't illegal.  In /r/jailbait, the bad/wrong stuff is illegal.

This means that a reddit admin has to look at every single picture being posted to /r/jailbait.

The team was like, five people back then.  And ONE unlucky person had to look at ALL these pictures, and make determinations like ""well, the growth patterns of her pubic hair probably indicate that she is post-pubescent, so this one is probably legal..."" or ""OMG this is clearly horrible child abuse"" and shit like that.

Well, having to do that 24/7 (because the flood doesn't stop) is HORRIBLE FOR YOUR SOUL.  No one wants to look at a stream of pictures that are already not so great, and every so often there is an AWFUL one that shocks you, and you have to keep doing it constantly because there's no end to it.

So they were like, that's impossible for us to handle, we have to shut that down, and moved the line to ""no sexualized pictures of minors.""  And the thing is about that rule is - if you post a sexualized picture of a minor, that's NOT ILLEGAL.  It's (probably not) child porn.  It's just against the rules.  So they can now police that, and make all the mods police it (if you don't police it, they shut down your subreddit), and if there's any slip-ups, at least nothing illegal has happened, unlike with /r/jailbait where you had to police everything perfectly.  You just catch the slip-up, and ban it, and you're okay - you have a margin of error.  No one's soul has to be crushed doing this horrible job.

There are literally reddit admins who have PTSD from this.  

---

To answer the other question, no, I don't think politically-minded subs affect voting patterns around reddit.  They're just lost in the noise.  People who are involved or care a lot about it think it's a BIG DEAL but the reality is frankly that no one cares.  The advertisers don't care, they're just like ""show this ad to as many people as you can.""  The days of advertisers really caring about ""what kind of content their ad appears next to"" are way over - they are savvy about social media now. 

People get all crazy about this.  The reality is that the universe (and the advertising world, and the rest of reddit) don't fucking care about you.  Did you know, for example, that MOST new reddit employees who would call themselves ""heavy users of reddit"" join the company and have no idea what SRS is?  It really is a tiny insular thing.  I was a heavy user of reddit, going back to 2005 when they launched, and I didn't even know about SRS until I joined.  Like, I think that *one time* someone mentioned ""ShitRedditSays"" so I checked out the subreddit and thought, ""I don't understand what this subreddit is about"" and clicked Back and continued reading about bitcoin or cat pictures.  That was it.

As for advertising, advertisers are just ""can you get me eyeballs"" and maybe ""can you target some people who like Samsung phones"" kind of stuff.  That's about as far as it goes.

d951u0t,DIGITAL-not-Virtual,46,"He claims blocks will fill again the moment the limit is increased, but where's the evidence for that?

Surely the evidence is quite the contrary?

Blocks never immediately reached the current 1 MB limit. It took five or six years of steady growth before the limit was reached.

Blocks have now been full for around a year. There's no historical evidence showing that if the limit were changed to, say, 8 MB that overnight all blocks would become 8 MB.

Besides, Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't mean that blocks will instantly become of unlimited size. Rather, it means the limit will be decided by consensus rather than central planning. There will still be a block size limit with Unlimited, but that limit will be flexible and will be decided consensually.",2016-10-24 11:05:39
d9545s4,garoththorp,38,"Right, this is the bit that seems to be totally lost for whatever reason. People think that giving miners control of the blocksize is going to lower *total* fees. If the miners know what they're doing, it'll instead *increase* total fees in the long term.

People extrapolate that without high fees to support mining, bitcoin will be doomed in the long term.

However, it seems obvious that if miners control the blocksize, they'd be able to decide exactly how much of a fee market they want. They'd have to balance keeping a low blocksize (to create fee pressure) vs increasing the blocksize occasionally (to allow for network growth). In the end, they will optimize for total revenue.

What does optimizing for total revenue mean? Well, right now, miners make about 3% of their profits from fees. So as far as miners are concerned, they have no reason to care about their fee revenue. They could earn 0% from fees and operate the same way.

Thus it seems that like with software startups, the best plan of action is to first acquire users -- and only thereafter raise fees. I.e. miners could raise blocksize considerably now, to allow the network to continue growing. Chill out for 4 years and earn tiny fees. After 4 years of user acquisition, they could then slow down on raising the limit, allowing the fee market to emerge again. At this point, they might find that with block rewards lowered, fees now make up 20% of their profits.

Tl;dr the fee market is irrelevant until the userbase in considerably bigger. Wasn't that always Satoshi's plan with regard to block rewards vs fees?",2016-10-24 12:05:10

If it were possible to securely determine much of anything by 'count of nodes'-- we wouldn't need mining. :)

BU promotes a radical change to the philosophy of Bitcoin based on a misunderstanding of it. They view miners as being in charge of the system rather than a security service provider for it along with a unfortunate helping of idolizing voting as an ideal decision tool rather than the unfortunate compromise. Bitcoin has from day one been a system based on antonymous validation-- where no one can tell you what to do, even if they out number or out spend you-- the fact that a very narrow but critical part of the system's functionality, the ordering of transactions and fixation of the history, depends on a very specialized kind of vote don't change the the rest of the system is based on stronger stuff, and that the system's entire premise and values are best understood in contrast to political money. The rules of the system enforced by all nodes are a lot of what create the incentives for each miner to collaborate with the system.

With Core, you have a large collection of accomplished computer scientists from the fields of cryptography and networking working together under a pretty compelling consensus governance model.

d94k7ut,Taek42,16,"I will speak up. This debate has a lot of facets. General advice in the dev community is to avoid reddit. It's toxic. Sometimes you say stupid things and they'll be held against you for a long time.  Sometimes you say really smart things and they still get held against you for a long time.

It's an exhausting fight. First XT. Then Classic. Now Unlimited.  XT was a terrible idea. 20MB blocks would have been a disaster. Classic was ultra political. 2MB blocks were really okay, but they would have gotten farther without the 'fire the core devs' attitude. Well, and a sane deployment schedule. And if they hadn't insisted on making bunch of other negative changes. I digress. Bitcoin Unlimited is a really bad idea in ways that are simple to explain. I will make a blog post today about it. Next we'll be fighting 'Bitcoin Beyond', which will have who knows what mix of good and bad ideas. This battle doesn't seem to have a conclusion, rather it's just the way of life. Best not to spend too much energy on it.

We can do a hardfork. But it has to be peaceful. And you have to let the engineers tell you what is possible and what is not possible. Stamping your feet and taking about how we're inhibiting adoption is not acceptable. That's like Elon Musk asking the engineers to double the payload of a rocket. If the engineers say the tech isn't ready, it means that no amount of executive decision is going to make the payload possible. If Bitcoin can't scale yet, then it can't scale yet. And that's a hard limitation of the technology, not something you can get around by firing your engineers and replacing them with inexperienced alternatives who don't understand the consequences.

I believe that it's time for the core devs to start taking about a hard fork in a serious way. I think Bitcoin is going to need it, and I think it's going to take 3-5 years to execute. Yes, **3-5 years**. And just like segwit, the hardfork is not going to be just raising the block size. Lots of features and changes will be introduced. Lots of fighting will happen, and lots of very good features and changes will get blocked. But maybe it is Bitcoin's destiny never to hardfork again. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it means the upgrade happens in the form of an altcoin or sidechain, **and that's okay**.

Most importantly, we need to all be on the same side. We all love Bitcoin. That's the only way an upgrade will work. If you are making enemies out of your opponent's we'll never get anywhere. Bitcoin is special because it means that centralized opposition cannot push changes into the community. But that also means that a minority can block a change easily. ViaBTC can stop segwit. Blockstream can stop Classic. If we're not friends, we don't get upgrades. Bitcoin is supposed to be able to resist governments. If it can do that, if course it can resist Blockstream and r/btc. In Bitcoin, nobody gets what they want unless everyone wants the same thing. That's how it's supposed to work, and it seems to be doing that pretty well.

There are some okay ideas floating around, some great ideas floating around, and some terrible ideas floating around. Those who know the most are often the quietest. The loudest are often the most incompetent. Not always, but often. Bitcoin unlimited is a terrible idea, it's among the worst designs ever proposed for a decentralized cryptocurrency. There is not decentralization in a future where the predominant cryptocurrency is BU. I will make that blog post, the explanation is very accessible.

I think the biggest piece that is missing is that's the community is not listening to eachother. Problems have solutions, but only if you acknowledge them. If you bulldoze complaints or ban discussion, you exacerbate the problems. Most people aren't stupid. Either they are missing important information or they know something you don't.

---

This point of view is totally rejected by programmers working in mission-critical applications (military/defense, energy, healthcare - *cryptography*) who for years have been using (formal, often *executable*) high-level *specification languages* to describe and document (and formally verify *in advance*) what their programs do:

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=executable+specification+language&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web

A mission-critical cryptocurrency would have a high-level formal executable specification in an algebraic specification language such as Maude (which has been used to develop some general tools for verifying cryptographic protocols), 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=maude+NPA+cryptography&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tezos+cryptocurrency+ocaml+coq&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=synereo+rho-calculus&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web

which would provide the following immediate benefits:

(1) It would enable mathematically *proving* that the (high-level, human-readable) specification is correct.

(2) It would allow semi-automatically deriving provably *correct* (low-level, machine-readable) *implementations* of the specification (in languages such as C++, Java, C#, etc. - or perhaps in Ocaml, with the nice possibility of producing a self-standing unikernel ""appliance"" in MirageOS).

In the case of the emerging (private) cryptocurrency [**Tezos**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tezos+cryptocurrency+ocaml&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web) (being developed by Andrew Breitman in Ocaml), this solid mathematical foundation provided by formal specification tools will be used to permit a unique kind of ""online"" governance - where the network forms consensus not only around the longest chain under the current rules, but also forms consensus around *what the rules themselves should be* - in an ongoing *online constitutional governance* process based directly on the Ocaml's built-in support for specifications (via Ocaml ""modules"").

In the case of case of the emerging (social) cryptocurrency [**AMP / Synereo**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=amp+synereo+rho-lang&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web) (being developed by Gregory Meredith in the new language Rho-lang, based directly on the pi-calculus having a long tradition going back to Tony Hoare's CSP and Robin Milner's CCS, which is also related to Yves Girard's linear logic which is ""resource-conscious"" making it a perfect mathematical fit for cryptocurrency applications), this solid mathematical foundation provided by formal specification tools will be used to provide ""smart contracts"" which can be proven correct *before* they are executed - avoiding the tragedy of Ethereum's DAO.

Bitcoin can't have these kinds of nice things because it is has been taken over by a bunch of ignorant low-level implementation language grunts (C++ programmers at Core/Blockstream - most of whom are probably totally unaware of the important above-mentioned related work that has gone one before them) who have manipulated certain historical-political-economic accidents (Gavin giving away the repo keys, [AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) buying a dev team) to position themselves as the sole ""owners"" of the (unspecified) ""Bitcoin protocol"" - and a bunch of even more ignorant lower-level non-programmers who unquestioningly worship their so-called ""expertise"".

These are the kinds of low-skilled devs who tend to produce ""spaghetti code"" as a way of to guarantee their job security. For example, SegWit-as-a-soft-fork is much messier than doing SegWit the right way, as a hard fork. But the devs at Core/Blockstream don't care about helping the Bitcoin community - [they only care about hanging on to their own power - even if it damages Bitcoin in the process.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=blockstream+hard+fork+author%3Aydtm&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

In academia and in mission-critical application areas, people laugh at the idea of writing anything mission-critical as an isolated C++ ""reference implementation"". *Maybe* a low-level implementation now and then (accompanied some kind of higher-level specification - hopefully formally verifiable and executable - or at the very least merely informal documentation such as the IETF Internet Engineering Task Force approach favored by Gavin) - but serious programmers would *never* take a low-level C++ implementation *in an of itself* as a ""specification"". It would be absolutely insane and dangerous.

d95xbuw,awemany,17,"&gt; If core lose the authority will make the hard fork easier.

Yes - but there's truth to some saying Core only have power because people still give them power.

I don't know what exactly went down in the earlier meetings of AntPool, F2Pool etc. with Bitcoin Core. However, [this action by Jihan Wu - and I guess the other miners involved in the Core meetings](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-634#post-22454) - was IMO the most damaging to Bitcoin (even if not intended to be) in recent times:

&gt; After you got the benefit of killing competition in the past months, but when you need to deliver your promise, you call your promise as being blackmailed.

(I am still glad, however, that he is honest enough to say it like that. It is a glimpse into the process which still feels to many, myself included, like having many elements of a  backroom deal..)

As a miner, you know all the ins and outs and the trade-offs, intuition and so forth when deciding on block size or other matters concerning Bitcoin from a miner's perspective. I think we are all glad here that you clearly 100% know what you are doing - and of course also that you have 'our' stance of making Bitcoin what Bitcoin was originally intended to be.

A lot of thought on the English speaking side went into the idea that apparent incoherence on miner's action could be due to language barriers, cultural differences and what not. The above 'killing the competition' statement was such a moment where I thought so as well.

It appeared to me that, likely due to the language barrier, Jihan and others thought that the western Bitcoin hemisphere is well-represented by the 'Core dev team' and what is now the screwed-up /r/Bitcoin subreddit and Bitcointalk.

So that's why I think the erosion of Core's dominance can be sped up a lot by you talking to your fellow competition and laying out what is going on here.

But I bet you are doing exactly that already.

So I want to finally end with a ""thank you"", thank you so much for your support for bigger blocks, Bitcoin Unlimited, and - in turn and most importantly - *Bitcoin itself*!

[Here on the official Bitmain shop](https://shop.bitmain.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020160307072415240XwaQIqfF06D3) the device only costs 39 USD. I suppose the difference is shipping and customs?

Based on my calculations, at current difficulty, you will mine a block with this roughly every 56,000 years. As all devices are configured as solo miners, this means one in 56,000 customers of this thing has a rough chance of finding a single block in the next year, including transaction fees valued at around 13.5 BTC and ~8,800 USD right now.

If you were compensated 'fairly' for your mining power, you would earn roughly US$ 0.15 over the next year, again, assuming constant difficulty.

In theory, it would be awesome if all Bitcoin users had devices like this at home. It would make mining more decentralized. At the current hash rate, we'd need about 34 million homes to get 50% of the mining power (assuming nobody will drop out or enter in addition to the 34 million devices added).

d98jfca,jeanduluoz,46,"Hahah, what's up - thanks for the featured comment. I just wanted to follow up with something i posted before, which is the same material with some more detail:

The greatest irony is that while blockstream might be able to manipulate bitcoin development to damage it, but I am positive that they will never make a dime. Bitcoin will struggle because off-chain solutions are not bitcoin - they are inefficient and add a middleman layer, but do nothing to scale. They just offer a trade off - for lower costs, you can either lock your funds, or use a centralized hub. Alternatively, you can have instant payments at high fees, or have a shitty time and not use a hub. Off-chain solutions don't improve bitcoin, they just change its economics.

Their magical ""off-chain layer 2 solutions"" were just buzzwords sold to investors as blockchain hype was blowing up. Austin Hill sold some story, rounded up some devs, and figured he could monopolize bitcoin. Perhaps he saw blockstream as the Apple of Unix - bringing an open-source nerdy tech to the masses at attractive product margins. But it doesn't look like anyone did 5 minutes of due diligence to realize this is absolutely moronic.

So first blockstream was a sidechain company, now it's an LN company, and if segwit doesn't pass, they'll have no legitimate product to show for it. Blockstream was able to stop development of a free market ecosystem to make a competitive wedge for their product, but then they never figured out how to build the product! Now after pivoting twice, Austin Hill is out and Adam Back has been instated CEO. I would bet he is under some serious pressure to deliver anything at all, and segwit is all they have, mediocre as it is - and now it might not even activate. It CERTAINLY doesn't monetize, even if it activates. So no matter what, blockstream has never generated revenue from a product.

Now VC guys may be amoral, but they're not stupid. The claims of ""AXA bankster conspiracy"" are ridiculous -VCs don't give a shit about ideology, but they do need to make money. These are just VC investors who saw an undeveloped marketplace ripe to acquire assets in and start stomping around. But they're not on a political mission to destroy bitcoin - they're just trying to make a bunch of money. And you can't make any money without a product, no matter how much effort you spend suppressing your competitors.

So I think with 3 years and $75MM down the drain with nothing to show for it, blockstream doesn't have much time left. Austin hill has been dumped by the board, and they hope Adam Back will turn blockstream around. But Adam back will just drive that crazy train right into the ground. Austin Hill may have been a sleazeball, but he had legitimate business and operational experience. Adam Back has none of those skills. Their product management is plummeting into oblivion.

Meanwhile.... we'll see what happens to the high-risk, overvalued tech VC market when the equity/debt bubble pops. VCs are borrowing money for free and throwing it at companies like Blockstream, because why not? But interest rates just need to move a bit to remove credit from the economy and therefore the fuel for these random inflated tech companies doing nothing.

d97a7dx,slowmoon,26,"&gt; Nothing of significance is happening. If bitcoin moons in the next year, it'll be for the exact same reason it did in 2013 - pure speculation.

I see real use of the network ramping up heavily. The two measures I like to look at for ""real use"" are localbitcoins.com volume and Total Transaction Fees in USD. 

Why? Because both are expensive.

Trading on LBC incurs a 1% fee to LBC. An expensive thing to fake. 

Similarly, paying money to miners is money that you can't get back. Spamming transactions at 10 cents per transaction gets very expensive very quickly. 

In both cases, people paying these fees are willing to shell out significant money to perform bitcoin transactions, which represents real demand for use of the bitcoin network. 

Hopefully, I've convinced you that these metrics are meaningful, because the following charts show that both of these metrics have moved up massively over the past few years.

https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees-usd?daysAverageString=100&amp;timespan=4years

I am betting that either the fundamentals have already caught up with the price or that we are well on our way to catching up with the price. And now the price is going to have to continue trending upwards to keep up with demand.

Once speculators recognize this trend as unmistakably clear, they will pile on. And if I know bitcoin speculators, they will not use restraint.

d97ktw4,YRuafraid,26,"**Non-technical Analysis** 



There was an article by BCG and Google regarding the emergence of digital payments in India. The study predicts digital payments to have significant disruption in India over the coming years, with total payments via digital currency in the range of $500B by 2020 in India alone. 

In summary, their reasoning is based on the increasing penetration of smartphones and internet on mobile (with estimated 1.2B people on mobile &amp; 650M with internet access by 2020), consumers being more demanding for instantaneous and one-touch payment solutions, emerging technologies making digital payments simpler than it is today, economic incentives for merchant adoption and positive changes in regulatory framework. 

It's a great read if you have some time:  

http://image-src.bcg.com/BCG_COM/BCG-Google%20Digital%20Payments%202020-July%202016_tcm21-39245.pdf

Now they didn't name any specific digital currency, and only mention bitcoin once in the article, but bitcoin is far ahead of the game in terms of adoption with services like ZebPay and UnoCoin gaining huge traction in India.. imo it's pretty safe to assume that bitcoin will lead the way in this digital currency renaissance and I'll mention why below.

The charts on page 23 and 26 are are interesting:

Key Barriers of Adoption
---

- Habit to use cash (68%)

- Complexity of using (55%)

- Lack of compelling value proposition (48%)

- Inertia of Non-cash methods (33%)

- Incentives / offers from other methods (29%)

- Fraud / hidden charges (27%)

- Reach (16%)


Key Barriers for Merchant Adoption 
---

- No clear benefits over payment methods (87%)

- Proclivity towards Cash (78%)

- Lack of clarity (77%)

- Not enough customer pull (67%)

- Technical Issues (48%)

-----

This absolutely applies to bitcoin or any digital currency. Merchants may not have clear benefits to use bitcoin at the moment, and many customers either find it too much of a hurdle or prefer using cash because of simplicity. Not to mention the 1MB bottleneck that makes bitcoin less than convenient as a payment channel *for now*. However we know there will be benefits for both merchants and users, and the primary barriers of entry includes lack of infrastructure, lack of simplicity and lack of convenience. Over the next years this will all change imo, and we will see significant improvements in all of the barriers of adoption. I feel confident enough to make another bold prediction [like I did back then](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3bh2k2/daily_discussion_monday_june_29_2015/csmpdj5/), that the price of bitcoin is going to be significantly higher than it is today (~$659/btc) at some point over the coming years (between 2017-2020). I think most of you guys agree, but here are my main reasons as to why... and I'm not going to mention stuff like economic downturns, European banks collapsing, and etc. 


**The Other China's** - China has been on the driver's seat for bitcoin activity, but we are beginning to see other countries emerge in that activity including Japan with electricity bills, Russia with all time highs on localbitcoin volume, Brazil/Venezuelan for protecting themselves against hyper inflation, and India on remittances. Indians send $4B/yr to students living outside of India, and receive $100B/yr from Indians in other countries sending money back home. Bangladesh, completely untapped by bitcoin at the moment, has 70 million people living in various countries sending money back home. There are clear incentives that bitcoin can provide for these remittances, and there is absolutely no reason to think that bitcoin won't tap into this market *when it becomes convenient* to do so.   


**Convenience -** Not only Bitcoin itself is improving to become more convenient (SegWit, LN), bitcoin apps will be getting better over the years as well. Better customized interfaces, intuitive design, seamless connectivity with merchants/users, use of technology like tap and go (NFC/QR codes) are all a part of bitcoin's growing infrastructure. The launch of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) in India allows easy implementation of any payment processor and has potential to drive large scale adoption of digital payments. And finally, Lightning Network --which a lot of people dismiss as ""vaporware"", which is weird as it's been in testing and we know it's coming-- will also be a significant win in the convenience department. For bitcoin to be competitive against other non-P2P payment channels, and for it to handle the volume of transactions for world-wide usage as mentioned above it needs INSTANT transactions, not 10 minute transactions where block size becomes a bottle neck. Users will not know whether their transactions get confirmed on-chain or off-chain, what they will notice is that their money is being transmitted instantly with almost negligible fees. I really think LN is the answer for mass-scale bitcoin adoption and I believe it's coming. 


**Confidence -** Bitcoin has the most mature blockchain protocol with a $7B security bounty which is unparalled by any other alt coin. As far as competition goes Ethereum, Dash, Monero, Litecoin, Doge, Ripple, etc etc etc are no where close to reaching bitcoin's penetration. There are thousands of alt coins with better one-off features than bitcoin (which second layer/side chain innovations overcome anyway) but they are more prone to attacks, and we typically have no idea if they will have a lasting development support. With bitcoin you have dedicated developers who are some of the most talented experts in the field under the umbrella of a company with $77M in funding. As much as some people dislike Blockstream this gives people confidence. This is also why I don't agree with the analogy that bitcoin is myspace-- when it comes to money confidence and adoption are more important. We have come a long way since the 2013 when bitcoin was still considered drug money for the internet. The quick recovery from the BFX hack was another example of the gaining confidence in bitcoin.

**ETF -** We know it's happening, and I know we've been waiting for this for 3 years but it is happening... and let's be honest here you don't want to be caught on the other side when the news comes out. Nuff said.


**$10B Market cap is peanuts -** If you really think we are going to remain here over the next few years, which is absolutely ludicrous, you do not have confidence in the success of bitcoin, period. 

Misc:

**Kim Dotcom -** I'm not sure what this nerd is up to, but he likes to do big things and he's been hyping big moves in bitcoin price with his reputation on the line. “I want to take Bitcoin mainstream,” Kim Dotcom told Max Keiser on The Keiser Report. “In order to do that, we need to have a really powerful, popular site that can carry Bitcoin to the next level, and I believe that Mega Upload 2 can be that site."".... so take it how you will, yolo!

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously!

d9812o9,todu,22,"&gt;&gt; What would happen to the 45 000 transactions if everyone would use that automatic wallet you suggested?

&gt;The market would allocate the scarce resource of blockspace.  Markets decide who gets to use limited resources by the price mechanism.

First of all, the scarce resource you're talking about is *artificially* scarce because the Blockstream / Bitcoin Core developers have decided it to be by refusing to upgrade the blocksize limit. 

Secondly, what you're saying is the same thing as I am saying, which is that those 45 000 transactions ""don't get to use Bitcoin"". You just say the same thing with different, more positively sounding words. 

&gt;Q: What would happen if 1 million people want a share in Google, when they are only 100 thousand shares available?

&gt;A: Well the share price may go up, and the shares will be allocated to those willing to pay the most.  This market system is one of the most efficient resource allocation systems known to man, and responsible for massive increases in the quality of life over hundreds of years.

What would happen? At least 900 000 people would own 0 shares of Google, that's what would happen. And unnecessarily so, because if Google would just split their stock into 1 000 000 000 shares, then everyone would be able to buy at least one share each without the shares ever going to 0 pieces left. 

&gt;You may not like the principal [sic] or idea of the current 1MB limit (luckily many want to increase it, please be patient), 

We've been patient since 2010 when the limit was introduced and immediately questioned by people such as /u/caveden for example. We ran out of patience since approximately early 2015. We are in the process of forking Bitcoin away from your control, and you know it. You were at the Hong Kong Roundtable agreement meeting in February 2016 so you very likely are aware of the fact that the current conversion among miners and mining pools in China is no longer ""if"" but ""how"". Your days of controlling Bitcoin protocol development are numbered and I'm sure you know it. 

You small blockers do want to increase the limit, yes, but you want to increase the limit by an insignificantly small amount. So de facto you don't want to increase the limit. You just say you do but you know very well that we big blockers are not talking about a puny 850 KB limit increase. We're talking about numbers such as 16 MB of immediate increase that does not have to ""grow slowly"" like is the case with your offered 850 KB limit increase through Segwit. Your rhetorics are dishonest when you say such things as ""we all want to raise the limit"" and then not making the necessary distinction. 

&gt; however the fundamental idea of using markets to allocate scarce resources is sound, in my view.  Blockspace will always be scarce, even in the large blocker extremist scenario, of miners catastrophically pushing the blocksize right up to the limit, where orphan risk costs is stretched to the maximum, it is still a scare resource.

Yes, blockspace will always be scarce. It has been scarce since the genesis block but the fees were kept low anyway because when the blocksize limit was first introduced the median blocksize was just 10 KB. Just because we raise the blocksize right now to 16 MB (default recommended BU setting), does not mean that the blocks will be even a quarter full. 

Just look at how the median blocksize grew between the years 2009 to 2015 on any block explorer website. It will show that if you have a limit that's 1 MB but a median blocksize of 10 KB at the time of introduction of the limit, then it will literally take 6 years to even hit the limit much less constantly press against it. 

Also, if miners choose to create and accept blocks close to the *actual* limit where it starts being financially profitable to start orphaning blocks because they're too large, or that they spontaneously get orphaned because they take too long to propagate compared to competing smaller and therefore faster blocks, then there's nothing ""catastrophical"" about that. That's just normal operation and one of the several factors that all miners consider when they put a price on a given transaction. 

You say you're letting a market decide how to price a scarce resource. No, you're centrally planning the size of the fee by enforcing a fixed blocksize limit. If you let the market decide the size of the blocksize limit, like Bitcoin Unlimited does, *then* you're letting a market decide how to price a scarce resource. What you're describing is not a capitalistic market; you're describing a communist production quota of exactly 1 MB and global blocksize limit that has to be shared with everyone. That artificial and centrally planned production quota is set to 3 tps for 7 billion people. Karl Marx would have been proud of Blockstream. ",2016-10-26 12:21:09

On a serious note you have to think one step further.

If you raise the block size, you will allow more people into the ecosystem and thus you have more chance of people setting up nodes and contribute to bitcoin security is various ways. The amount of security you lose because of higher bandwidth and storage needs will be compensated by the overall larger user base, and more.

Had I wanted a system that was highly scalable in it's most basic layers, systems like Paypal and Visa already widely available and easily compatible with the money I already had.

There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient.""

In 2011 Dan Kaminski, after reading Mike Hearn's ""dump everything into the blockchain"" scalability page on the Bitcoin wiki (which he protected with edit warring) he described Bitcoin's decenteralization as pretextual-- because growth would destroy it.

Bitcoin is not a currency; it's a commodity.  It's not backed by the full faith and credit of any sovereign, which is really the most important aspect of a currency.

d99cxfu,nullc,27,"&gt; Will segwit relieve congestion pressure?

Hopefully not-- reduce? absolutely. But the system operating with back-pressure is important.

One reason that it is important is because without it there isn't a stable fee market. As you can see the transition between market behavior and 'whatever, everything paying much of anything fits' is a bit bumpy at times. Without the stable market they'll be nothing to pay for security in the long run, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400519

The other reason is because as the subsidy goes down mining incentives need a fee backlog to keep miners incentivized to go forward rather than fight each other over the tip. https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a54

It's especially important that the ecosystem doesn't establish a practice that as soon as congestion starts forming, there will be an intervention the takes it away. This results in a vicious cycle where rational participants will not invest in the development needed to handle it, which results in it being all the more urgent to prevent it.. and the conclusion is an impossibly loaded chain that drives centralization and an non-viable fee market with bad mining incentives-- rescuing such a system might require the addition of monetary inflation and or centralizing mining with signed blocks instead of POW.   We already went through this experience with the soft limits... in 2011 there was a 250k soft limit, ten increasing backpressure above that to 500k. over time the automatic backpressure was removed and the limits were bumped as soon as they were hit. As a result most wallets didn't have dynamic fees a year and a half ago. People even argued that the block size _had_ to be bumped because the soft limits had been bumped and the bump of the soft limits was an implicit promise to keep increasing.

[What is... DOG BEAR?](http://press.invincible.ink/what-is-dog-bear/)

Dog Bear is a game of generating and playing out a Metal Gear Solid-style sneaking mission. Dog Bear is a few good secret agents sitting around a poker table, answering The Boss's question, ""Well, that was a hell of a mission. How *did* you survive all that?""

Dog Bear uses a deck of cards to generate your code name - whether you're Eel Octopus, Whisky Flying, or Autumn Shark - and flesh out your character with traits like ""Never backs down"" and ""Eyepatch"" and ""Secretly a dog"". The cards also determine your mission - whether you're in an abandoned prison complex trying to kill a school of cyborg piranhas before the dangerous eco-terrorists can unleash them, or infiltrating an arctic cold war bunker to rescue an intriguing scientist from misguided bitcoin thieves.

It's The Boss's job to weave these elements into a mission and determine what obstacles you face, and your job to use the cards in your hand to overcome those obstacles. The four suits have different uses as both tactics and obstacles:


* Club: Fight

* Diamond: Tech

* Spade: Sneak

* Heart: Feels

That's right, when faced with a guard you try to face them in head-on combat, or spray them with knock-out gas, sneak past them, or... you might explain to The Boss that you knew this guard - you grew up with him, and you didn't know how he ended up with these terrorists, but you knew you could win him over to your side. However, when you play a card to overcome an obstacle, The Boss will flip another card off the deck to see if you succeed. If the opposing card is higher, The Boss will explain how your attempt was thwarted, or how it only led to more complications, based on the suit of the higher card.

Dog Bear is not a challenging game - after all, you all made it out of the mission and back to The Boss for your debriefing. There are ways to help your teammates that make failure very easy to avoid, unless you want to fail to see where it takes the story. Dog Bear is a game of ridiculous scenarios and shocking plot twists, where no matter how stacked the odds are against you, you know you'll find a way, *some* way, to get out alive.",2016-10-27 12:57:51

On the basis that other actors maintain a greater than 5% rate on mining, our options appear to be either all out war or stagnation at 1MB and the resulting drop in valuation.

Scenarios I see are:

* SegWit signalling hits 95% and activates.
* SegWit fails to activate and the status quo remains.
* Miners switch to BU and the blocksize increases.

The recent increase in the underlying bitcoin price makes me wonder if there are rumblings anew in the Chinese mining fraternity that may evolve into a greater migration towards BU. From my perspective these periodic spikes are matched closer to miners moving from their current positions towards bigger blocks rather than Yuan devaluation or Deutsche Bank woes.",2016-10-27 20:04:00
d99v3i8,centurion44,21,"&gt;There's an infinite amount of ways. 

Okay, so why did you say a single way?  Sorry, petty.

&gt;Look, the concentration of wealth create economic aristocrats and that's evident.  Some people control the way wealth is distributed simply because they were born with the privilege of having wealth, thus they are called economic aristocrats.

Repackaged Karl, but whatever, sure, the concentration of private wealth tends to create a class of individuals who benefit from that economic privilege as do their descendants to some degree.

 &gt;There's no economic or social advantages to that. These people don't know better than others were is best to invest that wealth to make the economy more efficient.

There are social and economic advantages, at least in my opinion, particularly socially.  Peoples desire to accrue and develop their wealth is increased when they can leave it to their offspring.  People are often satisfied if they can leave something like an economic legacy to their children.  So there is an *infinite number of ways* that the ability to leave inheritances after you pass can give utility within society.  

&gt; These people don't know better than others were is best to invest that wealth to make the economy more efficient.

Also, ignoring the assumption, people with concentrated wealth often have the means and ability to hire people who do know.  Anyway, everyone knows the most efficient way is to just put 33% of your portfolio into index funds, 33% into money aka gold, and 33% into bitcoin.  The remaining 1% goes into apple stock. 


&gt;On the other way, people should earn wealth depending on the work they do. You have more valuable or demanded skills, you earn more.

Okay…..

&gt;So my idea of what the solution should be is to create a separation between owning assets and investments versus receiving a wage. On one side, we have a free market for human capital and we leave it as it is. On the other side, we make owning assets and investment democratic. 

Wait, what?  This is very confusing.  I think I understand what he is trying to say, but I have no idea how to word it.  We all work and are paid a wage based on L and W S/D but we are also all in a gigantic societal co-op where everything is owned equally by every person and everyone has a ‘vote’ (stock) in everything and things like the stock market and corporations function entirely the same way but everything stays perfectly distributed? 

&gt;In this economic democracy, everyone would own the same amount of investment power. They use their investment power to buy the investments they wish to buy and there's still a free market for that. Money earned from wages wouldn't enter that market.

How is there a free market if you divy up the ‘investments’ like a commissar handing out beets.  What happens if my investment fails and I lose my shares, are they regularly redistributed to maintain an even playing field?  Or, at birth, are people given X ‘investment dollars’ like my Uncle gives me Bonds?  What happens as the market grows?  Are people allowed to enjoy gained value in say, share price?  Or is all growth handed out and redistributed.  If so, why would anyone ever invest anything? 






&gt;It results in everyone receiving some dividends from owning parts of humanity's modes of production.

*means of production intensifies*

 &gt;If there's a large economic displacement events, everyone benefits from it. 

AKA, when the robots come.  But you know, a legitimate problem, just not sure, ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY is the path.

&gt;Nobody is begged for their wealth to distribute a basic income.

The government doesn’t beg for wealth from the citizenry in a democratic nation.  The government takes what wealth it sees fit as an extension of the peoples will and sends *MEN WITH GUNS* when you don't pay up.

&gt; Public goods are still paid via taxation.

Why would the government need to tax people when it is divvying up the ‘investments’ which means it has total control over various industries.  Unless some third party is the one divvying up the investments.  In which case, can I apply?

&gt;People who contribute more to society still earn more through their wage. Capitalism is still capitalism, but it's democratic. 

How is capitalism democratic or not right now. What you just, I think, described is just some bizzaro world communism where people are given wages instead of food rations.  Instead the rations are ‘investments’



&gt;If people decide some ventures that isn't socially acceptable shouldn't be invested into, then they don't.

People already do this.

So you can still get rich from your investments?.  So how do you assign ' investments' to people?  Hell, how do you split up returns?  HOW DO YOU KEEP THIS INSANE SYSTEM BALANCED AND EVENLY DISTRIBUTED?  

&gt;It would be an incredibly better system.

[More gooder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c)


So basically we have a new economic ideology to hitch our wagons to folks.  It is called, **Economic Democracy**.  Basically, how it works is when you are born you are assigned tree fiddy worth of ‘investments’ that you can invest in humanities stock market.  We haven’t quite worked out how to make sure the system stays balanced and how to prevent people from becoming rich and other people from becoming poor via their investments.  But it will be super awesome and like kickstarter and people can choose what they think is coolest.  But don’t worry, if you lose all your ‘investments’ you will still have a job and be paid a wage depending on your value.  But no, you may not save or invest any of that money.  Also, the government won’t be involved in this process at all, humans will just get together and hand out ‘investments’ as they become available.  Oh, and if this whole process' purpose is to prevent economic displacement and people not having jobs due to automation won't people then not have a job and wage to rely on?  Oh well, I guess you can always sweep the streets for ~~radishes~~ *investments* 

I have this sinking feeling that somehow, everything this guy said is reasonable and I'm actually just an idiot.  In which case, the investment restructuring can't come soon enough.

Greg is most comfortable when he can confuse people by talking about topics where he knows more than they do. This is why he loves to talk about the intricacies of his C++ spaghetti-code Bitcoin reference client [implementation-masquerading-as-a-specification](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5979iv/vitalik_buterin_on_twitter_in_2016_does_anyone/d96edw9/) - where (by definition), he's automatically gonna know more than everyone else.

Adam doesn't tend to comment much around here, and when he does, he tends to flail. He's had some great ideas in cryptography (I remember admiring his comments years ago on bitcointalk.org regarding ""homomorphic encryption"" - which went on to become the basis for the proposed Confidential Transactions), but he's not a great communicator, and he tends to garble his message.

But the current post here is about venture capital, return on investment, bringing a product to market - topics where many other people know much more than Greg and Adam do.

And to make matters worse: Greg and Adam have turned out to be total failures in these areas: wasting all that venture capital with no product and no return on investment.

I personally conjecture that it's quite possible that the owners of Blockstream ([AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on) etc.) actually want to kill Bitcoin - and they have willing to spend $76 million to preserve their trillions in ""fantasy fiat"". But I realize this is merely conjecture and many people regard it as a ""conspiracy theory"".

Meanwhile, if we stick to the the more ""normal"" theory (Blockstream's owners are just greedy VCs who want to make money on their investment), then they must be getting very frustrated with the failure of Greg and Adam to deliver any working level-2 product, while also crippling the existing level-1 product.

d9ak19a,Merlin560,25,"Point and Figure Chart for The Day

The price broke upward last week and its continued it move.  At one point this morning it exceeded $690.  This is $20 above the target for this move.  With that movement up two more boxes, we’ve entered into a long pole situation. 

The movement up, under normal circumstances, would be exhausted at this point and normally it would reverse downward about 1/2 the height of the “pole.”  That would put the move down into the $640 range.  Such a move, wether fast or slow, should be expected. 

There is a general consensus that China is driving this bus.  If the Yuan continues to devalue against the dollar, it should be positive for bitcoin.  That might be the wildcard here that allows it to run.

How am I trading it?  I am holding at this point and I would sell anything under $640.  As I am more of a long term holder, my cost basis is down in the mid $500’s.

Since we usually see some upward movement going into Friday’s it will be interesting to see where we go.  $700 is the next place with decent resistance.  Then its a pretty clear way to $790-800.  The movement from $800 to the ATH is just a hop skip and a jump. 

Late this afternoon there was a post on ZeroHedge that indicated a move to a price target of $848.  If there is a reaction to this “target” expect the price to overshoot.  This is the kind of thinking that results in an overshot to the ATH, and a retreat down to $848.

So, this week I am optimistic.

The question is which blockchain will win. Let's compare Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can, but better. For example block time is 40 times faster, more than 2 times the number of transactions per second, better proof of work algorithm, etc. I don't think you can find a single thing where Bitcoin is better on a technological level. Plus Ethereum has smart contracts. So, Bitcoin can revolutionize payments... Ethereum can revolutionize payments, contracts, law, governance models, etc. 

Imagine Ethereum was released in 2009. Then, 8 years later, someone introduces Bitcoin. Would anyone pay attention to it? Of course not. It's getting attention now because it's the incumbent. I introduced my friend to Ethereum and he got a chance to play around with it a while ago. He then wanted to buy some and had to go through Bitcoin. He was surprised how slow Bitcoin is compared to Ethereum, he said it's like using dial up Internet. Sometimes it can take hours to get your transaction included.

Some people would say that Bitcoin has 2 advantages: immutability and smaller attack surface. The first one is literally not true. The second one is nonsense.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of bitcoin.

- Reddit definition of bitcoin

For a more comprehensive overview of what bitcoin is, its Wikipedia page is a great resource.

Bitcoin represents a tiny part of my portfolio but I'm intending to build the size of the stake a little bit. In my view, it is a suitable minor component of the left side (safe side) of The Black Swan Portfolio. Please note: Bitcoin is extremely volatile.

There are a few things coming together why I'm writing it up now:

1) We are getting ever closer to a bitcoin ETF

The SEC is gathering input on the Winklevoss Brothers initiative (Pending:COIN) and it looks like some kinks could use working out this appear doable. Even if they fail, I suspect we are going to witness an ETF or fund getting launched at some point. Here's the latest SEC letter.

2) Funds are launching and there is great demand

HK, run by the FRMO Corp. (OTCPK:FRMO) team and a Black Swan Portfolio holding, started a fund for its clients (emphasis mine) and there was a lot of interest:

In 2016, Horizon Kinetics also established a fund that invests in bitcoin. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency. This asset class will be discussed more fully in the section pertaining to our investment in Digital Currency Group. This asset class did not exist several years ago; it is entirely new. The fund established an investment maximum of $50,000 per client. We are not aware of any other firm that so constrains client contributions. However, we believe it is the easiest and most obvious way to control risk. We simply limit the amount of money that can possibly be lost to an amount that is tolerable. Investment firms often complain about the short-term focus of clients. The short-term focus is more understandable if the investment in failure mode could quite negatively impact their lives. In any case, we rapidly sold essentially every available slot in the fund.

I've learned from the company they have two funds that are open to accredited investors only and limit investments to $50,000 for now.

3) Funds have started buying in

Ark Invest, an investment firm, read their white paper on bitcoins, holds bitcoin through the GBTC trust. It holds GBTC in its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). Horizon Kinetics also invests in GBTC though its Kinetics Internet Fund No Load (WWWFX), Kinetics Paradigm Fund No Load (WWNPX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKAX). When fund buying starts ramping up this can have a profound effect on the valuation of bitcoin because 1) On a global basis there's over $100 trillion in assets under management. Imagine only a 1/10th of 1% getting moved into bitcoin. 2) Institutions holding for diversification or long-term investment purposes may have much steadier hands than the current bitcoin traders, which could help stabilize bitcoin's volatility, which would in turn make it more attractive to other investors and retailers.

4) Family offices are buying in

Perhaps by nature more interested in wealth preservation, family offices appear to be acquiring bitcoin. Murray Stahl on the FRMO Corp. Q3 earnings call:

Believe it or not, bitcoin is making progress. There are family offices, quite a few of them actually, that are buying bitcoin. The issues about safe custody and storage are technological problems that are being worked out.

5) Optionality

The downside is admittedly quite large with bitcoin. It is conceivable it becomes worthless and it has been proclaimed dead no less than 112 times. The last time in Newsweek October 12th.

The upside is also large. Bitcoin is already 10x larger than Linden Coin (of the game Second Life) at its peak. What can bitcoin become? Could it become as important as gold? Can it replace all money? I don't know but the visualization made by the money project in 2015 gives an idea of the relative size of the bitcoin ""market cap"" compared to other assets:



Source: The money project

My allocation is less than 1% and I prefer a basket of cryptocurrencies to any particular cryptocurrency, but I'll talk about those in a future article. The ultimate value of some of these coins is very large and without any cap and therefore I prefer to diversify between them. Read my prior Bitcoin articles: 6 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Invest In Bitcoin and 5 Reasons To Buy Bitcoin.

Good places to acquire Bitcoin and Ethereum are:

Coinbase (U.S.-based, if you use this link and buy $100 worth we both get $10 bitcoin free)

Kraken (U.S.-based, you can use this alternative)

I use the above-mentioned Coinbase for a cryptowallet. It is very user-friendly. No advanced tech knowledge required. In addition, you can also hold Ethereum which I find convenient.

d9b2hnc,todu,17,"&gt; At least we can all unite behind SegWit in a period of unity, before **we inevitably begin arguing about the next blocksize increase again**, as soon as SegWit activates. [Emphasis mine.]

This is one of the main reasons that we do not want Segwit to activate. We don't want to have this conflict again just 6 months from now. What we want to activate is a permanent solution to the blocksize limit problem and debate. We will solve this problem by activating Bitcoin Unlimited instead.

In addition to the above, Segwit will not even solve our need for a bigger blocksize limit *at all* because the 0.8 MB limit increase will not be immediate. It will grow over time and finally reach 0.8 MB, after everyone on the network has started using Segwit transactions instead of today's standard transactions. So it wouldn't be surprising if it would take a whole year before half the community would've started using Segwit for their transactions, which would give only half of the 0.8 MB Segwit benefit (only 0.4 MB). So Segwit does not even solve our need for a bigger limit *temporarily*, much less permanently.

I would not expect Viabtc and the bitcoin.com pool to change their minds on refusing to activate Segwit. They have 12 % of global hashing power and Segwit needs 95 % to activate. Segwit will very unlikely ever activate. Bitcoin Unlimited is much more likely to activate instead, which would solve this debate and conflict *permanently*.",2016-10-28 14:14:34
d9ajzv4,spoonXT,17,"Quoting Needham:
&gt; Bitcoin has improved significantly since it was initially released nearly 8 years ago, and we think the outlook is bright. The latest major version (released August 23) contains 14 notable changes from 101 contributors around the world (decentralized much?), including a set that benefits scaling at the protocol level and eases the process for further scaling improvements (“segregated witness”). For those interested in the specifics of the latest release, we recommend the release notes which summarize the big changes.

We have our nearly 2 MB bump (Actually we could have 4 MB blocks !)

So what you will do, r/btc crowd, Roger Ver and ViaBTC ?

You will stall progress ?

You stall on-chain scaling ?

The ball is in your camp !

You can activate on-chain scaling with major technical fix for Xmas 2016, maybe even mooning the market as a side gift !

I wait that you become rational again, thanks :)

Before 2013, there were about 3-4 other such instances where the price shifted rapidly up an order of magnitude, then even-more-rapidly retraced a goodly portion of the rise. They're called ""bubbles"" and many long-term holders are not only not ""scared of it happening again nowadays"", we're waiting patiently for more such bubbles, because after the dust settles each time, Bitcoin has grown dramatically in terms of exposure, utility, popularity, and price. 

Markets exhibit cyclical patterns of fear and greed. The greed helps these bubbles occur. The fear helps them end. The cycle repeats. Fortunately, underneath it all, there is a useful and exceptionally-well-thought-out protocol of money that provides the right incentives to compel significant global adoption, so while there's no guarantee that Bitcoin will take over the world or anything, there's a very very high likelihood that it has a few more dramatic surges yet to go.

Old coins need to remain spendable.

&gt;&gt; Segwit updates the 1MB block size limit to a 4M unit block weight limit,

&gt; 4MB?

No, 4 million weight. Weight is not bytes, it's an abstract unit that better reflects costs to the network somewhat better than a simple size does.

&gt; &gt; Larger blocks will result in higher resource requirements for full nodes, potentially causing users to shut down their nodes, which would result in higher centralisation.

&gt; where is the data to support this? All I see here is your opinion with no data to back it up

That larger blocks require more resources is an objective fact based on the construction of the system, it's not really up for dispute. Regarding the effect, the text states 'potentially' -- I don't know what the author of this was thinking of, but we get basically non-stop complaints to Bitcoin Core from users based on the resource usage of their node (particularly the amount of resources it takes to start one for the first time). These concerns are also supported by [network measurement](http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/block-size-1.1.1.pdf).

&gt; indicated Satoshi planned for btc to be able to hard fork when needed, which is could do as a minority and start a 'alt-chain' or it could do as a majopirty and force the previous establishment into being the alt-coin

Pretty rude to put words in someone's mouth, especially someone whom you've never spoken. The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.

&gt;  the two chains could survive in different niches,

There are already plenty of altcoins... but in general money gains its value from network effect, Bitcoin voluntarily splitting up it's network effect would almost certainly be bad news.

Segwit = Segregated Witness.  Basically it is an upgrade that takes the signatures connected to every transaction, and allocates them separately. Signatures separated aka Segregated witness.  It allows for a much broader scripting capability and changes how blocksize is measured, essentially giving an increase to a 1.5-2mb blocksize as far as transactions go.

d9csgtq,thisusernamelovesyou,46,"I have nothing to do and I speak this language, so I'll translate this for you guys.

""The festival of Diwali is close. Diwali is considered the festival of the Goddess Lakshmi, and that's why, on this day, we pray to Lakshmi. The indian Rupee is known as a form of the goddess. You've probably seen many forms of Lakshmi - or money, like the Indian rupee, American dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Europe's euro. All these currencies are a form of the goddess Lakshmi.

Most of these are made of paper - you can see them with your eyes and put them in your pocket, and you can feel them too. If you go to a country, you need to use only that country's currency. But have you ever heard of a currency that nobody can see? But still, it has become the world's most valuable currency? We are talking about Bitcoin. This is a kind of 'digital currency'. If the Internet was a country, then maybe Bitcoin would be the Internet's national currency.

It's possible that many of you have never heard of Bitcoin. And even if you have, you probably don't know how it works and what it is. So, we've decided to tell you about the world's most valuable currency - because as of today, one coin is worth 45,000 Indian rupees. It doesn't matter that you can't see it, because it's a digital currency. We're also making this segment because an Indian agency is trying to freeze a Bitcoin exchange. Drug sellers are using bitcoin, and a division of the Indian government, the Narcotics Control Bureau has seized 500 bitcoins. As one bitcoin is 45k rupees, the amount frozen is around 2 crores and 25 lakhs.

You're probably wondering - what is bitcoin? How does it work, and why do people worldwide want to buy it? We're going to answer all of these questions today. Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, that was specially made for the digital world. Bitcoin can be used whenever and wherever you like. Bitcoin allows for anyone in the entire world to send money to another individual. The best part is, you don't need a bank or a third-party agency to help you out. That means, whenever you'd like to send money, you can send it directly from your Bitcoin wallet to the other person's. This means you only need to pay about 1 rupee in fees, which is very little. Right now, thousands of people are using Bitcoin instead of fiat. If you want to exchange money, you need banks. Banks decide how much money is circulated in a country. However, bitcoin is something that is not controlled by banks, agencies or the government. An exchange of bitcoins happens directly between two people. This transaction is completely encrypted, making it a secure and super-fast way to send your money. However, in your wallet, you don't get notes. You get digital codes, and these codes are your money. 

Now let's explain how bitcoin's value works. Five years ago, one bitcoin was only six rupees. But now, one bitcoin is 45k rupees. Bitcoin was born seven years ago, on 3rd January 2009, thanks to a programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. Till date, nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Several people have pretended or claimed to be Nakamoto - but in reality, nobody knows much about the true creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto's aim wasn't to create a currency - it was to prove that, even without a third-party, financial transactions can indeed be made. On the 22nd of May 2010, a pizza was bought for 10,000 bitcoins. This was back when one bitcoin was just 10 cents. But today, bitcoin has risen several thousand percent. Since the inception of bitcoin, many people are trying to buy it, and it's value is rising.

&lt;money counting scene&gt;

The world has different countries - different cultures, different people. Different languages, different cuisines, different powers. But there is one thing that connects everything in the world, and that thing is money.

Today, almost every action requires money - whether it be buying food, buying water, buying a house, or buying weapons - we need money for everything. Several people waste their lives trying to earn money. For money, people work hard, create conflicts, commit crimes - sometimes even kill. But have you ever wondered that this money - this currency - this piece of paper that we call a 'note' - what exactly is it? That piece of paper is a promise. A promise to give you the amount of value written on the note. When you give this note to a shopkeeper, then this 'paper of promise' is with him. The shopkeeper gives you stuff in return. That means, the only value in this paper is the promise that the Reserve Bank of India is making to you. But when you store your cash in a bank, the bank takes a large amount of your money and loans it out to other people. You can see money in your bank account, but the truth is, that money isn't there. The person who loaned out your money buys more stuff, and puts more money in the bank. The bank loans out the money in return, taking a greedy interest as well. This way, that piece of paper becomes the most important financial promise. The truth is, even if only 3% of people all withdrew their money from their banks, the banks would not have enough money to pay them. The entire monetary system is dependant on governments and banks. If a bank messes up, then all your money could be lost. But, bitcoin is an attempt to get away from this regulation and this danger of banks.

Bitcoin is a digital currency and a software. Blahblahblahblah repetition of previous points""

d9ddx8q,insette,43,"At the recent height of network congestion, I couldn't use Bitsquare, a *decentralized* exchange, because it was taking over 18 hours to get my $1000 multisig deposit confirmed on the blockchain.

Proponents of Blockstream Core will claim big blocks lead to centralization, but this is pure conjecture. Due to 1MB blocks, I couldn't use a decentralized exchange service, and was instead forced to use a centralized exchange. *That's* real world centralization, caused by small blocks.

Proponents of Blockstream Core will further claim Lightning Network, or sidechains, or TumbleBit, or some other trendy unproven technology will offload low value transactional demand, saving the day. What they don't get is users like me who make high value transactions *don't like waiting* 18 hours for a single confirmation. They don't get that no amount of fiddling with RBF, and no amount of fee increases will make for faster confirmations for a larger number of users.

If low value transactions can't be made on chain due to user experience failures, then in all likelihood, high value transactions won't be made on chain due to the exact same user experience failures.

Proponents of Blockstream Core will claim that users can simply *not use Bitcoin* in times of high congestion. Unfortunately, due to the self-interested nature of cryptocurrency investors, combined with the echo chamber effect perfected by Theymos, this results in rapid diversification away from BTC into altcoins. Meanwhile the people who have diversified will shout that everything is fine in Bitcoin-land, while shilling for their newest, shinier investment product on the sly. We saw this constantly with Ethereum up until the DAO disaster which quite possibly was the only thing that saved Bitcoin's bacon.

Proponents of Blockstream Core will claim that altcoins can't and won't challenge Bitcoin for world reserve currency status. But Bitcoin is a *service*, and the users of this *service* want to transact in the underlying to gain freedom, to save time or money, and for other reasons. Transacting in a money is the *entire point* of a money. You can't have a world reserve currency if that currency isn't useful for transactions.

We must raise the block size limit and take Bitcoin back from Blockstream Core. Priority fees, to get next block confirmation, for very small transactions are pushing $0.50 *today*, and this is with no more than 10M people globally adopting Bitcoin. The situation is becoming increasingly hopeless. All it would take is for a small number of large investors to file for the exits for this situation to go from hopeless to *beyond repair*.",2016-10-30 09:33:26

I don't like this article, mainly because it talks about modifying bitcoin to make this work. But this is fundamentally against core principles of bitcoin in how its protocol was created - it was meant to have pseudonymity to enable users to be tracked or not voluntarily. Codifying something like a transaction tax for a UBI into the currency only makes sense in a currency *designed* around it, and you can do it in a much easier way than embedding genomes in the blockchain.

You *want* centralization on something like this, or at least a system of accredited consensus rather than generic consensus. For one, creating fake DNA profiles is radically easy, because you will be unable blockchain-wise to determine the legitimacy of a self-reported DNA profile. Additionally, a lot of people would rather their genetic code be private, and if you were placing the code on the blockchain in an encrypted form it is already indistinguishable from fraudulence.

You won't find uniqueness in random patterns. If you want one account per user, you need some centralization of identity, and that would either be direct (the central authority issuing accounts) or deferred (the account creation process requiring a third party unique identity verification from a centralized source).

Cryptocurrency as a state institution seems highly inevitable to me, because of all the myriad benefits you get in tracking your users, controlling money flows through taxes, and eliminating untraceable paper money. But they won't be bitcoin, but that doesn't stop them from implementing a UBI into the protocol either.

Most cryptocurrencies are already effectively enabling their own kind of UBI - bitcoin is fairly unique in its only having proof of work payout of new coins. Others include proof of stake, which effectively introduces interest on coins in circulation distributed based on currency held in wallets at the time, which if organized by a state apparatus could just give everyone a stake in the market based on uniqueness rather than currency held, while still requiring node activity (to stop the dead from accumulating coins).

The market cap of bitcoin is only 11 billion. That is a lot for an unofficial online money, but nothing for almost any government. Anyone trying to introduce a uniqueness mechanism that works on a scale of a society (or globally) would be involved in an organization with the means to write their own currency from scratch rather than trying to use bitcoins market share, because that market share is nothing next to fiat currency markets today, and they write it in a much better way to meet their own goals (besides account uniqueness, bitcoin itself is *awful* for use as a day currency because its supply is designed to deflate, whereas any real world currency would need normalized inflation around 1% to keep the market in high velocity while stable).",2016-10-30 01:25:14

It's online playing in real time so you can't use paper money right? So instead everyone uses the same excel spreadsheet to record the money movements, and each move adds one cell to the spreadsheet. Each move just shows how much money was deducted or added to each individual account. Account balances can go to zero, but not by erasing old entries, but by adding new deductions. This way everybody in the world can see the history of the game to double check anything. Using a super long spreadsheet is cumbersome but also fundamentally simple and easier to prevent cheating.

The spreadsheet is the blockchain.

The miners are the ones who keep the spreadsheet up on the internet (it costs money to keep their server recording all those thousands of moves) and they get $200 every time someone passes 'Go' (this inflates the current monetary supply as well).

d9eq5dd,vbuterin,78,"I personally would not be satisfied with the Ethereum Foundation becoming a true formal governance body for the Ethereum protocol; I think that public blockchains are unique beasts, and something less institutionalized is best.

I agree that the bitcoin model (which I define as bicameral governance: one chamber is Bitcoin Core, the other is Chinese miners) doesn't really work well. On the ethereum side, what we have is multiple clients that need to come to consensus, and so development power is reasonably spread out, and the mechanism that guides protocol changes is hard forks, and if users find a hard fork disagreeable they are free to not adopt it; this creates incentives for the development teams to (i) come to consensus, and (ii) promote changes that users will find agreeable. If there are true controversies, then second-layer consensus aids like carbonvote can be instituted ad-hoc to help create schelling points.

IMO this is actually a totally legitimate ""governance model"" and I would say it's pretty good, but it can certainly be improved on the margins. I think the most important practical thing that can/should be done is encouraging more public participation in EIP discussions; this perhaps may require more education as to the technical considerations that are being made so that more people feel comfortable participating, but I would like community feedback on this matter.

In Ethereum Classic land the thinking [seems to be](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVM3iN1ClVrDjZ4AcJRAQyn24B1NN6Y5_X5IpLrT9Ss/edit) that ""investors, miners and developers [are] the three groups that will have differing objectives that need to be reconciled"", which strikes me as very wrong - users are the group that is paramount, and miners and devs are there to serve the users.

d9f30pz,stcalvert,42,"This post proposes that if BU gains 75% hash power, that will be more than enough to fork safely. 

Why? Because of the sudden and severe loss of hash power, the original chain will have to wait potentially weeks or months for difficulty to retarget down to a level that can be handled by the remaining hash power.

There are two major problems with this.

1) It is highly unlikely that BU will ever gain 75% or more of the existing hashpower.

2) Even if BU manages to sway that much hashpower, it certainly does NOT mean the end of the original chain, because obviously its supporters (including me) will support a defensive hard fork to a different work function, making the difficulty problem moot.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211

""Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ""high-powered money"" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.""

Bitcoin Unlimited now (EB1/AD6 as described by Viabtc), and a hard fork Segwit that is built on top of Bitcoin Unlimited instead of on top of Bitcoin Core. This hard fork Segwit would have 0 % discount for signature data, not the Blockstream proposed 75 % discount.

**Reasoning**:

I don't want the current soft fork Segwit with 75 % signature discount. The purpose of Segwit should be to fix transaction malleability and the quadratic sigops bug. Flexible Transactions can do that just as well and it's worth waiting 2 years to activate Flexible Transactions instead of activating the current Segwit proposal as suggested by Blockstream. 

The main priority right now is to leave Bitcoin Core and activate Bitcoin Unlimited in the way as proposed by Viabtc. It would also be ok to activate Bitcoin Unlimited with the synthetic fork if that is what is preferred by the miners. ",2016-10-31 05:32:38

Private cash didn't exist online before bitcoin... So anything at all you want to buy over the interwebz and don't want others knowing about it (which could be anything, but usually winds up being porn, gambling, anime, or VPN/Torrent related) is a great reason.

Then there are things that can't be done at all with fiat money in your own country, such as how americans can't gamble online or donate to wikileaks. In each country it's different; Any time you speak up against your government it's a good idea to not show them your visa card number.

Then there are things that aren't technically do-able with fiat currency, like sub-penny payments and machine-to-machine payments on the Internet of Things. Nerd stuff, but the market is growing.

Then there are markets of legal things like the app OpenBazaar that only accept bitcoin.

But I'd suspect the major reason that the Swiss will use this is the same reason we'd all use it; It's just damn convenient, and if you need or simply want bitcoin for any reason under the sun, it's far better to stick a few francs in a machine than it is to use a debit card online, where there's always the risk of your card number being swiped by virus, malware, or evil webmasters.

d9ejke7,papabitcoin,15,"The concluding paragraph of the paper shown below this para...core's grip on power is a blight on this project.  They resist all efforts, and in fact are derisive of anyone who puts forward business or other non-technical arguments about the best direction for bitcoin. 

&gt; Given the experimental nature and current lack of maturity of the technology, it is difficult to predict, at this specific point in time, what would be the best strategy to ensure that the Bitcoin project evolves in accordance with the interests of all relevant stakeholders. Yet, regardless of the approach taken, it is our belief that a proper governance structure for Bitcoin can only be achieved by publicly acknowledging its political dimensions, and replacing the current technocratic power structure of the Bitcoin project with an institutional framework capable of understanding (and accommodating) the politics inherent in each of its technical features.

another extract..

&gt; it is only one individual in Bitcoin who ultimately makes such decision, the maintainer, currently Wladimir van der Laan, described as “a programmer from the Netherlands” without any detail regarding his previous work experience or any indication as to why he is in any way qualified to hold such position. **In any event, his statement on May the 6th 2015 that he was “weakly against a block size increase in the near future,” may have well determined the outcome of the debate.**

? oh really - what a shock /s!

&gt; In sum, it can be stressed that, at all three levels (defining borders, acknowledging status, and managing conflicts), the governance of the Bitcoin project relies almost exclusively on its leaders, lending credit to the view that peer production can often lead to the formation of oligarchic organisational forms (Shaw &amp; Hill, 2014). More specifically, in classic weberian terms – and as can often be observed in online communities – **Bitcoin governance consists in a form of domination based on charismatic authority (O'Neil, 2014), largely founded on presumed technical expertise.** The recent crisis experienced by the Bitcoin community revealed the limits of consensus formation between individuals driven by sometimes diverging political and commercial interests, and underlined **the discrepancies between the overall goals** of the project **(a self-regulating decentralised virtual currency and payment system)** and the **excessively centralised and technocratic elites who are in charge of the project**.

Core had the chance to do something (anything!) about the power structures - but they have chosen not to seek to improve it, but rather maintain and exploit it.  Deriding anyone who doesn't agree with them and focusing solely on technical arguments at the expense of other dimensions.

[Chart](http://imgur.com/eGkB0yT)

1. $660 is a 50% retrace from this little rally ($612 - $715)

2. The most recent resistance line was there, which was broken, and i expect it to act as support now.

3. 6-hr Ichi cloud is also there.


And if that retrace never happens - so what? I'm 100% bitcoin anyway, just not margin long. So i'll open another long when consolidation closes around Christmas.

Now i don't think these seemingly unrelated TA comments above are coincidental - price discovery patterns are all related. I don't set my BTC target price with TA, because i believe that's what fundamental analysis is for. But i do believe price will be substantially higher in the next few months (between $3.4k and $9k), and i want to go margin long on that. However, If i opened a margin long now, I would just be throwing away my money borrowing leverage while it doesn't do anything.

And that's why i think TA has value (particularly PnF) - it visualizes the price discovery process, which allows you to make intelligent, activist trading decisions. ",2016-10-31 00:45:15
d9ebe9w,Oznog99,13,"I did research on this awhile back, and concluded cash-accepting Bitcoin ATMs are a TERRIBLE idea.

There's been dozens of different ways to ""cheat"" a bill acceptor.  Casinos are the main victims, but also aggressive at countering it.  It's not worth the cheating to steal sodas.  But at a casino you can buy hundreds of dollars in chips and then sell them back for cash.  They have a LOT of security and you have to hang around to play with the chips and sell them back.  So, it's still high-risk.

See, there are new bank ATMs that DO scan in banknote deposits directly, rather than envelopes.  But you've got an account with them so defrauding the ATM is such a high-risk plan that it's nonviable.

But now look what Bitcoins are.  The machine's not likely attended, there's no profit margin for hiring 24/7 security, if you did that you'd just hire a bank teller and forget the ATM.

Because when someone cheats the machine, they get Bitcoins, which CANNOT be ""taken back"".  They're gone.  Maybe you can get this person arrested sometimes, but that does nothing to make the business model profitable.  You won't likely get the Bitcoins back, if you do, it's at a huge expense to get them back through the legal system.

After being asked ""what can we do to make a truly secure bill reader"", answer seems to be, ""you can't"".  You could drop the bill reader or require an account with the company, but that seems to largely defeat the point of having an ATM.  If there's any legal point to begin with.

*(edit: Jesus, this is really only pertinent to the comment I'm responding to, not OP. I conveniently ignored the ""is this much Apple hate usual"" component because I vehemently hate both Apple and MS. Because of that, I only addressed whether or not they can weather the hate (they can), not the level of hate (confirmation bias here), and spent a lot of time talking about Apple vs. Microsoft vs. consumers)*

I was going to respond with something similar. I've been having a ton of conversations about this with coworkers. I don't have articles or blogs to back this up, but we have noticed a very interesting switch between the two companies.

Microsoft, paragon of `we made it so deal`, has open-sourced several projects (e.g. [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/)). They finally acknowledged proprietary annoyances and added a Bash shell to Windows 10. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has received a ton of positive feedback, following in the wake of community editions of standard Visual Studio that surprised everyone. 

(I really hate Windows and how pervasive proprietary Office formats have become, so I don't have many positive things to say here. My coworkers usually provide those points. The only saving grace I see is finally adding that Bash shell. Except Microsoft is charging you for the privilege of emulating freely available, open-source software with almost zero common features, like [properly displaying fonts](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto/issues/217): to duplicate, install [`zsh`](http://www.zsh.org/) and try to install [`prezto`](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).)

Apple, paragon of `our shit is cooler than yours`, tried to play off the success of abandoning floppy drives in the late nineties by introducing a ridiculous new amount of proprietary hardware. While  the majority of other phone manufacturers rallied around a common, universal standard, Apple introduced Lightning. Apple abandoned headphone jacks in a similar manner, with the assumption that its users relish the thought of charging both headphones and music player.

(Didn't realize you could buy Lightning headphones; I feel like a price argument is too cheesy but Apple made it for me: you have to buy lots of proprietary hardware to do normal things with standard Apple hardware, on top of paying technicians with expensive official certification to repair it. At this point, it's pretty cliché. Everyone knows Apple charges you too much for hardware and accessories, and everyone still buys it because form plays a large role in expensive purchases.)

I feel like this switch is due in no small part to Apple's ""I'm a Mac"" ad campaigns, where they worked hard and long to distinguish how their hardware, via the lens of their software, was not personal computer hardware but rather Apple hardware. I think Microsoft learned a great deal from those campaigns, including the need to listen to consumers and pay attention to market demand. While Apple was working very, very hard to isolate and stratify its brand, Microsoft worked very hard to open its brand. Apple changed the game by introducting the mac façade, which I think Microsoft grokked: by naming your hardware and drenching it with proprietary controls, you can convince consumers the boards you produce, identical to your competitors, are better.

More recently, as far as I know, only one of the two companies has a tablet with full Adobe CC support. Five years ago, no one would have guessed that Microsoft would fill that role. Microsoft's also been very careful to stay away from the desktop market, unlike Apple, which moves questions like, ""Do I need a headphone jack or Micro-USB port on this?"" to the consumer, which means consumers can only blame themselves for poor hardware decisions. If we ever see an era of homebrew tablet hardware, that might change, because both companies make really dumb decisions and charge people too much. Apple continues to think it should be the only one making Apple computers, so it is solely responsible for its bad decisions.

To counter that counter, though, Apple did a great job standing up to the US government over cybersecurity concerns. Microsoft's track record there is terrible. As recently as [Windows 2000](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962022.aspx) (I can't believe they're still hosting that), Microsoft has deliberately reduced Windows security to give the NSA (or anyone with a bitcoin farm these days) access to anything they sell. (Some of that's loosely sourced from [Steven Levy's *Crypto*](http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php/books/crypto). I wasn't able to find online sources verifying his original account of Windows security flaws in the 90s).

None of that really answers OP, though. Should Apple be concerned financially? Sure, any computer company ever should. Consumers are  fickle and weird. I believe we're in the middle of consumer mindset transition, where the average person realizes proprietary is expensive and overhyped. I think Apple will bleed for a year or two until its investors shake the residual ""mac is different/better than pc"" out of management, and then Apple will start open-sourcing cooler shit than Microsoft, like some of its accessory hardware. In return, consumers will start believing proprietary is expensive but provides better features, and abandon the generics Apple and Microsoft have fostered. Microsoft will then begin to ignore consumers and make its OS completely proprietary, ignoring the market and doing whatever it wants. Apple will respond by redesigning and simplifying hardware built for Microsoft but not by Microsoft, then release an award-winning campaign emphasizing how its hardware, via the lens of its software, is better than Microsoft. Fast forward a few years, and Microsoft will learn its lesson, Apple will get cocky again, and someone else will be confused because Apple is suddenly the focus of internet attacks (or whatever crazy tech we have by then). Unless, of course, someone does something stupid like [providing backdoors for curious governments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/yahoo-helps-the-government-read-your-emails-just-following-orders-they-say/2016/10/05/05648894-8b01-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html) or [ignores software (or hardware) for hardware (or software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems#Acquisition_by_Oracle) (
