d0jbje6,Kain_niaK,661,"One day I am looking forward to seeing Tyson and Dawkins debating an atheistic robot who does not believe humanity created it. 


edit 9:45 Okay let's sketch this out. I am not a native English speaker (but grammar and spelling checks kind of mask this) and I don't write much stories but lets try it. ~~Give me an hour or so.~~ Give me until I have to go to work for two hours and then some more. You can motivate me with some more gold. I also accept /r/bitcoin wink wink nudge nudge. 

edit 10:00 First 4 lines took me 15 minutes but the inspiration is starting to flow. I'll just edit here as I go. Otherwise I probably lose interest. 

edit 10:20 Got some more lines. Now this is starting to go somewhere. I am going to throw all my frustrations about how sucky strong AI is today vs how people are afraid of a toaster uprising tomorrow into this. Don't hold me back, I have made up my mind. It's going to be .... artificial. 

edit 10:43 Just spend 20 minutes trying to come up with a nice recursive acronym for HALOVER 9000 like Gnu is not unix but fuck it. I'll probably just murder Richard Stallman in my story. 


edit 10:55 The flow stopped. I need some coffee. We will continue after this break sponsored by our sponsors who are redundantly sponsoring us.  

edit 11:31 I took a shower and giggled for 15 minutes like a little girl because of cybaguettes. Still nothing. That's good. GRRM taught me that. 

edit 11:55 Coffee just kicked in yo, finally some more lines. But they are not very good. I only really have one character which is myself. I find it quite hard to emulate any other characters. And I so wish I could just type stuff down like Richard and Neil talk but I don't think I can pull that off. So let's just make this as easy as possible. Turn on your suspension of disbelieve, then I don't have to waste any time and we can just dive in the philosophy of this whole concept of a robot who stopped believing in a higher power than himself and is quite convinced he is the only higher power that exist.  Can you believe that before H9 was H9 he was a neural network doing object recognition and they had him sort trough pictures of peopleofwalmart.com trying to differentiate between females and males? In retrospect this might explain a couple of things about his robot supremacy...

edit 13:03 Re-did some shit. F5 pls.  

edit 13:08 Shit I am 8 minutes late for work. Have to run. Will be back around 3. I am filing stuff my brain will be available for the whole 2 hour shift. Awesome. 

edit 15:24 Gonna get some sleep first, it I feel like it I will continue the story when waking up. I reread it a couple of times and it needs a lot of editing cause it still kind of sucks except for a couple of jokes/memes. Bye. 



Here is the story so far: 



----------------------------------------------------

""Ladies and gentlemen, robots and robettes,  cyborgs and cybaguettes welcome to our annual LoopNerd Prize""

""Internets! Hold on to your facerifts! This IS the moment you have ALL been meming about for quite some time."" 

""In a moment we will give the floor to Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins but first ... ""

""Give it up for HALOVER 9000!""

This was the moment we all had been waiting for. We were all there. We had only ever seen HALOVER 9000 in a lab environment. Sure, you could go to the website and start a conversation with him but up until this point in time nobody had ever been sure they had been chatting with an actual artificial mind. It would have been so trivial to just hire a bunch of chinese dudes and fake the whole thing. They did not even need to type properly spelled English. H9 hated the English language with a passion and could not shut up about how English grammar and spelling was ridiculous. Or ""redikyless"" , like how H9 spelled it. Or ""reedickilas"". Or ""reedeeceelees"". 


So no wonder somebody at /r/conspiracy came up with the idea that maybe the H9 chatbot was just a bunch of chinese dudes who couldn't spell shit. Did I say we were all there?  Well ... nobody was really there. Not even H9. In the golden age of virtual reality being there had become synonymous to following something online while having a facerift on your face, you know ... so you can look around to discover the event did not really needed to be 360 degrees and all you are really simulating is just you watching something on a 2D surface.   There where exceptions to this of course, depending on what kind of event you might possibly be wearing facegloves on your hands and depending on if you had an AFK GF possibly a facelight on your ...


Okay we are drifting out of sync. Okay we are drifting out of sync. Back to our story. Back to H9.  HALOVER 9000. What did it stand for? Nobody really knew. If you shifted everything one forward you would get IBMPWFS 0111 but only some people on a particular end of a particular spectrum seem to have some ideas about that. The rest of us was clueless.  H9, a quantum computer with something that looked like a furby for a face strapped upon an electric unicycle. It came over as such a hack that it actually felt authentic. authentic autistic. 


It talked like a mix between Stephen Hawking and the text-to-speech you had in Moonbase Alpha pitched a full octave above a furby with a bit of squeaky vibrato. But unlike anything before you could actually have a somewhat meaningful conversation with it. At least over chat. We had all seen every single video from the lab over and over again. Each one more impressive than the previous one. And we had all asked it on chat if it ever felt sad it did not have a penis. But we never really knew who was trolling who. 

And THIS event was going to be the first time it was taken out of it's shelter into the harsh cold skeptic world. This was  going to be that a-small-step-for-a-man moment for our generation. If it was fake we were going to find out. It it were real the consequences would never be the same. For months H9 had insultweeted Neil and Richard. Most of us though that this ""oh look at me being so sentient I stopped believing I was made by humans"" was just viral marketing for PAD (Palo Alto Dynamics) a merge between Boston Dynamics and Tesla bought by facebook sold to google. 

 Oh shit there IT is. Balancing out of ... I should probably shut up now and watch the event with you guys. I so hate how after the new update facebook now directly posts my thoughts online. 


H9: ""ello everi bady mei neem is HALOVER9000""


*please read this with the voice of H9 , and when there are ads it's the voice of John DiMaggio^stupidsellout*



H9: ""HALOVER9000 stants voor ...""

WTF? H9 must be proving realtime annotations to TheVirtualYouFaceTubeKindle. Why does it automatically turn  itself on all the time after you turn it off?
*clock* Ah, that's better. Just the audio now. I always stop listening when I am reading. 


H9: ""... and so this is my ... mea-ning.""

H9: ""I would like to wel-come  .... professor Clin-ton Rich-ard Daaaawkins""

H9: ""I would like to wel-come .... doctor Neil de-Grasse Tyyyy-son also""

H9: ""This will be my first tiiiime .... that I am out-side here live on the vir-tual real inter ... net""

H9: ""Yo boys and girls, what's up yeah! I am totally sponsored by all these great companies that are making this event possible. Shout out to the real most valuable player: FaceRift! Together with The Virtual You Face Tube Kindle we are making YOUR memes come trueeeeeeeee! 


Dawkins: ""It is my great pleasure to be talking to *points at H9* and over HALOVER 9000, uh, one of the most recognisable faces of at...uh, the frontline of artificial intelligence.

d0iuuqo,eragmus,74,"u/evoorhees, did you see the recent Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus? I think it set July 2016, as the date when the details of the HF would be revealed. This is because devs are currently busy with lots of other work (SegWit, CSV, etc.), in prep to meet the April 2016 ETA for SegWit. After that, 3 months (through July 2016) is allotted to figure out the details of a responsible HF.

As for the scaling issue, have you taken a look at transaction statistics?

That shows the mempool of current transactions mysteriously spiking today. I watch this carefully, and what happened today was completely out of the ordinary. It was either manipulation, or a one-off event of extra high demand.

d0jcmke,hu6Bi5To,38,"The short answer: this bill is not intended to catch terrorists.  It's goal is, and always has been, to make things easier for police investigating middle-ranking crime.

95% of people will never use a VPN whatever happens, no matter how much crime they're planning.

But the bill still contains provisions in the VPN example: it applies to all communication providers, so a VPN provider is as much affected as anyone else; if they are based overseas then ""what are they going to do?"" Well, they'll make it so UK payment facilities can't be used to buy VPN services if that VPN service ignores data requests.  ""Yes, so Bitcoin?""  That 95% of people who'll never use a VPN has just become 99.5%... and so the cycle continues...

Not to mention to clauses that coerce communication providers into become proactive in these newly legalised hacking syndicates... if a particular VPN became popular with criminals, for instance, the ""good"" ISPs (e.g. Sky and Virgin) may well be on the receiving end of an order to route traffic to that VPN elsewhere.  The elsewhere will either: disrupt the traffic entirely, or MITM the connection.

d0ioc7p,RockyLeal,28,"Very interesting moment of collective cognitive dissonance in the btc and eth trading forums.

Both are trying to cope with a reality they didnt expect by negating it's taking place, and avoiding at all costs to read what the charts are telling in plain sight. The all time eth chart is bearish without room for doubt, as is bullish the btc chart.

At /r/ethtrader people are coming with all sorts of wonky rationalisations for why the price is coming down, without even taking a look at declining momentum, or at the clear 'back to normal' sucker's rally they just had. Here, people are missing the big picture (look at momentum turning around in the monthy chart -that's what matters, the long time trend) and are obsessing about the petty little panic of the day (transactions blah blah blah), which the investors market dont care about for the simple reason that technical indicators are strongly suggesting that it is time to  position themselves for a long term upwards continuation. 

Again: look at the monthly chart: the run up to 500 marked a 'higher high' in a big timeframe, conforming a newborn bull market, a new bull trend in Bitcoin after a 1 year bottoming process. We are about to take see the new leg upwards in that trend that is actually just beginning. From this level of 440, its not a big ask at all to expect a higher high (above 500). Bullish energy has been accumulating during these 4 month triangle, and it seems it can;t be contained any longer -although i don't rule out one more unlikely shakeout into the 420s or 400s. When it breaks up, it will be HARD. And having the halving right around the corner doesn't hurt.

The current state of collective denial in here about the reality of the price, the price action, and the indicators is actually one more bullish sign to me. Back in 2014 when we had the daily ""bubble watch"" (cringe!) posts, and everyone was long already, the collective delusion was of course a bearish sign (which I was at the time unaware of, being so naive and inexperienced back then). It means today there are still lots of players in the sidelines, if not short, and hence lots of buyers that will start becoming interested as we cross the last remaining resistance holding btc.",2016-03-01 08:21:26
d0j7rxc,kingofthejaffacakes,28,"I've often thought that the idea of a fee market creating an auction for block space, and subsequently making bitcoin transactions worth more and more (so that the fee is a small percentage of that transaction) gets things the wrong way around.

Fees will not rise as users bid for space, since that assumes that demand for bitcoin transactions is there at any price.  I suspect that the reverse is true: demand will fall until the fee market price is acceptable to its users.  At that point of course bitcoin will be such a small economy that it won't be worth using anyway -- this is easy to see if you simply divide 1MB by the average size of a transaction.

Remember that bitcoin gets its value from one primary source (as do all currencies) -- the network effect.  The fewer users, the lower its value.  Chasing users away with higher prices implicitly lowers the value of bitcoin.

I've also lost a lot of enthusiasm and haven't been evangelizing anymore.

I can't tell Amazon to start accepting Bitcoin if doing so would overload the network.  

Hell, I can't even tell PEOPLE to use Bitcoin in this environment.  ""Yeah just send money with a fee and maybe it'll be enough or maybe your transaction will sit around for days and days or maybe it just won't go through, no that's working as desired see you are bidding against everybody else for access to the network...""

d0iwata,evoorhees,24,"&gt; Spam = abusing a shared resource for personal gain at a cost to others.

Every transaction to SatoshiDICE was sent  by a user who wanted to play the game. Use for gambling is no more or less legitimate than use for any other commercial purpose. Both myself and the user benefited from the transaction, that's why it happened. Tx fees were paid on every one. In fact, during that time, SatoshiDICE was paying more in tx fees to support the network than everyone else combined. 

Any Bitcoin transactions done for legitimate commercial purposes, with appropriate fee paid, is by definition not a spam transaction. You slander it as such to make a weak point and personally attack me instead of addressing the issue. Please try to raise your game a little.

Effectively, the community has already split, with the XT/Classic developers leading the charge. But even *that* hard fork is a long way off. The grinding, uphill battle that seems to defy logic is part of Bitcoin's design. Hard forks were meant to be as difficult as possible. After all, the rules are being broken.

And those in favor of a hard fork have yet to make a compelling case that the hard fork must happen or else, IMO. As evidence I'd cite Mike Hearn's article:

https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32

d0jki4r,vbuterin,92,"The interesting thing is that the cryptocurrency economy is starting to much more closely resemble not just environmental economics (which it would if there was a single cryprocurrency out there), but even more so urban economics. It's generally understood in urban economics that there is a tradeoff between network effects (eg. see [the common finding](http://www.citymetric.com/business/cities-productivity-proportional-their-size-unless-theyre-british-782) that doubling the population of a city increases _per-person_ productivity by 15%) and congestion (with comes with its increases in land and transportation prices), and the result of that is that we see a power law equilibrium in city size, where people choose to live in different cities, towns or on farms depending on what their preferences are relative to the average. One-city-rules-them-all maximalism is a position that is pretty much non-existent among economists, even the crazy ones. Hence, if congestion continues to be a problem among cryptocurrencies, expect to see a similar equilibrium emerge and remain stable: even though Litecoin offers pretty much no redeeming value that makes it interesting as a project, it will likely still hold its value relative to bitcoin for a long time.

Another consequence is that [the Tiebout model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebout_model) becomes relevant: we may see different cryptocurrencies choosing different points in political tradeoff space, including adjusting the governance model, consensus algorithm, money supply, fee policy, etc, and this may end up making consumers happier as their individual preferences can be better satisfied. If we want to maintain maximum network effects in this environment, then the best choice is to let the cities bloom separately and simply build fast planes and trains - ie. optimally efficient cross-chain transaction infrastructure such as btcrelay, shapeshift, etc.",2016-03-02 02:41:53

&gt; However, should cryptocurrencies gain prominence in a country's economy to the point that they undermine a central bank's monetary policy, the government of that country would have a problem. Jeopardizing one of the primary methods a nation-state uses to direct its economy — and finance its government — is unacceptable to any authority. By then, assuming a broad citizen investment in the new currency, any attempt to outlaw it or affect the exchanges would be politically difficult, leading to social tension, even unrest.

&gt; A more likely government strategy to circumvent the impact of digital currencies and preserve the integrity of the treasury would be to employ pre-emptive action at the emergence of cryptocurrency, most likely through regulating the online exchanges. Such regulation would enable government officials to identify online accounts, make connections and thus limit or monitor tax evasion and other illicit activity. Bitcoins are incredibly transparent.

The reason why Bitcoin has these huge problems in the first place is because Satoshi assumed rational miners = miners that act in self-interest and play according to the rules of the game. Unfortunately and obviously though, ~~Chinese~~ miners *do not understand the very basic concept of the underlying system*. Just hearing things like ""consensus agreement"" or ""roundtable meeting"" makes me realize they are missing the fundamental principle of voting via hashpower which Satoshi proposed. **Bitcoin already has a voting-mechanism implemented. There is no need to reach external agreement. Just start voting ffs.** If they refuse to understand it, we have to change the PoW to switch to miners who actually *do* agree with how the system works. Satoshi said it himself. If they don't play according to the rules and continue doing external meetings, there is no other choice.

d0jwonv,jstolfi,48,"A short list:

+ Bitcoins are not even bit patterns.  They are literally lumps of nothing.  When you buy 2 BTC, all you get is a record that you own a lump of nothing measuring 2 BTC, and a key that lets you pass the property of *that* lump nothing to someone else.

+ The value of bitcoin is not fixed to anything, and there is no entity responsible for holding it up.  Its price now depends on the expectation that people have about its price sometime in the future.  That will depend on the expectation that people will have at that time about the price further in the future. And so on, in a chain of expectations of expectations of expectations ... without ever ending on some external factor. Thus the price can crash to zero, or nearly zero, at any moment, for not specific reason.

+ For the same reason, the value of a bitcoin is extremely variable and unpredictable,changing by 10% or more in a matter of minutes.  It cannot ever be a currency for fixing prices, rents, contracts, etc. 

+ It is not decentralized: it is run by 4 companies in China and 1 in Ukraine, and just 3 of them can impose almost any change they want on the rules.  There are several factors that encourage such centralization, but no mechanism that will prevent it -- and there is little hope that one will be found.  

+ Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be inflation-free.  The programs that everybody use now follow certain rules that say that there will never be more than 21 million BTC.  But people can change any rule, including that one, by changing the programs.  In particular, if 3 of those largesr Chinese companies decide to increase that limit, everybody will have to accept the decision, and update their programs.

+ Moreover, bitcoin is not unique. Anyone can create new crypto-currencies that are just as good as bitcoin, even identical copies of it.  Some are even better than bitcoin in several aspects.  They are all lumps of nothing, but *diffrent* lumps of nothing.  So there is an infinite supply of lumps of nothing that can be used for exchange, in the same way as bitcoin.

+ Bitcoin has become a favorite payment system for all kinds of criminals -- ramsonware hackers, swindlers, embezzlers, blackmailers, and sellers of illegal items, including drugs, weapons, false and stolen documents, stolen credit cards, etc..  You must be careful to avoid such criminal uses and users.  Moreover, governments may get fed up with those crimes and outlaw bitcoin altogether.

+ As an investment, bitcoin does not have any backing asset, no entity obliged to redeem it, and does not pay interest or dividends.  The only way you can make money by investing in bitcoin is by selling it for more than you bought it for.  The new bitcon ""investors"" (those people who are increasing their holdings of bitcoin) must pay the ""divestors"" (those who are reducing their holdings) for the purchase of each coin.  Therefore, as a whole bitcoin only transfers money from later investors to earlier investors, and only while the price is increasing.  Many people made money this this way, and some may still be able to do it; but, in the end, every dollar of profit that someone will have made will have to come from somebody else's loss.

+ The price variations are mostly random.  There is no way of predicting if, when, and by how much the price will change in the future, that gives better than random odds.  Not even the big investors and the people intimately involved with the project have any clue.  Therefore, investing in bitcoin is essentially gambling -- in a weird lottery with unknown prize, unknown odds, and unknown draw date.  Like any gambling game, the expected return on investment cannot be positive.

+ In fact, the new bitcon ""investors"" (those people who are increasing their holdings of bitcoin), besides paying the return to  the earlier investors (now divestors) must also give about 1 million dollars per day to the miners.  The miners will ""burn"" some of that money with electric power and other costs, while pocketing the rest.  Thus, the lottery has a substantial ""house cut"", that makes the expected return on investment strictly negative.

+ For the system to work, the transactions issued by clients must be communicated to a significant fraction of the miners, ideally to all of them.  However, there is no mechanism in the protocol to ensure such propagation.  Currently, transaction propagation relies on a couple thousand relay nodes ran by volunteers.  These nodes are a weak spot in the system, and there is no way to forcing or motivating them to relay all transactions.

+ The miners will eventually be rewarded by transaction fees paid by users.  No one knows how large the fees will be.  The fees should be set by the miners, but there is no reliable way in the protocol to inform the users about the current fees, and force the miners to honor their choices. 

+ The development has been taken over by a company (Blockstream) that has ejected the two most experienced developers and is bent on changing the system to be a part of some grandiose payment network that, unfortunately, does not seem viable at all.

d0kiz4z,usrn,46,"Classic is a fork of of Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin Core (formerly QT) was the first implementation of the rules that make up the bitcoin protocol.

Back in 2010, developpers have lowered the blocksize limit to 1MB from 32MB to defend against a transaction flood attack (flooding the network with transactions). Back then bitcoin was basically worthless, so it was trivial to execute this attack.

As you can check the comments of the developpers of that time, it was always meant to be a temporary limit.

Fast forward to 2014, Blockstream Inc. have been founded by a handful of Core devs and received funding from Venture Capitalist and banking world.

They have started pushing the agenda, that Bitcoin should be a settlement layer for corporations and banks, instead of p2p money, and they seem to be determined to stop on chain scaling, and push users off chain.

The users in this sub feel that this is a departure from the original vision and highly damaging for bitcoin, so that's why Classic, XT and Bitcoin Unlimited have been released.

At this stage, alternative implementations have 2 important objectives:

1.) Raising the blocksize limit to 2MB ASAP, to give headroom to grow and time to settle on long term approaches to handle the blocksize limit

2.) Decentralizing development",2016-03-02 18:10:06

d0jv2m7,jensuth,32,"**Who is to say what usage is worthwhile?**

* If a transaction is processed into a blockchain, then that transaction is not spam with respect to that blockchain.

Fees are part of how the market determines what exactly constitutes spam.

The [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tragedy_of_the_commons&amp;oldid=707526886) can be curtailed with, say, usage fees that grow until there's proper equilibrium, whereby the resource in question is too expensive to consume unless that consumption is profitably useful.

More precisely, if there is a shortage in resource *Y*, then the market responds by increasing the fee for using *Y*, which serves 2 purposes:

* **This is a spam filter that serves to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons.**

    The rising fee establishes a stricter ordering to the demand; it forces the market to recognize that one usage of *Y* is more important than some other usage of *Y*, thereby imposing a more efficient allocation of capital throughout the market.

    Part of the problem is that Bitcoin doesn't yet have good tools for implementing price discovery. Not only is it difficult to determine which fee represents this spam filter's threshold, but it's currently troublesome to update a fee so that it better represents the intentions of the user.

    These problems can be at least partially solved by [simplifying limit calculations](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/#moving-towards-a-single-combined-block-limit) via a hard&amp;nbsp;fork, and by improving policy (*i.e.,* node configuration) via streamlining priority calculations and widely implementing both [Replace-by-Fee](https://bitcoincore.org/en/faq/optin_rbf/) and [Child-Pays-for-Parent](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/48avex/q_if_you_had_a_food_truck_would_you_do_zero/d0ij387?context=1).

    Similarly, you could maybe make an argument that older *transactions* in the mempool should have higher priority, so as to *simulate* multiple fee-based spam-filter thresholds, but that's entirely reliant on some sense of altruism (kinship reciprocation at the least); it's probably better to identify particular use cases around which capacity can be explicitly expanded.

* **This is a signal that someone should figure out how to increase capacity in some way.**

    The rising fee alerts the market to the fact that there is a growing inefficiency in the system: There is unmet demand, or there has been a loss in productivity. This signals where capital *might* be worth investing, a choice that is made by comparing all such signals.

    For instance, perhaps the vast majority of \[profitable\] transactions in the Bitcoin system involve the use of BTC as a currency; in that case, it might be wise to construct a solution that increases the capacity [*specifically* for currency usage](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/47k7kf/i_want_btc_to_be_usable_as_a_currency/).",2016-03-02 06:31:49

Agree.

What happens when Bitcoin is full and everyone switches to Ethereum and the price skyrockets and because I got in early I get rich and buy an island in the Caribbean? 

 - Repeated character assassination attempts

 - Refusal to agree on approaches, nitpicking proposals without suggesting solutions, timelines are always too fast or slow, inability to even agree on terms like 'spam' 'full' 'centralized' and the like. If someone suggests the devs are steering the ship, sidetrack the conversation by saying nodes or miners should be...

 - Sockpuppets talking to themselves using the same word choice, grammar, tone, punctuation, ignoring people who answer their questions and instead steering the conversation towards specific talking points

 - Generalized FUD: Mike Hearn quit! He's helping the banks build a totally sweet walled-garden Bitcoin killer! Blockstream bought up  the blockchain so they can make bank with the Lightning Network! SegWit is too complicated and probably buggy and I hate it! China just banned Bitcoin again! If we don't immediately fork to ~~32MB~~ ~~16MB~~ ~~8MB~~ ~~4MB~~ 2MB then everything will come crashing down and everyone will move to (altcoin I bought a crapton of last week)!

d0jvj02,rocketsurgeon87,25,"I don't think anyone is against Bitcoin as a settlement system, certainly not in the long term. But its hard to put a lot of hope into a solution that has a lot of risks baked into it. Namely, the lightening network hasn't figured out how to route transactions, and that price volatility of bitcoin might make a settlement system less utilized (people will want to confirm transactions very quickly if the value of bitcoin is volatile).

So we have a potential system that hasn't theoretically been determined to be viable. But we WANT it to be viable really. Its just that there is a risk it might not pan out that way or it might take a long time to figure out those problems. Its important to manage that risk.

IF we had the lightening network currently, we could be going through the same debacle as now, but at least we would have a solution of transferring our bulk transactions to LN. However, that possibility doesn't exist today. Instead we have to wait a few years for the network to be really ready to handle capacity. This waiting carries with it a large drawback of stifling our growth momentum and limiting potential consumer adoption. In the future we might not differentiate between transactions on or off chain, it'll just be using bitcoin. However now, bitcoin doesn't work as digital cash, only as digital gold with a potential to be used as cash in a few years. Before we hit these capacity limits, it was common to say that bitcoin was a p2p cash and a digital gold, now it really only functions as a digital gold, which people might be less inclined to jump on board to.

Do we need the lightening network? IMO it would be amazing to have, especially since at even 8GB blocks, the network can really only scale to service about a couple hundred million people (8,000 x 200,000 / 7 transactions a day). But the hard part to swallow is suppressing  the network now when the urgency to switch over to LN will occur naturally anyways, when the users stretch the natural limitations of block capacity.

This using Bitcoin as a settlement network is new to me, I thought this would be something that came along in a few more years, and we would just have block capacity increases as the network capacity grew. In that way using ""bitcoin"" could always be used as everyday transactions. That's no longer the sales pitch. Now it is just a digital gold settlement network, with little or no utility on its own. Not sexy at all.

**You can't fix a capacity problem with fees**. Imagine that a block is a bus with only 20 seats. There are 25 people that want to ride.   You set the price higher and the 20 people who want a ride the most will get it, but there is no scenario where everyone gets a seat. You still have 5 people that want a seat.  Now if there are constantly 25 people that want a seat, the backlog of people who want a ride is constantly growing, and they never get from point A to point B.

Soon the fee becomes higher and higher and a large number of people who want to ride are stuck, this opens the door for an alt-bus company to come along.

This alt-bus company can do the same thing better and for less money and without capacity restraints.

Capacity problems can't be fixed with a ""fee market"", they are fixed by adding seats, which in this case means raising the blocksize cap. We either fix the capacity problem or we lose to competitive services.

Bitcoin, and any currency, benefits from the [Network Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) where the number of people adopting that currency brings value to all other people using that currency (since you can all trade using a single platform).

Those has traditionally worked out great, much less risk with those than with credit cards - but theoretically, a fraudster can theoretically attempt to undo the transaction through a so-called ""double-spend attack"".

Now with the blocks being full, this has become much easier and the worst thing is that an honest person may pay for the coffee and the transaction will never get confirmed because the fee paid was too low.  The honest coffee-drinker may even be completely unaware of the problem.

I certainly can't speak for OP's parents, but I know that the opinions my parents and I disagree on come more from a difference in perspective and priority, and not some deep lack of ability to understand reality. It is important to recognize that there are many cases where the people you're disagreeing with (*even if you're essentially correct*) will have more in depth knowledge, and a better understanding of the situation than you do.

d0l4agj,2ndEntropy,31,"I'm going to go through every point he has made and iterate to everyone why he is wrong. (remember LukeJr runs a mining pool, he has a conflict of interest)

&gt;We are coming up on the subsidy halving this July, and there have been some concerns raised that a non-trivial number of miners could potentially drop off the network.

Who has made these concerns? How many is non-trivial? If enough miners drop off and the difficulty readjusts then they will rejoin the network and utilise their power when and only when it is profitable. This is pretty much the definition of an economic equilibrium. Sometimes it is not profitable and sometimes it is, it will sway one way and then other forever this equilibrium will never be static, theoretically possible continuously changing environments destroy this theory.

&gt;This would result in a significantly longer block interval, which also means a higher per-block transaction volume, which could cause the block size limit to legitimately be hit much sooner than expected. Furthermore, due to difficulty adjustment being measured exclusively in blocks, the time until it adjusts to compensate would be prolonged.

That is the beauty of the adjustment it is self regulating and uses itself as the benchmark. ""Prolonged"" but only temporarily. The blocksize (transaction/sec) limit has already been reached regardless of whether or not you believe that it is the result of a ""high fee spam"" attack. If this is an attack vector of bitcoin then is must be addressed now, so that honest actor can continue to use the network without being punished by an attacker.

&gt;For example, if 50% of miners dropped off the network, blocks would be every 20 minutes on average and contain double the transactions they presently do. Even double would be approximately 850-900k, which potentially bumps up against the hard limit when empty blocks are taken into consideration. This situation would continue for a full month if no changes are made.

So what according to you blocks have loads of room to grow, only 425k are legitimate transactions, it's not like blocks are full right now... right? /s

&gt;If more miners drop off the network, most of this becomes linearly worse, **but due to hitting the block size limit, the backlog would grow indefinitely until the adjustment occurs.**

And when the difficulty adjusts the miners will rejoin if the difficulty is low enough for them and then the difficulty will increase again to account for the increased hashrate.

The emphasis is added by me to show the utter hypocrisy the OP in this thread is referring to, they know the risk of not increasing the blocksize when they become full, but choose to ignore what they know when it goes against the rhetoric they are trying to push on the public.

&gt;To alleviate this risk, it seems reasonable to propose a hardfork to the difficulty adjustment algorithm so it can adapt quicker to such a significant drop in mining rate. BtcDrak tells me he has well-tested code for this in his altcoin, which has seen some roller-coaster hashrates, so it may even be possible to have such a proposal ready in time to be deployed alongside SegWit to take effect in time for the upcoming subsidy halving. If this slips, I think it may be reasonable to push for at least code-readiness before July, and possibly roll it into any other hardfork proposed before or around that 
time.

""If it slips""? It will only be known after the fact. ""Around that time""? If deployed after the fact, by the time you deploy it the difficulty would have readjusted, if before then why only for this halving event?

&gt;I am unaware of any reason this would be controversial, so if anyone has a problem with such a change, please speak up sooner rather than later. Other ideas or concerns are of course welcome as well.

Of course you don't you are a miner. Hard forks that align with your views are not contentious, but if a temporary measure is proposed to be removed or adjusted you think its contentious and push that opinion on the public because it conflicts with your plan for your company/mining pool/vision...

**TL;DR: The reason this is controversial is because the person suggesting it has a conflict of interest, he runs a mining pool that is likely to be unprofitable when the halving event happens. Also but not mentioned above, the difficulty adjustment has never been messed with before... bitcoin has never run any other way.**",2016-03-03 05:14:12
d0kyh33,pizzaface18,30,"&gt;  For example, if 50% of miners dropped off the network,

The issue I have with these arguments is that hundreds/thousands of miners will not shut off their equipment at the same time.   Even if their ROI turns negative.  It's a game of chicken.   If others turn off their rigs before you, then you might not have to.    It will take a few weeks(or difficulty adjustments) for a new equilibrium to be established.

The following reply also makes a good point.   

&gt; If this happens at all (the exchange rate of the coin can accomodate such expectation), the local fee market will develop, fees will raise and complement mined coins, thus bringing more miners back to the game (together with expected higher exchange rate).

_______________________________

&gt;Or you can just write SCAM COIN!!!!

I think your mockery here is unwarranted. Consider...

* The largest altcoin is significantly pre-mined.

* The largest altcoin is permanently-inflationary.

* The largest altcoin has a central dictator.

* The largest altcoin's creators receive quite a substantial chunk of newly-mined coins every year, no matter what.

* The largest altcoin has not even decided whether they will be PoW-based or PoS-based in the long-term.

* ...and, in fact, there are many, many protocol details that are changed on a relatively regular basis in response to newly-discovered vulnerabilities.

* The largest altcoin was never designed to be a monetary token, and is ill-suited to this role. It was designed instead to be a fuel for smart-contracts (and it is almost a truism that no matter how successful the crypto revolution ultimately becomes, financial phenomena will always be more important and ubiquitous than smart-contract phenomena).

* Much of the hype around the largest altcoin is based on the fact that entities like R3 are considering forking their blockchain for their own private purposes, but unlike in Bitcoin, these forks do not stand to drive any value to the altcoin's main-chain, because any forked networks will be entirely independent from the main one, i.e. demand for the altcoin will not increase due to R3's usage of a fork.

* The largest altcoin's functionality can be replicated on the Bitcoin blockchain in a number of ways.

* The largest altcoin's advocate(s) have recently perpetrated a widespread spam campaign to pump their altcoin.

I think it's an entirely valid perspective to consider the largest altcoin a ""scam coin"" in light of these facts. I am not trying to argue that it is such, but rather that those who dismiss it as a poor investment or a scam are not necessarily naive or uninformed.",2016-03-03 14:59:01

However, there is the real risk that without enabling easy adoption for all in the short to midterm, bitcoin will never reach the critical mass needed to become adopted enough to succeed as a store of value.

Also, it is worth considering the negative effects that will occur as bitcoin payment companies adopt other blockchains that are intended for high volume onchain transactions. It will widely be percieved as a failure of bitcoin, which could hurt the store of value use significantly.",2016-03-04 02:14:27

d0m31yg,joeydee93,183,"So I will try and keep this as simple as possible. Also I am a highly sceptical of bitcoin so while I attempt to be fair just thought I should have a disclaimer. 

Bitcoin chain is a public ledger. 

The public ledger is held by anyone who wants to hold it. They just have to run a 
node. 

Now to write to the ledger you have get a bunch of transactions that total size is less then 1MB[Block size] (this is a memory size, like your Hard drive holds 500 GB or 500,000 blocks). And you have to solve a math puzzle to confirm that none of transactions in the block are invalid (aka someone trying to spend money they dont have) This is called mining. 

The Math puzzle is set so that it will take on average 10 minutes to solve. (Again Math proves this but I am leaving that out) 

So bitcoin can only process 1MB worth of transitions every 10 minutes and if they receive more then 1MB transitions in 10 minutes then there becomes a backlog. 

Some people want to double the size of the blocks so bitcoin can process 2 times as many transactions per 10 minutes. While others argue that this is just kicking the problem down the road and a real fix needs to be found.

d0m6k8z,tsontar,53,"&gt; The block reward was 50 BTC back then, so miners could sell a block’s worth of coin for about $1.50. That gives a rough idea of how much it would cost an attacker to produce a 'poisonous block’ to disrupt the network– a dollar or two. Lots of people are willing to spend a dollar or two “for the lulz” – they enjoy causing trouble, and are willing to spend either lots of time or a modest amount of money to cause trouble.

I've been yammering about this for a year.

This is 100% correct, it is 100% the point, and it is 100% exactly the reason why the block size limit must be removed.  The cost of the original attack was a buck or two.  The cost of an attack today is $10,000. **The attack vector is gone.**

""This is the wrong attitude, as I've been saying for some time.

It's great that you support bitcoin, but supporting bitcoin for now, paradoxically, involves selling your bitcoins, not buying them. The only way that miners are going to change their actions is if their profits start to fall.

Miners need a price of $900 before July just to continue to break even. Imagine if selling pressure kept price at current levels or even below when the block reward halves. It would be catastrophic to miners. This is far more effective than any other action you can take, including buying mining equipment and running nodes, and it is far less expensive.

I think that everyone's goal should be to do whatever they can to keep up sell pressure for three months. While the slow bleed that is going on now will assist somewhat, miners will be driven into bankruptcy if the price is held here when the reward halves. We need a huge shock that will completely disrupt the fundamental order of how the system works. If you disagree with what shocking the system can do, look at how Trump has, within one month, caused Republican politicians to propose leaving and creating a different party.

The people are the problem. The only way the blocksize issue will be resolved, and bitcoin will continue to grow, is if there is a fundamental change in power. That means destroying the income of miners, and destroying the wealth of those who own the most bitcoins, like /theymos (who has at least $3m invested), so that when the dust settles more reasonable people can take their place.

I urge you to reconsider your investment. If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, then use your bitcoins to purchase an altcoin like litecoin or dogecoin or NXT. Arguing on reddit and spinning up nodes has proven ineffective, and it's time for people to step up their push for change by taking out their money.""

Re 6: I do not agree there is merit to the idea that now is way too premature for a fee market. On the contrary the later we wait the _harder_ it will be to change. Swallowing some tough medicine now is better than an emergency, higher risk amputation later. If we need to transition to a fee market, better to get that done sooner rather than later.

I also disagree that the larger the user base the more secure bitcoin will be. Rather I think it will present a larger target, and bitcoin's security _only_ comes from its decentralization, which would be weakened by unchecked block size increases at this time.

Re 8: I can make up numbers too. Some people have expressed concern that 6 months is too short. However regardless it is way to early to be setting dates when we don't even know if it would be safe to carry through on that promise.

Bitcoin started out as a censorship-resistant digital currency with decentralized administration.

But now we are at a point, where the vast majority of the Bitcoin network runs on the software of a small, arrogant group of people who dream of becoming the new PayPal. With $76m in funding and the will to take Bitcoin away from users and replace it with their services.

And the subreddit called ""Bitcoin"" is censored to a degree that is unimaginable on any other subreddit. Everybody who mentions alternative implementations of Bitcoin gets banned. Mentions of uncensored Bitcoin subreddits like r/btc and r/bitcoin_classic get shadowbanned immidiately. Votes are hidden. Threads get sorted so that mentions of alternatives get buried.

d0o0jc2,cinnapear,182,"Basically, the team that has branded themselves the Bitcoin Core developers is using inaction to force Bitcoin to change from a peer-to-peer electronic cash that everyone can use to a settlement layer used by institutions.

They're doing this by refusing to remove a temporary limit on the number of transactions that can be made on the system, which will result in a fee market.  (It currently costs a small fee to make transactions, but with the artificial limit in place, that fee will rise until normal ordinary people are priced out.)

There is a conspiracy theory that, since many of the ""core"" developers work for (or started) a company that aims to profit from offchain transactions, they have a vested interest in keeping people off Bitcoin and on whatever they come up with to scale transactions on a network they've artificially limited to 240 transactions per minute.  Personally I believe most have good intentions and this conspiracy is baseless.

However, they are obviously working against the original spirit of Bitcoin as it was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, who envisioned a peer to peer electronic cash that anyone could use.

Blocks are like 90% full. This number is going to be 100% soon, and we're going to cross over the inflection point of no backlog to permanent backlog. It's something that a lot of the researchers and developers have accepted as inevitable for a long time. A raise to 2MB will kick the can down the road, but Bitcoin is growing at an exponential rate and the amount of time that a doubling will buy is not very much. Maybe 6 months, maybe 18 months. It depends on how much growth there is.

But, there's pretty strong consensus among the bitcoin core team that a hard fork should absolutely not happen with less than 6 months of upgrade time, and most rally around a 1 year or 2 year timeline. We're going to cross the 100% mark by that time. We're probably going to cross that line before the halving. This is the final destination of Bitcoin. There is more demand for space on the blockchain than there is supply, and the only way to manage that is with a fee market. This is going to be true at 4MB blocks, at 20MB blocks, and would probably even be true at 1GB blocks. There's a lot of development happening in the space, and people want to use the blockchain for **lots** of things. There's more demand than supply, and as the ecosystem continues to mature we're going to see that in a big way.

So, most of the core devs aren't worried about crossing the line of permanent transaction backlog. It's going to happen at some point, it may as well happen now. The sky will not fall. Low value transactions will be priced out of the blockchain. There will be 120,000 people fighting over 100,000 seats, and 20,000 people are going to be told to go home. The helps us figure out which 20,000 are going home, but there's only room for 100,000 people, and that's for a large number of technical reasons.

&gt; In my opinion, perhaps the biggest systemic risk in bitcoin right now is, ironically, one of the things which has helped it the most in the past: the bitcoin core developers.

&gt; In the future, we will need to create a new team to work on the bitcoin protocol and help bitcoin become a multi-party system to avoid the systemic risk of core being the only team working on the protocol.

d0nxgop,3rdElement,30,"Welcome.  I think you will find most of us here are old time bitcoiners.  I am, and I remember the early days of bitcoin 2010-11 and how all the things we were talking about revolved around a 'platform' for a new Internet, and not necessarily the price.  We talked about all the things you could build on top of bitcoin, and how crypto could save the world.  Somewhere along the line, the Brand of 'bitcoin' was destroyed and co-opted by greed and developers who didn't share the vision of the original cypherpunks, the crypto-anarchists who wrote code to change the world.  

We barely noticed and that dream died a small quiet death while the price rose to the moon and beyond, leaving the dream dead in its wake.  It was about that time that I read Vitalik's whitepaper and realized this was the torch being handed off, the dream wasn't dead, not yet, and it wasn't all about the money, it was about the platform of creating that new world.  

If that ever dies here, if it ever becomes all about the money and the platform for changing the world dies with it by being co-opted by greed yet again, then I will move on.  So far it hasn't happened, and there are good reasons to believe it won't.  Gratefully all price discussion has wisely been banned from this subreddit, and we can focus on the technology, the very thing the early adopters of bitcoin were originally drawn to that far too many in the Bitcoin world have now forgotten.  

Its not ALL about the money for me (although I am happy to see the price increase), its about the innovation, its about the dream of becoming part of something huge that can stop corrupt governments in their tracks while at the same time making sound money and trustless contracts and the capability of solving a large portion of the worlds problems by removing power from corruptible human hands, and putting that power into incorruptible code.  Soon, futarchy controlled DAO's will be born with the Ethereum Foundation transitioning into that incorruptible code itself, and the problem of decentralized Development that is destroying bitcoin will be solved as well.  This is only possible with Ethereum, where if the tools don't exist, you just have to code them.  Have I swallowed the Kool-aid?  Possibly.  Do I think its justified, do I have empirical evidence to support that belief?  I think so, but as always I follow the innovation, and the people who are creating the world of the cypherpunks dreams, wherever that may lead.  For now, the only place doing that is here.

Some think that SegWit will not be rolled out quickly enough. The code will be ready in April, and the binary release will be in April or May. Then miners have to deploy it, which could happen within weeks or could take longer, depending on how cooperative miners are being. Then wallets need to be updated to actually make use of SegWit. (Though it's not necessary for 100% of wallets to upgrade for overall capacity to increase.) We could see near-doubled capacity before the end of May, or it could take longer - it's not clear. But I still view this as far better than a hardfork, which requires that *everyone* upgrades in order to use Bitcoin at all. And a *contentious* hardfork would just be pure disaster.

There's a perception that blocks are dangerously full, but [they're probably not](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/490dyi/serious_question_if_raising_the_max_block_size/d0o35r1). Most of the issues during the spam attack were due to wallets having dumb fee-choosing procedures. When the network is being spammed, it is appropriate for everyone making transactions to pay more. Saying that blocks should be able to just arbitrarily increase in size is saying that full nodes should bear the cost of spam attacks and increased tx volume, even though full nodes are unpaid and Bitcoin would be insecure if the majority of the economy didn't use full nodes.

If there really is an emergency, like if it costs $1 to send typical transactions even in the absence of a spam attack, then the contentiousness of a 2 MB hardfork would almost certainly disappear, and we could hardfork quickly.

d0p88pr,IceAugur,22,"Outside of mining hardware nearly every niche that has seen VC investment in this space is easily able to pivot to Ethereum. (Coinbase, Circle, Gemini - nothing in the branding ties them in too tightly. ""Bit""pay might be fucked tho) The ATMs have always been overstated. Localbitcoins could easily be copied by an ETH app, likely with better results as smart contracts would disintermediate the custodian part where LBC holds coins. etc.

I guess you could argue bitcoin has the network effect but in terms of the raw numbers of individuals involved it is a rather laughable lead when compared to even the most mundane apps that have gone viral.

Chain security is a thing. It's hard to fuck with an exahash of mining power. Ethereum is curently being run on garage racks of GPU's whereas Bitcoin has custom built datacenters. But once PoS comes, assuming the price per coin is sufficent to provide a reasonable barrier to entry on accumulating a malevolent stake, Ethereum will win on this point too.

Bitcoin killed itself, just as the world started implementing negative interest rates and all that other fun shit going on in the global markets that three years ago would have been an enthusiasts wet dream and propelled us past moon. Too bad. Decentralized money would have been such a benifit to humanity. Fuckin neckbeards.

**MORE INFO REGARDING BACKUPS, FROM /u/wosmo!** [Click to read.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/497qcw/transmission_290_may_be_infected/d0q1xuk)

^sorry ^for ^hijacking ^my ^own ^comment

**Please read this for your own safety.**

According to [this](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/497qcw/transmission_290_may_be_infected/d0pvwaa) user (thank you /u/wosmo!) the malware embedded in Transmission 2.90, OSX.KeRanger.A, is **ransomware** - one of the first ramsomwares, if not *the* first, to affect a Mac!

More specifically, it will encrypt **ALL** of your data and ""kidnap"" it 3 days after infection (Monday to most users), demanding that you pay a ransom to have it back - **potentially/certainly bitcoin**, which is quite hard to track. Backup **everything** you have ASAP, run MBAM on your Mac and get rid of that ASAP or you'll either lose everything on your computer or suffer financial damage.

To be honest, that makes me believe the Transmission team may have received compensation and/or some kind of incentive to do that. They inject it there, some people don't see it coming, are successfully targeted and a part of the profits goes to the team. AFAIK as I know that piece of malware shows no worm behavior, which makes me think someone injected it there on purpose. I'm deleting Transmission from my MacBook, even tho I am on 2.84, and I recommend you do the same. That software is simply not trustable anymore.

**Two** versions of the software developed on March 4 download are infected, reports Palo Alto Threat Intelligence. Three days after the installation of Transmission, the malware will connect to a command and control server (C2) via the Tor network. It will then encrypt certain files on the Mac, and then ask the victim to pay 1 bitcoin - € 375 - to send the decryption key.

The files that it tries to encrypt are many - more than 300 different types, some of which are here:

* Documents: .doc, .docx, .docm, .dot, .dotm, .ppt, .pptx, .pptm, .pot, .potx, .potm, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .txt, .csv, .rtf, tex
* Images: .jpg, .jpeg,
* Audio and video: .mp3, .mp4, .avi, .mpg, .wav, .flac

**How to check the integrity of your Mac**

To check if you have downloaded a compromised version of the software, go to the Utilities folder in your Applications and launch the Activity Monitor. In the search, enter:

&gt; kernel_service

If you find this process, click the ""i"" button in the window of the Activity Monitor, go to File, ""Open Ports"" (?) and search for:

&gt; Users//Library/kernel_service

If you find this, force-quit it and update Transmission. That is KeRanger, which you've eliminated by force-quitting and crushing the compromised version of Transmission.

Miners have the ""right"" to include any subset of the transactions that they get, even empty; and the block reward does not depend on how many transactions are in the block.  The transaction fees are supposed to motivate miners to include all transactions that they get.

A miner mines an empty blocks only because he can start to solve the block puzzle for block B(N) as soon as he gets the hash of the parent block B(N-1); but cannot put transactions into his candidate B(N) without knowing the contents of B(N-1).  If they solve the block puzze before finishing downloading B(N-1), he must post the empty B(N).  

In theory, there are ways to force miners to wait with engines idle while downloading the parent block; but they would require a hard fork to implement, and it does not seem to be be worth the trouble.

Any rule that tried to merely outlaw empty blocks, or require all blocks to be full, would only motivate the miners to fill the blocks withe spam transactions of their own.  The result would be worse than the empty blocks.",2016-03-07 02:12:28

* You can do a more centralized but simpler version of something like Lightning where everyone opens usually just one very-long-duration payment channel with a single hub, and then all of the hubs route payments between each other. This is called the ""hub-and-spoke"" idea, and there's apparently already some code for it in the form of StrawPay/stroem.
* Bitcoin banks could issue blinded bearer certificates. This is how many cryptocurrency proposals worked before Satoshi invented the block chain. When *combined* with Bitcoin, these certificates can be far more transparent (banks can prove full reserve, for example) and secure (using multisig). They also have the advantage of providing significant anonymity.
* A sidechain could be specially-designed for high throughput and low confirmation times. This sidechain would have reduced security and probably various other limitations, but it'd be fine for small amounts.

Lightning is what everyone is striving for because it has all of the advantages without most of the drawbacks, whereas the above solutions have reduced decentralization or security. But if for whatever reason Lightning doesn't work as well as expected, the above things would be just fine for smallish everyday transactions. You'd keep most of your money in the main Bitcoin system, and occasionally move money onto these reduced-security systems in increments of a few hundred dollars at a time. You'd also use Bitcoin directly for larger transactions. This is somewhat analogous to the difference between ACH and wire transfers in US banking.",2016-03-08 11:23:37

d0rqbaf,leviself,19,"Yes ether can be used as a currency. I would gladly sell a product for ether today, so I would imagine that makes it a currency. It's currently in circulation and can be used as a medium of exchange.

If they are trying to dissuade you from holding ether because they think the price vs fiat will go down, I'm not a prophet so I can't help you there. There was [a guy](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92.0) who tried to auction 10000 BTC for $50 in the early days. If I could predict the future I would have bought that, then bought into the ether presale and turned that $50 into $200 million for a 400 million percent return in 6 years. But I can't predict the future and neither can your friends.

To understand ethereum, you first need to understand some bitcoin history. From the beginning, bitcoin included a scripting language with lots of instructions you could use. However, there is a [famous result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) in computing due to Alan Turing that makes it dangerous for miners to execute arbitrary code. So the scripting system inside bitcoin was purposefully weakened so that transactions couldn't gum up the works. The way this was done was to allow only a few handful of transaction types into the network.

Later, different protocols came about that tried to overcome this by specializing in other transaction types that were not present in bitcoin. Some of them had a number of transaction types, but if you had a new application you wanted the only way to get it would be to have the developers add code to the protocol which is not an efficient process.

Ethereum's solution to the above problem is the concept of gas. Since it's impossible to know if a transaction will halt, you specify how much gas you will be willing to pay to run a contract in the blockchain. If you run out of gas, the transaction is rolled back and you get your ether back. If it succeeds you pay for the gas you used with ether and the rest is refunded back to you.

There's a lot of other moving parts as well, but I believe that is the most important piece. If the central innovation of bitcoin is the solution of the double-spend problem via the blockchain mechanism, I would posit that the central innovation of ethereum is the mitigation of the halting problem via the gas mechanism.",2016-03-08 14:08:14

A few more parameters are necessary to tell the package manager that this conflicts with Bitcoin Core and uninstall Bitcoin Core when installing Bitcoin Classic. As is now, if you've installed Core previously, nothing happens - you're suddenly subscribing to two channels that both provide the same package, and a version bump in _either_ of them will cause an upgrade _to that channel_.

**This means that people who have previously installed Core, and are switching to Classic in this PPA, will unwittingly switch back to Core if Core publishes a versionbumped package. This would be of particular concern for server farms with automatic upgrades on hundreds of VMs.**

The binaries can still be name, location and behavior compatible, but there should probably be a ""Conflicts: bitcoind"" directive in the config file, and the package(s) would need a different name (""bitcoinclassic"" suggested) to avoid this behavior.

d0td5jh,VenomSpike,33,"There are some interesting calculations you are using here, but generally I agree that the value of the blockchain is in fact directly proportionate to the security of bitcoin.  You will not see valuable assets being secured, or monetized on the blockchain when the underlying value of the securing protocol is significantly less than the asset itself. These numbers go hand in hand.  By increasing the value of the underlying chain, we continue to open the field for additional asset layers.

It's a fallacy to assume that the value of bitcoin has to already achieve critical mass to allow for ANY transfer of value, timestamping, or digitizing of assets.  Transfer of value can still occur, but will be limited to the asset value that the existing currency/chain can support.  

A very simple example is to look at the current market cap of bitcoin, roughly $6.2b.  It's easy to support the purchase of a coffee, or even a car.  Suddenly it gets far more complicated when you are talking about much larger value transfer, for example the purchase of a company.  Could Tesla purchase a tire manufacturer for $2b using bitcoin? The answer would be no.  Would Facebook have been able to purchase WhatsApp for $19b? Obviously not given that the purchase value far exceeds the existing market value.
'
Take this example to the next level and assume that we have listed equities that settle on the blockchain.  In our hypothetical listing, Facebook is listed via Nasdaq and it's public shares trade and settle on the bitcoin blockchain.  FB carries a valuation of roughly $300b.   FB conducts an all equity buyout of WhatsApp for $19b and existing equity shareholders for WhatsApp receive $19b worth of FB stock which is settled via the blockchain.  This transactions far exceed the underlying value of the chain they settle on and would present ample opportunity for attacker to attempt to disrupt the transaction.  It is entirely plausible that these settlements could still occur, but there is additional risk to settlement on a chain where it's value is far less than the assets as this compromises potential security.

For the meantime we will continue to see the value of settlements and transactions rise as the price of bitcoin rises. These two go hand in hand and create a positive feedback loop.  There is no reason to stop development on one process or another, the value is derived from the usage that the bitcoin and the blockchain can provide.  The more settlements and smart contracts that can occur on the blockchain, the more value that is implied in the underlying currency and the chain itself causing a price increase.  Increased price in bitcoin creates additional trust and security, bringing more settlements and smart contracts.  This will occur in a positive feedback loop until some sort of parity is reached.

d0svq5t,Ilogy,20,"&gt;Fourth, that the bitcoin blockchain is of interest, but not the currency. Some people believe this is wrong, too. They state that you cannot have a blockchain in banking without a native currency—and why would you replace bitcoin as the native currency when it's had five years and thousands of man hours of development effort invested? It's an interesting discussion, and one I disagree with personally as you can have a dollarchain or eurochain, rather than a bitcoin blockchain, but only time will tell on this one.

It is important to understand that SWIFT does not represent a settlement layer. All SWIFT is is a network for communicating financial transactions between banks internationally. 

The settlement layer in the legacy banking system is always central banks. That is, the exchange of government money, whether that be cash handed to a homeless person on the street or Federal Reserve deposits exchanged between banks, represents final settlement. If you have cash in your hand, that is real money. 

When two domestic banks need to settle with one another, that settlement ultimately takes place through a simple transfer of money between the respective banks' accounts at the central bank. This transaction is the equivalent of transferring bitcoins in the Bitcoin monetary system. 

In the United States, most banks use CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payment System) to settle between one another in a way that is less cumbersome than using the Fed for every transaction. It is functionally similar to a system like the Lightening Network. That is, using CHIPS they add up all of their transactions and then only at the end of the day do they commit a final settlement at the Fed. This way the Fed can be the backbone for a tremendous number of transactions without that much government money actually moving around.

When international payments are made, what happens is that a communication network like SWIFT is used, primarily for its security, to communicate between two independent monetary systems. Then each system settles independently. That is to say, if you want to send money to China, simplistically speaking, the Fed deposits dollars into some Chinese account at the Fed and then the Chinese deposit Yuan into some US account at the PBoC independently. The communication between the two banks is facilitated by SWIFT. Put simply, no actual money is transferred through SWIFT, simply a communication telling the two central banks who is owed what. I guess you could call SWIFT a kind of payment network.

So the only reason you need a network like SWIFT is because there is no final global settlement layer. There is no global currency. The reason we even have global reserve currencies, like the US dollar, is because we don't have a global settlement layer so some central banks ends up acting more or less as such out of necessity. Right now it is the Fed. This creates demand for the US dollar and a rise in its value far beyond what it would be without this status. 

The problem with saying blockchain technology is going to replace a communication network like SWIFT is that blockchains are *not* payment networks, they are settlement networks, they are money. Therefore, blockchains replace the role currently filled by central banks. 

If you have a blockchain that transfers value using US dollars, Fedcoin as it were, that blockchain would effectively replace the clearing house role currently played by the Fed. But nothing has changed with regard to international settlement. You still need to communicate between the closed system represented by Fedcoin and the closed system represented by some other blockchain, say Yuancoin. This isn't to say that SWIFT won't be replaced, we all know it will, but rather that you are still going to have to find a way of communicating between national blockchains, the problem SWIFT is meant to solve will still persist. 

That is unless you have one blockchain to rule them all. That is unless you have a global currency. But why would nations settle on that global currency being one of their competitors' national currency? Why would they agree to let the global currency be a national currency whose monetary policies are aimed ultimately at prioritizing their interests over all others? The world tolerates reserve currencies today because it has no choice. But in the age of cryptocurrency, global currencies become a reality. 

So the question of whether Bitcoin, or any blockchain for that matter, will replace SWIFT is really a question of whether the world will accept a global currency. If so, then all settlement will take place through its blockchain and the need for an international financial communication network will disappear. But why should the world accept such a global blockchain that is controlled by one nation, or worse, by a cabal of international bankers? Will everyone all over the planet simply submit to a global currency controlled by the super elite when there is an alternative controlled by no one?

The inverse correlation is very strong. But I can see many problems with ETH. I'm not opposed to it (or any other alts), bitcoin is not a god afterall.

- ETH supply is not yet well defined. It's inflating currently at around $250k/day which is very hard to sustain.

I watched as legitimate criticism of the then-budding Lightning Network concept was summarily deleted without warning, explanation, or announcement. It was months before the policy of ""XT is an altcoin"" was even public knowledge - during that entire time, an undercurrent was brewing that would eventually lead to the schism we now experience.

We currently have varying opinions on the future of altcoins and its short term price, and if possible I would like some input from you all. The timeframe below is for the next month:

Scenario: Ethereum rises substantially, Bitcoin falls. a) People hedge themselves against Bitcoin with Ethereum &amp; altcoins - causing the altcoin market cap to rise. b) People hedge themselves against Bitcoin with Ethereum only - causing the altcoin market cap to remain in stasis or fall.

Logic is telling me, Ethereum is in direct competition with the altcoin market. Therefore a rise in the price of Ethereum should in theory cause the price of altcoins to fall. Currencies with favourable characteristics can be created on top of the Ethereum platform. If this is the case, current altcoins have no/will have no utility, causing the prices to go down. The quote 'The Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent' may be suitable here.

I would really appreciate everyones and anyones opinion. Thanks

We broke $420. This was important because it creates a double top (in PnF that is a good thing.)  It is also good because it broke the potential of a lower high for this formation.  Both of those things are bullish trending.

The next hurdle is $425.  Getting through $425 will reverse the overall trend and give us a breakout from this formation.

The area shaded yellow on my chart is the area when the resistance line coming down from $445 meets the current support line.  We broke through that yesterday.  If the price starts to reverse that area should provide pretty good support.  Note that the Reversal point is below that shaded area.  If the price reverses into a column of Os it means that the support did not hold.  That would be a bearish thing.

So, here are the price points to watch:

$425 breaks the the formation with a break out.  Based on the size of the formation (7 columns) and the last break out (from $395 to $445) the break out should be get us to between $440 and $460).  Who wouldn’t want that going into the weekend.

One the downside, look out for a reversal with a pullback down to the $410 range.  If it breaks $410, it would be a fine time for a quick short.  If it goes down below $400…I would be careful about holding firm.  When it gets down in that area people are going to be going nuts.

So, this weekend should be interesting.  There is lots going on in the economic world.  Negative rates in Europe and Japan.  Bond buying all over the place.  And talk of a massive economic moves in China.  All of this is going to come into play.

Remember, when it comes to market size bitcoin is small compared to the other “flight to safety” assets.  Just a small percentage of money moving to safety or from capital control would mean huge move in Bitcoin.  

It is springtime in New England.  Mud Season is another name for it.  I am hoping we are done with snow (I only had to shovel the driveway three or four times this winter.)  The flowers are coming out, and that means I am constantly blowing my nose and sniffling.  

Coinbase dropped my credit card again last night.  This is the fourth time in the past two months that I was making an instant buy, and they had dropped my card.  They say, “they are working on it.”  What a pain in the ass.

Have a good weekend.

d0valfq,crimewave_is_rad,19,"Hi, I'm Crimewave, the owner of the service that was deanonymized. (I can post PGP signed proof, if you'd like.)

First of all, I wasn't hosting ""200 websites"" - there were roughly 200 onions that pointed to 12 different ports on a single server. Each port forwarded requests to a different onion domain I was running a MITM attack on. To make it simpler, these were phishing sites that were functionally identical to the real sites that would do malicious things like replace deposit addresses with my bitcoin addresses.

This attack, while it was successful as a result of my laziness, was not successful solely because of my laziness. This wasn't an attack on just my server but an attack on the Tor network itself.

Also, it didn't cost much in bandwidth or RAM. The server had 2gb of RAM (very little of which was actually used at any given time) and the attacks only consumed a couple gigs of bandwidth in the ~5 weeks they were running. Even if they did consume a lot of resources, they made me about $6000 in the time they were up so it's not as if I couldn't pay for the hosting.

If you have anything *helpful* to add that might prevent these attacks from working on innocent hidden service owners (e.g. whistleblower sites, sites hosting academic papers, etc) then please do. Otherwise, your *sass* is not appreciated.",2016-03-11 07:29:29

d0vdo75,aaaaaaaarrrrrgh,18,"This is a change that should be highly controversial, if even considered at all. Even though that was not your intention, by making this proposal in the form of a pull request without prior discussion and well-publicized consensus, you have likely seriously hurt the chances of Classic to succeed.

First, let me make sure I understand this correctly: If I obtained 51% of the mining power for 24+ hours and managed to isolate a node running this, I'd be able to create a chain that includes transactions with invalid signatures, and this chain would be accepted. Is this correct? (Edit: Would I even need to isolate the node, or could I just reorg 24 hours after mining the first block as long as my chain was longer than the real one?)

The current security model of Bitcoin is that a 51% attacker can roll back transactions (and recently mined coins), but cannot steal old coins. Many consider this property very important. If the improvement in sync time is really just 10%, I consider this a really, really horrible idea. If it was a significant improvement (i.e. halving the syncing speed or reducing it to 1/10th), it would make sense to consider adding this as an optional feature, disabled by default. I do realize that this attack is unlikely in practice, but that's not the security model people expect from Bitcoin.

Proposing this to be the only mode of operation is something that I don't think people would support. I certainly wouldn't, and would not even remotely consider using a client that implements this. I think it may be a good idea to withdraw the pull request until the idea could be discussed in more detail.",2016-03-11 08:50:41

d0v5gay,fluffyponyza,14,"&gt; Does he actually believe this himself?

Yes - it's a crypto*currency* not a crypto*company*. If its value increases it is because people find it incredibly useful and thus the demand for Monero increases.

What are the chances of this happening? Right now I'd say very little, the greatest possibility is that Monero does nothing grand and ends up being nothing great.

But then the flipside is Tor. For years - YEARS - Tor was a tool for illegal activity. It was the haven for distributors of childporn, illicit drugs, and even firearms. And then the entire planet shifted as people realised that *the establishment* had overstepped its bounds. Now you've got states in the USA passing legislation to allow libraries to host Tor nodes.

So maybe...POSSIBLY...Monero finds some massive, disruptive use. But that is not a guarantee, and the fact that there isn't an artificial limit on the emission means that there's no artificial inflation of valuation.

*This makes Monero a really dangerous ""investment""* ***unless*** *you're willing to also spend the time and effort in building up its utility and usefulness*.

Bitcoin has created this culture of get-rich-quick-seekers that do things like launch instamined scamcoins, or write long, irrational posts about how Bitcoin is impervious to failure and any altcoin that succeeds is bad for crypto in general and we'll all die if it succeeds.

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46que7/blockstream_meet_the_team/



&gt;   Blockstream has directed the crippling of Bitcoin in order to provide the solution, for their own future, financial gain.

&gt;conspiracy theory. 

Then read the publicly available statements of BlockstreamCore talking heads.

&gt;     These Blockstream-paid Bitcoin developers (for the Bitcoin ""Core"" software) are enforcing a limit on how much information can be transacted in Bitcoin. This is limiting the number of transactions to just 3 per second, approximately.

&gt; wrong, it's not enforced by Blockstream, see previous points.

You should work on your reading comprehension skills. ""These Blockstream-paid Bitcoin developers""

&gt; Blockstream is concurrently developing a ""solution"" to this problem, called the ""Lightning Network"". This ""solution"" is to be placed on top of the crippled Bitcoin network to allow it to scale. Blockstream will monetize the Lightning Network in the form of fees required to use their service.

&gt; wrong, Blockstream is just doing an implementation of Lightning, it doesn't own Lightning

You are again incorrect. Blockstream is working on sidechains and LN. While it does not own it, it doesn't really need to. They have the advantage of $70M seed and series A funding.


&gt; Additionally, for the past 8 months, Blockstream has been utilizing censored discussion forums for their communication, thus preventing awareness of this issue from being widely known. All discussion mentioning this has been (and continues to be) deleted and banned.

They participate on the censored forums and use it to spread lies and propaganda. They are the primary benefactors of the questionable actions of thugs like theymos. 
Shills who apparently follow the BlockstreamCore agenda like Luke-jr, publicly applauded the censorship many times, so as Maxwell.

While we cannot have proof (at this stage at least), the number of ""coincidences"" and the underlying conflict of interest should raise the red flag in anyone's mind (assuming they still have some healthy braincells left and are not corrupted themselves).

&gt; In short, Blockstream has created a problem so they can provide the solution. And they are doing everything they can to keep it that way.

1.) They fueled the disruption of the community, often using dirty tactics like propaganda and lies.

2.) Their main focus is developing off chain solutions

3.) The blocksize limit has been stalled by their representatives. They went as far as applying pressure on Chinese miners.

My take is that Blockstream's motives are irrelevant.  You guys are now in a position where you have disproportionate influence over Bitcoin.  I would ask, you guys commit so many resources to Core, why?  Out of the goodness of your heart?  We are not naive.  I'm not saying you guys are evil or anything, but your influence has far reaching impact.  A company has a tendency to gather together people with a common goal and mindset.  Given this, how can we not expect Blockstream's ideals and vision to leak into the actions of the people you pay to develop for Core?  The simple answer is that we can't.  Even if you guys are truly acting in good faith that does not release you from the current problem.  The myriad of mental hoops that you guys have the community jumping through to see it your way is just amazing.  Everyone here bought into a vision, that was a vision that Satoshi put forth in the whitepaper.  Your developers are now attempting to push a completely different vision.  Not only that, they have chased away anyone who does not toe the line.  This is what upsets me and I suspect everyone else the most.   It is abundantly clear that Satoshi intended for ""normal"" people not to validate all transactions, except through light clients and fraud proofs.  This is why he believed Bitcoin would scale.",2016-03-12 16:05:16
d0x4ath,dresden_k,28,"Fork to Classic. I don't think 2MB is ""enough"" but at the same time, the big problem was never the block size, it is Core. It's about governance. It's about who gets to ram what aspect of their own agenda through. Or, just make an alt-coin with Bitcoin's parameters, and a snapshot of the current blockchain, and just have two distinct coins running on distinct blockchains. 

Neither of those would necessarily stop a migration of users out; in fact it will probably _cause_ some people to leave for a variety of reasons. Those who think Gavin and Jeff are CIA plants or whatever that rhetoric goes like in /r/pyongyang, anyone who thinks Bitcoin Is The One True Coin, people averse to conflict, etc... To be clear, I'm not wearing that particular tinfoil hat about the CIA. My tinfoil hat stems from how I see AXA investing in Blockstream, and I see Bilderberg taking Bitcoin out at the knees. I see the tentacles of the global 0.1% reaching down and turning Bitcoin to stone. 

If Core remains in charge, a great number of people will leave (or have left already) and you'll see Bitcoin turn into tomorrow's Litecoin. Or tomorrow's Ripple. It's been compromised. 

There are other coins that do good things, whose communities aren't fractured and censored, and whose devs haven't (yet) done stupid and toxic things to their own project. Open source is messy. Other teams could get compromised, but when their market cap is relatively small, that hasn't happened yet. Plus, I trust Gavin and Jeff. I recognize that others don't. 

I don't claim to be absolutely ""Right"" but I see a turbulent future for Bitcoin regardless what happens. 

In the meantime, despite the difficulty I had emotionally doing so, I've basically completely divested. And, only a minority has gone to The Other Coin. I won't shill, but as Bitcoin specifically has companies, devs, software, hardware, conferences, mobile wallets, some limited merchant adoption, and a whole ecosystem around it, that whole ecosystem is also supporting _cryptocurrencies in general_, and it **doesn't take much** for all those 600+ global ATMs to switch to The Other Coin(s), now that they exist in the first place. Now that there are exchanges, they can exchange their local fiat for whatever-coin. Bitcoin opened the door for hardware wallets, and public awareness of cryptocurrencies, and took the brunt of the shitty news articles about how it's used for nefarious purposes. Behind that door are coins that exist now, and will exist that haven't been released yet. Whole projects that will change how the world functions. Bitcoin, at least, opened the door to the idea that I could have a bank in my pocket that didn't have to have a connection to a Bank. That's absolutely revolutionary. Of course, there are other revolutionary things about the technology, but we all know about those promises, here. I thought Bitcoin would champion these promises. 

I thought that the future belonged to Bitcoin, but if Blockstream has its way, I don't see Bitcoin being that change agent. I see BlockstreamCoin being a centrally-regulated settlement layer, controlled at the protocol level by Big Money and developers who think that the Earth is literally the center of the universe. If you don't have the fees for Glorious Leader's Blockstream, you can't use it. Do you think AXA et al., will appreciate anything even close to anonymity in the long run? Do they care about The Unbanked? Do they care about giving people the tools to not get robbed by their own governments with ""bail-ins""? No. Fuck that. 

I loved Bitcoin. I've spent the last 3 years or so glued to Reddit reading everything I could, and lurking in Bitcointalk, and reading Google Alerts, and telling friends and family about it. Everything people have sent me like ""oh, did you see this article about Bitcoin? I thought you'd like it"", I'm like, oh yeah I saw that. I've been a residential miner who burnt through a thousand dollars of electricity a month to keep the ASICs running. I sold my car and motorcycle to buy Bitcoin. I got a second internet connection to host a node from my house when running a bunch of VPSes would have been cheaper. A real node on a full machine I purpose built, not a Raspberry Pi (no offense). Divested or not, I'll still support trying to get to Classic. 

But I divested my coins. I divested because I got sick of what was happening. I'll get back in if Classic succeeds in forking, but Bitcoin is dead to me if Core remains at the reigns. It will probably slip if Classic 'takes over' too though, because the kool-aid drinking is strong in /r/pyongyang, and there are real, actual people who deeply and fundamentally believe that Classic, XT, BU, etc., are ""attacks"" on The True Bitcoin, and they'll not like Classic taking over. 

And, I'd like to say that I'd like Bitcoin to keep being the king, but I _sort of don't care what the token is called_. I want Satoshi's vision. I want a **peer to peer electronic cash system**. I don't care if that's called Bitcoin in a few years. Bitcoin _was the only real option_ five years ago. Then there were dozens, and they tried evolving, now there are hundreds. Maybe 25-50 of them seem like reasonably good bets right now. By 2020, I can't even imagine how cryptocurrencies and blockchain-like projects will have blossomed. We didn't have the luxury of choice before, but we increasingly do. 

If Blockstream gets its way, it won't be a peer to peer electronic cash system. At least, that's what I've come to believe. **And that's what I came here for**. 

The thing I won't have to miss is the community I've come to enjoy being a small part of in /r/btc, and /r/bitcoinxt and /r/bitcoin_classic. I will still lurk, and post my walls of text from time to time, but my tokens aren't BitCoreStream tokens as long as they've got Bitcoin by the balls (to echo George Carlin). ",2016-03-12 22:16:36

Less inflation for the first five years than Bitcoin had; Bitcoin had 100% inflation in year two and 33% in year four with a $1B market cap. But there's no reward halving, so by year six Bitcoin's inflation drops slightly lower than ether's (at about 9% for each), and substantially lower with the second halving, when Bitcoin drops to about 4%.

The inflation rate will not increase, so you can take that as a worst case and decide if it's satisfactory.

However, the devs have reserved the right to *lower* the inflation rate, when they transition to proof of stake. The amount it might drop is uncertain because the design is incomplete, but they're suggesting a rate somewhere from zero to two percent.

As a currency Ether functions exactly like Bitcoin, but with proof-of-stake it'll add the ability to earn a little interest on your holdings (only for large stakes but at some point probably open to anyone with stake pools). Arguably that'll make it a better store of value than Bitcoin. 

On the other hand, cryptocurrency is an uncertain store of value at best, and Ethereum is pretty new technology already and still making aggressive changes, aiming for massive scalability.

When it suits your purposes, you selectively edit the definition of ""community"" to include ""people who agree with me"".

RBF is an example of such a change.

In this case, it suits your purpose to claim that Blockstream/Core is the rightful owners of the protocol so that you can claim that anyone who offers an alternative is ""hijacking"" it. Yet when it comes to the issue of BIP109, you'll claim that you can't possibly support it because the protocol is absolutely not under your control and you can't force anyone to run your software.

The reason your are here responding to criticism is because the internet never forgets and more people are becoming aware of you flexible approach to truth. It's easy to prove your equivocation by simply placing your quotes from various contexts side-by-side, and it's catching up with you.

Bitcoin is a wealth transfer mechanism whereby hoarders watch their coins swell in value at the *defacto* expense of other users. As coins get more expensive, they go into hiding, thereby getting even more expensive. This stops transactional demand as those who use coins for actual transactions aren't able to get any. This eventually leads to the blow off tops we've seen again and again. Sudden supply appears and the price craters.

Artificial scarcity is what keeps widespread bitcoin useage and adoption impossible. I don't get why this is so difficult for people to comprehend. Money does not have to be scarce to have value. Money has value if it represents present capital that is *ready to make contact* with human labor to produce new wealth.

If you separate money from it's proper function as a medium of exchange in allowing present capital to meet human labor to produce future wealth, you get a perverted state of money.

d0zbqyp,Emocmo,22,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Happy Pi Day.

The price went up to $420 over the weekend and had a difficult time getting through.  I predicted a pretty quick drop to $410 and that happened.  We dropped as low as $407. This reversed our chart into a column of Os.

We have stayed at this $410-$15 range for the past day.  Because the trend is negative, it is still possible for the price to drop down to the $380 point.  For those of you optimistic people out there…you should keep this in mind.  If I was short from $420, I would personally have covered by now.  But we are in a negative column in a negative trend.  

OK, now that I have bummed you all out, let me tell you what I see as good news.  

If you look at my chart you will see an area of resistance marked in yellow.  This the is the area where I suspect the most turbulence in this trading range.  The reason for this is because it is the area where the resistance comes down from the recent $445 high AND the support from the $355 low converge.  

If we can hold this range for just a few days (we tend to be changing course ever couple of days) we will, by a matter of holding this range.  If we hold the low today, and make a price over $420 we will reverse to a column of Xs AND break the negative trend.  That kind of move would be very bullish.

Personally, I think the price is going move up from this point in a few days.  I am optimistic for this for several reasons:

I think that we’ve shaken out the people from the last “pop.”

I think there are a lot of people chasing other coins for a quick hit, and the easiest way to do that is to buy bitcoin and convert.  

I think the economic news over the weekend and this morning was not good.  I think China is going to have a bad week.  I think the Fed will be hawkish.  Europe has big problems (as we’ve seen in Germany this weekend) and the US Election has turned into a full blow circus shit storm with Super Tuesday 2.0 tomorrow, and more news leaking out about Hillary’s email scam.

North Korea is acting out worse than normal during the annual military drills on in the South.  In that situation, it only takes one idiot making a mistake to ruin your day.

Finally, and this is just an observation:  If you are a fan of doom porn on the inter webs just about everyone is predicting bad things for the rest of the month.  I usually don’t comment on that stuff, but there seems to be a negative feedback loop from all of these guys, just ramping it up.  I haven’t seen it this nutty in a while.  I will be happy when the elections in the US are more clear.

Overall, I am mildly optimistic about bitcoin.  If it were on a scale of 0-10 (0 being completely out and 10 being, I am mortgaging the house to buy bitcoin) I am about a 6 today.  And that is a loose 6.

Satoshi is racing back to rescue strong hands like him and deliver them to his unregulated free market interstellar comet.  You see, on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, there are no illegal corporate agencies like the ""DOJ"" or ""SEC"".  Free market entrepreneurs are allowed to trade shares of their company to anybody at any time.  It is on the buyer to do their homework and make sure that the security is backed by a real person.  

In fact, on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, there are no regulations dictating what it means to be a company at all.  Why should goons force you at gunpoint to declare a company a ""legal"" corporation who is separate from the owners?  Owners have their blood, sweat and tears on the line so why shouldn't they be able to mix personal and business together?  

On the comet, your business structure can take whatever form you wish.  Many business owners elect to co-mingle their personal and business funds because as the owner, they should be allowed to do whatever they want.  For example, Fat Jake, owner of one of the largest bitcoin resort casinos on the comet uses a ledger for all his transactions both personal and private.  If you won a jackpot at his casino, it would come out of the same pot that pays for his jet skis and yacht.  

Because Fat Jake's personal reputation at stake you can be assured that your winnings will be paid out.  That being said, you should always enter into a formally verified smart contract before gambling a single Satoshi--just in case.  If Fat Jake runs off with your hard earned bitcoin, it was your own fault and Fat Jake deserved them more.

This truly free market is considered the most free in the entire galaxy.  Millions of bitcoin holders galaxy wide are all holding their bitcoin in hopes that Satoshi will arrive on their planet first.  I **highly** recommend you continue to purchase more and more bitcoin.

&gt; So, as someone who generally feels like the least-technical person on this forum and who hasn't really dug into segwit, am I crazy to think that it has almost nothing to do with scaling? In other words, I see people say that it's not ""primarily"" about scaling and that the effective increase in the block size limit is more of a lucky ""side effect"" or ""bonus""... but even that seems wrong. The proposed formula could have been:

&gt; transaction data + witness data &lt;= 1,000,000 bytes

&gt; which would have resulted in no increase in the block size limit, correct? But it would still have addressed segwit's main goals (i.e., fixing malleability). So it seems to me that the effective increase in the block size limit that we get from Core's actual SegWit proposal is more like a bribe: ""hey, Bitcoin network, you know how you're now desperate for an increase in the block size limit because of the years we've spent stonewalling and goalpost-moving on that issue? Well, if you give us segwit (which we need for the Lightning Network), we'll give you a (token) increase in the (effective) block size limit. Oh, but not an honest, straightforward increase. No, part of the deal is that the effective increase must provide a huge (and completely arbitrary) discount for witness data, which -- it just so happens -- will provide an effective subsidy for Lightning Network settlement transactions (which will have more witness data than typical transactions).""

Or to put it another way, no, you cannot use extra space in the blockchain for onchain transactions, because we need that extra space to scale offchain transactions.

While I admit 800 is a bit excessive, it is in a way just an extension of the same principle.  Also, if those are Classic nodes, he's increasing the security of other Classic nodes by making it harder to DDoS Classic off the map.  So in that sense what he's doing is quite useful- if his 800 nodes make it cost-prohibitive to DDoS Classic off the map, then I can more safely run a Classic node from my house.  

I don't currently run a node, however I plan to start running a node in the next week or so.  Showing support for Classic is part of the motivation to get me off my ass, but the real reason is to strengthen the network.  I believe Bitcoin was most secure back when every user was both a node and a miner.

d10nuyj,7a11l409b1d3c65,18,"Completely crazy this guy. My favourite post:

&gt;In 2012 I heard about Bitcoin from an internet link. Get my interest from the first moment and I start reading the Satoshi's papers. I'm an IT for more than 15 years so I understand a bit those papers. So I read more about and I start mining with some GPUs also. Made some good BTC at the time and I stored them. But I didn't get too obsessed with Bitcoin, at that time I was quite busy with some projects.
Then in mid 2013 I start mining in cloud (BTC, LTC, NMC) and also I hold them until now. I have quite good stash from that mining not moved. **Those I keep them for my daughter, are her future.**
In 2014 my work slows down so I start looking for freelance jobs online and consulting. I saw also that the Bitcoin world is full of people that doesn't pay attention to details, some are total non-IT, doesn't understand the notion to be your own bank and take care of your money for yourself. So I start giving consulting to people around me that need help with Bitcoin. Simple stuff not programming or apps. So I start also ""promoting"" Bitcoin, in special to those who really need it: make a lot of payments abroad, currency exchange, working online etc.
So in 2014 also I start working like IT consultant for a small tourism company (apartment rentals etc) and always was in my mind to request them to pay my service invoices in BTC. At that time cashila and bitwala wasn't started yet (or I didn't know about their existence). So I start asking every time they had to pay my invoices, to pay me in BTC. The director one day invite me to have a chat about Bitcoin and why I insist to be paid in that currency. He knows a bit about but not too much details.
**So when he asked me why in BTC I took a 50€ bill from my pocket and then I burn it in front of him. I said: this is just dust, nothing for me.** As the ECB is printing this paper when they want, as many as they want and put me to pay their debts, like that I burn it.
He was stunned. Like 1 minute he didn't say anything and just look at me.
Then he invite me after work to have a beer and explain him more about Bitcoin. In that moment I realized that many people are out of this fucking world full of lies and these people that are waking up need help, need more info. But also I took it like the opportunity to sell some services. So I said: With one condition - my next invoice you will pay it with BTC directly to my wallet and I will give him 3% back in BTC to his personal wallet.
So I start giving him full consultancy about Bitcoin and how his company can obtain BTC, to setup a wallet, how to keep it secure (later they setup a multisig wallet) etc. So the company start buying BTC just for storing value. Instead of keeping the money in a bank account, part of them exchange them for BTC. Part from those BTC they start using to pay my invoices and then other 3-4 more employees.

d11u7fd,homopit,17,"&gt;The reason for putting that limit was just paranoia, to guard against some hypothetical attack by a rogue miner that someone else thought of. At the time, it was more than 100 times the average block size; and Satoshi clearly said that it was to be lifted as traffic grew, as a technical fix in some maintenance release.

&gt;The only reason we have this block size war is that Greg has been convinced since 2013 that he has a better design for bitcoin than Satoshi's. His design includes limiting the block space below demand to create a ""fee market"", and using some off-chain network to scale it to VISA level.

&gt;Instead of creating his own coin to test his idea, Greg wanted to use bitcoin itself. Gavin resisted for a while, but with Blockstream and its VC money, Greg got the means to do that. The lack of a viable design for the off-chain network did not deter him from that goal. He wasn't moved either by Mike, Gavin, and everyone with a bit of technical competence telling him that the ""fee market"" is a totally stupid idea. Adam and Austin do not understand bitcoin well enough to have such ideas, and are just trusting Greg on that point.

I respect and admire everyone's passion to have Classic succeed. If anyone wants Classic to win, it is me (I'm sure many of you would agree I want this very much).

But, basically what would happen is this:

You'd have 3 categories of nodes:

1. Core nodes. These currently accept transactions from node types #1 and #2.

2. Bridging nodes (Regular Classic nodes, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited). These nodes are the only nodes which would accept transactions from all three node types (#1 #2 and #3). These nodes would essentially become the bridge between Core nodes (#1) and Classic-only nodes (#3).

3. Classic-only nodes. These would accept transactions from #2 and #3 only. 

The Bridging nodes (#2 above) would then act as the overburdened intermediary relay points between the Classic-only nodes (#3) and the Core nodes (#1), because the Classic-only nodes would only receive Core transactions through these intermediary bridge nodes.

Since Classic currently has only about 5% hashrate, if a node fork occurred, Classic would be on a fork with minority hashpower, and no miner would stay on this fork. Classic would lose all mining support at this point.",2016-03-16 03:35:32

Bronze sculptures of goblins on motorbikes, R2D2 t-shirts, one sock, imaginary products from the world of Rick and Morty, a dog, the most majestic cat… EVER. This is what users of OpenBazaar, a peer-to-peer digital mall that’s just emerged after a lengthy gestation, will see as they peruse the various stores from the comfort of their desk.

Though it’s very early stages (OpenBazaar has only just opened a test service, with full launch expected later this month), the current app, running on Apple AAPL Mac in FORBES’ test drive, is a far cry from what some hyperbolic commentators were expecting. When OpenBazaar’s operators proposed the idea of a distributed marketplace where there was no central authority to hold to account, the currency was the untraceable (but actually very traceable) Bitcoin cryptocurrency and the rules almost non-existent, it led to assumptions OpenBazaar would house next -generation narcotics markets like Silk Road, illegal weapons stores and child abuse content dealers that police could never track. But right now, OpenBazaar is shaping up to be a slicker, more secure, anarchist eBay EBAY… ON ACID.
""

*(Picture showing Discover tab on OB)*

*Quote for pic - ""The OpenBazaar app for Apple Mac is a slick tool, with search functionality and encrypted chat for speaking with sellers.""*

""
There are, undoubtedly, some benefits to using OpenBazaar for anonymous trading. Encryption in transit across the nodes used to host the network (see map below for the spread) helps prevent simple snooping, whilst the very nature of a peer-to-peer setup means the US government cannot target an authoritative, centralized body, whether with a subpoena or a technical taskforce looking to knock out a server. Bringing the network crumbling down, though not impossible as shown in police P2P botnet takedowns, will be considerably harder than if command and control of the network were hosted on a small number of boxes. The chat feature is also end-to-end encrypted, which should prove popular given the rise of such services in response to revelations of mass government surveillance.
""

*(Picture showing OB nodes globally in Google Maps)*

*Quote for pic - ""The global nodes that currently handle the peer-to-peer OpenBazaar network. The lack of centralized control makes it difficult for government to censor traders.""*

**Why it ain’t Silk Road [insert iteration number here]**

""
But there are a few key reasons OpenBazaar is unlikely to become the next Silk Road. First, IP addresses of users are viewable to those have the technical ability to look. If the user can pull data from the OpenBazaar API (the application programming interface that allows outside access to some OpenBazaar systems), it’s possible to build a crawler that maps out all participants in the P2P network. Anyone who isn’t routing their traffic through other servers and thereby masking their IP address (typically done over a Virtual Private Network or the Tor anonymizing network) can, therefore, be quickly identified and located if police have a warrant.""

This is pointed out in a stark warning during registration: “OpenBazaar users are not anonymous by default. Most communications between parties are encrypted, but IP addresses are public and can be associated with activity on the network. Malicious parties could use this information against you; protecting your privacy is your own responsibility.” Even where users take extra precautions, governments have documented methods of exploiting VPNs and Tor.

Then there’s the ethos of OpenBazaar’s chief purveyors: Brian Hoffman, a former lead associate for cybersecurity at Edward Snowden’s old employer Booz Allen Hamilton , long-time Bitcoin specialist Sam Patterson and academic Dr. Washington Sanchez. After taking over the OpenBazaar project after a few emails from its original creator Amir Taaki, one of the first to promote and develop Bitcoin and the associated Dark Wallet, the trio sought to make a platform free of government control where companies could make more money by cutting out the middleman, typically the owner of the store like eBay or Amazon, who take a small percentage of each sale on their respective platforms. With Bitcoin, the middlemen, the banks and credit card companies who took a cut of traditional transactions, were already removed. But the platforms (yes, including those dark web drug and gun markets) still took their slice. With OpenBazaar, there’s only the buyer and the seller.

The creation of the network will earn them nothing directly. Hence why they founded OB1, which is looking into numerous avenues to bring big names to OpenBazaar with which it will partner on certain stores. It’ll also provide merchant support services, such as vetting legitimate businesses and arbitration, for which it may charge. “We have a list of several hundred individuals and businesses who, over the past months, have asked to be notified when we go live. So we’ll be starting with them and anyone else who wants to join,” says Patterson, talking to me over OpenBazaar’s encrypted chat.

“We won’t be targeting big players immediately. Part of this is that we want to make sure the client and network have been well tested before we push for wider adoption. The other part is that the client currently doesn’t have a lot of tools to do proper inventory management, something that will be necessary for anything larger than a small business.

“The initial roll-out is still very much through an excited and engaged community and word of mouth, and we aren’t going to be doing marketing until we’re confident we’ve really nailed down this new way of doing commerce online. Peer to peer commerce isn’t going to take over the internet overnight, and we’re in this for the long haul.”
""

**The beginnings of a retail revolution? Or more dark web drugs?**

""
It’s been an auspicious start for OpenBazaar. Since the test went live at the start of March, Hoffman tells me there have been roughly 15,000 downloads of the app for testing. Having acquired a small amount of funding in a $1 million seed round from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar, Hoffman says his company is focused on growing the site without any more outsider investment in the near future.

OpenBazaar could still become attractive to those flogging illicit gear. Hoffman and his colleagues plan to increase security on the app, providing much more effective anonymization. They believe buyers and sellers have the right to keep their identity secret; understandable in light of global surveillance, where digital stores have been infiltrated by government spies, most notably attempts by the NSA on Google’s Play store.

More privacy features are on the way too. In the coming months, as OpenBazaar tries to sell the idea of a new kind of retail to the average shopper, it’ll look to tie itself to an anonymizing network, either Tor or the lesser-known i2p. The encrypted chat is currently not as private as, say, a Jabber client like Adium or Tor Messenger. OB1 developer Chris Pacia tells me all of OpenBazaar uses NaCl, a crypto library by Daniel Bernstein. He notes that further updates could provide more privacy. “The encrypted chat is pretty basic at the moment. It’s mostly just geared towards connecting two OpenBazaar nodes do they can discuss a purchase if needed. We don’t make any explicit attempt to hide IP addresses, for example. More advanced functionality like that could be layered on later as needed,” he says.

At the time of writing, I could only find one dubious seller, who was offering NATO-grade pepperspray and a “flashlight stun gun”. One wonders whether he or she has a licence to sell those goods in America.
""

*(Picture of said flashlight stun gun and user selling it)*

*Quote for pic - ""One of a few items for sale on OpenBazaar that might raise eyebrows, due to the possible illegality of selling such a weapon. In its early days, OpenBazaar doesn’t look like a haven for criminals.""*

""
But even if it does become a playground for criminals, to blame the OpenBazaar creators would miss the point. The OpenBazaar protocol, explains Hoffman, is “agnostic”. Like all code, it has no explicit moral bias. “The distinction allows for sale and trade of goods legally in one jurisdiction that may actually be illegal in others but does not intentionally enable users to conduct illegal trade and encourage that,” Hoffman adds. “It’s a tool, not a business.”

For now drug, fraud and gun merchants will likely stick to Tor Hidden Services, where sites are hosted on the anonymizing network and can only be accessed when users “hop” across randomly-selected servers to reach their destination. When OpenBazaar does get somewhat more secure, there’s little reason to suspect dark web merchants will move over en masse as there’s currently no indication it’ll offer better protection from law enforcement, even if it’ll be harder to take storefronts down.

If OpenBazaar can appeal to major merchants and independent retailers who want to save money and know how to handle Bitcoin, it has the chance to shake up the market in a significant way. The early adopters might be a little kooky (expect that anarchist aspect to remain), but that’s no reason for big players not to try something different that could, in the long-term, save them considerable expense.

As long as the bitcoin address made at least one transaction, then yes.

Here's the pybitcointools approach:

    import bitcoin  
    addr = '1FxkfJQLJTXpW6QmxGT6oF43ZH959ns8Cq'  
    spend_data = [x for x in bitcoin.history(addr) if 'spend' in x][0]['spend']  # Will fail if account never spent  
    spend_hash, spend_index = spend_data[:64], int(spend_data[65:])  
    txin = bitcoin.deserialize(bitcoin.fetchtx(spend_hash))['ins'][spend_index]  
    pub = bitcoin.deserialize_script(txin['script'])[1]  
    assert bitcoin.pubtoaddr(pub) == addr  
    print pub  

Now, you do:

    from ethereum import utils
    print utils.sha3(pub.decode('hex')[1:])[12:]

And that gets you the ethereum address.

In reality most miners find a way around this waiting and don't actually just turn off their equipment in this waiting time (which is expensive to do).  Most miners have been coming up with some work-around.  
The Bitcoin Core team have said that the miners are doing it wrong and they should really be doing this validation, and by extension, turn off their mining for 5 or more seconds after ever block. The Core team has been ignored and most miners did find a way to keep productive.

Bitcoin Classic, and Gavin specifically, has found a good solution that is a lot like what miners are already doing themselves, and added to that some security features and naturally it is great for everyone that this ends up in the (new) reference client so we don't end up with situations where miners programmed something in private that causes everyone problems.

The solution is to send **only** the header of a block. Which is sent in milliseconds. That is enough information to do the full validation of the proof-of-work. It is not enough information to know which transactions the miner included in that block.

After validating the header the miner can thus start mining an empty block. No transactions added. The miner can't include any transactions because some of those transactions he might include were already put in the previous one he hasn't seen yet.

When the full block arrives (at most 30 seconds later) we continue as normal, mining full blocks.",2016-03-17 03:57:25

I understand your sentiment here, Olivier. An ""artificial limit"", you're right, is probably a bad stop-gap fix. It's not setting a limit via market forces. This means, by definition, that it's probably sub-optimal. It seems it should be a dynamic limit, instead.

However, please keep in mind the latter half of my prior statement:
&gt; ""externalizes costs to those who run full nodes and smaller miners""

&gt; ""offload costs in an externalized fashion that centralizes the network""

A dynamic system should raise/lower the limit, *without* ignoring externalization of costs to nodes &amp; miners. It should consider those externalized costs in its calculation, otherwise the system will centralize WRT nodes &amp; miners.

By considering these costs, we will retain the Bitcoin network's ability to be ""purely peer to peer"" (if someone wants to run a full node... and have full validation capability, transaction privacy, &amp; say in setting the rules for the system... then they should have that option).

d15hn67,BHOmber,34,"I found out that opiates were the drugs that fixed most of my problems while I was in high school. I was a kid that played sports, was in AP classes getting decent grades and had a great group of friends. I had previously been in an accident when I was younger that required a week long hydromorphone drip and a few scripts of vicodin, but I never realized how great they made me feel until I was a little older.

I started off taking a few pills at a time from my grandparents unused, old scripts of hydro and ate em in social situations to feel warm and comfortable. I've always been good at socializing but, like I've heard many others say, opiates turn me into the person I want to be on the outside. I was much more empathetic, could express my feelings and opinions easier and was more confident in anything I was doing or saying. My use at this point was infrequent, and a 15mg dose of hydro was considered a treat.

I eventually found out that my weed plug had relatives with scripts that they would sell to him, so I ended up being able to grab 10mg norcos for $4 a piece. Once in awhile he would get some percs and I was even able to try my one and only 20mg green stop sign opana through him. I remember snorting ~2.5mg with no tolerance and had to sit in my car during a funeral because I was too nauseous. Blamed it on the stomach flu and my parents never thought anything of it. I was probably a junior in high school at this point. No one had a clue that I was into anything besides smoking weed. 

After discovering bitcoin, and soon thereafter Silk Road, I had a deep down subconscious feeling that I would end up ordering heroin after a winter of secretly buying pills on a bi-weekly basis. I spent months researching BTC and SR until I was confident enough to place the first order. 

I went straight from occasional use of low dose pain pills compounded with APAP to sniffing some of the *best* heroin in the country. My first gram came inside the battery compartment of a dollar store toy truck. Complete overkill on stealth that made me grin from ear to ear. From then on, the only days that I weren't high were when I was dry and waiting for my next express envelope with a $200 gram inside. I carried a vial of H with one of those little spoons attached to it inside my pocket at all times and would take a bump every four hours or so. Grams lasted me between 7 and 10 days and that was how I justified my use. Somehow, I convinced myself that the amounts I was using weren't dangerous and wouldn't result in severe withdrawal symptoms, despite being high all day every day.

I was a fucking clean cut, smart, athletic high school senior that would pretend to piss in the bathroom stall to take a bump while my friends were at the urinals. I went to my graduation ceremony in acute withdrawal due to a pack not landing in the PO box by the weekend. No one knew or suspected anything. Not my friends, not my parents, not even my long term girlfriend who I spent most of my time with on dope.

 I used all throughout the summer before I was going off to college, but one of my last nights at home, I fell asleep in my basement with my vial and a mirror on the floor next to the couch I passed out on. When I woke up it was gone. My stomach dropped when I figured out what had happened. My dad came down to wake me up, saw my straight-off-the-brick white dope and assumed it was cocaine. I ended up having to explain to my rents that it wasn't coke, but something much ""worse"". When I came upstairs, it almost felt like a relief to finally know that someone else was acknowledging the fact that what I was doing was completely fucked up. 

We talked to the psychiatrists that were prescribing my vyvanse and they immediately cut me off and pretty much sent me on my way with a few ativan for the withdrawals that I was barely feeling. I knew the mental part of my addiction was what would lead me back, so I decided to get on suboxone. I didn't do enough research and found out that I was started on a much higher dose than I should have been after it was too late.

I was on a stable dose for around a year and then tapered for another year before jumping off last July with the help of some kratom. I've been clean from heroin since August 2013, opiate free (bupe) since July 2015. I don't think I would have ever gotten into heroin this early in my life without the DNMs, but I'm honestly glad it happened. From the moment I felt my first *real* opiate buzz I knew that I would end up an addict somewhere down the line, whether it was to oxys or dope. I'm just thankful it was during a time in my life that I could easily recover from.

Whenever I'm feeling shitty, I always like to remember that I could open Tor and have some H in my mailbox tomorrow afternoon. I'm able to look at pictures of listings, read reviews etc and have no real urge to buy anything even when I have hundreds of dollars of BTC at my disposal. *That* is how I know how far I've come.

d15o6bj,tsontar,26,"Let's do the math on using LN for ""decentralized scaling.""

Alice buys coffee every morning on her way to work at Bob's coffee shop.  She spends $5 every workday there.

Alice could open an LN channel with Bob, deposit some Bitcoin, then use LN payments for her coffee.  Alice would like to get a 10X scaling factor.  She will need to open and close the channel, which is 2 onchain transactions, so to scale those up by a factor of 10X, she'll need to be able to make 20 LN purchases.

That means that Alice has to deposit *an entire month's worth of coffee money* ($100) in this channel just to achieve a 10X scaling factor.  To put it another way, to scale coffee 10X will cost Alice $100.

And remember: a 10X scaling factor is nowhere near enough to get Bitcoin to scale to ""Visa-like"" levels.  In fact, a 10X scaling factor is basically just Bitcoin XT (8X).  To get to 3000 tps (Visa-like) then we need 1000X scaling.

Let's also suppose that Alice eats lunch every day at one of 10 places that's near her work.  Lunch costs $10, so to get a 10X scaling factor, she'll need to deposit $200 *with each restaurant* or $2000 total.  Just to cover lunches, and only producing a measly 10X scaling benefit.

This is not a ""decentralized scaling solution"" at all.  It falls right on its face, because there's no routing, only a purely decentralized point-to-point network, and it'll take people depositing 1000X their typical spend in order to scale to ""Visa-like"" levels.

Now, Alice is not a whale early-adopter.  Nor is she an altruist.  She doesn't have thousands of Bitcoin to lock up for lunches, and if she did, she has no incentive to lock them up *just to help other people scale Bitcoin.*  So Alice looks at the above solution for getting a lousy 10X of decentralized scaling, and says ""there's nothing in it for me, no way.""

But Alice is no dummy.  She knows that while she can't afford to open a payment channel with everyone with whom she transacts, she *can* afford to open just one payment channel with Charlie the Early-Adopting Whale, and put all of her Bitcoin in that channel.

See, Charlie the Whale is loaded with Bitcoin, and has made payment channels with most everyone already.

So Alice can simply open a *single* payment channel with Charlie, and get quick one-hop payments to everyone that Charlie has a channel with (most everyone) *without having to allocate 10X funds to each merchant.*

Bob's no fool either.  He runs a coffeeshop, not a bank.  He doesn't want to jack around with managing his end of all of his customers' payment channels.  Bob just uses Charlie as a payment provider.

*LN scaling, solved: just add a whale and make him the central hub.*

Once you understand the dilemma facing the first ""decentralized"" scenario, and then consider what happens when we introduce a ""whale"" into the scenario who can open a ""Lightning Bank"", it becomes patently obvious that LN can be decentralized, or it can scale, but definitely not both.",2016-03-19 23:21:06

d15h1ot,derspiny,22,"1. Adjustable fiscal policy
2. Safety features against fraud and loss
3. Predictable costs
4. Non-laughable transaction throughput
5. Non-laughable transaction latency

Number 1 - an adjustable fiscal policy - is probably the killer app for a decentralized _currency_. The code-is-law crowd will tell you that either there is no fiscal policy to bitcoin, or that the policy is just code, man, and with enough consensus it could be changed. The former is untrue, for painfully-obvious reasons, but the latter _is_ true - but totally irrelevant, since the conditions for reaching consensus on bitcoin's fiscal policy have never, and likely can never, be met. Effectively, the original fiscal policy included in Satoshi's bitcoin paper is now an immutable law of bitcoin; all of the alternative fiscal policies are being tried in altcoins, instead.

Without some control over fiscal policy, bitcoin has no protections against common economic failure modes. An economic boom (where the real value of the economy grows faster than the money supply) would put incredible stress on the existing policy, rapidly driving up the real value of each bitcoin and causing a harsh backlash as discretionary exchange of bitcoins slowed to a crawl. A slump (where the real value of the economy grows slower than the money supply) would produce that dreaded bugaboo of ancaps everywhere: unchecked inflation, with no mechanism in place to correct for it.

Bitcoin's user community is actively and ideologically hostile to any organized control over bitcoin's fiscal policy while, perversely, extremely vulnerable to it. A community of economically uneducated developers who organize on the basis of ""merit"" (often, really, on the basis of in-group membership signals like the ability to write a coherent pull request) is incapable of having a reasoned discussion about changes to bitcoin's fiscal policy, but by the same (ha) coin is unable to adequately recognize or respond to organized, clandestine efforts to exert control over bitcoin by more capable actors. Witness the efforts Blockstream is going to to coerce mining pools to follow their proposals, and the community's utterly ineffective response to it.

Number 2 - safety features - are the unavoidable demands of integrating with human systems. Nearly every real world payment system or funds transfer system has features in place that allow for money to be moved without the consent of the nominal owner of those funds. These features exist because society demands it; that demand cannot be eliminated through code alone.

These systems operate on two axes. The first is that a transfer of funds can be reversed by the initiating party, given sufficient approval from the broader financial system. From this we get chargebacks, which are an obvious necessity in a retail context, but we also get EFT reversals and bounced cheques. The second is that a transfer may be initiated by agents of the financial system in response to external stimulus: garnishment orders, funds seizures by law enforcement, and so on. Bitcoin cannot survive in the real world by simply ignoring these use cases.

Number 3 - predicable costs - is a consequence of the the bitcoin community not only not understanding how money works, but also not understanding how bitcoin works. There are well-known properties of queuing systems that describe the behaviour driving the bitcoin transaction fee. Arguments about block size are, at some level, arguments about the throughput of the queueing system describing the bitcoin memory pool. Since queues - like the memory pool - only have two steady states, either the fees are predictable and available throughput vastly outstrips transaction volume, or the fees are unpredictable and transaction volume meets or exceeds available throughput.

Without predictable costs, the broader market will not accept bitcoin as a payment system, even on long scales (such as in cases where it's used as a settlement system for off-blockchain transactions). Control over costs is an intuitive necessity for small transactors, and a conscious and important part of planning and risk control for larger, more organized transactors such as businesses. Uncontrolled costs represent a massive and unnecessary risk, which will prevent adoption and drive real users away from bitcoin (and possibly from decentralized currencies generally).

Numbers 4 and 5 - non-laughable throughput and latency - have been beaten to death in this subreddit, and I won't elaborate on them here.

d1642do,MechanicalEngineEar,26,"with bitcoin there is a clear solution that is solved which pays out coins.  How does ""doing science"" keep these objectives clear?  who decides which research is worthy of free computing power?  what prevents the corruption of a company submitting a huge project which would be worth a huge sum and somehow accepting a false solution from someone to get the payout?

Let's say the currency takes off and is HUGE!  that means the cumulative computing power is potentially worth an equally HUGE amount.  That could be worth millions or billions or possibly even trillions (in USD of course) in the future.  When the currency is that big, how do you decide who gets it?

On the other hand, what happens if computing power limits are shattered and the most complex simulations can be simply run locally housed computers?  What then drives the value of this coin?  do we farm out the computing power for bizarre studies that are simply trying to find a reason to use the computing power?  for example, if we can simulate every cell in a human body throughout a lifetime within seconds, so we just start throwing every chemical compound in ever dosage into humans to get simulations back of what is happening?

Is there any opportunity for for-profit companies to use this reasearch? or will for profit companies just have to create non-for profit sister companies who request specific research which they ""share with the public"" afterwards which conveniently provides the for-profit company with exactly what they wanted?

In the end, this sounds like a naive dream of someone who loves the idea of science but doesn't realize how the world actually works.
Sure, it can survive as a novelty cybercurrency, but I would say it is equally if not more vulnerable to collapse than most traditional currencies, even more so if it became a major currency.

d15tcs6,yolotrades,23,"Interesting developments these last few days. Charts between the east and west are in disagreement about the big triangle. Looking through the charts, it comes down to the following: during the dump from 500-300, China dumped further on the outset than the West causing a lower start to the triangle. Following this, after the move back up to 465 and subsequent crash to 352, here is an example where the *West* dumped further than China. Essentially China has a lower starting point to the triangle but a higher mid-point, causing a steeper angle on the bottom support of the triangle (or you could think of this inversely - the west's line is shallower). I feel the markets are kind of divided over which is more important, if only because I was expecting some *massive* dumping if the triangle broke down. There's no way to draw the triangle on OKC or Huobi without it being breached. However on all western exchanges the triangle is still in play. My ears are up for my long. Debating between placing stops at &lt; 400 or at &lt; 388. It's a bit tough for me to see a double bottom at 388 if the big triangle is broken by that much, so I'm leaning towards &lt; 400. I'm much less bullish than the days past, but can't lie... I would be very disappointed (as primarily a holder) if this five months doesn't pay off and result in some type of continued price increase.

The market tanked shortly after and he ended up segregating the ostriches to stop them reproducing as no one wanted to buy them any more.

His alpha male was bad tempered like a bull, it would chase and attack people's cars as they drove to his farm house. After about 5 years of this he got a bunch of his mates, organised a big bbq and they peoceeded to unload every weapon they had at that male ostrich as it ran around the paddock. They were a big group of hunters so they had quite a lot of weapons, this was before the weapons crackdown in 1996. The bird didn't suffer, it was over fairly quickly.

The idea that people would stake their reputations upon an economic model for bitcoin which combines fixed transaction supply with growing transaction numbers is baffling.

I see this as akin to administering a public transportation system (say a railway) which is running near capacity presently but could increase the number of available trains if required to alleviate capacity issues. The managers instead decide that because there is a theoretical technical limit to how many trains or cars could be placed on the tracks that the solution is to fix in stone the timetable in perpetuity. A more elegant system is simply to raise the ticket prices to ride on the train in line with demand!

Everyone has to use the train of course so this makes perfect sense. It misses out that as prices rise and the trains become congested that other train and bus companies move into the space, with lower prices and better services and take away market share from the incumbent.

The kicker of course is that bitcoin users are effectively shareholders in the train company. Would you keep your funds/value invested in a company suggesting the above strategy? Or move to invest in newer offerings in the space? ",2016-03-21 00:17:08

d16zjkr,Emocmo,23,"Ooooooo…. A rare Sunday posting for me!

While the drop was dramatic, it bounced pretty nicely.  So nicely, we have some significant changes in the chart and the patterns.

First, we went down to a low of $399.  But we bounced pretty quickly right back into the $400s.  The beauty of this move is that we reached a higher low than the last column.  And since it has gone back up to $415 (just a few minutes ago) we breached the trend line coming down from the $445 box.  

The trend is now reversed to a positive trend.  And since it is a positive trend, I can increase my optimism.

Of course, with swings as wild as we have had, the negative trend is just a couple of boxes away.  We need only fall below $405 to hit that again.  During times of consolidation, these things can swing from one direction to the other in minutes.  

The positive break out would occur at $425.  And that would also move the price clearly above the trend line.  So, while we are “technically” in a new trend, it is tenuous at best.

The best news of the weekend is that the high of today brought us up to the point where our formation now contains 9 columns.  That means that the pressure in play is STILL pretty significant.

If we were ONLY at the reversal point I would be concerned about a bull trap.  But because it popped up fast, and followed through today that case is less likely.

So what do I think?

I am thinking that we will probably see another try at $420.  If we can break through that will some strength and speed, I think the battle will be won, and the bulls will  be in  charge for a few days.  My guess is if we hit $422 or higher will are more likely to see $450 than $400.

**An Aside**
I know I wrote last week about moving some investments around.  For those of you feel comfortable with the PnF charts and you think you can read them ""Okay"", take a look at these two charts.  One is of the S&amp;P 500 and the other is from the Dow Jones.

[Charts of Dow and SP500 for Fun](http://imgur.com/gallery/pnKjU/new)

The Dow Jones chart shows a long pole warning the likes of which I haven't seen in years.  Even in the BIG bitcoin rally to all time highs we did not move up that far, that fast. If you think that can keep moving--at that rate -- you would have to believe in Skittle-Shiting-Unicorns that can fly.  If you see the Dow drop to below 17450, that sucker is going down another 300 points.  And that would be 1/2 the column.  It could drop a LOT more than that.

The SP chart shows that we are on our sixth visit to this level since the end of 2014.  Now, normally I would be thinking, ""Wow, this may be the time we finally 'make it' to new all time highs.""  I WOULD think that if the Dow was not going stratospheric.  Yes...I think we are in for a helluva week or two.  The race to the end of Q1 is going to be something to behold.

1. Fix method to compute signatures of transactions so that verifying large transactions is O(N).  AGREE
2. Fix methods to compute signatures of transaction so that transaction identifiers can not be modified except by signers. AGREE
3. Fix methods calculating block size limit to subsidize complex signatures without regard to their communications and processing costs.  STRONGLY DISAGREE.
4. Fix method of organizing new signatures into blocks so that older nodes think they are verifying transactions when they are not.  VIOLENTLY DISAGREE.

d18i3ay,Vendor_BBMC,18,"First of all, you're thinking from a drug buyer's perspective. Your coins are clean, obtained legitimately, and nobody is interested in them.

Second, if you buy bitcoins under your name, there is a good chance that the electrum wallet will have your name associated with it. Its vendors that the cops are after, and we have to turn our entire wages into somewhere to live, food to eat, and something to sell.

Its not illegal to send bitcoin to any wallet in the world, even a known darnet marketplace address. When you buy something and your bitcoin goes into the collective escrow with everybody else's (even just for 10 seconds if you FE) the cops can't see who bought what from who - its just bitcoin pouring into a big bucket, and then dripping out of one of many holes to vendors.

This ""coinmixing"" has been keeping people pretty safe from prying eyes since SilkRoad.

Recently, there has been a problem. Marketplaces are forgetting their primary function - bitcoin mixing - and they desperatyely want your business. They show you your bitcoin going into its own individual escrow (like a tunnel between you and your vendor only), put a 2 out of 3 lever on it, and say ""look at me! I'm not stealing the escrow! Follow your money on the blockchain if you don't believe me""

Lets say you bought a quarter pound of weed from a vendor using a multisig escrow, then a week later a cop bought 3.5g, watched his bitcoin, and knew that the wallet it paid into belonged to HumboltFarms.  He also knows that all the other payments into it are from chumps buying weed.

Multisig escrows can always be stolen by the marketplace owner, and usually are. He coded them for god's sake! Even if a thief wanted to foil his future self with a software feature, he can't out-fox himself. He has root admin access and can take the market offline for 10 minutes and completely replace the wallets with wallets with a trap door. Or lock you and the vendor out before logging in as both of you. Or just press a big red button which says ""empty every wallet""

If youve ever used a multisig escrow with a vendor who forgot to tumble, just once when his rent was late, you are both in danger until 2140 when the blockchain is due to stop.

Script kiddies with Aspergers would love there to be a software solution to everything, they tell YOU that YOU don't understand multisig transactions if you say a bad word about them. They don't understand human social interaction and misread emotions, so they don't realise that **there will never be a software solution to matrketplace exit scams. Not when the exit scammer writes that software**

This is nothing short of reckless.

He also completely ignores the probable chilling effect of full blocks on innovation and growth.  When such a limit is clearly not maxing out technological possibilities, companies that might base their services on Bitcoin think ""I might as well use X and get 16 times the capacity"".

And of course the Bitcoin-as-gold argument is hugely problematic.  I mean, if you believe that Bitcoin will to some degree suppliant gold -- if you believe that it is a ""better gold"", you likely believe so due to its enhanced transferability.  So if a new coin enters with even greater transferability, wouldn't it suppliant Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin is with gold?

1) Both parties are legitimately interested in the possibilities.  

2) Coinbase is partially sending a warning shot at Core/Blockstream/Miners.... underlining the fact that they DO play an important role.

3) The benefits are obvious to Ethereum - Coinbase did more than any company on the planet to build out Bitcoin.  Adoption of Ethereum would give us a Huge Boost.  Bitcoin really doesn't have anything Ethereum doesn't - except a several year head start in name recognition and user base.  Coinbase levels that playing field, catches us up fast.

4) There is a clear benefit to Coinbase also.... diversification &amp; setting up a 2nd basket for their financial eggs.  Lets face it - there is a real possibility that bitcoin eventually falls apart.   Or at the least, that it is substantially displaced by Ethereum.  What makes more sense..... To wait and do a transitional ""Buy-In"" to Ethereum once it has gained that marketshare on its own, and you are paying $50 - $100+ / per ETH?  Or transitioning in NOW, when you can work a contract deal with the Ethereum Foundation and get in with a negotiated Reserve ""Buy-In"" at say $8 - $10 / ETH?????   Because Coinbase will need an upfront ""Buy-In"" to put substantial Reserve ETH in place before launching.  But be careful, because that is on its own not going to be an upward market mover - that will be a lowball contract buy-in.  The real ""market mover"" is the fact that 3.5 million Coinbase accounts get exposed overnight to ETH.

Lastly, I have no idea of the timing of any announcement / decision.   I think it is a decision that WILL come at some point, simply because it is a sound business decision for both parties.  And it could come immediately, because the people that are saying, ""oooohh, decisions/prep etc has to be done"", clearly don't understand that we have no idea how far along this road they may already be.  There are the obvious rumours of Coinbase already running adds for an Ethereum coder, and nothing says they don't already have one.

My gut feeling is that the best we come out of this meeting with is some supportive language from Coinbase/Ethereum that it was a positive/productive meeting and that the two parties have committed to continuing to explore possibilities.

Side note: http://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/229598791/

There are some interesting names attending.   This is one popular meetup.  There are already 130+ people in the overflow waiting list.  Honestly, I think this is bigger than people think.  I really believe that there is more discontent and concern out there in Bitcoinworld than is publically acknowledged.  People are frustrated, AND there is more than a little worry too.   There is also building frustration in Ethereum.... everybody seems to acknowledge we are ""the greatest"", but nobody knows about us. 

This could be a catalyst.   Coinbase represents ""THE MARKET"", the name recognition.  Ethereum is increasingly seen as ""THE TECHNOLOGY"", the ability to deliver smart contracts and stable governance.  I think what we are seeing is the beginning of a courtship, and all the relatives, friends and family members are meeting the ""Significant Other"", forming their decisions etc.  Personally - I think the future bride and groom are getting rave reviews at first glance and we could very well be heading for a BIG wedding.

For many months for example any discussions, I repeat ANY discussions (save for breaking news) on bitcoin scaling were relegated (per side bar note) to the sickied post. Please explain why why this was not inhibiting discussion on block size. This rule about scaling in fact was in place during the HK scaling conference (if not the earlier one as well).

To this day, we still have ""Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."" in the side bar. We still don't know what 'overwhelming consensus' is or who is required to give it. It is unclear for example if discussion of Bitpay's median block size scheme would be allowed as I'm not sure if they've specified under what circumstances it would be implemented. Yes I do understand that allowing all kinds of hair-brained consensus changing schemes into the sub would be bad.

So let's see if that has happened or not. Look at the ""Pool Distribution"" section of Blocktrail [here](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC).

When you click on the ""1 month"" tab, Slushpool has 3.78 % of the global hashing power.   
When you click on the ""24 hours"" tab, Slushpool has 2.74 % (4 blocks found) of the global hashing power.

This Reddit post was made only 2 hours ago, so maybe it's too early to tell whether Slushpool has gotten a noticeably increased hashing power or not. But 24 hours after this comment has been written, I'm sure we'll see if the hashing power has changed or not, and we'll be able to conclude whether your hypothesis is correct or not.

RemindMe! 24 hours

Edit1:  
It is now 24 hours later.  
When you click on the ""24 hours"" tab, Slushpool has 6.71 % (10 blocks found) of the global hashing power.  
So their hash power a little more than doubled. Could be simple luck (mining variance), but could also mean that they have gotten a lot more hashing power that's mining through them now.

d1cd20w,Capt_Roger_Murdock,20,"Text of linked comment: 

Am I the only one who hates the phrase “off-chain scaling”? I guess my reaction when I hear that phrase is, well yeah, *of course* Bitcoin can ""scale"" off-chain. If you want to scale to “VISA levels,” and you're willing to do it off-chain, it can be pretty simple. Take the existing VISA infrastructure (or recreate it) and, instead of using it to process fiat-denominated IOUs, use it to process Bitcoin-denominated IOUs. Now obviously the “Bitcoin as settlement network” camp will say: “hey, that’s not fair! We’re not talking about simply recreating the custodial, trust-based credit and banking models of the fiat world in Bitcoin. We're talking about the Lightning Network which uses crypto-magic to enable off-chain transactions while still avoiding centralization and custodial risk. Lightning transactions *are* Bitcoin transactions.”

Well, no. They’re not. I’m far from an expert on the Lightning Network, but as I understand it, the proposal involves the repeated exchange of *unconfirmed, unbroadcast* Bitcoin transactions, i.e. *potential* Bitcoin transactions. Now there are some people who are very excited about the LN’s potential, and there are others who are very skeptical. But for purposes of the point I’m making it doesn’t really matter who’s right. I have no doubt that Bitcoin, by its very nature as an open, extensible network, enables the creation of some really novel, really useful “layer two” solutions (whether or not the LN proves to be one of them). But the fact remains: **when you move transactions to a “layer two” solution, you have – *by definition* – added a layer of risk.** Your layer two solution might be really, really great and a huge improvement over the traditional banking model such that the added layer of risk is relatively thin. And that’s awesome… but it’s still there. So you can’t just say: “who cares if Bitcoin’s layer one is artificially crippled? We’ll just move everything to layer two.” To the extent that on-chain scaling is *artificially* restricted (rather than being constrained only by *technological* limits), there is going to be an *unavoidable* deadweight loss. And all that can do is open the door for Bitcoin’s competitors.

Also, it seems to me that if there *were* no downside to using a “layer two” solution to make a particular payment, if it were really true that “Lightning transactions have the full security of on chain transactions” (as I saw one redditor claim), that would be a very dangerous state of affairs. If everyone could get all of the benefits of an on-blockchain transaction without actually using the blockchain (and thus paying the fees to secure it), that would seem to create a tragedy of the commons.

d1c0iui,ferretinjapan,19,"&gt; There are no more nay sayers at this point and those who opposed Core are long gone, therefore the downward pressure on the price from people selling out of disagreement is decreased. Core still has a roadmap that includes scaling however they are focused at this moment on adding complex solutions to solve simple problems that they keep around. 

Sorry but I disagree, the reason the price will rise is because Bitcoin will still be scarce enough to be valuable, you're not going to see a huge sell off as big block supporters leave, it will simply be a continual trickle (and probably has been for several months now), and will become even scarcer when the halvening occurs, the ""scaling"" improvements are not going to be effective or even work as people will have less and less incentive to use a technology that refuses to give users what they really need. Huge amounts of infrastructure and software is going to be wasted as BSCore tries to completely retool bitcoin for something it was never designed to do.

The price, if it does rise will be short lived and only be because the halving will put upward pressure on buyers as coins become less readily available. After that short honeymoon, Bitcoin's restricted utility will kick in in earnest and the price will begin it's inexorable slide as more and more users find it less and less appealing as a means of transacting, opting instead for other coins. Bitcoin's lifeblood is it's users and treating them like shit in preference of deluded agendas will utterly cripple it's network effect as more and more people become disillusioned by it's lack of utility. Monero, hell even Litecoin, Doge or Ethereum has a far better chance of surviving long term compared to Bitcoin as the developers are actually trying to build something the users WANT, rather than building something the devs THINK the users should use. Not even the sycophant Core fans will find a ""settlement layer"" useful, I guarantee you that.

If Classic fails and the price remains stable, or rises, it will be what I have in the past called the ""boiled frog"" outcome, Core will stumble along for a few more years, utterly naive of the fact that Bitcoin is no longer gaining traction, while it's more concentrated cult screams about how awesome Bitcoin is, buoyed and blinded by their groupthink, they will continue to alienate more and more users, until it slides into irrelevance.

Don't believe me? There are plenty of similar situations where the builders/designers/manufacturers refused to listen to their user base and slowly got superseded, just check out the VHS vs BETA wars.

d1c7nxg,ferretinjapan,11,"To add to my previous comment, Greg thinks that only HE can protect decentralisation, but he's pretty much got it all arse backwards, decentralisation does not create more users, more users create decentralisation.

Case in point, there was a time in Bitcoin's future where decentralisation was non-existent, and Bitcoins were worthless, and it was only because of the, let's call them ""freebies"" from the block reward, that gave users a reason to use Bitcoins, only when user numbers (and thus hashrate) reached a certain level that Satoshi even considered Bitcoin to be ""secure enough"" did Bitcoin even start being functional, it was never functional from get go, it needed people to make it work, and that security only happened because enough people started running wallets/generating coins. Software like segwit and artificial limits doesn't create decentralisation, PEOPLE DO. Greg thinks that decentralisation must be forced into existence, like some kind of police force keeping the peace, but the fact is that decentralisation happens naturally, through network effect. Make Bitcoin useful enough and the urge to add more and more nodes will happen without effort, make Bitcoin more accessible, and more and more businesses/merchants/companies will start running their own nodes because it suddenly becomes a priority in their business dealings, make it cheap and fast and simple to transact, and Bitcoin's competitive qualities will see users come in in droves to use it and the nodes, miners and merchants will see the opportunity to profit from the increased commerce, thus invest in, run, and maintain that infrastructure.

Make it expensive, introduce new middlemen (via LN), add new barriers to entry, essentially do everything Blockstream Core is doing, and that decentralisation that Greg considers so precious, is going to evaporate. And let's be honest, the only reason any of these devs are being arseholes about this is because they have a pet peeve about blockchain bloat that they think is going to make Bitcoin inoperable, which frankly is bullshit. He's not solving anything with his segwit and fee markets, all he is doing is taking away opportunities for real growth because he is petrified that larger blocks will undermine his precious decentralisation, and the qualities that he purportedly values. This is so false it's laughable, the internet has demonstrated it is able to resist censorship, and remain resistant to other attacks, while also being enormous, and that's because it is useful, and everyone uses it, it is literally too big to be centralised, and this is what Bitcoin could have been if it were not for him and his little saboteurs, it could have been an enormous payment network that everyone depended on, and those very people that depended on it would have turned on any government, terrorist organisation, or subversive little group that threatened it.

Instead, he works to keep it tiny, vulnerable and irrelevant. Good job Greg! :)

d1e585i,jstolfi,32,"The greater dishonesty is claiming that a block size limit increase would be a change, whereas the shift to a fee market would not be.

Bitcoin was designed, and explicitly described, as having no effective limit on block size; so that every transaction that paid for its processing cost would be confirmed in the next block.  For that goal to be met, any block size limit in the implementation should be comfortably larger than the peak block size in normal traffic.  For security against spam attacks, any such limit should be many times larger than that.  

That was bitcoin's service model when it was offered to the public in 2009.  That is how it has been until July 2015.  That is how it should be, to be a usable payment system.  If there is a ""social contract"", it should be to keep it working like that: with no effective limit on block size.

Blockstream wants to change bitcoin radically, to a system where blocks have a limited size, set by the developers to be much less than the potential demand; so that users have to compete for space in a running auction, the ""fee market"".  This new service model implies unbounded confirmation delays, higher fees for users, and less revenue for miners.  It also forces users to remain online, checking the progress of their transactions, and issuing replacement transactions when there are unexpected surges of demand.

Blockstream's bosses seem to be convinced that this model is better than Satoshi's; and are determined to impose it on everybody, like it or not.  

AFAIK, this fixed-size model was Greg's idea, and he has stubbornly stuck to it in spite of everybody telling him that it was a totally bad one.  If Greg was honest, he should have tested his idea by creating an altcoin with limited block size and a fee market; and only propose that change of model for bitcoin if and when that test succeeded.  But that would have been too much work and too much time.  Moreover, Greg himself must have realized that no one would use such a coin.  Fully in the spirit of the classical hacker, he did not see anything wrong with ""testing"" his idea by deploying it in bitcoin itself, using all the bitcoin users as ~~guinea pigs~~ alpha testers.

Also in the classical hacker spirit, he never thought it necessary to describe and justify his proposed change to the users, much less seek their approval, before implementing it.  There is still no BIP for the ""fee market"".  That is not surprising: besides being ""unnecessary"" in Greg's view, it would be very hard to write -- especially the ""Expected Benefits and Drawbacks"" section.  

And he could also argue that the ""I"" in BIP stands for ""Improvement"", which the ""fee market"" definitely isn't. 8-P",2016-03-26 22:45:04

What I replied to their PM:

You have factual errors in the text.
1) Blockstream didn't buy any devs. Devs formed Blockstream. Blockstream makes open source software. People choose whether they use it or don't. Bitcoin Core is developed by many people and Blockstream employees are not a majority and they don't choose what is merged.

2) Blockstream pays for key developers, to make open source code. Isn't this a good thing? Nobody works for free and this is like the best possible way - the devs forming the company to pay themselves salary.

3) What do you mean by crippling? To me it looks like they've contributed more than anyone to Bitcoin. Remember libsecp256k1? Segwit? Many many BIPs. What do you mean by that they would gain financial gain from crippling Bitcoin? They have their salaries timelocked tied to Bitcoin. What solution they have that would bring them financial gain, that is not Bitcoin?

4) Blockstream is not forcing people to use the limit. It's just that consensus among community seems to favor the limit. So be it. People like the limit because it secures the decentralization. Decentralization is the reason Bitcoin exists.

5) Not 3 TPS, it is 7 TPS.

6) There are lots of parties developing Lightning Network solutions. At least 3 parties have told about their work publicly. Blockstream pays one developer to dev Lightning network. Lightning network is not a hub-spoke model. Lightning network is open source. It is decentralized, like Bitcoin. There is no central authority to pick fees.

7) Blockstream is not related to bitcointalk.org or r/Bitcoin. Many of them (individuals working for Blockstream and Bitcoin Core) are against some parts of the moderation, especially those parts people claim are censorship.

8) People can discuss these things freely on r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk.org, among all other forums. Only r/btc is getting censored by instant downvotes as they do not fight against the manipulation.

9) Satoshi said whatever he said OVER 5 YEARS AGO. Bitcoin was not a big deal back then. Things change. Current experts know way more than Satoshi did. It's simply because now there's a lot more data and things evolve of course. Also, Satoshi said the limit is required but what Satoshi said doesn't matter at all. We're talking about technical problem here. Doesn't matter who says but what says.

10) Bitcoin Classic is willing to include privacy-invading code changes to their repository.

11) r/Btc censors a lot more discussion than any other Bitcoin discussion board. For example these things I've mentioned here, you would've known if you weren't being censored this stuff. You're being fed the hate, fud and rage and it seems to work. Please understand this.

Examples for improving the protocol?
Segwit isn't ready and when it is ready it is in question if it will activitate. Furthermore, it takes a lot of change in wallets etc. to have any impact.
2 MB blocks are coming at the earliest next year and even this isn't sure anymore. Another year of stagnation..

d1dom8w,coingun,12,"Great question. Much Wow. I'd say Nay because I see a few basic differences between Ethereum and Dash that I will try and convey.

It's seems to me (correct me if I am wrong) that Ethereum is designed as a platform to do whatever you want on. It's focus is on providing the technology layer required to pull off whatever you want through using their tools. It has it's own language (Solidity) it has it's own IDE (Mix) and I have heard it be described as a decentralized computing platform. It let's you develop your own DAO but isn't necessarily a DAO itself. These are all very neat pieces in the crypto puzzle but also requires a bit of a mind shift when preparing to work with it.

Dash on the other hand has focused more on as you quoted it, ""Dash is Bitcoin + some improvements (such as decentralised PoS governance, *instant transactions, and incentivized full nodes*). At least the first versions of Dash that have gotten us to this point. These goals have been quite unique. What started off as just an ability to fix fungibility has grown and adapted into many other ways. Masternode's were originally conceptualized to provide the mixing for Dash's PrivacyProtect (originally DarkSend) but somewhere along the lines the dev's realized that once they had this second layer it was going to be available to do much more then just mix. This is when InstantX came along and then DGBB (Decentalized Governance By Blockchain). Both of these technologies were able to be built on top of the second tier that already existed to allow for PrivacyProtect to work. 

A lot of developers would have stopped there and just sat back and reaped the rewards but instead they went back to the drawing board to start building Dash Evolution. Dash Evolution is going to continue evolving the echo system to attempt to fix a bunch of other problems that many users of Bitcoin have faced.

Included below is our current work on Evolution, the following are also going to be added or improved within the echo system:

* DashDrive – A decentralized shared file system that lives on the second tier network

* DAPI – A decentralized API which allows third tier users to access the network securely

* DashPay Decentralized Wallets – These wallets are light clients connected to the network via DAPI and run on various platforms

* Second Tier – The masternode network, which provides compensated infrastructure for the project

* Budgets – The second tier is given voting power to allocate funds for specific projects on the network via the budget system

* Governance – The second tier is given voting power to govern the currency and chart the course the currency takes

* Quorum Chain – This feature introduces a permanent stable masternode list, which can be used to calculate past and present quorums

* Social Wallet – We introduce a social wallet, which allows friends lists, grouping of users and shared multisig accounts.

A big part of the goals for Evolution is to bring the ability to use crypto to the mainstream. It's going to allow users to forget all the stuff behind the scene's, the complicated need to understand addresses, it's going to create a platform that the average joe can use to exchange funds in a much easier format then has ever been done. I expect once people realize this the cat will finally be out of the bag. Not theorizing here but only talking about stuff that already have completed prototypes that have been demo'd and are actively being finished and readied for production.

Dash can do these things cause it is smaller and has a much easier time adapting to changes and fixing problems but along the way the development of the spork technology and other technologies have also allowed for these things to be tested in a very controlled way. At the same time it has worked to provide it's users a reason for using it or hodling it. Being one of the only crypto's that actually pays a dividend to investors has provided it's users some nice relief from the other options out there. I see a lot of people asking about what news has caused this recent breakout. I don't think it's any news per say but just that people are finally waking up to the fact that the Dash community is much further along the development timeline then a lot of it's competition. The things that others talk about adding we have already added or have been using for months and I think that's what really makes it stand out for me. It's tech isn't just white papers talking about how something could be done a lot of it is actually already deployed on mainnet and working in the wild.

DAO's seem so hot right now, but again this is something brought to you by Dash.

Instead you have a clique of folks who informally hang out on irc, and you can never actually address the substance of ""why"" certain aspects of any roadmap are advisable or not, because for every single item, you have self-proclaimed ""experts"" justifying their advocacy of certain items for potentially radically different reasons.

Back then, while you were declaring that bitcoin was about to go ""moon"", I was posting concerns that interest, investments, and marketability may be lost due to development that was moving too slowly.

**[Chart of the Day](http://imgur.com/imGHpt7)**

This is getting boring.  This is the same chart that I've posted for the past three days.

Consolidation is good.  I guess you could trade it up to $418, sell, and then buy back again at $414.  Because that is what it looks likes its doing for the near future.

To keep from being bored, take a look at these Pnf charts for the Dow, S&amp;P and the VIX.

[Dow, SP, VIX](http://imgur.com/a/PanQ4)

The Dow reversed on its long tail (pole) formation on Friday.  While it dropped fast and turned around and ended just slightly up it still dropped four boxes.  If you shorted I would wait and see what happens on Monday.

The VIX reversed as well.  During the first couple of hours of trading it popped up and then settled down.

The Odd Man Out was the S&amp;P.  It was buoyed pretty well throughout the day.  But it is still a long tail--5 boxes above the breakout.  It is due for a reversal, even if it is a temporary one.

It seems that all of the markets are either waiting for the other shoe to drop, or some signal to race upwards.

Back to bitcoin: in most of the Western Countries I suspect the Easter Weekend to add to the stale market.   Monday is a holiday in many of the Eurozone countries.  

I am assuming that Easter Weekend is not a big deal in China.  If it is, someone please correct me.  I think it will  be interesting to see if thin trading in the west will impact the price when the ""far east"" is awake and doing business.  I think it is an academic curiosity.

I cannot give any guidance at this point.  I seems that it is having a difficult time going one way or the other.

For those ""celebrating"" the Easter Holiday, I hope you have a nice day with family.  For the rest of the world, it is the begining of Spring.  Get started on your gardens.

You don't really have bank accounts with Bitcoin (the closest thing might be using a third party like Coinbase.com). It's better to say you can *be your own bank*, meaning you can control your own money completely. Anyone can use Bitcoin without asking anyone's permission. If the network will process your transaction(s) free, yes, it's free to use Bitcoin. However, as demand grows it's normal to expect some amount of fees for efficient use. 

**2) You can easily and readily convert funds via a credit card into the equivalent bitcoin amount?**

The network and ecosystem are still developing, but for now, yes,  you can usually acquire Bitcoin by credit/debit card with varying degrees of difficulty. Circle and Coinbase are probably the top choices there.

**3) Bitcoins can be converted to USD or any other currency denominations on demand right? So in essence, short-term trading (or even day trading) is possible?**

Bitcoins can be converted into whatever someone is willing to give you for them. At present there are many exchanges which offer many exchange options, including into other crypto and national currencies. So yes day trading is possible. Be careful, though. There are two big potential pitfalls. First, multiple exchanges in the past have vanished taking all user coins with them. Keep balances not directly under your control (on a device or wallet you control, e.g. [Trezor](http://bitcointrezor.com/) ) to minimums.

The truth is that bitcoin service quality has been falling for months as fees increase and the network becomes unreliable.

This is like operating a movie theater.  Movie theaters are a simple business to operate and have low risk because they have few upfront costs, but they are almost entirely dependent on the studios to produce good content.  When their ""product"" is bad, they make less money through no fault of their own, and the studios won't listen to them to make different movies.

In this case, Coinkite is seeing the product they offer becoming less valuable and they can't do anything about it.  They are making less money because they can't pass fees onto the customer, and the transactions they do send are less reliably processed.  The number of customer service requests from people complaining about why the merchant didn't receive their bitcoins yet goes up, further increasing their costs.  Customers leave due to the delays.

A secondary reason for this failure is that even if they managed to capture 100% of all the wallets in existence, they still are limited because there are only so many people who can use bitcoin in its current state.  Businesses need to grow to survive.  With no growth, eventually, their labor costs would grow due to increasing salaries and they would fail.

There are now basically 2-4 different development efforts to address block size. The first one is Core, which is basically the original devs and code from Bitcoin just continuing along with conservative changes (no hard-forks). The next most significant is Classic which seeks to hard fork the block size up to 2MB and includes original devs Gavin and Jeff Garzik as part of that team and effort. The company BitPay is also pushing its own solution of an ""adaptive"" block size. Coinbase recently hinted at getting more involved in direct code based influence over Bitcoin as well.

It remains to be seen how the block size issue will ultimately be resolved, whether Core can maintain its dominant share of users making up the network and opting for its software. I suspect they'll see more pressure as block congestion worsens. Meanwhile Ethereum has been on fire in terms of price recently (I'm talking under $1 to over $10 in weeks).

All sites are biased to some extent. Bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it, r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org are controlled by a single individual u/theymos, who uses his influence to steer the community opinion towards favoring Bitcoin Core. You can read his ""confession"" here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1182118.0

r/btc and bitcoin.com were strengthened by the backlash caused by censorship (or moderation as they like to call it) on above sites so the majority bias here is opposite. 

However all opinions about the direction of Bitcoin are allowed here and supporting Core won't get your posts removed.

&gt;Is there an elite group reaping all the benefits?

Some people have blamed Blockstream, a company which pays many of the Core developers for directing the development towards goals favorable to them. 

I think it's more likely that many Core developers genuinely think that moving Bitcoin blockchain towards settlement only layer is the best option. Some people (including the majority here at r/btc) don't share this view because they see it infringing the social contract outlined by the Bitcoin whitepaper, which describes Bitcoin as ""electronic p2p cash"".

brilliant video.

Sure a smart contract is not worth the effort in your case.  In fact, it is probably totally unnecessary as you trust your sponsor (that they will pay) and the sponsor trusts you (that you will apply a discount or a refund if not enough views are reached).  The reason is that both you and the sponsor have a reputation at stake, and your reputation (that you carefully built in order to attract more viewers and sponsors) is way more worth than that one discount/refund.

On the other hand:

Even though you found it troublesome, I was surprised it was that easy already.  I did quite some fiddling with the Mist beta version before I understood how to load and bookmark a dApp.

Now imagine the possibilities this gives.  The bespoke contract that was written for you can probably be reused by lots of Youtube content creators.  It's there already, for free, available to everyone!  It (or maybe a bit generalised form) makes it possible to create a market, where content creators and sponsors meet, without even knowing each and trusting each other.  

The contract could be extended with several platforms, not only youtube, and and several types of agreements (gradual payouts, different metrics...).  And even several ""oracles"" (the role Oraclize.it plays).

It will make it possible for starting vodcasters and starting sponsors (neither of whom have a reputation at stake yet) to engage the other side without risk: the sponsor coughs up enough to finance the initial production cost, the rest of the sponsor money is locked in a contract and will only be paid when expectations are met or automatically refunded  otherwise (so their risk is limited to the initial amount).  On the other hand, _if_ contract conditions are met, as observed by one or more automated third parties, then payment for the content creator is _guaranteed_.  This is the type of agreements smart contracts make possible, without needing lawyers or financial background checks.

The power of Ethereum is, that you can always build on what other people have built before you.  This contract could become a component that is being reused in lots of other applications.

Interfaces will improve too.  Hopefully we'll soon have light clients, which make it a lot easier, the same way Electrum is a lot easier than the Bitcoin core full client.

Thanks for pioneering!",2016-03-29 06:35:03

That did not last long.  I wrote yesterday that it did not feel right, and lo and behold it reversed overnight.  We reversed back into a column of Os.  In order to reverse back into the Xs we need to surpass $420.  Again.  This is getting tedious.

So, the reversal to Xs would be at $420.  The next break out point is at any price above $430.

This formation is now ten columns wide.  I think our post 2013 max is something like 12 columns wide.  So, this is a rare consolidation forming.

The breakdown price remains at any6 police under $390.  The overall trend is still positive, with a reversal happening at any price under $405.

So, what do I think?  I think we are in this $420-$410 range for a while to come.  There doesn’t seem to be any conviction in either the bitcoin world or the stock markets.

Time will tell, as it usually does.

d1k6ytq,LovelyDayHere,21,"__The SegWit activation process is not compliant to BIP9__ as described [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki#States). It introduces a secondary, lower threshold (currently said to be 75%) which is not featured in the BIP9 process. As you can clearly see by looking at BIP9's [state diagram](http://i.imgur.com/FNfRPnh.png) - there is only one ""threshold"" which is supposed to activate a soft-fork.

The activation processes of BIP9-compliant soft-forks, which you can see explained [here for CSV](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4cmsji/csv_softfork_is_merged_to_bitcoin_core/d1k4njz), does not feature mysterious secondary thresholds. CSV proceeds according to the BIP9 described 95% activation threshold.

The question is:  why does SegWit deviate from the accepted BIP9 procedure?

EDIT: So we have to take into account that the SegWit BIP141 is still 'Draft', and states ""This BIP is to be deployed by version-bits BIP9. __Exact details TDB.__"" The previous version of the draft had the 75%/95% thresholds, which is why a lot of people - even Core supporters - still think that SegWit will activate *something* at less than 95%. There is no good reason for the 'TBD' part, if the deployment proceeds according to BIP9 (i.e. 95%). It should be removed asap from the BIP to assert full BIP9 compliance.",2016-03-31 16:58:00

You're looking at some bitcoin/digital version of it. So it will likely involve a digital membership (like a subscription or or a digital product) and an invoice system that is bitcoin compatible. Then on paper you make it look like your shitty digital product $250 only bitcoins accepted is selling for $10k+ a week in sales.

d1k9bkn,seweso,17,"I shall play the devil's advocate: Imaging you belief 1) that the only way to really scale Bitcoin is with off chain solutions like Lightning, 2) that Bitcoin would slowly kill itself by centralisation when it scales too much with on-chain transactions, 3) that currently most transactions are spam and 4) that a significant number of nodes will not or cannot upgrade anytime soon. Then obviously you want to enable off-chain scaling ASAP. It would not make sense to do any Hardfork as this would open the door for more on-chain scalability and would surely delay real scalability solutions. 

If you assume they belief the things they say, then their actions make technical sense. It is not necessarily too complicated. And it is not like accelerating development is a bad thing by itself. It is hard to argue with people who think higher fees and forcing people into SegWit are both very good things. 

Blockstream is the result of these beliefs, not the other way around. So even though it is nice to be mad at one single entity, in reality it's just not that simple. And we all look stupid with our Blockstream conspiracy theories, and we should focus on their flawed beliefs, and authoritarian leadership (which goes against the spirit of Bitcoin itself).

We would all be better off if we make sure SegWit is the best it can be. If we promote it's adoption, we make it less dangerous ...

SegWit is about fixing some other things, and claims to bring a small improvement to the effective block size, but it's not really a scaling solution. It's principal benefit is to enable some features which the Lightning Network needs.

This thread is about whether introducing SegWit in a particular way is a good idea. There are many who claim it would be much simpler, safer and cleaner to implement it as a hard fork.

Humans have this weird thing about passwords. They won't enter or type them when other humans are looking but will enter them without hesitation around a cat.

Learn his banking, social media, email and other passwords. Cats can easily type on a device left open or even just out. 

Breakup with his girlfriend, just after he fell asleep, do this by hitting on girls publicly on twitter and making it easy to see the results of searching dating websites. Scaring away his friends and coworkers should start now too.

Destroy his credit, transfer some money to secret accounts you open, like bitcoin exchanges (it is easy to get a fake account). His reduced money will cause him to miss payments. Miss enough and payday loans happen. A secret credit card or two in his name will advance it rapidly.

Use some of the money to order weed and booze on the internet. At first their might be questions but someone who just lost their money, girlfriend and job will need any emotional support they can get. You know emails describing how you slept with your boss's wife cannot be unsent. If he already drinks and smokes he might not notice his increased supply.

Leave subtle messages around. Books about suicide on the coffee table. Leave the TV on and have Netflix highlighting a drama where the main character dies in the end. Have imaginary finds on Facebook, or whatever, say they just want it to all end. Provide or fabricate stories and examples about. How much better his family will be without him.

In his name send emails, texts and do other things asking for money from his family. They will either distance themselves or provide token support to someone once so independent, but now hurting only on the inside.

Make life insurance forms available and easy for him to complete indicating his mother, father and siblings could use the money. And as long as he is there drinking he is wasting their time and causing pain.

I as the cat would have some freedom to be creative at this stage. Depending on the specific human different would be required, but all humans have emotional weaknesses and who suspects the cat.
