czill1r,justusranvier,35,"By the way, this has been the threat hanging over the heads of anyone who dares to use an alternatives to Bitcoin Core, since 2013:

http://pastebin.com/4BcycXUu

&gt;If I were the US Government and had co-opted the ""core"" Bitcoin dev team, you know what I'd do? I'd encourage ground-up alternate implementations knowing damn well that the kind of people dumb enough to work on them expecting to create a viable competitor anytime soon aren't going to succeed. Every time anyone tried mining with one, **I'd use my knowledge of all the ways they are incompatible to fork them, making it clear they can't be trusted for mining**. Then I'd go a step further and ""for the good of Bitcoin"" create a process by which regular soft-forks and hard-forks happened so that Bitcoin can be ""improved"" in various ways, maybe every six months. Of course, I'd involve those alternate implementations in some IETF-like standards process for show, but all I would have to do to keep them marginalized and the majority of hashing power using the approved official implementation is **slip the odd consensus bug into their code**; remember how it was recently leaked that the NSA spends $250 million a year on efforts to insert flaws into encryption standards and commercial products. With changes every six months the alts will never keep up. Having accomplished political control, the next step is pushing the development of the Bitcoin core protocol in ways that further my goals, such as scalability solutions that at best allow for auditing, rather waiting until protocols are developed, tested, and accepted by the community that support fully decentralized mining.

Since Bitcoin Core isn't encouraging alternate implementations, we're safe, right?

No, not really. What jdillon did here is give the other participants in that thread the precise formula for obtaining total political control over Bitcoin, and just phrased it in a way that the people implementing it can claim to be protecting us from it. (Is that mention of millions of dollars a subtle bribe? Inquiring minds would like to know)

And they've used this formula. Ever since 2013, Bitcoin Core developers have been mentioning about those two bolded techniques any time somebody talks about alternate implementations (nice full node implementation in Go you have there. Sure would be a shame if something were to happen to it).

They achieved the political control described in that paragraph simply by using the tactics pre-emptively and openly.

Now that they have it, they use their deep knowledge of the code as a threat to intimidate miners and businesses who are considering alternatives to Bitcoin Core.

Everybody knows that Bitcoin Core developers are malicious, vindictive, and highly skilled.

This is why the mining pools are hesitant to switch to Bitcoin Classic even though they clearly indicated that they know Bitcoin Core is not acting in their interests.

As soon as the rest of the network begins to transition, Bitcoin Core developers will launch an all-out attack on anyone and everyone who tries to escape their control.

This is the fire Bitcoin has to pass through in order to prove that it can't be taken over by malicious developers. If we can't do it, then the assertion that Bitcoin is anti-fragile is falsified.",2016-02-01 00:00:17

cziltmc,awemany,27,"Along these lines: I remember reading an early version of the client's code (~ around 0.3.0) and feeling that I grasped it fully. Ok, to actually start developing on it would have probably taken me a couple more weeks and (as usual) running into oddities that are not obvious from reading the code, but I was confident that I understood the full structure and where things where.

Reading it now, I feel it is harder to grasp and bigger and not necessarily more readable. For example, main.cpp got larger and messier IMO.

Some of that are surely the warts of Bitcoin growing up (such as a couple of odd transactions that are referenced directly in the code).

But some of it seems to be using a style that doesn't really make the code clearer but rather seems to be about shifting stuff around.

I am not even saying that  some of the criticism regarding Satoshi's style is pointless.

But I'd still say that our supposed elite wizards of Bitcoin are not really that excellent as they like to refer to themselves at writing very clean code or cleaning it up. For anyone doubting this, look at what the btcd team did and compare!

/u/jstolfi's characterization of them being hackers comes to mind. I rather think there might be another reason for the code being like it is, a reason that is *not* underestimating the professionalism of the core devs.

5.) The fork starts

6.) With the support of a large part of the users, of the miners and of exchanges and payment providers the fork is successfull

7.) Some core-developers change to classic

8.) some core-developers say: ""My solution or nothing"" and change the algorithm. That new core/pwc-coin will be one of the top-10-altcoins

9.) Lessons learned: 

- a small group of developers that is in some strange ways affiliated with two companies (blockstream/pwc) can't force bitcoin in an unwished economic change. 

- The Nakamoto consensus works in regard to protect the network from being captured by some decelopers

- Bitcoin is stronger than before. Price finally rises to new hights.

&gt;All that said, I do cringe just a little at the over-simplification of the video...  and worry a bit that in a couple years it will be clear that 2mb or 10mb or whatever is totally safe relative to all concerns— perhaps even mobile devices with tor could be full nodes with 10mb blocks on the internet of 2023, and by then there may be plenty of transaction volume to keep fees high enough to support security—  and **maybe some people will be dogmatically promoting a 1MB limit because they walked away from the video thinking that 1MB is a magic number rather than today's conservative trade-off**.  200,000 - 500,000 transactions per day is a good start, indeed, but I'd certainly like to see Bitcoin doing more in the future.  ... But I suppose the community can work on educating people about that them with concrete demonstrations.

czjjo7o,long-lostfriend,17,"We used to talk a lot about ""being your own bank"" here before the block size debates started monopolizing the threads. It is a feature, not a bug; and I have fully endorsed the principle of controlling the keys for your cryptocurrency.

I still do, even when it costs me personally. Today, I accidentally sent 0.7 BTC worth of a Counterparty asset to an address owned by Coinbase. For those of you not in the know, Counterparty is a platform that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the ledgers for CP tokens are derived from data embedded in the transaction data of bitcoin transactions.

Long story short: I would need the private key to that single address (containing nothing at this point but the dust needed to make the underlying BTC transaction happen) in order to sweep those assets back into my Counterparty wallet. Due to Coinbase's security, it looks like that will be impossible. Therefore, those tokens are effectively out-of-reach until the end of time.

Two lessons to be learned from this: 

1. The fuck-up is mine. I have no one to blame for this but myself. It is no one's job to bail me out of my own lack of paying attention to what I was doing. This is the reality of the new crypto economy, and the bottom line is that I need to be more careful in the future

2. For all of the frequent ""Coinbase hating"" that goes on here, their inability to help me is a testament to their high security standards.

czj1jdm,Gobitcoin,16,"&gt;Roll out a hard fork that increases the maximum block size, and implements a rule to increase that size over time, very similar to the rule that decreases the block reward over time.

&gt; Choose the initial maximum size so that a “Bitcoin hobbyist” can easily participate as a full node on the network. By “Bitcoin hobbyist” I mean somebody with a current, reasonably fast computer and Internet connection, running an up-to-date version of Bitcoin Core and willing to dedicate half their CPU power and bandwidth to Bitcoin.

&gt; And choose the increase to match the rate of growth of bandwidth over time: 50% per year for the last twenty years. Note that this is less than the approximately 60% per year growth in CPU power; bandwidth will be the limiting factor for transaction volume for the foreseeable future.

&gt; I believe this is the “simplest thing that could possibly work.” It is simple to implement correctly and is very close to the rules operating on the network today. Imposing a maximum size that is in the reach of any ordinary person with a pretty good computer and an average broadband internet connection eliminates barriers to entry that might result in centralization of the network.

&gt;Once the network allows larger-than-1-megabyte blocks, further network optimizations will be necessary. This is where Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables or (perhaps) other data synchronization algorithms will shine.

Oh I guess they'll just keep their bitcoins instead of converting. Hmm maybe not, since literally no sensible retailer or business person is going to risk their profit, or even worse; a loss, due to bitcoin volatility.

So what are we left with? No miners, no hardware manufacturers, no exchanges, no retailers, no security and probably no users because of a plummeting price. At least you'll be able to run your useless valueless network on your shitty Internet connection though right?

What I can't understand Luke is how someone who has been a part of the bitcoin community for as long as me (and possibly longer) could possibly say the things you have been saying, and seriously mean them. This isn't bitcoin and you know it's not. It's not what's set out in the whitewater, it's not what has ever been conceived to have been bitcoin until very recently.

If you really want to make a new governance and consensus model why don't you make an altcoin or Sidechain for it instead of co-opting? That's a serious question by the way.",2016-02-02 13:22:56
czkq90f,Yorn2,24,"Make no mistake, this disagreement on block size is only a temporary distraction, but it is a discussion that needs to be had, regardless of how short-term painful it is. When this is over, it'll be important to crush the private blockchain nonsense the bankers are working on.

Like the above poster, I'm an early adopter (late 2010) who is not great with code. I understand enough to follow the new concepts that come along, such as segregated witness, and what Mircea Popescu has recently covered. I continue to hold just like everyone else and don't buy the fantasized argument of Blockstream owning everything.

I think Reddit is particularly horrible at supporting conversations that need more than a minute's consideration. 

I don't want to be rich, at least, not anymore. That was never the intention of buying into Bitcoin over five years ago now (it's crazy to think it's been so long, actually). I saw Bitcoin as something that really did look like the science fiction version of ""credits"" that was in all the movies and books I read as a teen. I thought the world HAD to eventually switch to such a system of storing wealth and the mathematical concepts at the time just blew my mind as well as the peer to peer distribution. This was a trust model that worked! Surely it was worth a few bucks to try it...

But underneath that joy of finding something amazing, I'm also quite upset. I want to wake up the public to how they've been duped by fiat and a system that perpetrates cronyism. I want to destroy everything that the to-big-to-fail banks in the US have guiled the American public into buying. I'm perfectly happy watching the price of Bitcoin sit still or even fall if it means these bastards will lose their jobs in five to ten years. I can endure the growing pains and disagreements for years if needs be.

It's unfortunate we need a threat like Bitcoin to actually get some accountability back in place when it comes to our finances, regardless of country of origin. No one lost their jobs in 2008, that's probably the surest sign something like Bitcoin *has* to succeed.",2016-02-02 15:04:05
czkwgvs,awemany,24,"Greg, this whole discussion of LN now is *all besides the point*.

A working LN is still vaporware. We are likely going to have bigger blocks soon, and as soon as you are out of the path of blocking decisions on blocksize, you'll see that a) Bitcoin will still work and b) you'll not get as much heat for investigating LN.

Again: You get heat for LN only because you are selling us vaporware for a solution and you are working on messing with the economics of Bitcoin, creating the problem in the first place.

But you know that as well as we do.

I am actually curious whether Blockstream will continue working on LN even when we have an open-ended blocksize limit.

czk11uf,DeftNerd,21,"No problem!

And to extend the metaphor a bit, in the US there are mass transit options that use the existing road network. They often aren't very popular and often need government subsidies to stay funded. The places that mass transit does work is places where the road network cannot get anywhere near supporting the needs of everyone having their own car. 

In Bitcoin, this can be seen as LN/Sidechains not likely to succede on their own unless there are so many transactions that they simply cannot be supported by the network. In order to encourage the LN/Sidechains growth, they're preventing the enhancement and growth of the core network so people will have to choose between a sub-optimal direct transaction or the LN/Sidechains mass-transaction solution. 

This is also the crux of the blocksize debate. 

If you're a city, do you add on to the road infrastructure when the population explodes, or do you let private drivers suffer and give them more mass transit opportunities. You could even financially hit people that don't want to use mass transit. (SegWit is intended to make LN transactions cheaper to process, and the fee market is meant to be like London's vehicle congestion tax)

Personally, I think mass transit makes more sense, but people often like the freedom that a personal vehicle gives them and get angry at being forced to give up their car and use mass transit even if its better for the common good. 

As logical as LN/Sidechains might be, it's a solution that will bring about a LOT of anger and people feeling like their freedoms being taken away or they're being gouged financially to express that freedom.",2016-02-02 04:26:01

czk2ad0,nullc,20,"&gt; Bitcoin was designed as a protocol to define consensus as the longest chain.

This is simply untrue.  The longest chain mechanism is used to provide ordering _within_ a set of autonomously validated rules.

Bitcoin could have been designed as a system where the miners control everything-- but it wasn't. Much of the complexity in the system comes from not doing that, and no version of Bitcoin (even the pre-release alpha) worked that way.  ... nor would it be desirable: Would you want to use a system whos every property was subject to the whim of a set of self-selecting parties?

In an ideal world -- we wouldn't need mining and every property of the system would be decided autonomously. This isn't possible; so mining is used for that one part that can't be decided autonomously, but nothing else. And mining is kept honest by the myriad constraints that limit the ways in which its abuse could be profitably exploited.",2016-02-02 04:54:23

That's **93** people. And only **7** of those [work for Blockstream](https://www.blockstream.com/team/). 

&gt; Things like RBF which was NACKed by many developers, still got pushed through.

RBF was proposed and developed by [David A. Harding and Peter Todd](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki), neither of whom work for Blockstream, please get your facts straight. 

&gt; Meanwhile, a blocksize increase has been suggested and advocated by many developers, and has been rejected by the blockstream corporation.

A block size increase hasn't been rejected. A better, safer alternative was proposed that gave more than just a capacity bump, giving more time to develop scalability improvements such as weak blocks and IBLT, before an actual hard fork capacity increase would be needed. 

&gt; Competitions are more efficient than monopolies. I'll choose competition any day of the week.

Me too, but it should be competition between ideas, judged by those that are *capable of doing so*. Not the unwashed masses that don't bother informing themselves and give preference to solutions that solve their immediate perceived problems instead of looking further into the future and choosing the path that will ultimately solve the problems for good.

Banks won't mention it out loud but behind the scenes Bitcoin terrifies them, but they will continue their bravado and pretend they are on top of things. Those internally to their corporate structure won't mention Bitcoin or suggest anything truly disruptive as that goes against corporate culture and being on the radar of someone senior to them that might endanger the position they have climbed a ladder for.

They will have their own disputes amongst institutions in whatever non-blockchain permissioned 21st century database they intend to 'share' with eachother.

So the answer to all this is remain level headed, stay calm, really there is no rush. The right answer will surely release the breaks on this sideways trend, the wrong will do worse.

Fact is in an industry (the Bitcoin industry) where we have created hardware in months that consumer ready would take years, to the extreme of silicon tech, where more innovation has been seen in 7 than decades the banks have had, Bitcoin lives dogs years.

czluw9y,Cryptolution,35,"&gt; Sound the alarm, fees are a penny more than $0.05!

This whole mocking people because they want to see bitcoin grow and not be stagnated as a settlement layer is really a poor attitude.

I understand that people are hard at work creating layer2 services that will *eventually* bring micro transactions to fruition. But there has not been a single valid argument today by *any* core developer as to why a 2mb blocksize would create any negative impact on the network. And dont anyone dare try to spout this hardfork BS. The network has had consensus for a long time now and no where in that majority consensus is there any *fear* to be rattled about theoretical nonsense of network splits.

What we have seen, is core developers (gmaxwell) outright state that the intention is to create a fee market, which is the role of a economic adviser instead of a developer. Something gmaxwell has no right to dictate, being the excellent  and well deserved and respected cryptographer he is. 

As pressure is building the valve to release it is too slow in the coming and not fast enough. A few developers were fighting *hard* for a bump over a year ago, while the rest stagnated. While I dont agree with raising the limit more than a 1 or 2mb, I still think they had the right vision and perspective, that the limit needed to be raised 6 months ago, not 6 months - 12 months from now.

czlwhxn,Cryptolution,19,"&gt; And they are already doing 2MB via Segwit, whats the issue?

Its been beat to death already. That you act like you still dont know the facts is not cool. I see you post a lot so im sure you've read the facts many times.

At most we will see 1.7mb increase when *everyone* utilizes SW style tx's (for non-P2SH tx's, which is 90+% of the current usage). This is assuming 100% adoption. Assuming 100% adoption is irrational and even the core dev's are not doing that. Call it excessive exuberance if you would like, either way its a fantasy to think that we can go into 100% adoption short term. The same developers cry wolf over hard forks even with 90% of the community already reaching consensus on a 2mb upgrade, so to go the opposite and to claim that we can achieve a majority switchover on not just node software, but all software *makers* themselves short term is nothing more than a fantasy pumpers dream. 
 
There has been analysis done from many well respected members of the community, and even sipa said himself on IRC that short term he agreed with the analysis that we could be as low as 1.3.... not 1.7 and definitely NOT 2mb. We would only see 2mb with higher utilization of P2SH, which there is no economic catalyst for so there is not much reason we should see any dramatic increase in the utilization of P2SH, as big as a fan as I am of the technique. 

1.3 is just *not enough* considering we are already peaking and tx load is increasing steadily. Im not running around screaming fire. No one is on fire. But we will be in a very short while and while core developers are great at developing technology, they have stated it is not their position to dictate economic policy.

By refusing to release the pressure when this issue has been beat to death they are playing economic policy dictators.

That is *not* cool.

And dont try to bandwagon or create camps over the issue. Im pro-SW and its wonderful and I cant wait to see it intergrated in bitcoin. But short term its not the pressure release we need. There's literally been zero evidence provided for negative consequences for a 2mb upgrade, the issue has been debated to death and nothing has come  out other than fear mongering over HF network splits, which *wont happen with a economic and market majority already declaring consensus for 2mb*.",2016-02-03 13:14:27

czlzbyv,Ilogy,15,"&gt; his opinion on blocksize to me seems to align with a more banker-ish point of view in that the bitcoin blockchain should be a settlement layer as opposed to a payment system

When people say they don't want Bitcoin to be a settlement layer, they are saying they don't want bitcoin to be money, because money and the instrument to settle debts are the same thing. Amir understands this. 

A payment network, on the other hand, transfers value via credit, not money. Credit is essentially a promise to settle using money later. Since a promise requires no actual exchange of a tangible asset, it can be communicated much more quickly and therefore makes for a more effective medium for easy payments. Credit cards allow us to make purchases digitally, despite the fact that our base currency is still made out of paper, because we aren't actually transferring money, we are transferring the promise to pay money at a later date. Most of our ""money"" today is actually just credit, and that is why, in my opinion, the monetary systems around the globe are in such trouble. 

The main difficulty with credit is that it relies on trust. For something to be an effective money, you must minimize trust from the equation. Gold was a good money because there wasn't much trust required. For bitcoin, reliance on trust is kept minimum through decentralization. If the system is effectively decentralized, the creditworthiness of the system as a whole is all that matters, as opposed to individuals actors or players in charge of the system. 

It seems to me that big block advocates in this whole debate don't really seem to care about Bitcoin as money. They don't fear the particular type of centralization pressures raising the block size would cause because they don't see the problem in bitcoin losing its status as money. They see the idea of bitcoin as settlement layer as something negative because they don't view bitcoin as an instrument to settle debts. They view it as a new way of transferring wealth that is somehow superior to existing credit services and they fear without an expanding block size it won't be able to compete with those services.

Put simply, big blockers imagine bitcoin as credit. Small blockers imagine it as money. And that is the heart of the whole debate. ",2016-02-03 14:51:47

If someone can place Bitcoin in danger or exploit Bitcoin, then it *will be* placed in danger and exploited because it is possible to do so. If something has the potentiality of ruining Bitcoin, then it will happen sooner or later.

Such is the nature of exploits. Those who would seek to exploit will sooner or later find the weakness and turn a simple cut into a festering wound.

What we are experiencing right now, with Blockstream taking over, is a big experiment. If we succeed with a fork, then Bitcoin has thwarted yet another of its attackers. If we fail, well then we found Bitcoin's vulnerability-- centralized development and purchasable devs.

Even though you and I can see the solution is as simple as adopting a new software version and forking, if this doesn't happen, then the social/development aspect of Bitcoin failed and has been successful exploited.

It would be ironic that of all the hackers who have tried to technologically exploit Bitcoin and failed, the simple use of fiat money could buy the exploit in the form of ethically compromised developers. Far cheaper than a 51% attack.

czmbtkc,maaku7,35,"They are mutually exclusive, right now. We had a series of data-driven open workshops exploring this question, and the clear result was that the network can't currently handle more than about 2MB block sizes at this point in time and retain its adversarial protections.

Now if you look to the Core roadmap you'll see a number of research directions mentioned (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks) which are expected to increase capacity. The plan, put simply, is this: use the existing excess capacity to deploy segwit; concurrently research and deploy IBLT, weak blocks, and various other network layer improvements; measure and verify that these technologies have in fact at least doubled the available capacity; deploy a block size increase fork. It is most likely that around this time next year we should be working out the details of a 2MB hard fork on top of the already deployed segwit code.

If I were a betting man, that's the outcome I'd put my money on. But the philosophy of Core is conservative, and we do not feel that we should be betting with the entire Bitcoin economy by committing to a 2MB hard fork in addition to segwit and setting dates before we have even developed and tested the technology that would make it safe to do both. The scenario I outlined above is the most probable outcome with what we know today, but there are known unknowns and probably unknown unknowns that could  interfere with such a schedule. We _think_ that the network could support another doubling after mitigating the effects of the Great Firewall. We _think_ that a combination of IBLT and weak blocks will be able to do that, although no concrete proposal exists as yet. We _think_ that deployment of these technologies will be all that is required to achieve the next level of scale. We think. But all of that is untested, and it would be irresponsible and reckless of us to commit to such an outcome before we actually did our homework.

_Right now_, we are only certain that the network could be safely made to support double its present on-chain capacity with either a 2MB hard-fork or segwit deployment. Of these, segwit is the obvious clear winner as it brings other scaling benefits as well. So we can commit to a schedule for that and do our best to meet that deployment schedule. We have also identified the problems that we believe are holding us back from a further doubling, and possible solutions to those problems which require more research. We can commit to doing the proper research in a timely fashion, and hope that deployment of that technology leads to another capacity doubling.

cznbyic,Paco_Smithereens,33,"Well, much as with ratios on trackers today, pirated games were basically currency.

Sometimes you needed a reference to get on these -- this is different from a tracker invite in that the person offering it to you was expected to sort of vouch for you.  You'd sometimes even be asked that during the application process -- who do you know?

One of the things, especially about single line boards in the 80s, was if you were spending a lot of time on the system, you were tying it up for other people.  So leeching and ratios were heavily policed (where not enforced by the software itself.)

One day a guy from a big Commodore pirating group called FBR dialed into my board (guy named Oahawhool).  My board was really discussion-heavy; politics and stuff.  Lots of people using real names.  He dug what I was doing and I think I broke into chat with him.  We talked awhile and I was really impressed he was from FBR but explained as much I liked games, I didn't have anything new enough to breathe that rareified air.   We rode our bikes to meet -- he was in the next town over (that surprised me), and he gave me a bunch of disks with basically 0 day games on them, along with a bunch of leech credits on his board.  The closest thing to compare it to would be given access to a topsite.

Another thing he did was invited me along on an Alliance Teleconference which were these international voice party lines (conference calls) where pirate and demo sceners would get together for a big international chat.  We take that for granted now - *big fucking deal in those days* given the cost of long distance on land lines, and especially international teleconferences over copper.  I remember being in awe of everyone on it.  Guys from really famous groups like [TRIAD](http://www.triad.se/) were on, all European accents and all.  This was *mindblowing.*  I don't know what happened to Oahawhool or why he was so nice to me, but...thanks for the memories (and all the FBR cracks -- anyone with a Commodore had at least one, as well.)  Out of my league, all those guys, but cool as hell to get invited in for a peek.

Speaking of which, another kind of big deal were codes -- ""phreaking"" as a term generally covered these although phreaking was actually different -- that was manipulation of phone lines with tones.  Phreaks tended to look down, justifiably, on coders.  Phreaking was real hacking and exploring the world's telephone networks.  Codes were just stealing phone calls.  But for a lot of us, all we wanted were free phone calls anyway -- mainly to call boards out of state or overseas just to see what the rest of the world was like.

Codes were sort of like calling cards.  People would set up their systems to hammer on systems like Metrofone (Metrophone?) which took six digit codes (950-xxxx).  Once you had that code you could dial out from that account long distance, where it would be billed back to the poor account holder (I'm sure they were never forced to pay those bills.  God I hope not, anyway.)

Instead, people would set their code hackers - similar to wardialers, really - to just try them at random until one got through.  Often this was left to run overnight and while you were at school.  You'd come home and have maybe half a dozen to a dozen, and you could trade lists of working codes for other things online.

Carding is also pretty old but most people I knew stayed away from it.  If you were 15 or 16 years old, the question was always where were you going to send shit to once you ordered it with your card. A lot of people just really needed a [Lt. Kernal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lt._Kernal) or a [1581](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1581) and risked sending it right to their own house.  Of all of the illegal activity on boards back then, carding was the riskiest, and I knew several people who got caught doing it -- All sysops!  Hardware was not cheap.

Coding could get you caught, as could wardialing (dialing random numbers in an exchange to look for computers, as in Wargames.)  Whether you got caught wardialing depended in some sense on what phone company you had and whether they had processes running to detect it.

I did this inconsiderately, without mercy, and routinely in my area and never had a problem although to be honest I regret doing it just in terms of all of the people it bothered.

The other thing which might be of interest was platform partisanship.  It was almost like biker gangs, where Apple, Commodore, and Atari people sort of had their own boards, and often talked shit about other platforms.  Sometimes this would turn into stupid adolescent wars.

To some extent, this was because of competing character sets (PETSCII, ANSI, ATASCII).  While almost all software could support plain ASCII to allow people to call from any platform, a lot of effort went into the color and graphics of a board.

This ""platformism"" became less important over time as it became clear that everything was going to die except for IBM compatibles and Macs.  But for awhile, it was a pretty stupid way of dividing ourselves up into factions.

Of course, one of the most fondly remembered cultural expressions of the time was the g-phile or text file.  The best archive of these is still available for browsing at Jason Scott's excellent [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com).

The value of these could not be overstated for a few reasons.  First - at least to me - Unix systems were esoteric and mysterious.  These, along with networks of the time (like TELENET -- this has nothing to do with TELNET) and peculiar systems of the time, were inscrutable unless you could get some information on how to get around.   Text files often provided this information to people used to 8 bit computers with bitty, barely adequate operating systems.

But beyond that -- you're 15 or 16 years old.  You live on a cul de sac in a subdivision in the suburbs (in fact you may well have looked exactly like the kid in the [Subdivisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYYdQB0mkEU) video.)

It's summer and everyone else is at camp.  All the boards are busy.  You feel like you need something to take the edge off the summer.

I'm talking about *BOMBS AND HOMEMADE INCENDIARY DEVICES MADE WITH FUCKING DISH SOAP AND TURPENTINE AND SHIT.*  It is amazing just how much time was spent writing up Anarchist Cookbook-like recipes for mayhem (with, as you might predict, similar safety and reliability.)  The Poor Man's James Bond.  Jolly Roger.  Transcribing anything you could order from Delta Press (and everyone I knew got the eagerly awaited Delta Press catalog.)

I distinctly remember a warm summer day in New Jersey by the Delaware River.  It was the sort of day when you eat a lot of popsicles, and the fireflies come out, and you notice you can see more stars than usual.  Around you is the smell of grills and cut grass.

So of course you gotta make yourself some **FUCKING NAPALM.**  And that's what we did.  We'd use spoons to fling it across the yard.  To our horror, it was nearly impossible to extinguish.  

Also I remember fucking around inside cable boxes to try to get The Playboy Channel.  Methods and techniques for doing this could be found on your favorite local BBS that specialized in aggregating these files.

But all in all -- most of it was pretty adolescent.  The current underground scene on the Internet - the Silk Road set and people into Bitcoin and crypto, would eat the underground BBS scene for lunch.  The stakes are higher.  You could post a fake story about a corporation you hated on a BBS and it wouldn't have any effect.  Today smart people can use the Internet to pump-and-dump.

Which actually reminds me -- another thing -- computers were still this niche thing only professionals and hobbyists understood.  Though people liked to talk in paranoid tones about the FBI and the like, in point of fact most of these were unmonitored playgrounds.  Everyone knows how to get on the Internet.  Very few people, comparatively, could load a term program and dial a modem.  So you could get away with saying or doing just about anything -- remembering, of course, the limitations of the time.  Pornography, for example, was impractical at that time, as was serious encryption.  I guess you could sell weed online or something but I never saw that. 

As such, the [Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse) didn't really have a battlefield.  There were no cryptocurrencies, no VPNs, nor darknets.  Even if law enforcement had been fully aware and knowledgeable about the mischief online, I doubt it would have been much of a priority.

[Until, of course, one day...it was.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sundevil).  1990 is an excellent year for when everything changed.  As people began migrating off of their 80s-era 8 bits to PCs, lots of things became possible: high resolution graphics (porn), multiline chat systems -- themselves always possible but unaffordable.  However by 1990 the first generation of BBSers had graduated college and had incomes to install multiple phone lines and the modems to handle them.

I got on the Internet in 1991.  I had set up my second BBS in college and I remember the constant stress -- as I could still only afford a single phone line -- of wanting to keep the board up so people could call, but also wanting to use my shell account to use the Net.  What I'd wind up doing is just going to one of the libraries at Rutgers and doing my Internet stuff from there to preserve board uptime.

Anyway these are my subjective memories and undoubtedly others will have different ones.

I loved BBSing and get really nostalgic for a few of the things I think we've lost since that period, but I admit I think I get my nostalgia for being that age and it all being so new and exciting, mixed up with the actual tech and the systems.

BBSing was a solar system.

The Internet is a galaxy.

Wouldn't ever go back.

&amp;nbsp;

Blockstream practically **has a monopoly on side-chains**. Since they know which exact lines of code will make it into the protocol, they are able to tailor their products perfectly, *months* before anyone else. Furthermore, since they factually control the development of the protocol, they can also alter it to put a competitor's sidechain-implementation at a disadvantage (or simply break it) anytime they want. **No sane investor on earth would put money into a company developing side-chains when the main competitor controls the settlement protocol**. Not gonna happen. So if you are asking yourself why Blockstream has a $150+ million valuation - this is why.

Second of all, one doesn't have to be Einstein to realize that it is bad for the community when the developers (who are writing the code for the protocol main-implementation) found a company that makes money based on fees of transactions of a payment layer that is 1) *based on* and 2) *competing* with the main payment layer. I mean, the conflict of interest is so overwhelmingly clear. I can't believe that people in here *still believe* that keeping the blocksize at 1MB has nothing to do with Blockstream's business plans. Either based on extreme naivity or have never worked at a larger firm who actually tries to make profit.

czocg3h,nullc,38,"Hi, ""SamouraiWallet"".  Lets get dispense with the adhomenem, then: I believe my Bitcoin Privacy credentials are above reproach, and here are _my_ concerns: 

After looking at the announcement and discussion on Reddit from the other day-- and the findings here (which you don't appear to be materially refuting),  it appears to me that this wallet has below average privacy (though a few useful thoughts!) and yet was billing itself as high privacy while failing to disclose its limitations.

I think this is unethical.  Good privacy is very hard. But even more important that the best privacy is being utterly honest and frank about the limitations. Phoning home to bc.i API and leaking the user's private information isn't just some mistake, it's a major functional design decision. 

You said the other day that if you were co-opted by interests that wanted to harm users, people would notice in your behavior, and stop trusting the wallet.

Is this true?  Lets see: You released a closed source wallet, that phones a third party API and reveals private user data. You did not disclose that it did this.  What are we to conclude from that?

I think this is indistinguishable from what would happen if the wallet were co-opted... and the fact that your response here is to attack back and make excuses rather than acknowledging a serious breach in privacy and communication does not bode well for the future prospects of this wallet as a pro-privacy tool.

What good does it serve anyone how much you'll wax philosophic about ""going to jail""-- when the rubber meets the road it seems you are already showing that you won't do the right thing, even when the stakes are much lower. I hope you reconsider your approach.",2016-02-05 11:21:05
czop819,meekale,37,"Keybase are making a serious effort to try and bring public key cryptography to a wider audience. There's a lot of scepticism, as always, which is a good thing... but there's also an aspect of FUD to the instant barrage of fears and doubts that always comes up.

The core question about Keybase's model for verifying keys is interesting. What is the alternative?

Key signing parties, pretty much. That's what you have to do if you **really** want to know that somebody's public key matches their ""real identity."" You have to meet them in person, and preferably check their passport. Otherwise it is **always** possible for someone to hack all of their accounts simultaneously and fool you into believing anything.

So, yes, Keybase's verification depends on—in addition to the normal PGP web of trust—checking your online accounts for signed evidence.

Let's take a concrete example. Jacob Kaplan-Moss, aka jacobian, is well known in the Python community. Maybe you want to communicate something sensitive to him. What are your options?

You don't have his public key in any way that you can 100% trust, because you haven't met him and done the key signing ritual. You don't have a highly trusted friend with jacobian's public key signed as trusted. You don't even really know him, aside from as an internet persona.

Well, you could look him up on a public key server, like the one hosted by MIT. Can you trust the key you find there? Can you explain in detail how this is safe?

Well, it isn't, really, unless your web of trust happens to connect you to that key. So you come across Keybase, and his profile there, which links to a tweet and a Gist:

https://twitter.com/jacobian &amp; https://gist.github.com/jacobian/9371311

Now you know that someone who has control of the accounts jacobian on Twitter and Github posted these snippets in early 2014 and hasn't changed them since.

Keybase has an open API and their open source client is a reference client. They publish the entire state of the Keybase data in the form of a Merkle structure, which is also pushed into the Bitcoin blockchain. Their client releases are signed and open.

I applaud your concern about security... but I wonder, are there any tried and true tools for sharing public keys online in a trustworthy manner?

You don't have to use Keybase's client for encrypting or decrypting. It's all just PGP. They haven't invented their own cryptographic primitives.

Here's a page about how to use the public Bitcoin ledger to verify the integrity of the data exposed by the Keybase server:

https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitcoin_blockchain

Their value is obvious to everyone who understands the principle behind them. That was *never* the point in the discussions. Sidechains will be relevant in the future for sure.

But many people don't agree with *artificially limiting* the main payment layer just to make sidechains relevant *now*. **We shouldn't cripple the network to force sidechains. That's not the way it was supposed to be**, and Satoshi stated numerous times that Bitcoin can scale naturally. Besides that, sidechain development should attract multiple companies, because a fair competition between them brings the most value to Bitcoin. In reality however, there is no competition because one of the sidechain firms controls the underlying settlement layer, which is totally retarded. *Fair competition is not possible* in the current situation.",2016-02-05 09:19:01

It's obvious that the Blockstream Core crew have a vision of Bitcoin as the settlements layer for a whole new world of smart contracts carried in side chains and layers.  That's what they've said, and that's why they set up Blockstream in the first place. 

And that's why many of us object to their control over Bitcoin development.  Bitcoin is not their Ferrari, and my bitcoin most certainly aren't. It's not for them to decide how we use Bitcoin or our own bitcoin. If I want to buy my coffee and then rack up miles in MY Ferrari driving the back roads of New Canaan and Greenwich who the eff are they to tell me that I can't because my vision doesn't suit their business plan.

czojhpv,theymos,30,"&gt; It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.

This is a point that's very often missed. In the original paper and again here, Satoshi talked about SPV as requiring what are now called fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, lightweight nodes are still able to enforce all of the rules of Bitcoin as long as they are able to receive messages from one honest full node. But what we now think of as ""SPV nodes"" lack these fraud proofs, instead trusting miners absolutely. (This redefinition was first made by Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ.) This is way less secure than Satoshi imagined, and the rise of these validation-less nodes is a major threat to Bitcoin as a whole (see [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation) and [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength)).

Satoshi might not have realized it, but it was previously impossible to do fraud proofs that cover all of the rules. But with SegWit, this will be possible, and I hope that fraud proofs are implemented soon after SegWit. Even if the number of full nodes was reduced by 90%, if all lightweight nodes became capable of processing fraud proofs, this'd probably still be a net gain in security for Bitcoin as a whole as well as for each of its users. (Though it'd be even better to have a lot of full nodes as well.)",2016-02-05 14:42:59

&gt;They don't see the bitcoin network as a way to 'pay for cups of coffee', or to 'do micro-transactions', they see it is the greatest, most powerful, most incredible, trust engine ever engineered in human history.

This is the main problem with what block stream is doing. It does not matter what them, you or I think are acceptable or unnaceptable transactions for the block chain. The economic and technological reality should be the limits. Nor they nor anybody have the capacity to centrally plan what is adequate.

It is funny because I agree with Blockstream that not every transaction will end up in the blockchain and some sort of system is needed to handle micro transactions, for example side chains or LN style solutions. But what it is unnaceptable is that the guys at block stream have decided not only that they know better than anyone but that they know better than the market and instead of letting it happen organically, they are going to control the process. Instead of having the price raise naturally as we reach the technological limits, they are going to set up artificial limits to indirectly control fees, because apparently they know around which price they should be.

This position they have taken is extremely dangerous and goes against anything Bitcoin represents (or represented). It changes Bitcoin from a decentralize system to a centralized one.

What announcement? The off hand tweet someone posted here? I just want to make sure that we are looking at the same thing. 

The findings here we aren't refuting, and never were hiding it either. From day one we have highlighted - mostly within our alpha group discussion group, but also there is a mention on our website - the need to move off third party API's - not only due to privacy concerns but also the increased downtime we were experiencing due to no fault of our own. Indeed, this is part of the reason we are not publicly available in the Google Play store today instead behind an ""opt-in"" testing path.

&gt; I think this is unethical. Good privacy is very hard. But even more important that the best privacy is being utterly honest and frank about the limitations. Phoning home to bc.i API and leaking the user's private information isn't just some mistake, it's a major functional design decision.

I think it would be unethical to release a 1.0 Samourai that is closed source and this information not disclosed. I however do not see an ethical problem at all in highlighting our goals (better privacy) and actively working to achieve those goals by releasing a series of testing builds. If any of our testers feel that we have been unethical in our practises I would like to sincerely apologise and work to rectify that. 

&gt; You said the other day that if you were co-opted by interests that wanted to harm users, people would notice in your behavior, and stop trusting the wallet.

I believe that was in the context of requiring KYC/AML, but yes overall the point stands.

&gt; Is this true? Lets see: You released a closed source wallet, that phones a third party API and reveals private user data. You did not disclose that it did this. What are we to conclude from that?

Yes a closed source alpha testing wallet. Yes it relies on a third party API (in the build being discussed BC.i is the sole API source, in an upcoming build we separate address balances from transaction pushing). I wasn't aware I needed to disclose this piece of technical information on a reddit thread about a tweet I made regarding KYC/AML in Bitcoin. This isn't the first time this has come up, we aren't hiding it, but granted this is the first time you are bringing it up, which means that you are looking at our wallet, which is awesome. Thanks.

&gt; I think this is indistinguishable from what would happen if the wallet were co-opted... and the fact that your response here is to attack back and make excuses rather than acknowledging a serious breach in privacy and communication does not bode well for the future prospects of this wallet as a pro-privacy tool.

czohlgf,johnnycoin,14,"The problem is that you actually have just been duped. 

Sidechains are just as valid and useful for the blockchain at 1MB as they are at 2, 6, or 100MB. Sure there might be some point in the future where block size is too big for the available network capacity, but at 2MB that day is not today. 

At a measly 2MB there are no serious technical hurdles, anyone that says otherwise is also saying that Bitcoin would have failed technically if Satoshi had mistakenly chosen to reduce the size to 2MB instead of the sacred 1MB on that fateful day long ago. 

So why then is Core refusing to up the limit??? One reason, and one reason only. Precedent. 

Once they do it once for scaling issues, they won't be able to stop it again, and they lose their leverage of putting more focus on their sidechains.

czo7xzz,nullc,14,"Thank you, I think you've pretty much got it.

&gt; adjudicating absolutely anything

Anything where the proof can be measured mechanically and the value to be delivered can be secured by a bitcoin payment, at least.

(which does turn out to be a great many things, except where the potential losses are so large than the cost of borrowing the Bitcoin to cover the loss is prohibitive-- or where the decision is so subjective that you might as well just have the subjective deciders secure the funds.)

&gt;  I can see how they might get frustrated by people who are demanding to use it to send low-value payments

I don't see anything wrong with making low value payments directly on the network, _in and of itself_. Frustration comes from a perceived push to change the direction in the system to optimize for that use case in the short term at the expense of the this bigger vision and Bitcoin's long term value.

Using your example-- it's not just using the indycar to buy milk, it's the argument that we need to loosen up the suspension to give a smoother ride along the way. The argument falls down though: Keeping an indycar for racing means leaving it at home for the milkrun. The Bitcoin _currency_ can be used for all the applications' just fine.

Imagine you've made a compound that works as both a dessert topping and a floor wax. As a dessert topping, it's not great but not awful. But as a floor wax it has no parallel, and while high performance floor wax is a huge industry-- with a much larger total addressable market-- much of it is professional and thus invisible and unfamiliar to many people. But _everyone_ understands the dessert topping use case. Some are arguing to add some sugar to the compound to make it a somewhat better dessert topping, but still not an awesome one and at the expense of potentially making it much less useful as a floor wax. I propose instead, that we should put the sugar on the side in a packet with sprinkles and a cherry-- and then it's even better yet!  Other people argue that the tooling for that will take time, and what is this ""floor wax"" thing anyways?

Then up the stakes: if we bloat up Bitcoin or undermine long term security it appears _very_ unlikely that we can undo it later-- we've made only modest success fighting back node count declines, reliance on third party security for wallets (even business ones), or mining centralization.

So it's not that I think that small payments are a worthless application-- I think they're also important too, but rather: they're not where Bitcoin-the-network offers a distinct transformative value and they can only be done in an actually competitive way though smarter ways of using Bitcoin that shift load out of the payment network. If we distort Bitcoin's operation enough in an attempt accommodate them the inefficient way then the smarter applications lose their potential.

In business, and really in all cases of competitive interaction, it's not enough to merely do something well: the thing you do has to provide value, and you have to do it better than the alternatives. Is bitcoin a better small payments system than the alternatives? -- Not today it isn't: For an adult in the US the experience of using a credit card is almost strictly superior than Bitcoin payments today: Credit cards work with the fiat the user already has, credit cards have delayed billing, 'good' credit cards have cashback, nice online reporting, fraud protection, ... and compared to popular Bitcoin payment processors today require providing less invasive personal information at the time of sale. As a merchant the formula is slightly more in Bitcoin's favor but on that side they live and die by adoption, or otherwise they wouldn't bother accepting the credit cards in the first place. None of that would be fixed by twiddling the block size.

Yet for some payments that are handled most poorly by credit cards-- machine to machine-ish payments where the values being moved are a penny at a time (which are only really realistic via payment channels, like lightning or what 21inc has implemented), cross-border, or applications for people suffering [financial censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3u5b1d/my_exchange_with_coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong/)... almost none of the industry is spending time making those work well in Bitcoin (there are some notable exceptions). ... and maybe that makes me doubt how much earnestness there really is behind payments as a real application, and how much of the activity is just driven by trying to make the simplest possible argument for ""impending moon"".

Well, I've got an argument for ""moon"", one that speaks to advanced technology rewiring how the whole world performs all kinds of transactions; not just as a mere yet another commodity payment system (but this time incompatible with the money people already have). But it's one that that takes longer than 1Q to make its payoff. But I also have a few million material pieces of evidence that others can understand it, even though it isn't the simplest possible story, and realize the chance is so fantastic both in terms of the benefit to man kind as well as the potential for profit in helping along that kind of world-wide transformation-- that they are eager to take a risk on helping it happen.

I'm glad you've tuned in too.",2016-02-05 09:16:31
czoomnl,killerstorm,14,"&gt;  There seems to be some tie in with bitcoin's block chain to further harden their identity verification but i had a hard time following what they meant by that?

An attack on certification authority/key server can be used to perform man-in-the-middle attack, as it can serve attacker's public key instead of the public key of the person you're communicating with.

This attack can be thwarted if one can detect that key server isn't serving the same data as it was served before.

Bitcoin blockchain is pretty much the only way to implement this without using a trusted third party. Clients can verify data they receive from a key server against a root hash published by the key server in the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin mechanisms make sure that everybody gets the same root hash, defeating them will be very expensive.

I have been following the debate closely since the beginning and I see all the censorship as disrespect. Moreover, I am here because of Satoshi's vision which is all about on chain scaling. This debate has been draining the energy out of both sides. 

There is a huge amount of posts on other unrelated subreddits about net neutrality. I would argue we should fight for Bitcoin neutrality. By letting banks invest in them, Blockstream has just added to the existing conflict of interest. With all moderation and financial incentives, more and more trust is required from users towards them. 

I remember a video where Andreas Antonopoulos was on skype and he told: ""if the telcos had been given decision power over internet legislation, I would be inserting coins now for every minute of this call!""

Imagine if SMTP had a maximum of 2.7 emails per second globally, and you have a team arguing that the capacity shouldn't be raised because it would centralize, increase spam, and that we need a fee on each e-mail, because they have a complex theorical plan to fix this, and they are financed by postal companies which are about to be disrupted by e-mail. What would happen then? We'd just be using an alternative protocol for email. Yes the comparison is not totally valid because not all SMTP servers are processing every email, but the point is a e-mail is a protocol not owned or licensed by corporations, just like Bitcoin should be. Blockstream innovations have potential, but they should not be forced on users. They should be optional and compete with on chain scaling. Those innovations should not be allowed to alter the course away from the original classic vision which brought so many people here in the first place.

The updated bitcoin protocol already has miner support (otherwise it wouldn't exist because of the 75% check) and all other miners have a huge incentive to switch to it too, so we can basically say that miner support at this point is guaranteed.

How about support from the users? Well the miners think that users want this, otherwise they wouldnt mine it. Do the users even have a say in it? Do most of them even notice? Depends on the merchants. And the wallet providers.

The merchants will always want to support the coin that is most popular. But they are not limited to only one. Even now some merchants accept litecoin next to bitcoin. So they don't have a problem accepting the bitcoin that more than 75% use.

The wallet provider want users. That's how they make money. They want to support the coin that most people use, so they have a lot of potential downloaders of their software. Some of the popular wallet provider already said they are prepared to update their software.

What about nodes? Well there are already a couple of hundred nodes live that support the hardfork change. And again, once the majority of people/merchants/miners/wallets support something, the rest will have to follow. The same with nodes. Once the hardfork movement has started it's not easy to stop it.


Overall a lot people agree that there won't be a state of 75/25 split for long. Once it's clear where bitcoin is heading people will follow. They kinda have to. Especially when miners change, because that's when the losing protocol will be vulnerable to a 51% attack. The PoW algorithm has to change at this point or it's dead.",2016-02-07 18:59:47

Let's see if I got it right: to access sites with the SatoshiPay paywall, you need to download and install the the SatoshiPay wallet plugin/app (that will not have any malware, boy scout's word).  Then you must register into an exchange, buy some pocket-change bitcoins, and withdraw them to that wallet's address.  Then, whenever you visit a site with the SatoshiPay paywall, that site will reach into your pocket, without asking your permission, and help itself to the pocket change it deems appropriate.  (I suppose that, if the site has sub-frames, each sub-frame can charge separately and automatically for its contents, right?  Otherwise how can the authors of the sub-frames be rewarded for their valuable content?).

Needless to say, instead of the hassle of buying some bitcoin, you can but a $400 PiTato from 21.co, leave it plugged and mining all day long, and withdraw daily its 5 mined cents from the 21.co pool server to the SatoshiPay wallet (minus the 2 cents or so that you must put aside for the increase in your utility bill).",2016-02-07 04:15:11

For example, the article falsely claims that the subject served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation (he never has), it also falsely claims that he contributed to several software projects (bitaddress, ethereum, etc.) which he has not. etc. To those coming in from reddit being asked to mob this discussion: Having a wikipeida article about you is no kindness, the majority of people I know who have articles about them that I've discussed it with have considered it to be a negative effect on their lives, and the impact is more negative the more niche the interest around you is as the article becomes more distorted and inaccurate the sparser the coverage becomes.

czte8k8,pb1x,19,"In the beginning Classic had a way of getting support by going around asking people if they want 2MB capacity and then marking them down as ""support Classic and our weird voting system and [firing all the developers](http://0bin.net/paste/8YeL12K5CwP26YUP#kSSLpZ2+PC9RqgcbiP0-bYbDhIHAMRCB3t2CpHkxokQ), etc."" They are quite deliberate in promising nothing else for fear of scaring off what weak support they have.

In fact the entire idea of 2MB was originally a Core plan, proposed by Adam Back, [called ridiculous by Gavin](https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/636569665284775937), and then realized in the SegWit plan. By December Core had already done the leg work of getting support for 2MB capacity from the miners and many in the community.

So 2MB is just a smokescreen, XT and Classic (same people, sans Hearn) are mainly efforts to ""govern"" Bitcoin.

As Gavin said:

&gt; even before stepping down as Lead I was starting to wonder if there are ANY successful open source projects that didn't have either a Benevolent Dictator or some clear voting process to resolve disputes

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/008810.html

Gavin self-elected himself as ""Lead"" by asking Satoshi to put him in that position, and in the beginning he did mostly high level cleaning work like organizing testing and filling out the tool chain, promoting Bitcoin. Over time Gavin started to try to exert control of Bitcoin, telling devs that they should take the project in a direction they disagreed with. Gavin has called the Bitcoin devs out as [liars](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uw5tp/slush_pool_to_reenable_bip_101_bitcoin_mining/cxif6yh), [poisonous](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62037.msg724040), [negative](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xf8ys/todd_continues_to_erroneously_think_bitcon/cy48hji), [FUD spreaders](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rqexb/87898_kb_block_just_now/cdpvh9x) etc, but ultimately he couldn't change the situation and he stepped down. With XT Gavin tried to force the ""Benevolent Dictator"" system, with Mike Hearn as the dictator, with Classic, the ""voting"" system, with Toomim in control of the voting apparatus

Some of them are in favor of lifting the block size limit to 2 MB, allowing for blocks twice as big. The downside is that larger blocks increase the bandwidth requirements of full nodes. The number of full nodes has be in decline despite increased adoption. Further drops in the number of nodes leads to increased centralisation which is a risk to Bitcoin as a whole.

People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* bankers) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.

The 'Blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.

The 'Blockchain' without BTC *is* useful to them.

And to whatever degree an actual correlation exists and wasn't summoned by the half-dozen degrees of freedom above: We would expect excitement about price to cause increased transaction volume as traders bounce funds between exchanges; nothing about that graph suggests any direction for whatever casual arrow exists.

There is no reason we cant all work together as Matt suggested.  We should be drawing a line under past disagreements and working together to improve Bitcoin.

Ultimately we should be clear that Bitcoin is a p2p user currency and users views are most important - companies exist to provide services, features and use-cases that users value building on Bitcoin.  This is why people say there should be widespread consensus - Bitcoin security works as a decentralised collaboration between users, ecosystem companies like exchanges, wallets, and services helping users and miners providing security for the user and ecosystem economic full nodes, which then creates SPV security for smartphone wallets.",2016-02-11 18:58:19

In short, ETH will likely have bitcoin's current marketcap and a larger dev network by the time that LN is released because it is a far better platform for development today.

2016/02/11

""BITMAIN/Antpool chose to abstain from signing the statement, “A Call for Consensus,” that was released yesterday by representatives of several bitcoin companies. The statement was produced as the result of extensive discussions between the Core team and key industry players over the past several weeks.

We applaud the Core team’s increased communication and willingness to find compromise, but we do not wish to bind ourselves to a document that does not contain concrete technical proposals. We look forward to reviewing Bitcoin Core’s updated roadmap and evaluating it on its technical merits, but we do not believe that this should be done to the exclusion of other development efforts.

Like those who signed the Call for Consensus document, we share the common goal of seeing bitcoin succeed. The bitcoin network has proven resilient in the face of many challenges over the years, and we do not believe that testing different implementations of the software poses a threat to the network. If support for a hard fork fails to reach majority consensus, then bitcoin’s built-in voting mechanism works as intended.

Bitcoin has always been free software, and in line with open source philosophy, we encourage and welcome all code proposals irrespective of the team proposing."" - Bitmain Technologies, Ltd.

Whether or not Greg Maxwell is a good coder doesn't really matter any more - now that **""the peasants are revolting""**.

The only reason Blockstream / Core is in danger of losing control over Bitcoin via a hard-fork, now involving 3 other, competing repos (Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin XT) is simply because Gregory Maxwell **""frequently makes mistakes""** - **""misapplying a rule""** and **""blindly applying his new policy without any thought""**.

Greg has misapplied [Satoshi's 1 MB temporary anti-spam rule](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wo9pb/satoshi_nakamoto_october_04_2010_074840_pm_it_can/), trying to turn it into a new policy - which is now stifling Bitcoin adoption and price and ripping the community apart, creating **""a direct threat to the project""**.

czwlshg,jstolfi,27,"&gt; So, if all everyone around here wants is 'a blocksize increase', well SegWit delivers that.  However, I don't think that is what people really want. What they really want is for the official bitcoin reference client to no longer be under the control of the current group of developers.

SegWit will only ease the space crunch for those transactions that use the  SegWit format.  That may be OK; it would motivate old clients to upgrade.  However, it benefits mostly transactions with complicated signatures. They will be able to pay a lower fee per kB than simpler transactions, while having the same priority in the queues. 

But the big-blockians do not want 2 MB blocks, or 4 MB, or whatever. They want *an uncongested network*, with the capacity always higher than demand, so that every transaction gets confirmed in the next block.   For them, the 2 MB is just a temporary fix to delay congestion by another year. It should have been 8 MB or more, but so much FUD has been created about big blocks that the increase had to be reduced to 2 MB to reduce those fears.  If traffic continues growing, the limit will have to be lifted again, to avoid congestion.

In contrast, Blockstream/Core wants a congested network, with an arbitrary capacity cap decided by them.  They want a system that holds transactions for hours on the queues, in order to force the users to pay ""ransom"" to get them out.  They want SegWit for other reasons, and its increase of the effective block limit to 1.7 MB is only tolerated; they have no intention of increasing the capacity further.

So, the big-blockians' quest is not to change the numerical value of that parameter, but to take control of the protocol away from Blockstream and the current Core developers -- because there is no sign that they will ever give up on their ""fee market"" plan.",2016-02-12 07:52:20

czyav45,BalajiSrinivasan,95,"Bitcore's implementation is great, but it's fairly low level. You need to manually do things like this:

    assert(consumer.validateRefund(messageFromProvider));
    sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(400 * SATOSHIS));
    sendToProvider(consumer.incrementPaymentBy(4 * BITS));

Our implementation does cover that low-level use case with both a [library](https://21.co/learn/21-lib-channels) and a corresponding [command line](https://21.co/learn/intro-to-micropayment-channels/#the-channels-command-reference) tool.

However, what we are really focused on is a higher-level use case - namely, making micropayments *easy*. You'll have to decide for yourself whether we accomplished that, but here's some [sample code](https://21.co/learn/21-lib-channels/#setup) that sets up a little payment channels capable server:

    import datetime
    import flask
    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitserv.flask import Payment
        
    app = flask.Flask(__name__)
    payment = Payment(app, Wallet())

    @app.route('/current-time')
    @payment.required(50)
    def current_time():
        return str(datetime.datetime.now())
  
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=5000, debug=True)

The `payment.required` line is the key bit that charges 50 satoshis per request. Assuming that server is running on localhost at port 5000, here's a corresponding client:

    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet
    from two1.lib.bitrequests import ChannelRequests

    requests = ChannelRequests(Wallet())
    response = requests.get(""http://localhost:5000/current-time"")
    print(response.text)

All the payment channel and 402 logic is thus handled in the background and you can just request the URL like a standard HTTP-accessible resource -- so long as your local wallet has a nonzero Bitcoin balance to set up the initial deposit transaction. We do think this allows you to program at a somewhat higher level of abstraction as you'd otherwise have to implement all that logic on top of the low-level stuff.

The ""blocksize"" crisis have put light on something more serious; a quite fragmented community with many key developers (who works for blockstream) who has a quite different view on how bitcoin should be used compared to most users. 
My basic understanding is that core/blockstream does NOT want to use bitcoin as a payment system, they want ppl to use blockstreams tech instead. Most other people and companies would at least like bitcoin to scale a bit more to handle the current (and near future) situation.

Some of the people and miners who signed the document has financial ties to blockstream ((BTCC as on example) from what I read, second hand source). 

During this process, I'm very surprised on both how little miners have reacted and how little knowledge they had on what's going on. When they made statements, they have latter been withdrawn because they have missunderstod key facts about who's supporting what..... 

This will go on for quite some time, I'm afraid. Even if core eventually is ""forced"" to increase to 2MB, the main issues are not solved; what is the future for bitcoin? have all the hard words and different opinions led to a general distrust in core+blockstream? will miners start act responsibility and make educated decisions.

czxc2eo,Emocmo,22,"Good morning.  

I had to go back and forth a couple of times because I did not do a chart yesterday.  When you look at this, you are going to say I got some ‘splainin’ to do.

We dropped down to $360 yesterday, and from what I can gather it was a single trade or one fat finger trade.  Never the less, it dropped the chart down below the negative break down point, and then reversed right back up.

I have explained in my charts that every trade is counted, even those that do not make any sense to the anyone paying attention.  As it goes, “It is what it is.”

Well, since we broke down we chart it, close out the day and move on.

This morning, it clearly moves back up into a column of Xs.  But that move will not be confirmed until the “end of the day” because it may reverse and drop twenty points back to the $360 range.  That is why the right-most column is currently shaded—to remind me that it is not “confirmed.”

Here come the things to watch:

The break out point dropped $5 down to $390.  That is pretty clear to where we are today.

The trend reversal is now at $395.  This is also pretty close.

The formation is now 14 columns wide.  This is a very wide formation.    The price has tried to break $360 twice in this formation, and failed.  This is a good sign.

With a formation this wide (14 columns) the battle between long and shorts must be getting exhausted.  Whichever way it breaks, it should move quickly.

If we break out this time, we will do a few significant things:

1.  If there is a break out, we take out the trend line.  This will revert to a bullish trend.
2. If we break out we will go through the conjunction of the trend line from the recent highs, AND the support line coming up from the most recent low of 198.  That is significant because that line is a long term resistance line.

If we fall through $360..look out below.  There is nothing down there.

So, what do I think?

The trend is still downward, but if the price continues to move in this narrow range we will break through in a couple of days—by default.  As you can see the trend line (the little + signs moving from the top left towards the bottom right) moves down one box for each column.  It would only take a couple of trips within our range to hit it just “because.”  While this is a bullish sign…it does not happen with any conviction.

IF the price moves above $385, it might be a good time to close out your shorts as it moves towards $390.  If the price hits $390 I would open a trade and watch closely for the pop.  Will this happen before Monday?  Without significant Chinese involvement, I do not think so.

The gyrations of the regular market (stock and metals, etc) are making me nervous.  I spent some time yesterday moving some money into cash, a little more into silver, and I cleared out 1/2 of my silver options yesterday figuring it would probably drop a bit today.  It was a nice clip—but where the hell do you put THAT money?  Stocks are crazy.  Bitcoin is crazy.  Gold and Silver are crazy.  And how much cash do you want laying around the house.

I hope you all have a happy valentines day with those you care about.  I spent last night with my wife and daughter picking out wedding dresses.  If ever you want to feel old…marry off your daughter.  Jeez.

Stay warm.

czxgftg,ibankbtc,18,"Bitcoin market update:

Between the hard folk discussion, blockstream core and the altcoin pump, we in theory should have seen market drift lower if not crash. Some on on r/btc and r/bitcoin have lost faith in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Most and I were expecting much lower prices. 

Yet, here we are, with price drifting slightly higher day to day. It boggles my mind sometimes that this would occur. Is it someone with a strong hand buying? This certainly didn't come from bfx margin or open interest on futures. As a technical analyst, I see price drifts up, the why can wait. The phrase, climbing the wall of worry comes to mind. Investopedia says it best:

&gt;The financial markets' periodic tendency to surmount a host of negative factors and keep ascending. Wall of worry is generally used in connection with the stock markets, referring to their resilience when running into a temporary stumbling block, rather than a permanent impediment to a market advance.

This reminds me of a time in 2009 when the counter rally started after a bottom. Stories like Madoff, citibank and wamu were still fresh in our minds. Every week, housing prices fall, unemployment claim rise, and more banks fail. Yet, price continue to drift high like clockwork. Although bitcoin price is still within a consolidation phase, you can see signs of it making lower highs. I think a break out above 390 and psychological 400 would push market much higher. On the contrary, if something disastrous were to happen, a break below 360 is a tell-tale sign of a selloff.

&gt; In the English-speaking Bitcoin world, he says, the debate boils down to two issues. First, how should Bitcoin be governed — by dictators, as a democracy or as a republic? And second, which is more important — keeping Bitcoin decentralized or allowing for more transactions and users? The camp in favor of keeping the block size smaller for as long as possible (currently at 1MB), mostly represented by Bitcoin Core, believes doing so will allow even small-time miners to be included in maintaining the network, keeping it from being controlled by a few large entities that have the computing power to accommodate larger blocks. (Also, many in this group support other solutions, most notably one called Segregated Witness, that will allow more transactions to go through without having to raise the block size right now.) The other side, such as Bitcoin Classic, advocates for increasing the block size sooner, to 2MB, to accommodate for growth and also because smaller blocks may artificially inflate the fees required to get transactions processed in the network, cutting into one of the major advantages that Bitcoin has over other payment systems — the fact that it’s cheaper than payment methods such as credit cards.

meanwhile he cannot even comprehend that 1MB limit will not just maintain centralization, but will inherently degrade Bitcoin's network effect, hurting the whole scene.

Let's do the math:

The hash rate of the 21.co chip is [50 GH/s](https://support.21.co/21-bitcoin-chip/what-s-the-hash-rate-of-the-21-bitcoin-chip).

The total network hash rate is approximately [1 billion GH/s](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate).  

Thus it would require 10^9 / 50 = 20 million 21.co chips to equal the current hash power of the Bitcoin network. 

In 2015, [240 million](http://www.statisticbrain.com/computer-sales-statistics/) computers were sold.  

If 21.co were to make a deal with Intel or AMD and if 10% of computers at some point in time began shipping with 21.co ASICs, that would represent more deployed hash power than the entire Bitcoin network at present.

However it's interesting to note that it was actually a transaction of $15mil. The recipient immediately started obscuring the source of the funds with what looks like a tumbler. So if Shkreli really was defrauded he is probably fucked.",2016-02-14 15:42:04

czzd3dq,SirEDCaLot,22,"/u/Peter__R makes some good points but I want to add to that

We do not need to overwhelm the Chinese hashpower, or even match the total network hash power.  We just need to get a usable amount of mining happening on a decentralized basis- enough that if something happened to [these 7 guys](http://media.coindesk.com/2015/12/IMG_9339-e1449402865465.jpg) that the network would continue on unaffected.  

How much decentralization is desired currently depends on the block size limit and how close we are to it.  For example, if the limit is 2MB and we have 1MB blocks, then we can stand to lose a little under 50% of the hash power before we start having a real problem.  Right now the limit is 1MB and we are at ~700KB, which means if we lose even a little bit of hash power quickly (before difficulty can adjust) we are in trouble.  

Also, mining on a 21.co gadget is a totally different paradigm than current mining.  The point is not to be super profitable, it's to use a small enough amount of power that the user won't care, while generating a little profit for the user to play around with micropayments.  

**And that is the true genius of 21.co.**  
If you try to apply current Bitcoin ecosystem roles to them, they are a scam company that makes an expensive and unprofitable mining rig which nobody in their right mind would buy.  

But if you use a little vision and think 5-10 years ahead- imagine a world where on a website or music download, the 'like' button doesn't spam your friends, rather it instantly donates a tiny amount of money (maybe just a penny or two) to the creator of that page.  When you reduce the friction of the transaction to ZERO, and let people send tiny micropayments without ever touching their bank accounts, all kinds of new opportunities open up.  
Publishers wouldn't have to clutter their pages with intrusive animated tracking ads to stay profitable, they could simply request a 5c donation (and they'd get a lot of them) or maybe require a payment to view the content.  Unlike current paywalls, nobody would care because it just takes one click.  Musicians could start asking for donations; if everybody paid 5c to download the track, the musician is making money and the users don't care that it's not free because the transaction is frictionless.  

To make this happens though, two things need to happen:  1. Bitcoin has to scale (a LOT, I mean WAY more than block size increases can help with for the next few years; this is where payment channels start to shine), and 2. mainstream users need an easy way to get and spend Bitcoin.  

Now people will be understandably reluctant to punch their credit card details into anything.  But if you give them a box that they plug in and let hum away, and you tell them this box generates digital doubloons which they can use to instantly pay for shit without having to give up their own money, they will go for it in droves (even if they could get the same amount of BTC cheaper by simply buying it).  

And THAT's where 21's long term plan starts to make sense.  They want to make millions of tiny, unprofitable mining chips that will be embedded into gadgets like routers and cell phone chargers, then split the proceeds with the users.  These chips will use so little power that nobody will care about them or that they're unprofitable.  And once you start talking micropayments, suddenly that makes sense as something people might actually want.

Now while the 21.co computer isn't something people will want now, 2 or 3 generations down the line, if the micropayment ecosystem starts to form, it'll be something everybody wants in on.  ",2016-02-14 16:30:44

czzrnsb,jstolfi,71,"I have two theories for Blockstream's insistence in the 1 MB limit, even though it has created what may be the worst credibility crisis in the coin's history.

----

**One:** Back in 2013 or 2014, when it was created, Blockstream promised their investors a certain business plan which was critically dependent on (1) the imminent transition of the network to congested operation and a ""fee market"" (that would drive most current bitcoin users to off-chain solutions) and/or (2) their firm control over the protocol (that they had secured by by hiring many of the developers and having veto power on the commits).  

Thus their hysterical no-holds-barred effort to destroy BitcoinXT, and now BitcoinClassic (rather than just competing with them for popularity): because they would (1) prevent network congestion and (2) would take control of the protocol away from Blockstream.  These events would jeopardize their credibility before their investors, or worse.  It may not be a coincidence that their second round of investment happened just after they succeeded in wrecking BitcoinXT.

**Two:** Back in 2013, Greg Maxwell became convinced that he had a much better design for a distributed cytographic payment system than Satoshi's.  His design may have been based on sidechains at that time, although it has now shifted to the Lightning Network.  But anyway it always assumed that the current network would have its access restricted, and would be used only as a ""digital gold"" backing for his design -- as an internal network used only for infrequent high-value transactions. 

He also convinced himself that the right way to set the transaction fees was to have users compete for limited block space.  Perhaps, as libertarian, he felt that it would be the right solution because he (mistakenly) thought that it was a ""free market"" solution.  (At first Greg thought that the 1 MB limit was put by Satoshi in the original design, precisely to create such a ""fee market"".  Gavin corrected him, but he apparently did not change his mind about that.) 

Anyway, the creation of Blockstream gave him the power to finally realize his design, which no one had taken seriously until then.  He seems to be the single person responsible to determine the company's development plans: while Adam, Austin,  and others defend the plan with fervor, they may be just deferring to his presumed technical brilliance.

czzykx4,jstolfi,42,"My understanding is that they *want* to drive all individual users off the bitcoin network, perhaps assuming that they will then move to the overlay network.

One of the many problems in the LN design is that it would not begin to work until mostl bitcoin users are LN users.  

If only 10% of the bitcoin users are in the LN, and the other 90% are still using raw bitcoin, then (very roughly) only 1% of the bitcoin payments will be through the LN, 81% will be between two raw bitcoin users, and 18% will be between an LN user and a bitcoin user.  The latter will require at least two on-chain transactions, to close a channel and reopen it.  So the on-chain traffic will be 81% + 2 x 18% = 117% of what it would be if there was no LN.  

Only when more than 67% of the bitcoin users are LN users will the LN start to reduce the on-chain traffic.  This analysis is grossly simplified, but the qualitative conclusion is valid: if the LN adoption is low, the LN will *increase* the load on the blockchain, instead of reducing it.  That may be the reason why they want to start crippling the network even before the LN is deployed.

But the explanation may be much simpler: they just don't realize what they are doing.  Proceeding with their roadmap even before there is a plausibel sketch of the LN shows abysmal lack of software project management skills. ",2016-02-15 06:48:04

d00f1bb,Capt_Roger_Murdock,32,"Of course, the alternative to a ""contentious hard fork"" is ""contentious stasis."" And if 75% *do* support a fork, that means that the stasis option is, by definition, three times as ""contentious"" as the fork option.

Here's an analogy I really like that I think captures the situation:

Imagine five guys driving down the road and arguing over where to stop for lunch. They're approaching an intersection (a “fork” in the road, if you will). If they turn left, there's a restaurant a few miles down that way that two people in the car want to go to. If they turn right, there's another restaurant a few miles that way that two other people want to stop at. Finally, if they keep going straight there's a third restaurant that the last guy sitting way in the back wants to go to. After ten minutes of heated debate with no clear resolution, the last guy says, ""Well, sadly, it looks like we're not going to be able to achieve 'overwhelming consensus' on a 'hard turn' to the left or the right. And we obviously don't want to make a 'contentious turn' and risk a 'catastrophic consensus failure.' I mean, if we all tried to go to different restaurants we might get lost or murdered or something. So... best just to stay on the current road and go where I want go."" The driver puts on his blinker and says, ""shut up, *I'm* driving the car to the Mexican place on the left. If anybody feels like walking somewhere else, I'm happy to pull over right here and let them out."" Not surprisingly, no one takes him up on this offer. The guy in the driver seat in this analogy is the ""economic majority,"" and the car is the network effect (it's in everyone's best interests to stay in the car even if the destination isn't their first choice). “Consensus” in Bitcoin isn’t about getting everyone to agree on the destination ahead of time.  Consensus is about “staying in the car"" (abiding by the same set of compatible rules / agreeing on an identical ledger history) because the network effect is that important.  ",2016-02-15 15:40:44

Coinbase is a Bank that allows you to sell fiat for bitcoins and holds deposited bitcoins and some fiat. Coinbase is a Bank that will allow you to withdraw your fiat or bitcoin as bitcoin or fiat (via bank transfer).

Coinbase is a Bank that also hosts a Bitcoin wallet that you can control (the Vault) but your default wallet should be considered a Bank Account.

Coinbase is a new kind of Bank that sits between the legacy financial system and decentralized crypto-currency networks. Of course it is subject to regulations.

There is nothing stopping people from opening up their own unlicensed, unregulated exchanges, so why don't we see more of them? 

Because who wants to invest the time and capital into developing something that can be seized at a moments notice? For this reason unregulated, unlicensed exchanges will have a much higher premium to account for the increased risk of operation or the exchange is likely to operate on some kind of ponzi scheme or scam. Why work hard and risk everything you work for if you aren't even getting paid? 

It is the overarching regulatory system that causes this friction. If there were no Coinbase we would all be forced to use services with a much higher premium and/or higher likelihood of being scammed out of our money.

Attacking Coinbase will not make regulations go away.

d01jevm,knightly_news,33,"The world drastically changed when The Uplink came along. The internet has become a real, tangible place. The top layer, the Google, Yahoo, and news sites of the world is where 99% of the Internet populace lived. I am part of the 1% that goes adventuring in the depths, looking for the valuable information and the things that require certain...""tastes.""

There was a rule most of us Adventurers abided by- and that was ""Never go deeper than 4chan."" The brave souls who did, seem to become lost in the greed with the plethora of new information and new...items. Those who went deeper than 4chan rarely returned.

That is where I come in, I was one of the few that dared to venture deeper, and one of the few that returned. I earned plenty of coin for these tasks, Bitcoin that is. I could have chosen a simple life as a miner in the Bitcoin caves, but that wasn't in store for me. I craved the rush of adventure, and the rewards of plundering.

The Uplink had changed the world, to the point where the government had created Matrix like systems for those willing to sign a waiver, it wasn't all that bad. One day I was roaming around Bing, I prefer it because it's more...welcoming, to my kind of folk than the overly upscale and law-abiding Google. In the Search Bar I saw a man, he drew closer, us Adventurers were pretty distinct. He was straight to the point.

""400 Bitcoin for LSD,"" he barked.

""Seems a bit much,"" I replied 

""I'm desperate,"" was his only response 

I saw his kind often, Uplinkers who were druggies in real life and the Internet only made the effects more potent. I had my reliant drug market, so after further haggling I set off. 

I booted up my Tails, anti-tracking armor, raised my VPN shield, and pulled out my legendary Binary Sword and set off toward the local Jumping Point. In the Internet realm the deep web is literally a pit you jump into, once you have your URL ready it's simple as walking through a threshold. 

After my Jump, I walked into the most reliable market. As I appeared I saw a vendor get stabbed with a Trojan Knife, this isn't unusual, we were in the deep web after all. I acquired the LSD and was about to walk through the threshold when suddenly it shattered like glass. White started o overrun everything and suddenly there was nothing left but white in every direction. I looked up and saw the dreaded numbers; 404.

The dreaded Error, this could mean only one thing. 

My greatest fear became a reality when I heard the fabled deep voice of the monstrous NSA say the words that made my nightmare true.

The 'blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.

Proof of Work, especially when chained, is merely a spam filter that makes it difficult for anyone but honest users to participate; yet, as with git, such functionality is not required in order for the blockchain to be useful. Most systems don't require the ability to be run by *anyone*.

The things that were interesting yesterday are still interesting.  

Yesterday the price topped out at $409.09 (coinbase, from Bitcoin Wisdom’s chart), so we did not move up a box.  

So, we look at the low for the day.  The price dipped to $394.04, so we did drop into our reversal box ever so slightly.  So, we change course again and drop into a column of Os.

We never quite got to the long pole.  And since this reversal is not what I call a reversal with conviction, it is not a bull trap.  It appears to be more of a simple reversal, or pause.  

So, we need to break into the $405 box for another break out.  We need to rise to $415 for another break out.   Because our formation is 2 columns wide, it could be weak.  At best we could break into the $435 range.  But I am getting way ahead of myself.

As we’ve discussed on several posts, there is a lot of resistance in this area.  If we pop above $410, the resistance falls down a bunch and we should be able to rise up further.

A drop down to the $375 box would extend this formation to 15 columns.  Keep that in the back of your head, because that would predict a pretty severe movement one way or the other when it breaks.

Since we have already broken into a reversal for the day (which would be confirmed at 7 PM EST this evening—when the “day” closes.) I am pretty comfortable saying we will bounce around a little here.  If we go higher than $410 I would return some money to the game.  

If I were a long right now, I would not be worried until we got down in the low $380s.  I would look for the conviction of that move (yes, while the chart rules do not look at volume, I do.)

I wonder if anyone out there in China could give us a ""feeling"" about the daily re-pegging of the Yuan and how that might affect your buying and selling decisions.  I keep hearing about it, but I am not sure that there is correlation on ""the ground.""

d02yvm6,Introshine,15,"A lot of shit comments in this topic.

They did seem to have made a pretty serious appourch of a ""blockchain"" type of database. The whitepaper is worth reading:

https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/whitepaper.md

I honestly think this is somewhat of a threat to Bitcoin, technically this looks very advanced already for such a young project. The only thing that Bitcoin project has an advantage is the politics and market cap of the native token.

if you look at this, they seem to have made a ""Sidechain"" type of sub-chain infrastructure. 

https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/raw/master/images/world_view.png

This is not Open, this made to kill the Bitcoin project. I suggest we seriously read into this, instead of brushing it aside. They kinda made a Eth/Ripple/Bitcoin hybrid from the ground up.

**How about concensus?**

Well my Bitcoin friends. There seem to be 3 options at this moment. None (lol), PBFT (broken by sibble-attack), and last but not least SIEVE.

From:https://github.com/openblockchain/obc-docs/blob/master/FAQ/consensus_FAQ.md

&gt;What is the SIEVE Consensus Algorithm?

&gt;There are many limitations in existing consensus algorithms, especially for solving challenges around security, performance, efficiency, and scalability. To solve these problems and make blockchain ready for business, the OBC team has been researching several approaches to improve the existing algorithms.

&gt;One such improvement is “SIEVE”, a consensus algorithm inspired by classic PBFT [Castro and Liskov, OSDI’99] and the Eve consensus protocol [Kapritsos et al., OSDI’2012].

&gt;In short, SIEVE augments the original PBFT algorithm by adding speculative execution and verification phases to: 1) detect and filter out possible non-deterministic requests and establish the determinism of transactions entering the PBFT 3-phase agreement protocol, and **2) allow consensus to be run on output state of validators, in addition to the consensus on their input state offered by Classic PBFT.** SIEVE is derived from PBFT in a modular way (inspired by ideas described in [Aublin et al., TOCS'15]) by reusing the PBFT view-change protocol to lower its complexity and avoid implementing a new consensus protocol from scratch.

&gt;**A research paper will be published by IBM Research to describe this new algorithm in further detail, and we will continue to make further research investments in the subject and share our results with the OBC community.**

d04ma29,tsontar,87,"I've been around Bitcoin since around 2010.

The blocksize limit was always described as ""a temporary antispam measure that can and will be easily removed if we ever get close to hitting it.""  That was the social contract: a Bitcoin that would scale on-chain, and Bitcoin achieved its valuation on the promise of being able to scale up.

In the last year or so, the actions of the Core team have convinced me that there is an ulterior motive at work.  I thik that there might be actually valid reasons for not raising the limit.  However, so many absolutely invalid, dead-wrong, straight-up lies have been told about the situation that Core has utterly lost my confidence as leadership.  *When knowledgeable people lie through their teeth, you have to consider the well poisoned.*

So the good news is that Bitcoin was designed from the outset to be resistant to capture by a hostile dev team.  Self-interested miners and users will simply switch to another dev team that isn't hostile through ""voting with their CPU"" in Satoshi's words, just like any democratic referendum.  *This is Bitcoin's immune system against malicious code.*

However, Core is now selling the idea that such a move is ""civil war.""  According to Core, only Core controls the One True Bitcoin, and any client that deviates from Core's consensus rules is ""hostile.""  Hard-forks are now pitched as ""bad for Bitcoin.""

This gets back to my original point about straight-up lies: trying to convince users that Bitcoin's immune system is in fact a problem that needs to be crushed, *is a direct, full-frontal attack on Bitcoin*, IMO.

So now, it isn't about the blocksize limit any more.  Sure, it needs to be raised, for many reasons.  Now the problem is how to get the people in control of the protocol, out of control.  We need to decentralize development.  Badly.  I don't want to replace Core with Classic.  I want Core, Classic, and maybe some others to compete to see who has the best vision of Bitcoin's future, and then I want an on-chain referendum on that future.

That's what I signed up for.  That's the Bitcoin described in the white paper.  I didn't sign up for ""Greg and Adam being the smartest devs ever"" - I signed up for ""permissionless innovation"" where the best ideas naturally get adopted regardless of the source, and the bad ideas are weeded out because they don't work.  It is my opinion, based on years of watching this argument unfold, that Core is toxic to that process.

TL;DR?

**The blocksize limit is not the problem.  The blocksize limit is a symptom.  The problem is Core.**",2016-02-19 01:18:32

d04rh3z,jensuth,16,"tl;dr: The Bitcoin network is fundamentally *NOT* a timeless record.

-----------

I suspect that people will begin to accept—perhaps without realizing it—that the purpose of Bitcoin is *not* to store for all time a globally recognized record, but rather to provide means by which to calculate the *probability* that some piece of data (*e.g.,* a transaction) will remain for all time as part of such a record.

You don't need the entire record in order to calculate a probability that is sufficiently high for your purposes—hence pruning. Indeed, the subjectivity of sufficiency opens up that calculation to market forces; you can keep the necessary data yourself, or you can pay someone else to keep the necessary data for you, etc.

In the end, all you will be able to do is calculate with sufficiently high probability that you did indeed include some data in what will *likely* be chosen as the timeless record (consider that out of all blocks, the genesis block has the highest probability of remaining in the record, and the latest block has the lowest probability of remaining in the record). However, because nobody necessarily cares about your data, you yourself are going to have to maintain (or later purchase a copy of) the data that is necessary to make that calculation.

d04lbua,usrn,15,"&gt; But is this debate just about that?

No. 

1.) An urgent blocksize limit increase is needed, most importantly to gain some time to refine solutions to handle the blocksize limit long term.
http://www.coindesk.com/data/bitcoin-daily-transactions/

2.) Currently Core (former Bitcoin QT) dominates the network and Blockstream Inc. controls the development of it since 2014.
Which is not just unhealthy for the ecosystem, but there is an apparent conflict of interest between the fundamentals of the system (p2p digital cash) and their agenda (making bitcoin a settlement layer for banks and companies and pushing users off chain).


&gt; What are the impacts on me as a consumer? I just buy/sell BTC and trade it, nothing more. I use it as a currency. But what will classic change for me?

in short: nothing.

Classic proposed to raise the blocksize limit to 2MB only if the ecosystem chooses it. If enough miners and nodes switch to it then activates, if it cannot attract super majority then everything stays the same.

Sadly, BlockstreamCore didn't do anything but spread FUD about all alternative implementations so far, but we are hopeful that enough participants of the system come to their senses and reject the tyranny of Blockstream.",2016-02-19 00:56:21

d06jjih,Zeliek,2036,"This case seems really strange to me for several reasons. After going over your comments, this is what I've been able to discern so far:

 * You're insisting you've *never been hacked* and there is no way someone else has performed the ToS-breaching activity you're apparently being accused of because you use the steam app verification. 

I can theorize from this that either you're completely mistaken, or the hacking incidents are false-positives because you tend to visit very different locales (like Romania) which may lead to suspicions of hacking if you log into steam from vastly different areas. For now, we'll trust your suggestion that you've never been hacked, and that the likely issue behind the false hacking assumptions is location switches.

 * You've ticketed nearly a dozen times with negative responses **after investigations by Steam.** 

This is a little concerning. Not one but two separate customer support teams (Accounts Issues and Steam Client support) have now received and investigated multiple tickets from you and arrived at the same conclusions. 

* Steam threatened to go to the police. 

This is pretty rare, and rather alarming. They don't just throw that around without looking into things.

* Eventual flat out ignoring. 

This usually indicates multiple people have looked at your account and your tickets, and a manager has flagged you as DNR. They don't do that lightly. I don't work for nor represent Steam, so I'm not 100% on their policies, but we can make some reasonable assumptions here that ""just ignore him he's annoying and we can't be assed to waste time on the customer who spends thousands of dollars"" wasn't a conversation that happened. 

* Several emails to GabeN

I'm adding this in here because the guy has a habit of responding to pretty much everything, and has a reputation for personally responding to tickets, especially ones posted here. It's been 3 hours, so we'll give him some time, but really his input into whats going on is the clincher for me, or another valve employee. Reason being, I only have *your* side of the story, and unfortunately things don't look good for you.


**My conclusion:**

OP and his account has been investigated by two different Steam services and multiple employees from each, and all of them arrived at the conclusion he has violated the ToS, and thus been banned. 

Even though Steam hasn't the best (or even noteworthy?) customer service sometimes, logic dictates that it is **far** more likely that OP is guilty than an act of such grandiose negligence/incompetence on the part of multiple Steam employees. We're talking a level of fuck up here that is framed and pointed out to future employees on what not to do. Threatening to call the cops cause they can't tell the difference between a legit hacker's activities and OP's regular behaviour after ~3ish years of you using your account without apparent incident? Two different Steam teams buggering up in the exact same ways? Putting him, a customer who spends a boat load of money, on DNR without fully investigating his ""obvious"" innocence? Yeaaaah okay, OP.  

But! We will see. Perhaps GabeN will swing by with a ""wow, oops"" or another employee. Very likely we will see GabeN swing by and post [this](http://fat.gfycat.com/SoupyCautiousCat.gif) and then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-mnYLPxwtc) and promptly leave. 



**EDIT:**

&gt;You can see that I almost only sell items/keys for cash.

...Where is it you get your keys/items from that you sell? I suspect you have been reported by other players because they have purchased non-functioning/temp game keys from you, whether or not you were aware of it. I'm not very familiar with the Steam trading services but AFAIK you can't trade for cash, so you've got to be using outsider trading like Paypal or what have you. Not to mention the items.

Also, keep in mind Steam can and *does* read your chat logs through Steam, so if one of your customers messaged you and said ""hey whats the deal"" and you said ""lol thanks for the money scrub,"" that could be why Steam was able to shut you down without much effort. They also *can't* see what you do outside Steam, so if you've been receiving stolen goods and paying for them with Paypal, it literally will look like your account is a mule for stolen games without you being able to prove you aren't.

&gt;I may trade with scammers, I don't know. The ToS only says I *shouldn't* trade outside of Steam with Paypal/Bitcoin cause I'll probably end up working with scammers, it doesn't say that I'm not allowed to. I shouldn't be banned because I thought to myself, ""So what? Only idiots end up working with scammers, Steam is just being silly"" and then ended up working with scammers *after thousands of transactions.* 


*""No, John. You are the demons. And then, ~~John~~ OP was a ~~zombie~~ scammer.""*

**You can't buy broken/stolen game keys, stolen CSGO keys/items and sell them to people and then [go like this](http://a1.web.wt-cdn.com/post_items/images/000/034/583/original/shrug_gif.gif) and expect Steam not to get angry when they get irrate tickets from your screwed-over customers.**

*Ignorantia juris non excusat,* you can't ignore the warnings of the ToS not to trade outside of Steam because the enormous likelihood of scamming, complete thousands of transactions, and then go ""woops, yeah I sold a whole bunch of people stolen games, but I had a ""don't ask don't tell"" policy with the guys providing the games, so it isn't my fault because technically I didn't know."" 

**You can't traffic stolen goods, man.**

**EDIT 4:**

&gt;This is how I trade. I buy cheap items from different websites such as opskins, bitskins, etc... I then trade those items for keys or overpay in items (which I then sell for keys) once I get a good amount of keys I sell them for paypal and bitcoins and start all over again. **I could be unknowningly trafficking stolen keys but I wouldn't be the 1st one in line** if that makes sense (like I would buy them off of legit traders who prob bought them off of scammers or something)

[I understand, I do.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/877/239/d40.gif) It matters not where in the line you are, what matter is *you're in the damn line in the first place.* Steam **cannot** differentiate between your account and one of the many other mules the stolen goods have been passed through *because you operated outside of Steam.* GabeN is, unfortunately for you, not omniscient, despite prior claims of this sub.

d06zqoe,DTanner,124,"The CEO of a VC-backed private corporation, and a handful of Chinese miners, just unilaterally decided the future of Bitcoin. And they have the *gall* to call it consensus.

This is bad, really bad.

**Editing this comment to respond in one place to the army of throwaway accounts jumping down my throat:**

What would consensus look like? In my view there are five main groups that would need to agree on changes to Bitcoin to achieve consensus: The developers (the code), the miners (the hashpower), the nodes (the network), the exchanges and payment processors (the economic majority), and of course the users (Bitcoin early adopters). The users don't really steer the ship, they just vote by deciding to use/hold Bitcoin, and they'll vote by buying alt-coins if they don't agree with the direction the other four take.

At this meeting there are only representatives of two of those groups; the code and the hashpower. Missing from the developers are extremely important people like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's chief scientist), and Jeff Garzik. It looks like the majority of the hashpower was present, but not all (Slush for example), who have decided *a hard fork to 2 MB needs to happen urgently, not over a year from now*.

Calling this tiny meeting consensus? Laughable.

As to VC-backed Blockstream taking control of the Bitcoin protocol, they have a fiduciary duty to create a return for their investors. Their business plan is to profit from protocols built on top of Bitcoin, protocols that benefit from a crippled Bitcoin layer usable only for settlement. All their actions so far show they have a laser-like focus on enabling features in Bitcoin that will benefit the Lightning Network, while restricting the throughput of the Bitcoin network as much as possible until their product is ready to sell.

This will backfire, the users and the economic majority will move to a network that functions correctly.

d071ibl,jstolfi,45,"No.  

SW or SegWit is Segregated Witnesses, a horrible crock of a hack invented by Peter Wuille and Luke Jr.  It means moving all transaction signature scripts and signatures to an ""extension record"" that most clients will not see.  Its only real merit is to make the transaction IDs independent of the signatures, which fixes the so-called ""malleability bugs"", hopefully without creating any others.  

There is a much simpler way to fix the malleability bugs, but it would require a hard fork (HF) type of change.  Deploying a hard fork change requires getting the agreement of a large majority of the the miners (75% at least), then giving advance warning all users to upgrade their wallet software, because after a certain date they will not be able to use their coins until they do it.  

Back in 2010, Satoshi explained how to do a hard fork, and he thought that it would be a non-event if started well in advance.  But one of his great mistakes was overestimating the intelligence and maturity of the bitcoin users. 

The SW patch is ugly and complicated because Blockstream/Core  want to deploy it as a soft fork -- that is, as soon as a majority of the miners agreed to do it, without the need for a wider agreement among miners or anyone else, and without teelling the users that they had to upgrade.  

A side effect of their SW solution is that the Core developers will be able to put all sort of data that Blockstream needs into the extension record, without bothering to tell the users: again, they will only need the agreement of a simple majority of the miners.  (That means AntPool, F2Pool, and any other miner of your choice; or several other combinations of 3 and 4 miners.)

SW as soft fork will require substantial changes to every piece of software that wants to check or inspect the signatures.  It will also get users who do not upgrade increasingly confused, because they will see bitcoins on the blockchain that look like they could spend, but any attempts to do so will fail -- because the hidden signature scripts require some conditions that they can't see.

Blockstream also claims that SW will be equivalent to a block size limit increase, but estimates of that effect range from 0.5 MB to 1 MB, maximum, depending on how many clients upgrade to use the SW format.  So the network will become congested anyway, and it will be unable to handle more than 3-4 transactions per second, even with full SW adoption.  The demand is currently ~2 tx/s, so saturation is already occurring and will be definitive by the end of the year.  

A real increase of the capacity would require a hard fork, that changed one number in the Core software -- the maximum allowed block size -- from its curent 1 MB to some larger value.  By logic, the new value should be well above the current block size, say 20 MB or more.  But Blockstream's intransigent oppostion forced Gavin and other proponents of that chance to reduce the goal to 8 MB, then 4 MB, then finally the ridiculous 2 MB of the Classic proposal -- which will then require another hard fork a year or two later, if traffic continues to grow as it has.

But Blockstream is determined to prevent any increase in that parameter.  Greg Maxwell thinks that Satoshi's design, which had no arbitrary block size limit, should be replaced by his own design, that has limited block space and users competing for it in a crazy running auction, the ""fee market"".  Blockstream believes that Greg Maxwell is smarter than Satoshi, because that is the consensus among Greg, Greg, Greg, and eveybody who believes that.",2016-02-20 23:24:38
d06b674,[deleted],40,"&gt; I mostly would do paypal, bitcoin trading

Alright, I'm gonna make an educated guess.

At one point or another, you bought an item with something outside of the Steam economy (IE: traded X bitcoins for Y items), and on Steam's end, it looked like you received some item(s) for free. Unfortunately, the user you traded with had stolen or illegitimately acquired the items, and was moving quickly to get rid of them in exchange for something.

On your end, it was a legit transaction, but from the Steam POV, it looks like you traded nothing and received something. This looks suspect and there is unfortunately no legitimate way to protect you in this trade because it just looks sketchy from the outside. If you trade outside of the Steam economy, this is something that can happen to you, unfortunately. 

You assume the risk when you do transactions involving paypal/bitcoins/etc, and it looks like it happened to you more than once... and again, from Steam's POV, it looks like you were receiving items for free, and thus you get roped in with the punishment. They can't protect you if there isn't any substantial proof that is within the Steam economy. You mentioned in your ticket that the last time this happened, they had found you connected to stolen/laundered items. If you're receiving stolen/laundered items completely for free (from their POV, even if you traded bitcoins or something for it there is no evidence that Valve can legitimately see), it looks like you're in on it.

d06m1so,willfe42,27,"&gt; While the SEC asserts that bitcoin mining contracts are securities, the FBI has declared Bitcoin as “property” while FinCEN seems to be regulating it as a currency.

Yes, and there's nothing inconsistent or ""complex"" about it. The comparison is apples-to-oranges.

Bit-coins are property -- they have value and can be stolen, and that theft is a crime. Since the FBI's domain is criminal investigations, it sees bit-coins as property. This is reasonable.

Bit-coin is a currency -- it's an exchangeable store of value that can be used to settle debts and transact business in lieu of direct barter. Since FinCEN's domain is the regulation of activities related to storing, exchanging and transmitting it, it sees bit-coin as a currency. This is reasonable.

A bit-coin mining contract is not a bit-coin. It's a legal agreement between two parties. It's not property or currency even though it refers to both.

It _does_ offer an investment opportunity to the buyer: ""spend X dollars now and receive the fruits of service Y (whose primary goal is to generate income) for Z period of time."" That's a security. Since the SEC regulates securities (it's in the name, after all), it considers bit-coin mining contracts to be securities. This is also reasonable.

&gt; This increasing complexity, confusion and at times inconsistency of the government’s policy towards bitcoin regulation only highlights the importance of continuing the discussion on Bitcoin regulation

d07ijwo,IDUnavailable,2393,"Here's some perspective, facts, trends, damage control, whatever you want to call it.

Bernie is losing Nevada by 4.3% (as of me typing this with 80% in). This sucks and is obviously worse than tying or winning, no doubt. But never forget that Bernie was losing by over 45% in Nevada a year ago, he was losing by 23% as recently as late  December.

It is important to remember that, despite some backpedaling, **this is part of Clinton's ""firewall"" that's supposed to stop Sanders.** He was definitely supposed to lose here as of a few weeks ago, but his nationwide surge made people temper expectations in case things went poorly for her.

Obama lost Nevada by 5.7%, a larger margin than the one Bernie just lost by (as of right now), and he tied in delegates (no idea how that will go this time around). While it's true that Obama also won Iowa and South Carolina, he lost in New Hampshire. Their campaign trajectories may seem similar in the boarder national picture, but not as much on a state-by-state basis.

Someones's reading this right now going ""pfft, crazy Sanders supporters will justify everything! Just like Bitcoin, everything is good news for Bernie."" I say this not to say ""Nevada doesn't count, hahaha!"" I say it because there's a lot of hype around Bernie right now, and there's a lot of people on here are very overly emotional and very prone to mood swings based on what I've seen. This isn't good for Sanders, but it isn't a deathknell by any stretch of the imagination either. 

I don't recall seeing Clinton looking at the fact that she's dropped by massive margins in the last few months and giving up. I don't recall Clinton giving up after Sanders outperformed the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. I don't recall seeing Clinton flipping out because the national polls continue to drop day-by-day, despite the fact that she's not expected to ever trend back in the other direction. So why should Sanders supporters just suddenly lose hope and surrender because he met the expectations of pollsters/pundits for once instead of exceeding them? From Nate Silver: 
&gt;""Clinton was favored by 4 percentage points in our “polls-only” forecast of Nevada, close to what is likely to be her eventual winning margin of about 6 percentage points. Our “polls-plus” forecast, which projected Clinton to win by 6, may be slightly closer still.""

Super Tuesday is 10 days away. Again, according to [Nate Silver and 538](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanderss-path-to-the-nomination/), Clinton should win by +15 points in Nevada if she's up nationally as much as some polls have said (+12). She should win by +3 if they're tied nationally. Sanders definitely didn't lose by 12 points, and is still trending up nationwide. 

Super Tuesday is going to be probably the single most important day in the primary. It has that combination of early momentum to set the pace for the rest of the primaries, and a huge number of states voting. Things are still going in the right direction in SC, and they're trending in the right direction nationally. 

**Sanders has been outspending Clinton in many places and out-organizing her due to his immense grassroots support. Clinton may be able to double down and stem the tide when she only has one favorable state to deal with every week or so, but she can continue to lose ground in Super Tuesday states as she fails to match Bernie's grassroots organization and money.**

d082hi8,maaku7,69,"Segwit more than fully exhausts the entire available capacity in its presently coded form with the 75% discount and 1MB non-witness block size. Already we've compromised by agreeing to a worst-case 4MB block size while experimental evidence shows problems emerging at 3MB (and the compromise of spending our available time on this issue instead of fungibility fixes to the more pressing existential threat of chain analytics and redlisting). So where does that extra capacity come from for the hard fork to be delivered 5 months from now?

By lowering the discount? That reduces the effectiveness of the system by maintaining false incentives and not making use of full capacity available if one assumes a safe buffer.

By having a separate block size limit counted differently than the segwit discount? Now transaction selection is a multidimensional problem that doesn't depend solely on the properties of a transaction in isolation, thereby throwing out all the work that has been done towards making fee policy predictable or even consistent (not to mention the vastly more complicated code).

By simply increasing the block size even though the network doesn't support safely doing so, as a political compromise? What happens when we hit the new limit a few months later? This road leads to political money with none of the user protections Bitcoin currently provides. If Bitcoin's fundamental properties (in this case, it's resilience to block authoring centralization) are subject to negotiated concessions with a centralized entities behind closed doors at an invite-only meeting, then the writing is on the wall.

It also brings all the dangers of a hard-fork for what benefit? My understanding (2nd-hand information) is that the bump being discussed is less than 2MB. If we are going to consciously undertake the risks of a hard-fork, we should use the time available to make changes that more definitively solve the problem, rather than kick the can with a modest bump that would be insufficient even by the time it activates.

The capacity increase roadmap I signed onto is that we will use up existing capacity in a quickly-deployable soft-fork, meanwhile we will pursue technologies which lead to increasing available capacity for safely scaling by larger factors (e.g. technologies which mitigate the negative block relay effects of the Great Firewall), then we measure the increased capacity using objective metrics, and only then do we consider setting dates and details for block size increases. This is data-driven engineering. It leads to optimal solutions and guarantees of safety.

This roundtable agreement is the opposite: it sets dates, then it guesses about available capacity at that time, which informs parameter choices, and an engineering plan is chosen based on what can be accomplished in that timeframe. This is politics-driven engineering. It leads to horribly inefficient design-by-committee solutions and absolutely no guarantees of safety.

&gt; It saddens me that we had to settle to please miners and the populist demands, but its probably the least harmful path forwards.

We don't have to settle with miners. Miners have no involvement in a hard fork whatsoever. Miners serve the users, not the other way around. If it ever came to be that miners dictated or forced the terms of consensus rule changes, that would be immediate justification for a proof of work change.

As for populist demands, Reddit echochambers do not constitute ""the community."" There are millions of bitcoin users around the globe, and only a small fraction of them congregate in online fora like this. Actually working with Bitcoin users and attending local meetups gives a very different perspective about what Bitcoin users want...

As for being the least harmful path forwards, I hope the above explains why I feel it is in fact the most dangerous option on the table.",2016-02-21 22:16:56
d076uh1,ferretinjapan,60,"""True believer"" here, (at least since 2010). Also a node runner, daily poster, etc, etc, etc. . Honestly, I'm already hedging my bets in alts like LTC, and other more genuine coins that have already learned from the mistakes of BTC like Monero. But I've only begun to do so in the last 4-5 months. Before that I was 100% Bitcoin.

Frankly, it's a shitty situation all round, I've not given up by any means, but I'm very seriously extending one leg outside the exit just in case. I'm convinced that if Blockstream Core still has a strangle hold on miners in a years time, then Bitcoin is 100% fucked. There is literally no future with Blockstream, it will simply become a ripple-ised Bitcoin in many senses. That said, miners still have not fully shown their hand which is hopeful, but they are naive if they think they can hold their hand forever. People are already getting cold feet, some are holding back and many just want an answer. The fact that miners are fearful of angering core devs is a fucking JOKE, the real people they in danger of pissing off are the users that can dump en masse MILLIONS of coins at zero notice if they make the wrong decision. It utterly bewilders me how miners are so fucking retarded. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

My honest advice, firstly don't risk more than you are willing to lose, keep the rest in BTC in case the miners smarten up, then give it a year, if Blockstream still rules supreme, then you can be assured that Bitcoin is no longer going to lead society to a better future.

d074899,eragmus,41,"**Falsity #1:**
&gt; The CEO of a VC-backed private corporation, and a handful of Chinese miners, just unilaterally decided the future of Bitcoin

*Reality:*

Adam Back (President of VC-backed company, just like the other dozens of VC-backed companies in Bitcoin btw), Cory Fields, Matt Corallo, Luke Jr, Peter Todd, and Johnson Lau *all* negotiated with... not a ""handful of Chinese miners"", but with: Antpool, F2Pool, BW, BTCC, BitFury, Haobtc, LightingMiner, Huobi, OKCoin.

**Falsity #2:**
&gt; And they have the gall to call it consensus // Calling this tiny meeting consensus? Laughable.

*Reality:*

Well, when members of Core (the dev team that represents 90%+ of the technical community) + ~90% of hashrate agree on something, then yes, that's typically known as a rough ""consensus"". The rest of Core still would need to come to consensus, but this is a nice start.
&gt; https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff

Also, this involves the largest Bitcoin USD exchange by volume (BitFinex). You may want to note the recently released Bitcoin Roundtable letter, for more of the parties making ""consensus"", since you are hugely underestimating who is involved:
&gt; https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/a-call-for-consensus-d96d5560d8d6

**Falsity #3:**
&gt; Missing from the developers are extremely important people like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's chief scientist), and Jeff Garzik

*Reality:*

Gavin is ""Chief Scientist"" *not* of Bitcoin, but of the virtually bankrupt Bitcoin Foundation. He is also an Advisor to Coinbase, and holds equity in Coinbase (conflict of interest). Furthermore, Gavin's contributions to Bitcoin's code in the last few years has been minimal. He's still an important figure, in the sense that he also has a degree of expertise with Bitcoin, as does Garzik.

However, they are 2 people only. As previously mentioned, 90% of Bitcoin's technical community is aligned on Core's roadmap. Gavin + Garzik certainly do not trump the others.

**Falsity #4:**
&gt; Missing from the hashpower is the single biggest pool Antpool and other pools like Slush

*Reality:*

Antpool was part of negotiations. Slush has 7% hashrate (and plans to make it selectable by their miners which fork they want to support -- so they are neutral miner); the other 90% of hashrate participated.

**Falsity #5:**
&gt; the nodes (the network), the exchanges and payment processors (the economic majority), and of course the users (Bitcoin early adopters)

*Reality:*

You imply these are not on Core's side. Let me correct that for you.

Nodes: 80% are with Core
&gt; https://bitnodes.21.co/nodes/

Early adopters (rich users): They are overwhelmingly in favor of Core, by one of the only measurements known.
&gt; http://bitcoinocracy.com/

Exchanges: Largest USD exchange (Bitfinex), largest CNY exchange (OKCoin) are all part of the negotiations. Further, Bitfinex is BitGo's largest customer, and hence by default controls BitGo's decision (and BitGo powers most other exchanges).

**Falsity #6:**
&gt; a) As to VC-backed Blockstream taking control of the Bitcoin protocol // b) Their business plan is to profit from protocols built on top of Bitcoin, protocols that benefit from a crippled Bitcoin layer usable only for settlement // c) laser-like focus on enabling features in Bitcoin that will benefit the Lightning Network // d) restricting the throughput of the Bitcoin network as much as possible until their product is ready to sell

*Reality:*

a) Blockstream isn't ""taking control"" of anything. This is the typical FUD seen elsewhere non-stop for 1.5 years, despite obvious contrary evidence / logic. Bitcoin Core is an openly/publicly developed open-source software, with developers from many different organizations, not just Blockstream. You insult them all by implying they are all part of Blockstream.
&gt; https://bitcoin.org/en/development#bitcoin-core-contributors

b) Their plan is to profit from *sidechains*, which have *zero* to do with Bitcoin as a settlement layer that has restricted layer 1 scaling. You should probably learn what you're talking about, so you don't conflate these two concepts. Liquid is an example of a private sidechain they're selling to market exchanges to increase inter-exchange liquidity.
&gt; https://blockstream.com/2015/10/12/introducing-liquid/

&gt; https://blockstream.com/2015/11/02/liquid-recap-and-faq/

c) LN is the single best hope for massive Bitcoin scaling. LN is a decentralized layer 2 for Bitcoin, and is not owned by anyone... not the least Blockstream. Blockstream *donates* the services of 1 employee to further LN. LN itself is being developed by at least 2 other teams, composing maybe 10 other people.
&gt; https://github.com/LightningNetwork

d) As mentioned in (b), their products have nothing to do with Bitcoin scaling. Further, they are restricting TPS capacity according to technical constraints. These constraints have been discussed innumerable times on r/bitcoin, if you ever cared to read and do some studying. There have been all manner of podcasts, papers, interviews, etc. discussing Bitcoin's technical matters on scaling. If you spent as much time studying, as you did getting ""outraged"", you might have learned something by now.

d07nnzu,Peter__R,34,"No, this is FUD.  

Bitcoin Unlimited will follow the longest chain.  If for some reason a 2 MB block is mined and the majority of the hash power ignores it, BU will revert back to the 1MB chain when it becomes longest.  The orphaning of the 2MB block will be no different than the everyday occurrence of a regular block being orphaned.

Another way to see that BU is perfectly safe is to imagine we were *soft forking* from 2 MB to 1 MB.  We've learned from experience that it's OK for nodes to begin enforcing the new restricted rules *after* the soft-forking event. In other words, it would be OK for nodes to enforce the 2MB block size limit even after the miners soft fork to 1 MB.  Now imagine the reverse process of a hard fork from 1MB to 2MB: it's similarly OK for nodes to loosen their acceptance rules and accept 2MB *before* the hard-forking event.  

For a soft-forking change, nodes can upgrade asynchronously *after* the miners start enforcing a new rule. For a hard-forking change, nodes can upgrade asynchronously *before* the miners stop enforcing an old rule.",2016-02-21 10:42:40

A group convened in Hong Kong to discuss two specific technical items:

- [Segregated Witness](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/lets-talk-bitcoin-277-separating-signatures-with-segregated-witness) (SegWit); and
- a hard fork increase to the block size limit

Present were members of the Bitcoin Core team, miners, exchanges, and other groups. The group unanimously agreed to the following:

1. SegWit will continue to be developed as a soft fork. Expected release date is April 2016.
2. A hard fork update will be developed ""based on the improvements in SegWit."" Expected release date is June 2016.
3. The hard fork will expand non-witness block space (regular block space) to 2 MB. The combination of SegWit and the hard fork will expand effective block size to up to 4 MB.
4. The hard fork may contain other, unspecified, changes.
5. Members agreed to run only ""Bitcoin Core-compatible"" systems for the ""foreseeable future.""
6. Hard fork activation is expected to happen around July 2017.

Of all these points, I'd say (4) is the most important. An impressive hard fork wish list has been growing over the last 5 years:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist

A hard fork update isn't easy to pull off, and I suspect many would like this to be the last one for a very long time. The tension between including as many new features as possible and sticking to the task at hand could prove challenging.

I'm also of the opinion that this meeting is very very far from representing the threshold of ""rough consensus"" required for protocol changes. And I really dislike that Core developers had to settle with the miners, reinforcing the wrong idea of miners having power over protocol development.

Still, this seems like a good basis to start building community-wide consensus, and the letter is carefully worded such that its clear that it only represents the people attending the meeting and does not represent a commitment from the wider technical community (which they don't have the authority to give anyway).

The following days will tell more about whether this gets consensus or not. I only hope that others in the technical community will have the courage to speak up if the proposal does not stand on technical merits, rather than give-in to pressure from the miners.

d094bbp,SirEDCaLot,101,"Okay here's the quick version.  There are two sides to this- technical and social.

Let's start with the technical.

There are blocks every 10 mins, and right now a hard coded limit prevents blocks from being larger than 1MB.  That means the total transaction capacity of the Bitcoin network is 1MB per 10mins, which means somewhere between 3 and 7 transactions per second depending on how big the transactions are.  

Changing this is problematic, since every single node and wallet out there has the hard coded 1MB limit.  That means if a block is mined above 1MB it will be rejected.  

This limit was introduced by Satoshi years ago back when blocks were in the sub-100KB range.  It was designed as a last ditch spam filter, so an attack couldn't flood the Blockchain with useless data too quickly.  Satoshi inteded it to be raised before a raise would be needed, IE pick some block in the far future (a few major releases away) and say 'as of block X, the new block size limit is Y'.  

Unfortunately we kicked the can down the road too many times.  Today we often have full blocks which causes a transaction backlog.  

Bitcoin-Core is the 'official' Bitcoin client, previously called Bitcoin-qt.  Its developers do not want to raise the block size because doing so creates a hard fork- a situation where any clients who haven't upgraded will reject the new bigger block and potentially keep mining on the older smaller blocks.  That could create two parallel blockchains.  Core developers propose a system called SegWit, a complex new type of transaction that allows moving some of the block data outside of the block so it doesn't get counted.  SegWit fixes some other problems also like transaction malleability.  However for SegWit to work, every node and wallet will have to implement SegWit, which is non trivial.  

Gavin Andresen (Satoshi's appointed successor) and some others have been pushing to increase the block size limit for some time however the other Core developers have refused to do it.  To make a long story short, Gavin is now working on an alternative software called Bitcoin Classic.  It's the same as Core except it provides a method to safely increase the block size limit.  Under Classic, when 750 of the previous 1000 blocks contain a tag denoting them as Classic blocks, a 1 month countdown begins.  At the end of that month, all Classic (and compatible) nodes increase their block size limit to 2MB.  

Classic fans believe this is a responsible way to increase the block size as it gives miners and nodes plenty of time and notice to upgrade.  Classic supporters like a simple block size increase because someone running a hosted wallet can support the new blocks by changing one line of code.  

Core fans support SegWit because a hard fork is seen as too risky.  Most Core fans do not consider it a big problem if the transaction volume exceeds block space, because we can simply start pruning the mempool (throwing away some unconfirmed transactions).  Classic supporters strongly oppose this because it means 0-conf transactions (transactions which are submitted but not yet confirmed into a block) become essentially worthless at point of sale.  

-----

The social side is a lot dumber.  /r/Bitcoin moderator Theymos, who also operates the bitcointalk.org forums, has decided that any hard fork which does not come from the Core developers is a hostile attack on Bitcoin itself.  To that end he has declared that the result after a hard fork is an altcoin (as it's no longer compatible with Bitcoin-Core) and thus is offtopic for discussion on Bitcoin forums he manages.  That means a LOT of threads about Bitcoin Classic or advocating a hard fork get deleted on /r/Bitcoin and bitcointalk.  

Then there's Blockstream- a private corporation that is (among other things) working on sidechain tech.  The idea of a sidechain is that you can have many transactions happen on a separate network in a cryptographically safe manner, and only at the end does a small number of settlement transactions hit the main Blockchain.  Blockstream employs several Bitcoin-Core developers, and if the block size limit isn't raised then sidechain tech might be required to keep Bitcoin in any way usable.  

The result of all this is a once heated discussion has become actively hostile.  Core users accuse Classic supporters of trying to subvert Bitcoin with a hostile attack, and trying to make the Blockchain grow so fast that people won't be able to store it, leading to centralization.  Classic supporters accuse Theymos of censorship, and accuse Core developers of working for Blockstream's best interest rather than Bitcoin.  

The sense of pride, that we are building something new and amazing, and cooperation that we are all here to make that amazing thing take flight, has pretty much gone away.  It's quite sad.  I've been involved with online communities for over a decade, and I have literally never seen such an amazing cooperative community split so hard and turn so hostile so quickly as Bitcoin has.  

There is hope though- as with most large groups, most of the hostility comes from a small number of people.  However right now it still drowns out most other things.

d08u0p3,Cryptolution,24,"&gt; Any uptake by Core or other projects remains to be seen.

I agree with you that we should wait to reserve any hasty judgement on consensus and core planning until official notice, but it would be naive to not recognize that some of the most conservative members of core were present and agreed with the proposed path forward.

This is clearly a political process, but also a process that will echo within cores chambers and traction will be likely, since the most conservative dev's are sold.

Im a little confused with all the back and forth that has been going on lately. There's a faction that is really representative to the fact that we need a scheduled hardfork, but now that we are seeing the formation of that proposal, we now have a faction thats decreeing that consensus is not derived from people sitting in one room.

I actually beg to disagree on a basic psychological fundamentalism with social behaviors. Clearly there is a large faction that is going to follow core without any regard to the path forward, so long as it is not *extreme*. This would be the conservative faction that has an appeal to authority that will support anything that comes out of the satoshi github repository. I would state with consideration for bias that this faction has fundamental justification for this behavior, considering the history of core and its well respected members. Its a impressive list, and quite diverse with a lot of counter-opposing ideas within. This is *good*. I would like to see Gavin, Jeff continue to work within core because the balancing of ideas is important and its *really* important that there be contrasting views for the health of the ecosystem.

Meaning that anything that core proposes, we will see a majority of the users support it by default, so long again, as its *not extreme*. This means that while full consensus is not built within a room, it has a strong influence to creating consensus industry wide through the microphone piece (satoshi github/core).

The analogy is akin to the white house. The president, while he does have veto and executive orders, he cannot change the outcome of congress (miners) except *by the means of using the whitehouse as a propaganda platform to build rapport with the citizens of the nation*. With these citizens being the constituents in a representative democracy, this is a 2nd layer approach to try to influence congress by proxy through the people. Now I understand that we can go into complexities like representatives not doing what the constituents want (miners ignoring users) but I think for the most part the users have the ultimate power as the final say (I will use this software or I will use a different software). Further, users have the power to vote out both congress and the president *at any time*, which is a improvement on the representative-democracy model in comparison here.

Core is in a similar position where their platform allows them a advantage to build consensus by vocalizing their support, which comes in the form of software releases, core issued statements with signatures, or the ACK process on the devlist signaling strong support for issues.

I would say that the establishment (core), is already a political party by default, even if they dont try to be. Even if you would disagree with this ideology, I think its ultimately clear that they are *at least* a central planning committee that is influenced the same as all humans are.

And I think this recent ""consensus"" is a transparent example of this political process and how the final result is molded by it, regardless of what it may be.

And I think those who wanted the HF need to be happy with the compromise, and that core should *really* hope that the blocksize limit is not hit, creating a artificial market that prices some users out or frustrates people into moving to another software system, be it bitcoin or a altcoin. This would also cause another HF war with alternative clients offering to ""fix"" the situation by raising the limit.

With all that said, I think gavin is merely expressing his frustration at the political process, by recognizing it for exactly what it is - a political process/central planning committee. And if they can decide these things, then they can decide these other things, right?

I hope that lukejr builds a solid platform for the future HF proposals so that we have better consensus logic in the future, and less political process. I think he would agree its a threat to the system, same as dwindling decentralization is.",2016-02-22 11:47:10

This is why Blockstream IMO is probably bribing the miners now. They're starting the bribe relationship because miners won't make any profit in the future once Bitcoin itself becomes rarely used due to transactions happening off chain. Once profits for miners drops low enough I imagine Blockstream will buy majority mining interests outright. They will own devs, mining, and the protocol altogether.

They'll probably actually eventually provide a fairly compelling competitor to fiat because most people simply don't care about privacy and decentralization enough to fight.

d0a2ofl,zsaleeba,60,"Strictly speaking bitcoin proof of work *is* productive - its purpose is to secure the network against attack and it does that. But that's not to say it couldn't also be a useful type of computation in other ways at the same time. Unfortunately no-one's thought of good ways to make it useful yet ([depending on your definition of useful](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/primecoin-the-cryptocurrency-whose-mining-is-actually-useful-1373298534)). The problem is that for bitcoin mining work to be useful in securing the network it has to satisfy a number of criteria which make it pretty hard to turn into a general calculation:

1. It must require a significant amount of work to find an ""answer"".
* But it must also be very cheap for everyone else to verify that the answer is correct once it's found so they can verify that the work was actually done.
* Since it's a race every few minutes to find the next winning answer there has to be way for the winner to be random based on the amount of compute they're doing so the reward is shared fairly.
* The amount of work required has to be variable so the ""difficulty"" can be adjusted as the network increases in size and miners get faster.

The existing bitcoin algorithm does it this way: it searches a large key space for keys which produce a given SHA256 pattern. The pattern to match on can be varied in length to adjust the difficulty. This relatively simple computation satisfies all the criteria above but it isn't really useful for anything else.

It's hard to think of any useful computational tasks which have all of these attributes. Most general computational tasks wouldn't satisfy these criteria.",2016-02-23 10:57:58

Smaller blocks can be a competitive advantage for larger companies, because they can:

a) Contract with big miners or pools for guaranteed block space or ""preferred"" inclusion of some number of their transactions.

b) Arrange once-a-day (or -hour/-week/-month) settlement with other large companies with whom their customers do a lot of transactions. E.g. Coinbase and BitPay might agree that any payment from a Coinbase customer to a BitPay merchant settles immediately off-chain, and is combined with all the other such payments into a single on-chain settling transaction.

That work (which is engineering and business development and lawyers) only makes sense if the savings and improved customer experience outweigh the costs.

Big, well-funded companies like Coinbase can afford it. Little companies may get squeezed out, and individuals will have an increasingly strong incentive to use a service like Coinbase's centrally managed wallet-- it will be more reliable and cost less.

If Brian was running a really big, old company then maybe he would be all for keeping the block size low to drive more business his way.

Mods please let us have this convo.  Friends, let's please not turn this into a personal attack thread.  For my part I'd prefer no more names were mentioned in this convo.  

We need to attack *principles* not *personalities*.

One of my biggest problems with Core is the lack of ethical center.  For myself: censorship, deliberate misinformation, DDoS, and the attempt to stifle a free and fair competitive Bitcoin space are not ""tactics to be employed"" they are ""breakdowns of moral order.""

(Edit: Core does not need to engage in these tactics itself to be complicit: the term [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) applies here, as ""Core"" in the context of this discussion is a larger group that includes not just the developers, but also all of their accomplices).

You don't take business management classes in crypto school.  Otherwise, you might learn the valuable lesson:

""The culture of an organization is set at the top.""

Now ostensibly, the ""top"" of the Core organization is [REDACTED, on the grounds of principles not personalities], because git has very clear hierarchical responsibilities, and technically this individual has the final say on what goes into Core by virtue of the design of the code repo.

This individual however does not lead.  He is a figurehead who serves to rubber-stamp commits that are ""accepted"" by the rest of the team through their voting process.  Past that, by all observations, he is simply a git-repository mechanic who does not take sides on anything (AFAIK).

That means there is no formal leader whatsoever.

They don't teach political science at cryptography school, otherwise the Core team would have learned that the anarchical system left behind by an absentee monarch is characterized as ""[mob rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies)"" which leads to predictable breakdowns of order and ultimately, thug rule.  And in fact, escaping 'thug rule' is why /r/btc exists.

Once it became clear to me that there was a breakdown of the ethical center of that team, the ""issues"" took a backseat.

I've always subscribed to the higher-order logic that says, ""if you have to resort to bullying, censorship, intimidation, and lying, it's because you don't actually have an intellectual, logical leg to stand on.""  Why listen to them?  I couldn't care less what they have to say anymore.  It's not even possible to have a technical conversation with these people, as the communication channels have been censored.  *The well has been poisoned.*

Issues like blocksize, RBF, LN, etc. - these are all distractions.  They aren't the problem.  They are the symptoms.  

**Failure of governance is the problem.**

And as an aside to /u/evoorhees, whom I respect: silencing dissent is *toxic* to the community.  Trying to shepherd all the dissenters into one political party leads to [known political outcomes, like this.](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2012/06/tiananmen-square-then-and-now/t01_90605094/main_1200.jpg)

It's not Ethereum's fault to keep evolving and keep building upon the Bitcoin idea. It's Bitcoin's fault for stagnating.

d0bb4ri,drwasho,177,"Bitcoin Core isn't alarmed by this, and they won't be alarmed by this... it's actually part of their design.

They fundamentally believe a _fee market_ is necessary to pay for the security of the network, which means blocks need to full in order for transactions to be caught in a bidding war (in terms of fees) to be cleared from the mempool into the blockchain.

Bitcoin Core's reluctance to increase the block size isn't derived primarily from decentralization concerns, but their eagerness to see the emergence of a fee market. 

They have ruled-out paying for the security of the network by transaction volume with smaller fees. Overall this means that if the miners decide to stick with Core, the economic properties of Bitcoin that you're used to will be radically changed. Little by little, transactions will be priced out of the blockchain transforming Bitcoin from e-cash to a settlement system.

I've said this in other places, but I view this as the real *hard fork* of Bitcoin, not some token change in the block size limit.

Gotta agree with this. The emergence of a fee market is the bigger of the two changes compared to segwit\blocksize increase IMO. It impacts nearly every part of the game theory and network. Miners, nodes, software, exchanges... everything. 

EDIT: At the end of the day yes a fee market is supposed to overtake the block reward as a suitable security against network attack as coin inflation slowly slows as the years progress, but there hasn't been much of any talk about WHEN this switch over should occur, how much of a spam tx should be limited, where this cutoff should be, etc. Additionally, those who propose that making a fee market means more rewards for miners... economics 101 is any artificial limit imposed to a network that disrupts the natural equilibrium of supply (block space) or demand (transactions) creates a deadweight loss (total fee revenue) [See here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Deadweight-loss-price-ceiling.svg/2000px-Deadweight-loss-price-ceiling.svg.png).",2016-02-24 09:54:10

d0byl5a,petertodd,29,"&gt; He did originally sign as Blockstream President, but the medium post was later edited.

The Medium post wasn't officially released with Adam Back as 'Blockstream President' - you're thinking of the draft, which was released publicly by accident.

FWIW, Adam Back wasn't the person who actually typed in ""Blockstream President"" in the original Medium draft - IIRC the document was edited on Samson Mow's laptop and he probably actually typed it in based on what he assumed Adam Back would sign as.

Before the final copy was released officially Adam Back asked for that title to be changed to individual after consulting with others, including other Blockstream employees, as well non-Blockstream Bitcoin devs such as myself, both at the meeting and on IRC. That actual edit was probably made by Samson again.

The rational for that change was pretty simple: Adam Back didn't feel he could speak for Blockstream officially without further consultation with others at Blockstream. Similarly, rather than use the more common term 'Bitcoin Core Developer', we specifically used the term 'Bitcoin Core Contributor' to avoid giving the impression that the Bitcoin developers who signed were signing on behalf of all Bitcoin Core developers (edit: I personally argued for even more clear language along those lines, but everyone was getting tired so I decided to drop the issue, and instead I made it clear in my [tweet](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/701127054138322944) rather than delay things even further).

The final step in the process was a joint reading of the statement; previously we had gone through every single person signing to make sure names were spelled correctly and titles were correct, however for the final reading that part was skipped (it was about 3am and we'd been talking for 18 hours already!).

d0aq6nj,[deleted],27,"The principles that attracted me to bitcoin have not been even lightly threatened.

1. Fixed supply. This is my #1 thing. Whether bitcoin is a success or failure, I want to participate in the testing of a deflationary currency. I believe that the need for ""liquidity"" is not good reason to lower every single citizen's net worth every year. I believe that creating more money in the form of debt is kicking the can down the road without actually fixing what's wrong with this country, which is that we are all consumers and not producers. Some people think that a successful hard fork would put this ideal in jeopardy, as it would show that anything could be changed, including the supply cap. I disagree. I think that if we have learned anything through this debate, it is that the community will be slow to make any drastic changes, and there will be strong resistance along the way, with ample warning. The bottom line is that I will have the choice of holding my coins or not if the 21 million supply limit was ever threatened. I have no choice about USD. I have to bend over and take the federal reserve's decisions up my ass.

2. Money without borders. Nothing has changed about this. My bitcoins are as easily accessible in Australia as they are here in the USA. If I wanted, I could memorize 16 words or so and be able to carry my bitcoins with me wherever I go, in my head. I think that's really fucking cool, even if not practical.

3. The government has no access to my bitcoins. This hasn't changed. In this time we live in, it's sad to say that being able to have something that the government couldn't take from you is a very rare thing. 

4. Anonymous transactions. Some people call it pseudo-anonymous. I think pseudo-anonymous is fancy speak for ""I didn't try hard enough to cover my tracks. I think it's really awesome that I have an address that only I know how to access, which I have bitcoins stored at, and not one fucking person, even the NSA, has any clue how many I have or how to get to them. I think that's fucking awesome.

5. Fast and cheap transactions. Every transaction I've ever sent has been a flawless process. Even during the network spammings. I effortlessly move bitcoins between exchanges, sportsbooks, wallets, etc, and I can do it as many times as I want, for cheap. I initiate a withdraw on one website and see the deposit on another within minutes. That's fucking cool. I can't do that with my credit cards. 

6. Unregulated money. AKA the wild west of money. At times I question why this intrigues me. It certainly causes pain to lots of people, as we've seen with Mt. Gox and similar things. It's crazy to think that every transaction I send is not reversible. I guess I just have faith in free markets working themselves out, and I think that only the competent should dabble in bitcoin. It's not always pretty, or smooth, but I think it's cool to see a financial structure being developed by means other than a government.

This whole blocksize thing is so overblown. The community is freaking out about a problem that is coming, but is not here yet. It's really note even close to here yet. If we start hitting 1MB blocks before core's agreed upon hard fork date, then it will be because of all of the non-fee or extremely low-fee spam transactions. I don't really want to go to a full blown fee bidding market, where you have to keep paying more and more to get your transaction included in the next block or two, but fuck it, that's a free market in work. If the demand for using them hits that point, I'm going to completely understand that. However, the reality is that there are so many spam transactions in every block currently, that by raising fees to even just .0005 or so will easily still render the network usable for everyone for fairly cheap long after we have started filling every block.

If you take a step back and really really think about everything that bitcoin has gone through and survived in incredible fashion, you do realize it's a fucking honeybadger. That honeybadger can easily eat your shorts if you are playing the 20x game all the time, but if you bought coins anytime during the history of bitcoin and held, chances are very high that you are in the black.

EDIT: Last thing. What is so fucking scary about a group of miners and developers meeting in a room to make decisions? Do you guys think we would make a better consensus if we had the whole debate play out completely on the internet? Do you think it'd work better if that meeting was open to any and everyone who wanted to come? Neither of those processes would have gotten anywhere. Look at /r/bitcoin. There is zero fucking consensus there. None. Nada. One day they are behind classic, one day they are behind core. I'm actually relieved that Core and blockstream are more or less ignoring it. I belive that they all know a whole fucking lot more about what is going on in the bitcoin world than the ""community"" or Hearn. Regardless, the bottom line is that I was able to watch this debated. The problems were in the public eye, and for a long time. Multiple solutions were proposed. Smart people have had a lot of public debate about it. The whole time, I've had the option to get the fuck out or not. That's beautiful. You can't do that with fiat. At least Bitcoin users give a shit too. Fiat users have no fucking clue how their own money works. If I'm gonna pick a crowd to be a part of right now, you better believe it's the bitcoin crowd.",2016-02-24 01:39:34

d0anejz,Emocmo,21,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Today’s movement confirmed the reversal to a column of Os.  This is not a surprise as we moved into a long pole warning over the weekend.  Usually the reversal from a LPW is about have the length of the pole (not half of the break out.)  

In the case,. the LPW column was 11 boxes.  Therefore the reversal target would be between 5 or 6 boxes. The reversal hit that target at six boxes,. and then it settled down a bit.

Now this is where my genius comes in:  It can either go up or continue down from here.  (18 years of education comes in handy, doesn’t it.)

If it were to continue downward, I would look for it to go back down most of the box, settling around the $400 support.  

If it goes up, it will probably bounce between this point ($423 right now) up to the mid $430s and languish as it has every time we go up.  

We need to break $450 to break out again.  Remember, the last formation was 14 columns wide.  That means at least two weeks in the same trading channel.  It would take something significant to make it shoot up.

I admit to not understanding all of the ramifications of Classic vs Whatever.  But I DO understand what the block size means and how its coming might move the price up or down, depending on whatever.

Speaking of wu wu stuff—Clif High says his web bots have indicated that silver and gold are about to go higher, and bitcoin is supposed to go right behind them like a dog on a leash.  And now that I’ve typed that, it will fulfill his language and screw up his predications!  Ha Ha.

In any event, it is also important to remember a few stats.  On Coinbase, the price is $14.58 in the last week.  It is up almost $20 in the last month.  And it is up $183.55 since last year on this date.  Those returns are not too shabby when the rest of the world is advocating negative interest rates.

PS:  Do not let them take away your cash.  There is talk of limiting cash transactions and denominations.  Once they move the cash out of the system, they can take your money electronically.  I like my cash.

That is all of my ranting for today.  Good luck.

d0bw15a,Yoghurt114,19,"A linearly increasing block size leads to quadratic IBD sync time.

A static block size leads to linear IBD sync time, which is bad enough.

We can't willy nilly 'scale' Bitcoin by changing a number for this exact reason.

This is simple fundamental fact for any block chain unless you're willing to erode your security assumptions (ie. by making the assumption long-past PoW is 'good enough', and skipping validation)

&gt; is this type of thing that the core developers should be working on.

Take a peek at, say, Pieter Wuille's impressive track record of contributions to Core - most of them have been related to solving or mitigating these problems. They've been working on this since the start. If they hadn't then the network wouldn't even function on 1MB blocks; their efforts into improving scalability make the entire block size debate possible in the first place (and they're getting the stink eye for it! :S).",2016-02-24 22:23:44

d0azgsn,tsontar,15,"&gt; Theoretically.. yes - but in reality.. not going to happen. Lightning adds a lot of complexity and also exposes the user to some more complexity. ""Do i send my money to a bitcoin address now? Or to a lightning network address?""

How about, ""why do I want to lock up $100 just to buy coffees, when I could just spend the $5 now, and have $95 in liquidity to do anything I want?""
___
The Lightning Network is their answer to, ""we don't need everyone's coffee purchases stored on the blockchain.""

But if I want to move 90% of transactions from onchain to LN, **and keep it decentralized**, then people have to lock up at least 20X their typical spend in payment channels:

[buy coffee onchain] X2  = 2 onchain txns

[open/close channel with coffee shop] = 2 onchain txn

So to scale to 10X Bitcon's capability, then I need to be able to buy 20 coffees for my two onchain transactions, instead of just 2.

If coffee and a muffin is $5, then **I have to be willing to lock up $100 just for coffees** in order to achieve the desired scaling benefit.  

If I'm only able to commit $20 to this channel, then it can only provide a very modest 4 coffees, or the **same scaling as raising the blocksize limit to 2MB.**

If I'm a typical consumer who lives pretty much hand-to-mouth then I have absolutely zero extra liquidity with which to ever open any payment channels and the point is completely moot.",2016-02-24 05:04:06

d0c1lpd,Tim_Burton,112,"Since this is gonna gain a lot of attention now, let me dispel some myths and misconceptions regarding the EULA.  

1 - Mojang's EULA is not some sort of ploy to try to cripple servers so that they can sell their Realms. Mojang updated and started enforcing their EULA due to the series of complaints they got from angry parents whose children charged hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for paid features on self-hosted servers.  

2 - The EULA does not strictly prevent server owners/admins from making money off of their servers. There are still methods of making money off of your servers without violating the EULA. It boils down to one simple test - does your paid features give a paying player a gameplay advantage over another non-paying player? If yes, you're violating the EULA. If no, then you're perfectly fine.  

2a - This means that you can NOT sell things like extra diamonds, creative mode, kits, etc. If a player is capable of giving you, the server admin, real life money in exchange for some feature, item, etc that gives them an advantage over another player, then you're in violation of the EULA.  

2b - Paid features are server specific. It's totally possible for you to sell players access to a private server, as long as everyone has to pay the same amount. For example - if I had a server which required you to pay me $5 to access, it's totally fine to do as long as you require everyone to pay them same amount.  

~~By extension, it's possible to have extra dimensions/worlds on a single server which are pay-only, as long as players can't somehow gain an advantage in the 'free world' by accessing the 'paid world'. For example - if you have a single server, but with a pay-only dimension for building in creative mode, and players can't take items they spawn in back to the non-paid world, then it's fine.~~  
([Nope, I was wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/47bt3r/mojang_are_starting_to_crack_down_on_servers/d0casgm))  
However, if you made a mining world which players need to pay to access, and they can bring materials back to the original, free-to-use world, then it violates the EULA.  

2c - Cosmetics are pretty much safe. Cosmetics are a great way to still make money off of your servers without violating the EULA. The only exception are cloaks. Cloaks are off-limits as per the EULA.  

So, you could sell players name tags, access to /nickname, trails, footfalls, mini pets (that are 100% cosmetic) - heck, you could even sell players cosmetic-only armor that doesn't give them any armor points or effects, and you would be totally fine. More so, you could even give players access to /fly in your spawn world, like the lobbies for mini-game servers, and you would be totally fine, because being able to fly in a lobby is not granting the player a gameplay advantage.  

There are MANY ways to make money off of your servers without violating the EULA. Just gotta be smart about it.  

3 - Unlocking server-wide features are totally fine. This is one of my favorite ways to incentive donations. You could set up a donation tracker. When X amount of money has been donated, you would unlock a mining world, for example for *everyone* on the server. This is ok to do, because a single player doesn't gain a paid-advantage over another. Since everyone benefits from a single person's donation, it's ok by the EULA.  

You have to be careful with this, though. For example, if you gave players the ability to purchase access to a command like /toggle downfall, or /day, then that is still considered violation of the EULA. Even though switching day or night affects everyone on the server, giving a single player control over it could be considered giving that player an advantage over others, especially since it can be abused against other players' wills.  

4 - Soft currencies still violate the EULA, if they can be purchased. Your players can't buy some sort of econ or points which they then spend in game for items or features. This isn't some 'clever loophole'. Don't think you've outsmarted Mojang by using soft currencies, especially since I recall them making a statement about it somewhere.  

4a - Soft currencies are still OK to use, as long as they can't be purchased with real money. Let's say you reward players points for voting, for using your forums, for helping other players, etc. and they can spend those points on items, features, etc. I'm pretty sure that's OK to do.  

However, as soon as you allow players to gain additional points with real money, be it straight up purchases, or donations, then it violates the EULA.  

Even more so, if a player can pay real money to gain points *quicker* instead of straight up buying points, then it still violates the EULA. In other words, let's say that instead of letting players pay $5 for 500 points, you allow them to pay $5 for double point gains for 1 week. That still violates the EULA.  

The ONLY exception to this is if your points are used ONLY for cosmetic features. Then you're OK to do extra point gains, purchasable points, etc.  

5 - Version doesn't matter. Don't think you can get away with violating the new EULA just because you're still on 1.6  

6 - Not accepting the EULA doesn't matter. As of 1.7.10, you're asked to set the EULA.txt to 'true' before running a server. If you found some clever trick to get around this, don't think it somehow legally excludes you from the EULA. You're still bound by it. Period.  

7 - Forge, Sponge, Spigot, Cauldron, etc still count. Just because you're not running an official Minecraft server .jar doesn't mean you're excluded from the EULA. These jars still use Minecraft code, and therefore you're still bound by the EULA. The only way to be excluded from the EULA is to not play Minecraft. Period.  

8 - Server size doesn't matter. Yes, the bigger servers are more susceptible to being reported due to a higher flow of traffic, but don't think you're immune just because you're a small server with maybe 20 people on average. Mojang doesn't go around randomly checking servers (well, they might, but I doubt it). Instead, there's a form anyone can fill out to report a server they suspect is in violation of the EULA. Think of it like reporting a video to YouTube for violating their EULA. This then prompts Mojang to investigate the server on their own terms. I imagine they have a priority system, but I'm not sure. Anyone is susceptible.  

9 - Why now? Well, the new EULA was pushed back in July of last year. Since then, the whole transfer of ownership to Microsoft happened, so I'm sure that tied up their legal dept. Now that Minecraft is in Microsoft's hands, they probably have more man hours to put into legal investigations, including EULA violations. We're playing with the big boys now. You bet your ass they will tighten up and go after anyone who poses a legal violation.  

10 - Host doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're hosting off of your own home server, or if you've paid some host to run your server for you. Mojang looks at the server, not the person running it. In fact, I would argue that it's way riskier to stay in violation of the EULA when you're paying a host, since hosts like CreeperHost, etc probably have very strict rules about EULA violation. Just imagine if CreeperHost got a DCMA from Mojang regarding your server's EULA violation. They could be nice and contact you, the admin, to fix it. Or they could just flip a switch, delete your server, kick you out as a customer, and send you your final bill with an attached letter stating that you breached a contract with the host and they have every right to take action.  

At least with self hosting, you can back up your stuff and fix it when you get a notice from Mojang.  

11 - Donations still count. This should be self explanatory, but some people think that rewarding players for donations is somehow different than letting players buy features. It doesn't matter what you call it. Heck, it doesn't matter what currency you use. You could use Bitcoin, and it still violates the EULA. If money is transferred from a player's hands to the server admins/accounts, and in return, the paying player gets advantages over other players, then it violates the EULA. End of story. No ifs ands or buts.  

Final note -  
If you see something I stated that's wrong, point it out. I admit I didn't do any searching for sources to back up a lot of what I said, but I did get pretty heavy into the discussion of the EULA with my other community managers back when the EULA was first pushed with 1.7.10. So. I have a pretty good grasp on what the EULA is aiming to achieve, and what is and it not ok to do.  

There are plenty of discussions out there already, many answered by staff of Mojang themselves, so feel free to do some research and emailing to Mojang to get clarification on the EULA to determine if your server is safe or not.",2016-02-25 01:05:40

Adam Back *did* invent Hashcash.  His Twitter profile doesn't say he invented proof of work.

Bitcoin's author credits Adam for the contribution of proof of work to Satoshi's work.  Now maybe someone else invented proof of work, but Satoshi got the idea from Adam. 

And Bitcoin is like hashcash, with controlled inflation.  It's not a *lie*.  It's an exaggeration, and quite misleading, because the ""little add on bit"" (the blockchain which controls inflation) is in fact 99% of the genius - but it's not a *lie.*

It should say ""Bitcoin is Hashcash with counterfeit control.""

If it said that, then nobody would argue with it, I don't think.

Be reasonable.  I agree that Adam seems deceptive.  Maybe he's just inept, or awkward.  A lot of people who have met him say he comes across as highly genuine and friendly.  Maybe between being mentioned in the white paper (instant fame) and being friendly and personable, that's how he got the job, and he's just a little out of his league?  Fuck.

Because this is a small company, Dave decides to forward this question to everyone because Dave doesn't deal with what Hackerman is talking about. Deb in customer support knows though, and she replies, just to Dave. Now Dave forwards that reply back to Rob. Perfectly normal, except Rob Hackerman now has the company-wide email address in the email logs he was sent.

So, Rob Hackerman googles for 5 minutes. One minute on cats, 3 on porn for later, and one on the company itself. He finds a local newspaper that publishes stories about the company's expansion and strategy.

So he sends an email to everyone in the company from the CEO's email. SmallCompany doesn't think information security is a big deal, so the tech guy only really resets passwords. So everyone sees an email from ceo@smallcompany.com with the subject ""Congratulations!""

Diane, the receptionist, sees this email. She decides to click the link. Afterall, she's bored and wants to see www.localpaper.com/goodarticle.html

Unfortunately, this takes her to www.loca1paper.com. Diane should notice, but the site is identical to the real one. Rob Hackerman just downloaded the page and uploaded it to his own servers. Then, he put a little popup there. ""To see this article,""

That's all you need to know it says, because Diane is impatient and just clicks the big ""Okay"" button. She's prompted for her password, easy. The program installs, and now the company is completely fucked. Diane had admin access.

Experimental BU Client Release - Focus on Main-chain Scaling​

BitcoinUnlimited v0.12.0 Highlights are:

Core v0.12.0 code-base

*Enhancements:*

Effective block limit via emergent network consensus

* BUIP001 Fixed block limit made obsolete

* BU follows the blockchain with most PoW as per the original Nakamoto Consensus

* Separation of the mining block size (default 1MB) from the non-mining block acceptance size (default 16MB)

* Block size limits and acceptance depth individually configurable

* Classic block version for mining

Public notification of individual settings

* BUIP005 User agent subversion text
​

Xtreme Thinblocks

* BUIP010 Reduces real-time block propagation sizes by an average of 15x (i.e. 1MB down to 70KB) returning the network overhead for newly mined blocks to the state it was in June 2012
​

Xpress Validation

* BUIP010 Superfast block validation leverages the earlier validation of transactions which are in the mempool so that only previously unseen transactions in a block need full validation.
​

Traffic-shaping

* BUIP001 Users can easily configure how much bandwidth should be used for Bitcoin, allowing the BU client to run unobtrusively in a home network.
​

*Disabled:*

Replace-by-fee

* BUIP004 Community vote determines that there is no consensus for a feature which undermines the 0-confirmation use-case

d0fai0x,jtoomim,18,"Xtreme Thin Blocks are a great improvement in block propagation for normal full nodes. However, they are likely to be slower than the relay network. There are a few reasons for this:

1. The relay network should have smaller data packages, since it uses two bytes per cached transaction instead of six. 
2. The relay network does not require bitcoind to validate the block in between each hop. Since validating a 1 MB block can take up to 1 second, and since it typically takes 6 ""bitcoind hops"" to traverse the p2p network, and the total block propagation time budget is around 1 to 4 seconds, that's kind of a big deal. **Edit**: XTB have an **[accelerated validation mechanism](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip010-passed-xtreme-thinblocks.774/page-6#post-13232)**, and also have the ability to add more blocks-only peers.
3. The relay network has an optimized topology, and will only send each block at most halfway around the world, whereas the topology of the bitcoin p2p network is random and can result in the data traversing the globe several times over the course of the 6 hops.
4. The XTB shorthash mechanism can be attacked by intentionally crafting transactions with 64-bit hashes that collide. This would force additional round trips on each hop, delaying block propagation time through the network by several seconds.
5. The XTB system requires more round-trips than the relay network. In the best case, XTB requires 1.5 round trips, whereas RN only takes 0.5.

On the other hand, XTB has a couple advantages over the relay network:

1. The relay network is a centralized system run by one person. If Matt Corallo is asleep and a server goes down, the miners suffer.

When people say 'blockchain', what they mean is 'using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.

People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* IBM, bankers, etc.) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of transactional data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.

\[The\] 'Blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.

Proof of Work, especially when compounded through chaining, is merely a spam filter that makes it difficult for anyone but honest users to participate, and thereby also naturally drives consensus towards one record; yet, as with git, such functionality is not required in order for 'blockchain' to be useful. Most systems don't require the ability to be run by *anyone*.

That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an [Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/43zwlj/blockstream_raises_55_million_to_build_out/czmeral) with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of systems (both private and otherwise, both blockchain and otherwise).

d0eqbwi,pb1x,14,"LN does have some issues, it's not even my preferred solution, but his article seems to make mountains out of molehills

&gt; The Lightning Network does not yet exist

No scalability solution exists, that's the issue at hand. Lightning does in fact exist as a well reviewed white paper, a plan in motion, a top notch team, published open source code

&gt; The Lighting Network scales transactions NOT users

This makes no sense, users are transparent to both the Blockchain and Lightning. By my estimates the blockchain can handle up to 100-180 million individual users on Lightning without being proxied

&gt; If the Lightning Network existed, people wouldn’t trust it right away

Legitimate point, but I think from the wrong perspective. People are too trusting of Coinbase and Circle type hosted wallets and they will probably choose those over Lightning, at first.

&gt; If the Lightning Network existed, no wallets or payment providers would support it for a while

Sounds unlikely since Lightning will probably make a reference wallet. Plenty of people will also like instant confirmations, improved privacy and tiny micropayments and lower fees right? Legit point that it will take time for wallets that people like and they use to be widespread. It might never happen

&gt; The Lightning Network has problems with exchanging significant amounts of value

2/3 of the transactions on the blockchain are $5 and under. Large transactions can live on chain for a while because it's easier to justify the fee

&gt; The Lightning Network payment channels cannot help but lead to a certain degree of centralization

Not all centralization is bad. The important part is trustless and resistant to attack, that's the goal of decentralization. Lightning is designed in such a way where it does offer those features

&gt; Unbalanced Channels and Locking up Massive Amounts of Bitcoin in them makes LN economically challenging

Again, most real life transactions are small. Lightning is a complementary network, not a replacement for the blockchain

&gt; Locking up funds in channels means they are subject to market volatility

100% of funds are subject to market volatility. This is a non sequitur 

&gt; Users of the Lightning Network effectively have a 'hot-wallet'.

This only applies to relays, not users. Users can still hold cold keys.

The whole thing started when I noticed the name ""AXA Strategic Ventures"" in the list of investors for Blockstream's recent $55 million financing round.

I thought ... that's not the *same* as the ""AXA Group"" which got into trouble because they refused for decades to honor billions of dollars in insurance claims of Holocaust survivors?

So I did some googling - and I was *shocked* to see that the CEO of AXA Group is also the *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group - not merely some random attendee, but the friggin *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group, since 2012.

The Bilderberg Group includes top bankers from Goldman Sachs, HSBC - plus guys like Timothy Geithner - Henry Kissinger - Richard Perle - and many many more members of the worldwide banking and political elite.

**The Bilderberg Group represents the power elites from banking and government who would have the greatest means (and the greatest motivation) to try to destroy Bitcoin.**

**How much money has Blockstream accepted from AXA Strategic Ventures, and what did Blockstream promise in return?**

a) Using a simple bitcoin script on the standard main net of Bitcoin.

b) A very clever and sophisticated zkSNARK proof and verification program written outside of the block chain.  

A libsnark implementation on the world's slowest and safest computer (ethereum) would be totally impractical.  An ethereum analog of ZKCP would follow the same strategy: simple contract with complex off chain snark prover.

So, this is an example where the ability to program with Turing Completeness on the chain was not important.  But specialist programmers conversant with Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge were critical.

So this is how the banks plan to control Bitcoin: simply buy off all the programmers.

This is disgusting. I am absolutely outraged that anyone at Blockstream could accept getting paid by AXA Strategic Ventures, which is known to be controlled by the head of the Bilderberg Group. This is simply unacceptable.

Satoshi would be appalled at this turn in events: Blockstream/Core devs are now being paid by a guy who is the CEO of the biggest insurance company in the world, [1] who sits on the board of HSBC, and who is the chairman of the friggin' Bilderberg Group.

But we also shouldn't be surprised. This only shows that Bitcoin is *very* important, and the power elites of banking and government are desperate to control it, any way they can.

They're kinda clever too. They knew they couldn't ban Bitcoin outright - so they printed up a few million dollars in ""fiat"" and handed it out to some naïve programmers, in an attempt to control (and cripple) the code.

But we are *not* required to use Blockstream's crippled code - in particular their artificial 1 MB ""max blocksize"" limit, which is central to their strategy to discourage users from transacting directly at ""level 1"" on the Blockchain and encourage users to instead transact indirectly at ""level 2"" on Blockstream's complicated, centralized and unproven ""Lightning Network"".

**We are under no obligation to use code developed by Blockstream and funded by the world's biggest investment banks and insurance companies. That would go totally against the spirit of Bitcoin.**

We can and should run code produced by independent developers, who do not have conflicts of interest, and who put the needs of the Bitcoin-using public *first* - instead of playing into the hands of the *ancien régime* of big banks and big government - as represented by the likes of AXA Strategic Ventures / AXA Group / Henri de Castries / the Bilderberg Group.

So, woodcarving is a new hobby.  Last Wednesday I dropped a very sharp chisel into my lap.  Fortunately, the chisel landed handle end down.  The bad news is that I reflexively went to grab for it.  And I tore the palm of my hand to shit.  11 Stitches later I came home.   I did not venture into my office again until this morning.  So I apologize for not updating.

That explained, we reversed into a column of Xs.  This morning we hit a high of $442.  

A lot of this had to do with the devaluing of the Yuan.  I don’t know if any of you read the article on Zero hedge the other day about people moving Chinese capital into Bitcoin.  It was an interesting read with a mind boggling figure or potential value.  I’m not buying the number, but I do buy the proposition.

So here are the new numbers:

We breakout at any price over $450.  We would reverse at any price lower than $425.  The new trend reversal point would happen at $385.  At this stage a breakout over $450 should be  little meek, topping out at around $465.

This should be an interesting week.  The G-20 meeting closed with everyone doing exactly nothing.  There is talk of a sudden 50% devaluation of the Yuan.  I don’t see them doing this.  There is talk of NIRP in the US.  I doubt we see those things either.  But this week ends with a US Jobs report and that might send a signal about which way the economy is headed.  My bet is that the jobs number is going to miss.

Remember, the “noise” in this column’s noise level goes from $410-$445.  Thats a pretty broad range.  No need to get too excited or depressed until we move beyond that range.

d0h2mil,Prince_Kropotkin,16,"&gt; Markets don't require government

They have in all historical cases that we know about, c.f. David Graeber and other anthropologists. The reason for this is simple: what we think of as a market is a fairly large-scale exchange of many goods and services, typically with a currency being used and rules being set. Beyond the neighborhood flea market, this requires a large amount of trust in just about everything: trust that the market is safe, trust that the medium of exchange is legitimate, trust that the rules are reasonable and are applied fairly. There are very few sources of trust big enough to pull people into this situation to the point where the markets become functional and useful, and the primary one is government. In fact, in modern society, the nation-state is the backstop for other sources of trust, the ""trust reservoir of last resort"" if you will.

There are limited exceptions to this, independent caravan traders travelling between societies and the like, but typically that was based on a handful of commodities and payment with precious metals which were universally accepted by human society. Even then those 'markets' were fraught with danger, traders were constantly robbed or defrauded and States constantly intervened.

Even market anarchists depend on the federation of communities etc as a source of trust, which is government in a sense (however democratic or far away from the idea of the modern nation-state). A great example of how markets typically break down without trust is the dark web/Bitcoin economy, which is totally rife with scams and even with large numbers of stateless market enthusiasts can barely manage to have any useful goods or services traded on it. Half the dark net markets were taken down by the feds, sure, but the other half went under due to frauds. So without something like government, market simply don't exist, and so you can't have a free market either as its a contradiction in terms.",2016-02-29 03:11:00

&gt;For 250 years insects and rodents accused of committing property crimes were tried as legal persons in French, Italian, and Swiss ecclesiastic courts under the same laws and according to the same procedures used to try actual persons. I argue that the Catholic Church used vermin trials to increase tithe revenues where tithe evasion threatened to erode them. Vermin trials achieved this by bolstering citizens’ belief in the validity of Church punishments for tithe evasion: estrangement from God through sin, excommunication, and anathema. Vermin trials permitted ecclesiastics to evidence their supernatural sanctions’ legitimacy by producing outcomes that supported those sanctions’ validity. These outcomes strengthened citizens’ belief that the Church’s imprecations were real, which allowed ecclesiastics to reclaim jeopardized tithe revenue.

I never quite realized how much amazing stuff was generated in the '60s by Marvel. Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko were the Beatles of comics in this era. The question is whether Stan Lee was Paul and John combined, as he claims, or a lesser version of Ringo Starr, as his skeptics claim.
 
Bonus: Jack Kirby was so incensed by Stan Lee that he created a comic book parody of Stan Lee called [“Funky Flashman”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Flashman), which in turns reminds me of the nasty song that John Lennon wrote about Paul McCartney.

If your maxconnections is 15, then you're adding to the incoming connection debt. Bitcoin nodes spawn 8 outgoing connections. In an ideal world, all nodes would have port 8333 open, which means that those 8 outgoing connections would turn into an average of 8 incoming connections on other nodes, for a total of 16 connections. 

However, our world is not ideal, and about half or 2/3 of our nodes are behind firewalls. This means that each node with an open port 8333 should be willing to accept 2x or 3x as many incoming connections as it makes outgoing in order to keep the network healthy.

A limit of 15 would entail 8 outgoing and 7 incoming, which makes each node configured this way increase the incoming connection debt by 1 connection.

d0h6waq,son_nequitur,13,"Computer vision involves taking huge amounts of data and looking for very specific, very detailed signals. They are often doing one very simple computation over, and over, and over, say, looking through gigapixels of images for something that looks like legs.

Standard CPUs are able to take any arbitrary task and do it pretty fast, but to be able to handle anything they have to be somewhat robust and complicated. If you are doing very specific computations, you don't need nearly as complicated of a chip. When people talk about ""bitcoin mining"" they are talking about special chips that were designed just to do one single task. These are radically simpler processors, that can't run arbitrary software. They just do one thing really, really fast.

Take a look at a current generation computer vision processor: [Movidius's Myriad chip](http://img.deusm.com/eetimes/2014/06/1322651/rcj_Movidius_65nm_Myriad_VPU_SoC_2.jpg.jpeg). That top box is labelled ""SW (software) controlled I/O (input/output) multiplexing"". That allows you to take any of your sensors and connect them to the 8 image processing chips below, in any configuration and change it on the fly. Because the chip connects directly to cameras and other sensors it benefits from lower latency. Because the processors are optimized for computer vision they can use lower power and generate less heat to do the same processing.

It might seem like we are already very far into the age of processor design, but in fact we are just at the start. We have hit some limits in terms of how much general purpose processing we can fit into a small space, so now the industry is going in the opposite direction: special purpose processing that can do more with less power. Graphics, Bitcoins, and vision are just the start.

Tesla is in a battle to create better artificial intelligence. You do that by A) writing better algorithms, B) adding hardware, or C) making the hardware more efficient.

It crashed from there to all the way to sub $2. That's close to 85% of your holdings. There were crashes before that.

Many people would have sold and written it off as a failed experiment at that point. It was years before it went back up. And if you are a ""trader"" with specific strategies then it might have been logical. Which is fine if that's what you're in it for.

I never did. Never sold or used it for anything -- except for ethereum and maidsafe icos. That's all the way down, up to 1000, and all the way down to 200, to  400.... 

People will say you're missing out on selling at  tops. But blockchain is diff for me. I'm not looking for ""tops"" - I'm looking for something else. This *is* a venture bet. A lotto ticket-- but with actually kind of ok odds. Because of that, first -- you shouldn't be putting money you will lose sleep over losing. Just don't. Don't use credit cards for Christ sakes. If I was really ""sure"" of all of this I would sell all of my belongings, my house, right this sec. I'm not. Here's the hard truth: There are decent odds of failure. Yes even ethereum as high potential as I think it is. The only thing you should go all-in on is yourself. People forget this is uncharted territory. 

And second, if this is truly your thesis, and you made an appropriate, smart bet, you shouldn't be trying to optimize. It works or it doesn't. I didn't blink for a whole two years, as maidsafe crashed all the way down with no product in sight. And I wouldn't blink if ethereum went all the way down to $2 tomorrow and stayed that way for years. Because I know what I'm getting into and I have my context.

If you're thinking of a world where you need to ""cash out"" of crypto to profit then you're not actually thinking big imo. That's fine - but that's not a venture bet. If it's going big, then it just *will* -- valuations will have true justification. If it truly *works* then the world will be a tad different from today. It's a world where you *wouldn't* want to cash out. That's real lasting success. That's why I love that price talk isn't allowed in the main sub. Pumpers are playing a shallow game.
