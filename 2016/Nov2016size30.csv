1. What reactions in the user submitted reports prompted your decision?
2. As a moderator, you should listen to the users but ultimately the judgement call falls on you. What in particular about that thread justified it first being locked and then removed entirely?
3. Where do you draw the line between censorship and moderation?
4. Please provide a definition of what ""brigading"" is.
5. How do you differentiate between ""brigading"" and popular opinion?
5. As a long time bitcoin user, how does participating in censorship sit well with you?
6. Can you provide the exact reasons why the thread was locked and then later removed?
8. Who are you referring to as ""they"" in your post?

Thank you for your time, and I appreciate you owning up to your actions, deplorable though they may be.

d9ftr6l,nullc,33,"Greetings, thanks for taking the time to write.

Your message surprises me:  Before the scheduling of segwit began, I directly emailed the CTOs of  some 41 Bitcoin Organizations-- basically every one that I could find contact information for; seeking feedback on the activation of segwit.  I did not receive a single reply like yours.  Nor was there any like it in the bitcoin-dev public discussion.  So I'd like to learn a bit more about your views.

&gt; I see Segwit as a crudely-designed kludge, and an unnecessary complication to the protocol.

Can you elaborate on this?  Ignoring that any system which does not confiscate coins must preserve the legacy behavior in parallel, I -- and, I think, the vast majority of engineers working on the system-- think that segwit is a major simplification, which will make things easier going forward.

&gt; Open Transactions was working on a sidechain implementation years ago that didn't require Segwit,

Segwit doen't have anything to do with sidechains.  In fact, there is a federated consensus sidechain running today (and for the last year and a half) against testnet called Elements Alpha.-- I don't believe OT ever managed to get a running system. In any case, that sort of system works fine against Bitcoin today.

&gt; SegWit introduces a large amount of complexity, technical debt that will make it harder for others to contribute

Can you elaborate?  What is the complexity and technical debt? I believe segwit will make contribution by others easier by better isolating other parts of the system.

&gt; SegWit really is not a soft-fork, but a hard-fork, since you can't run an older node anymore and still even participate in validating transactions, all old nodes become obsolete.

Non-upgraded nodes continued to verify all that they did. Even in the segwit using transactions they verify the absence of inflation, absence of double spends, locktimes, etc. They don't verify the new signature style, but they know its there-- they just don't understand it so they accept it. Bitcoin was specifically designed to do this to make it forward compatible for upgrades.  Old software always becomes obsolete, but with soft forks there is no hard flag day where you _must_ upgrade. You can upgrade on your own terms.

&gt; brought to you by R3

I feel this is a bit ironic, since the large block public publicity push was started by Mike Hearn who was employed by R3 without disclosing it to the Bitcoin community.

&gt; we can extropolate that bitcoin would be just fine with an immediate

For the chain history, the block size isn't a 'size' it's a rate of increase.

&gt; The bankers bought out the core,

Bitcoin Core is created by a large open volunteer community-- there were 100 distinct committers in the last major release. They haven't been 'bought out' by anyone. I'm also not aware of any real openly developed alternative, BU is a couple people with a closed community, with secret funding, which you must be approved to contribute in, and the other implementations are either inactive or roughly one man efforts. 

&gt; SegwitCoin is Bankcoin, not bitcoin.

I'm having a little difficulty making sense of your argument here. What features of segwit to you believe act in the interests of Banks?

I'd love to hear about whatever specific concerns you have.  But I think to have a productive conversation it would be useful to set aside the personal attacks and political assumptions.  Cheers.

d9hw1ud,cypherblock,27,"I think until a strong enough developer and thought leader community develops around an alternative implementation, then any supposed HF is not going to get a majority or anything near 75% mining vote.

Gavin and Mike probably had a chance, but I think there was always the feeling that they weren't the hard core coders of old, but they had the thought leadership part down for the most part. Their move seemed too sudden to some (although I'm sure for others it was a long time coming) and I didn't see a strong dev community building behind it. Again this is just outsiders view, could be way off base.

Thomas Zander hasn't made that outstanding an impression (no offense). And what happened to the Toomim bros., just disappeared from dev work, but wasn't it their project for a while? I just haven't gotten the impression the other devs there are that strong either. I'm probably wrong but impressions matter. Not to mention, what the heck is up with Classic just going to 2mb and then we have to do another hard fork, after all this???? Is that sill their plan? After years of bickering to get 1mb?

Bitcoin Unlimited, surprisingly seems to have gotten a bit of traction despite having some team members that have been sources of controversy. Still it is unclear if the community at large understands the whole unlimited thing or really where BU would take us.

Not to mention that core, has continued to roll out improvements like compact blocks and yes even the very controversial segwit. I think TZ has some alternative way to fix malleability, but not sure if he has really sold that to others yet. Has BU come up with a fix for this? Not to mention the sighash and other segwit improvements that are not present AFIK in other implementations. While much of the community is interested in on chain scaling, that doesn't mean we are also ready to give up on things like LN, and malleability fix at least is needed for that.

All of these other coins have a bitcoin base.  The whole reason we have something great in Monero is exactly why making wallets and payment processors and whatever is so difficult.  Those other coins are easy to work with because they're a Bitcoin derivative.

All of the Bitcoin luxuries that you see today took a lot of time.

So when you hear someone say ""Monero reminds me a lot of Bitcoin in 2011"", they're not always taking about the price - it's the (lack of) infrastructure.

A lot of people like to use the beta/vhs metaphor, but Monero to me is like Linux in the 90's.  It was hard to use, open source was scary, Microsoft FUD, Sun FUD, Oracle FUD, SCO FUD.  But we knew it was better.  So we kept our heads down and kept working on it.  It hasn't replaced everyone's desktop, just like Monero won't replace Bank of America.

d9hd47s,_chewtoy_,22,"Because it's always different eventually! 

Support and resistance levels don't just appear spontaneously. They are defined by repeated attempts to break above or below them. With each failed attempt, the resistance level becomes stronger and buyers retreat back to support of greater or equal strength. 

$200 to $300 is a fantastic example of this as far as bitcoin is concerned. 

The market was more or less deadlocked for the better part of a year between resistance at $300 and support at $200. 

The market crashed to ~$200, bounced up to ~$300 and stalled there, confirming $200 as support and $300 as resistance for the 1st time. Then the market bounced off support at ~$200 again, confirming it as support for a 2nd time and doubling down on that level as strong support. 

Alas, $300 was still insurmountable and the market retreated back to $200 to test support there again. 

Lo and behold, $200 held for a third time (which is incredibly bullish) and the market started churning back to test $300. Because there were three successful gut checks of $200, the market felt it could overcome resistance at $300 and, sure enough, it did. 

So, is it possible the market will tuck tail and run again between $730 and $780? Of course! But if it finds support in the $500 to $600s again, then strap on your moon shoes because $780 has a good chance of falling on the 3rd go around.",2016-11-02 05:45:51

d9hh535,ashmoran,15,"&gt; I think neither side wants an indefinite stalemate. Forking is really the best way for both sides to move on and stop hindering each-other. 

This depends on how the fork is done. If the fork involved *both* sides making a conscious movement, and creating CoreCoin on the one side and UnlimitedCoin on the other, it would then be a fair race to gain mindshare. But if instead UnlimitedCoin forks off and leaves CoreCoin on its original trajectory, that means CoreCoin is now the ""default"" Bitcoin, with all the exchanges, all the payment processors, all the web pages, *everything* already up and running. UnlimitedCoin would have to start like Ethereum Classic and compete as an altcoin.

One example is LocalBitcoins. LBTC hasn't added a single other cryptocurrency to their platform since they launched. Would UnlimitedCoin be the one that convinced them to start the major reengineering necessary to support multiple cryptos? Or would they just ignore it and wait to see what happens? 

&gt; Right now, this stalemate is just stalling Bitcoin's progress

The effect of this stalling is highly asymmetric, and may even affect each side in the opposite way.

Supporters of an increased block size limit want to see on-chain capacity increased to meet demand for transactions until off-chain solutions are available, so that no damage to Bitcoin is incurred from people unable to use it and leaving for either other cryptocurrencies or flat. Bitcoin is already running at capacity, which means that Bitcoin is suffering this kind of damage now on a daily basis.

There are many theories as to why Core are acting why they are, so I will pick an arbitrary one. Core want to prove how clever they are by making it possible to run a fully validating Bitcoin mode in 2026 on a Raspberry Pi. The fact that their off-chain scaling solution is complex, over-engineered, late, carries unknown centralisation risks, not theoretically well-understood, and not yet proven to be possible, is entirely irrelevant. Because *if* it works, they will look so, so clever. If it *doesn't* work and they accidentally destroy Bitcoin in the process, it's no big deal, the only consequences they suffer is that they will all need to find a job somewhere else â but it never hurts to add a new role to your CV every few years.

I have no idea if this Core theory has similarity to reality, but it seems to fit the observed behaviour well enough for the purpose of this example. The important thing is that in this scenario, stalling Bitcoin is not only not a problem, but potentially even an advantage: the more time and effort it takes to build an off-chain scaling solution, the more clever they will look. And if it turns out that by strangling Bitcoin for so long everyone has started using something else (and therefore the blockchain returns to having free space), they can still increase demand for their clever solution by lowering the block size limit, which Luke Dashjr keeps mentioning now.

Core have an advantage by being the ""default"" Bitcoin, and they suffer less from stalling. This is why since ViaBTC started mining with Bitcoin Unlimited, I don't think it's as clear cut whether it's better to chain fork Bitcoin and compete as a free-floating currency, or persist and hope more hashing power jumps on board. Both have many known unknowns and probably many unknown unknowns too. But the two sides are in markedly different positions, and the whole thing looks to me less like chess and more like hnefatafl.",2016-11-02 07:07:27

I too became interested early and mined my first coins many years ago when it was easy on a single AMD card, and when the pools were no longer lucrative I just bought them for practically nothing (relatively speaking). 

If you had told me about bitcoin in 2000, I would never have believed it.

With money printing out of control, governments officially bankrupt and going only deeper, banks collapsing nearly daily and major global banks only a stone throw away from collapsing, Bitcoin, naturally when kept in your own wallet, seems like one of the least risky places to store wealth in this new fucked up financial bubble we are in.

To continue using full node wallet, you need to update the software, and then to 'synchronize' with the blockchain. That means to download and validate all the blockchain data from the time you last used your old wallet, up to the present. It can take a while (days to weeks), depending on your Internet connection speed, and the speed of your CPU. 

If you want to go this route, I recommend to download a Bitcoin Unlimited wallet and install it. https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/download

Second option is to use a 'lite' wallet. It does no save all the blockchain data, only headers (33MB now), and uses other's full nodes to check for transactions. A popular desktop lite wallet is Electrum. https://electrum.org/#download

d9l0f3p,oneaccountpermessage,15,"Actually if China becomes serious about banning bitcoin for real this time it will be a mayor issue.

Last time they did not want to ban bitcoin, they simply wanted to reduce the impact it has on China.

Since they are now realizing it is a problem again they can do this:

They can quickly modify the great firewall to block or greatly delay packages that look like bitcoin traffic (it supports advanced packet analysis).


This will create major chaos, because it will basically split the network in two, and it is unsure if the hashrate of Bitcoin-China will be higher than Bitcoin-rest of the world.

If Bitcoin-China has a higher hash rate then this creates a major problem for the Bitcoin-World network, since all the miners there know that all their efforts might be in vain. If the longer chain created by the Bitcoin-China miners somehow makes it out of the great firewall it will cause a major chain re-organisation. Because it will be the longer chain.

The chinese goverment could on purpose Block-unBlock-Block-unBlock.

That way the Bitcoin-world network will shift between being overly slow (+20min blocks) to being reorganized and cause double spending risks.

All this will create a major downward pressure on the price, and with it downward pressure on the in incentive to mine. 

Eventually the Chinese goverment could decide to deliver a deathblow by seizing all the bitcoin mining equipment and using it explicitly to attack bitcoin.

When this happens the rest of the world is faced with a dillema. the network will be cripled and the only two ways out of it will be either buying billions of dollars worth of mining equipment (to mine an asset with now uncertain future), or switch to a different type of proof of work.

It will be unclear though how well bitcoin will cope with the huge uncertainty caused by this event. Bitcoin has no effective leadership, so it is very well possible different parts of the network will want to take different solutions to this problem. For example chosing which proof of work will be a major challenge. Some people will argue it is best to switch to something tried and tested like the proof of work of litecoin, but then some people could argue China again has a huge share in that. Then it could be argued it needs to be a completely new proof of work. But the parameter choosen will be very political, since it might favor certain CPU/GPU/ASIC configurations over others",2016-11-04 12:22:32

His ex-business partner and co-defendant in a civil lawsuit involving child sex abuse is [Marc Collins-Rector.
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Collins-Rector) Then this whole thing happened:

&gt;In 2000, a federal prosecutor in New Jersey brought further criminal charges against Collins-Rector on five counts of transporting a minor across state lines for illegal sexual activityâbut he was already out of the country.

&gt;After his indictment by a grand jury in 2000, Collins-Rector fled to Spain together with Shackley and Pierce. Interpol arrested them in May 2002 in a villa in the south Spanish beach city of Marbella. Guns, machetes and child pornography were found in the house. Pierce and Shackley were held for about a month then released.

But wait, there's more!

&gt;In August 2008, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement updated its records on Collins-Rector for the last time, listing him as living in an unspecified address in the Dominican Republic. In 2011, Collins-Rector renounced his American citizenship. He has been untraceable ever since.

Hm, Dominican Republic? That sounds familiar. Oh yeah. Remember Laura Silsby and that whole Haitian kid smuggling thing with [New Life Children's Refuge?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case)

&gt;On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children. The group, known as the New Life Childrenâs Refuge, did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on child trafficking charges. 

Brock Pierce and Marc Collins-Rector are [not out of the woods though](http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/some-in-bitcoin-group-resign-over-new-board-members-link-to-sex-abuse/): 

&gt;More recently, the California man who brought the civil suit against Collins-Rector, Shackley, and Pierce has come forward as Michael Egan, now aged 31.

&gt;In April 2014, Egan brought a new lawsuit against four men, including X-Men Director Bryan Singer and three Hollywood executives, alleging that he was coerced to have sex with them at Collins-Rector and Shackleyâs estate 15 years ago and on a private estate in Hawaii. All four men have denied the accusations.

See, say you have a fortune. A couple of million dollars. You stop working. You keep the money in a big pile of cash that you like to look at. Or jewels. Whatever, doesn't matter. You just keep it handy.

What happens to that money? Well, first, you need to live off it. You feel pretty flush, so you spend $70k a year on a decent home, nice car, some trips. Goes surprisingly fast that $70k, but you're sensible.

Thing is, the money is also becoming worth... less. Each year, that government keeps printing more! If it's in gold... well, they keep digging more up!

After ten years, your $2m is worth $1.3m, minus inflation... basically, $1m in a moderately bad decade, and even worse in a terrible decade.

So what do you do? You invest the money instead. Make it work. You can play it safe, and then you might *just* maintain your wealth in real terms. If you're careful.

Or you take real risks. Start a business, or pump it into a company doing something difficult, like inventing a new drug or... a new energy source. If you fail, you lose out big. Nobody talks about failures though. Survivor bias is a bitch, basically. But we all see the guys who make another billion. Woo!

If you don't devalue the money, people hoard it instead, and they act like Bitcoin holders. They don't use it as anything other than a transfer of value.

Of course, this just shows the judge that he is shady and in no way inspires feelings of mercy.

When I read this stuff, I see the same thing.  ""I won't be the only one"" is not a commitment.  It's his not-so-clever, sneaky way of trying to imply commitment with ambiguous language that he can later say was not a commitment.

It's his way.  I suspect he was raised mostly by an adoring, but weak-willed, mother who always sided with him and was easily persuaded by emotional tactics when he was wrong.

He seems to expect that in the real world he can get away with weak tactics that worked as a child.  For instance, when he is caught selling explosives, he is the victim of an unfair system that punished him for selling fireworks.  Why?  Because local officials sought political revenge?  When the judge asks him whether he was coerced into entering a plea of guilty, he tries to spin an offer to drop additional charges as a physical threat (judge too smart, rephrased the question).  When he was asked whether he had the capacity to understand, he tried to say he was on medication (judge too smart, offered to postpone, Ver finally and unequivocally acknowledged capacity).  And the linked message?  That's simply him doing the same stuff he did 15 years ago and has done all of his life.

The judge responded that that was not what he was asking about, so I replied that I must not understand what it means to be threatened or coerced. The judge then proceeded to lecture me extensively on politics. He carried on about why government is so important and how âtaxes are the price we pay for a civilized societyâ and that government is wonderful in general.** He summed up his lecture by telling me that âI donât want you to think that your political views have anything to do with why you are here todayâ and then sentenced me to serve ten months in federal prison.

**Court Transcript:**

&gt;THE COURT: And has anyone threatened you in any way in order to cause you to plead guilty in this case?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: It depends on how you define ""threaten,"" but I would say no, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: By ""threat"" what I mean is someone said if you don't plead guilty, you're going to be harmed or some member of your family will be harmed or something bad will happen to you apart from the legal process.

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: Nothing apart from the legal process, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: So the threat that you were referring to is the threat you would receive more time in prison if you were to go to trial and be convicted?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: That and additional charges, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: And additional charges. Okay. So your decision to plead guilty has, in fact, been influenced by the possibility that you could receive additional charges and additional prison time; is that right?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: But there are no other threats of any kind or nature other than that?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: None other than that, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: Are you presently under the influence of any drug or medication?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: I've been taking cold medicine.

&gt;THE COURT: All right. Does the cold medicine affect your ability to understand what you're doing right now?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: It might impair my ability to determine that. I feel pretty miserable. I have the flu currently.

&gt;THE COURT: Would it be better to do this a different day?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to do this today

&gt;THE COURT: Again, I don't want to have a problem later because on reflection you don't believe you understood what you were doing. Does the medicine you take affect your judgment to the extent that you don't understand the questions I'm asking you?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: I don't think so, Your Honor.

&gt;THE COURT: All right. Does it affect your understanding of the importance of this particular proceeding?

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: I hope not, Your Honor. I'm sure my mental capacity isn't, you know, up to par compared to how it would be normally.

&gt;THE COURT: Well, I want to be clear here that if you have any doubt about your ability to comprehend and understand what's taking place we should -- we should do it another time. This is truly a case of haste makes waste. If you plead guilty today and decide two weeks from now that I really didn't mean to do that and if it hadn't been for that medicine I wouldn't have, it's going to be a very messy thing for everybody concerned especially you. So if you have any question in your mind about your ability to think clearly this morning, I will continue this to another day.

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: In all honesty I think that that might upset, you know, two of the attorneys present and I'm willing to sign today.

&gt;THE COURT: But, you see, I appreciate your concern for them, but if sometime in the future you have buyer's remorse about this plea agreement, to be very blunt about it, and you say, ""I didn't understand what was happening and I didn't knowingly and intelligently give up my rights and I didn't understand the consequence of my plea,"" then that would have to be litigated. I don't want to create a situation where that's going to occur. So I have to ask you again if you have any doubt about your ability mentally to proceed this morning, then we should proceed at a different time.

&gt;THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to sign today. I feel I can do so knowingly and intelligently. 

Bitcoin Jesus Christ! Did he really think he was going to pull some juvenile shit with the judge and get out of this? This is not home room, it's federal court. Just answer the questions the way your attorney told you to and accept your sentence. You've had way more than plenty of time before the hearing to decide whether you want to plead guilty.

&gt;THE COURT: Okay. Let me then discuss with you the elements of each of these offenses ...

1. mining has become very centralised with a handful of mining pools being in charge of all mining

2. it is not possible to verify that two mining pools aren't actually operated by the same entity

3. in practice people don't store the whole blockchain but instead use lightweight wallets or third party bitcoin providers which (yes it kind of defeats the whole purpose)

4. the whole philosophy relies on this crypto-anarchy idea that one can replace all human structures which rely on trust with trustless systems; imagine a society without a government; everything is market based and trustless; that's the idea; however I think it remains to be shown whether this is at all possible (trustless systems) and whether they would even be an improvement at all

5. but all of this aside, a technology like this needs a use case, there is currently no incentive for the average Joe to use BTC. back in 2011 everyone was building all these online platforms that accepted bitcoin; pretty much none of them are still in business; nobody cares; BTC seems to be only used for buying weed on the internet and moving money out of China.

d9nbno3,GrowHempColorado,38,"Hey, everyone, thanks for taking the time to read the article and why we feel this an integral component to moving both the Hemp industry forward, but perhaps more relevant to most of you, having a solid use case for a closed-looped ecosystem within Ag-bitcoin. We're not averse to the use of cash, but in an ideal system the need to exit into the fiat system is less than desirable given how much we can do with btc. 

Personal shouts to the whole Mycelium team, particularly Dmitry (Rassah) we had a blast that weekend! 

&gt;So these hemp farmers will need to use decentralized services like LocalBitcoins, MyceliumLocal Trader, OpenBazaar, BitSquare, and Rein if they think Bitcoin's volatility is too much and want to convert it into other currency, goods or services.

While we advocate the use of all of those aforementioned services... but, not quite, our subsidiary services 1620Solutions.com offer farmers the ability to lock-in their current BTC balances into the current USD price to avoid price volatility if they so desire as a feature when they sign up for an account. We work one-one with our clients and they all have specific needs, some like to diversify their btc and like to keep a percentage in btc, and decided to cash out some profits during the recent price rise to $740, which they all agreed was a nice windfall.

They really get the necessity to hedge themselves, but they require some time to explain how seamless it all is once inside the btc ecosystem.

We also offer the ability to use traditional payment methods (credit cards) to pay their suppliers, purchase goods/services as well the ability to withdraw cash from those very same cards--fees apply, of course. 

We have been trying out an NFC solution to add as an adjunct payment option that we hope to be able to offer moving forward, and I'm happy to say things have been going rather well!

All the Best

Bitcoin sellers on places like localbitcoins.com need it to reduce fraud risk. They are subject to scams involving payment fraud and chargebacks, ie. stolen cards and hacked accounts.

Bitcoin itself has no such requirements. If you want to avoid strenuous ID requirements you'll have to meet in person and deal with cash, or use a payment method that is irreversible like Western Union, money orders etc. Bitcoin is irreversible and that makes it incompatible with forms of payment that can be reversed. Too many have found that out the hard way and once bitten won't deal with possibly fake payments.

d9nbarz,papabitcoin,17,"I think you are very confused - you think of bitcoin protocol as some kind of fort knox - in your mind as long as it is stable the value of your bitcoin will hold their value.  That is wrong.  While, having a well defined, capped and predictable issuance for bitcoin is a necessary condition to achieve scarcity and thus potentially become a store of value (particularly in a high inflation environment), it is not a sufficient condition in and of itself.  What also gives value to bitcoins are the fact that people are willing to keep buying and holding.  They do that in the times of rising bitcoin price.  But when there is something better that comes along that provides them with more utility and a better underlying structure for governance of the protocol there is a real risk that some people will start switching out of a crippled and stifled coin.  Be aware that stock market crashes aren't caused by everybody selling their shares at once - but rather because a relatively small percentage started selling aggressively and the rest follow in increasing amounts of panic.  So while you may hold your bitcoins, you actions alone won't stop the price lowering if a reasonable amount of people decide to opt for something better. (A declining price for bitcoin is extremely bad because miners lose money and close leading to a less secure network).

Bitcoin is in its infancy and so is cryptocurrency in general.  At this stage people are still able to hedge their bets by holding bitcoin and taking positions in other currencies that they think might grow.  They are not forced to sell one to buy another due to the relative immaturity of the market place.  As things mature and the price of entrance into other established coins rises it is more likely people will need to sell down one to buy the other.

You are not seeing bitcoin as existing in an ecosystem.  Let me tell you what happens to species in an ecosystem that are unable to adapt - they go extinct.

Not only that, but while you are happy bitcoin can't change. Many people who bought and held did so on the assumption that the blocksize would grow as technology and techniques permitted and that it would not be forever restricted at 1mb.  After all in the early stages people bought in due to Satoshi's vision.  Many are very unhappy with all this and if something more closely resembling Satoshi's vision arises they could well switch - at the moment most people who feel like this are ""holding and hoping"" that change will come, particularly as they don't want to sell only for some compromise being reached and the thing rising in value which they may miss out on.  But when all hope is extinguished, be in no doubt, many will exit.

What gives bitcoin value is controlled number of coins + utility.  Utility is rapidly declining.

You are not living in the real world, but in some kind of fool's paradise.  But by the time you realize you are mistaken it will be too late for you and for all of us as well.",2016-11-06 06:08:46

d9nig1k,exmachinalibertas,16,"Thank you.  Before the election shitstorm, this sub used to be somewhat interesting and have a lot of posts that were valid possible takes on established stories, with some reasonably thoughtful insights even if they were far-fetched.  It was good food for thought, even if in the end I dismissed the majority of them.

But recently it's been full blown stereotypical whackpot nutjobs and is just a complete shit hole.  I'm sorry to break it to you guys but Hillary Clinton is not the Devil-incarnate.  If you lunatics actually took the time to research each of the claims against her, you'd find that yeah she's done a handful of shitty things and made some questionable decisions and alliances, but on the whole, she's -- well I don't want to say ""not bad"", but what you might expect from an average politician.

What really saddens me is Wikileaks.  It's always been pretty clear that Assange was a narcissist, if you took the time to actually research him and find out what the people close to him thought of him.  And it's totally plausible and within character that he would lie about using a condom while having sex.

But wikileaks at least seemed to be able to separate from him and be a somewhat neutral publisher of information.  I liked wikileaks.  I liked what they stood for.  Regardless of my views on Assange, I appreciated that he brought about wikileaks and made hacktivism and leaking/whistle-blowing something people appreciated and relied on as necessary to a democracy and a refuge of last resort for the freedom of the press.

And then this election cycle happened, and Julian's narcissism and crazy political ideas managed to get a stranglehold of whatever integrity wikileaks had left and dragged it down into the gutter with him.

What a shame.  Still, I have to thank the guy.  Wikileaks and Bitcoin were the primary reasons I decided to teach myself programming and get good enough with computers to get a sysadmin job.  I value the ideals of transparency and access to information.  I agreed with most of the things that the so-called ""cypherpunks"" espoused.  And it kept gnawing at me that I wasn't good enough to contribute to helping people with technology.  That phrase was always in the back of my mind:  ""Cypherpunks write code.""  Ideas are a dime a dozen, but it means shit until you actually implement it and people can use it.

So for all my annoyance, frustration, and anger, I owe the dude a debt of gratitude, and on the whole, the world is better off for him and Wikileaks having been in it.

You know how to get people to buy anime? A service like steam. There is a few series/movies on steam right now and while the series are somewhat reasonable in price($1.99/2.99 per episode) the movies end up at $4 to rent for 48 hrs and $13 to own which is a bit steep. As for the series there is even discounts if you buy an entire season. The cut for steam is 30% or maybe less for movies and they handle all the distribution and sales end of it with the studio getting a check. Imagine if you liked watching say Grimgar(a series I liked) and your option of supporting them are to buy a Japanese Blu-ray disc that would likely never be used(maybe not even usable if they region lock it?) or buy the manga which does not support a s2. Those are not great options.

This results in some unnecessary (and indeed, harmful) variables being included, like ""total bitcoins"", and ""hash rate"" as well as ""difficulty"". All linearly correlated, the first being a simple function of time (and indeed, even the other two variables...). Pick one. Not all three.

Any autoregressive variable (and indeed, the intercept itself) would have served the same purpose while generating less error - they modeled this as a time series after all. My gut tells me they data mined the shit out of the variables and the time period to get that result. Anyone can forecast into a dataset and get great results. I'd like to see them calculate the coefficients on the entire known dataset, forecast into unknown territory, and report back in 6 months. Further, the result is quite meaningless in the realm of actionability. Daily price sign change doesn't give you any meaningful trade insight if there's no prediction about the volatility or level of the price change. At least they used the right kind of equation for a binomial dependent variable. But I would have rather them try to get some decent results with a non-binomial dependent variable. Or at least, even try to predict something meaningful (will the price move up 10% today, yes or no; will the price move down 10% today, yes or no). At least that would provide meaningful insights. Although, I bet that not surprisingly, a meaningful result in that realm would be hard to achieve.

Finally, the 10 minute and 10 second estimates were, unsurprisingly, useless. I applaud these students for studying bitcoin, but there's really no surprise or actionable insight to be found in this paper. Hell, someone with an undergraduates understanding of GLM could probably put something together in a few days that gets close to this if all you want to do is predict the sign of the price delta on a given day.

**Satoshi Nakamoto** *2009-01-17 09:58:44 UTC*

*Re: Bitcoin v0.1 released*

&gt; I would be surprised if 10 years from now we're not using
electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.

&gt;It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or **micropayments** 
for adult sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.

&gt;It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. ""Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""

&gt;Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

&gt;It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly **pay a few cents** to a 
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine. ",2016-11-07 23:16:25

d9pjgnh,cdecker,19,"We have a simple flooding routing protocol ready that can scale up to a few tens of thousand channels. It just forwards the channel state to all nodes so that they can locally construct a route that will get their payments to the destination. For 100'000 channels this requires 84 MB in memory, though we are confident we can drop this considerably in the future, e.g., by aggregating redundant paths and delaying announcements by nodes that are unreliable. Beyond that we are investigating a number of possible routing protocols, Flare being only the newest one.

About spending 20% of the coins you own to create a channel: reducing the load on the Bitcoin network by using Lightning will also lower the fees you have to attach to your transactions, hopefully making it possible to setup a new channel for a few cents instead of the $2.43 citet by the OP :-)

Backups: you will only need to keep track of the latest state and be able to recognize if your counterparty misbehaves by watching on-chain for the anchor transaction to be spent. This can also be outsourced to another node you control, or even to an untrusted third-party which will react on your behalf if something bad happens. If you lose your wallet, just wait for the counterparty to unilaterally close the channel and refund your remaining coins to a cold wallet you specified during the setup of the channel.

We would also never propose to keep all of your coins in a hot wallet, just the amounts that you need for day-to-day transfers, just like you would with a Bitcoin wallet. You'd still keep your savings in a cold wallet.",2016-11-07 23:14:38

I never suggested it was. In fact I made it 100% clear that i didn't know if it was. 

&gt;That said, the majority of past and current bitcoin users want to see a larger max_block_size, and a small group of well funded terrorists have blocked every attempt to grow Bitcoin. 

You have this backwards. Most users don't have much of an opinion and just follow specialists (I'm not saying this is a good thing, as I would prefer users to be educated, but just is the reality we face and unlikely to change because its a matter of human nature and psychology.) Most specialists are pro core roadmap and in overwhelming numbers, from the thousand+ developers to oracles like Andreas, to owners of the most popular bitcoin websites. Therefore the crowd will likely follow them. All the evidence thus far supports this as well , from looking at activity numbers of live users, to content, to polls of developers, to node count, to blocks mined, ect... 

Than the next largest group is those that understand the details and support core. 

Than is a very small group of vocal supporters of big blocks at any cost. 

The smallest group (but very wealthy old timers )are those that follow MP and http://thebitcoin.foundation and they are extremely conservative and basically want no changes , not even segwit, and will definitely avoid any HF at all costs .

Now, it depends on how large his customer base it. Does he get over 1 million purchases a month, like a lot of major companies handle? Or we talking 100 signups a month? Because then it's a lot easier, but meh.

Fraud is different from sock puppeting. Because you see someone using a US based credit card from Mother Russia or Scam-Central and 100+ other factors that I won't list here. With sock puppeting though, you don't necessary need to send goods/ software to an unverified location. You merely need to pretend to be a new, internally consistent person.

This guy has his head up his ass. 30 minutes on 4chan and you can figure out how to obscure your identity on either a messageboard or another website.

Let's look at the example again. Signing up for a Google account. OP, Me, and President Barack Obama can all sign up for an account tomorrow BillAnderson1938382938@gmail.com, name: Bill Anderson ... using the exact same VPN out of some web server located in Salt Lake City, UTAH, same IP, same MAC address, same whatever the fuck. How in the hell is Google or Mr. Robot Guy going to tell the three of us apart? He can't. Not unless we put a credit card down but you don't have to with Google. You might be able to obscure that a few ways too via a company or bitcoin or who knows.

Or hell have someone else do it for you. Can a computer actually tell WHO is sitting in front of it? No, it cannot. Period. Unless it's infected, the webcam is on, and NSA-level facial recognition software is turned on. But if Google did that, their CEO would be raided by the FBI and thrown in pound-me-in-the-ass prison.

However, his approach fails, as usual. 

The graph in the OP is simply a scientific graph - it does not talk about ""lizard people"" or about ""Jews"".

(1) AXA is the #2 company with the most economic power &amp; connections in the world

(2) AXA's venture capital arm (AXA Strategic Ventures) is a lead investor in Blockstream.

(3) AXA would lose trillions of dollars in ""fiat"" if Bitcoin were to become a serious currency.

(4) Blockstream, part-owned by AXA, opposes simple and safe on-chain scaling for Bitcoin.

To anarchists, this means decentralization of power through the use of technology. Which we develop for that purpose. All kinds of anarchists want to end corporatism, and though you may wish to keep the state they are at least your allies in this regard.

We developed bitcoin in order to weaken the banking industry by making them obsolete. By making a better technology. And it is still immature but even today, cryptocurrency is a much better technology than traditional money.

We want to develop urban wireless mesh networks to circumvent ISP restrictions, increase anonymity and privacy on the internet, and increase redundancy to avoid outages.

We want to develop decentralized social media platforms so that Reddit or Facebook or Twitter can't silence opinions they disagree with.

We want to develop decentralized, P2P video sharing services so that YouTube cannot censor videos, and so that no group or company has to bear the cost of hosting millions of videos, and also to reduce strain on the internet infrastructure caused by asymmetrical traffic.

And so much more. Each of these innovations combines a political goal (weakening the control of the state or its corporate arms) with real logistical benefits that EVERYONE wants. There is no fighting. There is just a slow, subtle migration of power from the elites down to the people who deserve it.

Crypt your wallet. Don't lose your passphrase. Print it out, tear off the first or last few letters, write them on a big photo of you and send that to your Mom.

Don't store BTC at the market/vendor.

Backup your encrypted wallet. Don't use anything that auto-connects for backups, upload it yourself after each transaction. (So use one for small stuff that doesn't have much money, and use one for cold storage. Read about these and ask folks here to make sure you got it, before implementing them.)

Don't put your cold-storage wallet on your phone. Investing means keeping it long term. No need to have 100+ BTC on your phone.

If you want ""stop-loss"", then instead of keeping it at the vendor investigate options (as in you can ""buy"" a contract with someone wherein that someone agrees to buy BTC from you for X USD, if the spot price on the whatever markets goes below Y), as insurance. See also [hedging risks](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-hedge-Bitcoin-risk).

Of course as vendors/markets get bigger and bigger they get [insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4g8t13/are_there_any_exchanges_with_insurance_in_case/), so _maybe_ it's easier and safer than doing the whole cold-storage dance.

Anyhow. You can just buy BTC-based instruments with USD, so you don't even have to handle it. But of course, if you do it yourself then you can prepare for the collapse of the dollar and whatnot.

d9uq4ni,nullc,16,"&gt;&gt; the inaccurate implication that more incompatible implementations means more developers.

&gt; everything else aside, I take issue with this statement. this has to rank pretty high up in the list of problems with bitcoin-core. the issue is not that we need multiple implementations in and of itself to attract more devs. The problem is there is no damn standard for how the consensus logic should work. every implementation has to be bugward compatible with core otherwise it'll be at risk of forking or losing money. This limits everyone's choice and forces everyone to only work with core. 

The incompatibilities that I am referring to are _intentional_. 

Everything changed by the community around the Bitcoin repository (and in core) in the consensus rules gets detailed specifications. I think specifications are important and have put in a lot of effort making them happen.  Bitcoin is an open collaboration and the obligation to create something can only fall to the people who wish to take it on.  Specifications are also an area where XT/Classic/etc. have fallen down almost completely. 'you do see the irony, no?'

But aside-- in spite of my agreement that they're essential-- you seem to have a misunderstanding of what specifications can *possibly* accomplish here.  Lets imagine that you have specified behavior X, but in the network behavior X and Y is implemented: The result is a seriously broken network.  What matters is the network behavior-- the living and breathing machinery of consensus, the specification is a dead tree with no direct effect on the world.  The value of a specification is where it helps reduce the diversity of behavior but because specification language is usually, though not always, less precise than source code (which can have a strong formal definition) its ability to do so is inherently limited.  Consider another case,  say the spec says X but the network widely implements incompatible rule Y.   To work with the network at least in the immediate you must implement Y, and unless something is inherently bad about Y the situation would be resolved by changing the specification to indicate Y-- anything else would be very costly and risky.

This is also generally the case for widely used internet standards. But it is all the more profound in the case of cryptographic consensus: In many cases _no_ discrepancy in behavior can be tolerated, too restrictive or too permissive both can cause consensus splits, the behavior must often be exact. The specification of exact behavior is quite difficult and failure prone.  Specifications can help better communicate and get more agreement, they can also aid review and analysis which doesn't need an absolutely precise understanding.  But barring formal specification languages (which are effectively source code) a specification is not a part of the living consensus itself, and so it cannot be normative even though it is valuable.

Blockstream should start searching for a new business plan because the community and miners are in the process of leaving Blockstream. Once the miners have decided and agreed on a hard forking method, we will have new leaders. The new leaders will be the Bitcoin Unlimited developers team and Blockstream will become irrelevant because Bitcoin will no longer be using the software from the Bitcoin Core team.

[Mike Pence, Chairman of Executive Committee and Vice President-elect:](http://www.ontheissues.org/IN/Mike_Pence_Technology.htm)

&gt;Pence co-sponsored Internet Freedom Act

&gt;*Congressional Summary:* Prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from proposing, promulgating, or issuing any regulations with regard to the Internet or IP-enabled services. Makes such prohibition non-applicable to regulations that are determined necessary to:

&gt;1. Prevent damage to U.S. national security;

&gt;2. Ensure public safety; or

&gt;3. Assist or facilitate any actions taken by federal and state law enforcement agencies.

&gt;*Congressional Findings:* 

&gt;1. The Internet and all IP-enabled services are services affecting interstate commerce; and

&gt;2. such services are not subject to the jurisdiction of any State or municipal locality.

&gt;*OnTheIssues Explanation:* **This bill opposes ""net neutrality,"" the principle that all users should have equal access to the Internet.** By disallowing FCC regulation, commercial carriers could create ""tiered service"" (which is the opposite of ""net neutrality""). Tiered Internet service would allow, for example, faster access for companies who paid more (such as for ads).

And there you have it. The only politically-experienced or publicly opinionated individual in Trump's entire executive committee (managing his White House transition via figuring out who will run various parts of the government) that is *possibly* open to net neutrality is Peter Thiel. And typically billionaire businessmen from Silicon Valley don't stick around campaigns very long.

EDIT: That's be 13 of the 14 people in his currently-23-person executive committee transition team that both have publicly stated opinions on net neutrality (or exceptionally likely stances based on affiliation) and are wholly against it. The remaining 9 people are retired 

1. Army Gen. Michael Flynn, 
2. Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric
3. Daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner
4. Former Breitbart CEO Stephen Bannon
5. GOP donor Rebekah Mercer
6. Banker Steven Mnuchin
7. Financier Anthony Scaramucci
8. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi

d9x1yce,ferretinjapan,13,"Well, there we have it folks, Blockstream is playing the Bitcoin community like a fucking fiddle right now, and all his cronies are playing along. FYI, these published patents were lodged 18 months ago!! That is if this is in line with the American patent system. So, soon after Blockstream was formed, they've been scrambling to lock down every single piece of intellectual property they can get their hands on, and since CORE has been employed since Blockstream was formed, that means EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF IP PRODUCED BY THEM BELONGS TO BLOCKSTREAM TOO, SegWit, Lightning, whatever else they have waiting in the wings. All theirs.

I believe a slow clap is in order.

THIS is why they've fought tooth and nail to prevent a blocksize increase, and if SegWit had been deployed in time, they'd have fucked the miners, and the entire community by being able to completely control, WHO, and HOW Seg Wit transactions can be used. Don't worry your pretty little heads people, there's almost certainly a SW patent already lodged. 

I fucking said it 3 months ago:

&gt;[Yep, this is not a free market, this is a cornered market, or depending on your point of view, a natural monopoly. Big money pays to lock down the majority of Core developers with fat paycheques, spreads poisonous PR (compliments of Greg and Theymos) and threaten to take their ball and go home if the miners consider alternatives. Lets not forget their plans for a Defensive Patent portfolio, yeah, ""defensive"".

&gt;Users/Merchants cannot force a change of software without the miners, and as long as the miners continue to be willing slaves to Blockstream, Bitcoin is going nowhere except where Blockstream wants it to go.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vcicl/cnledger_andreas_the_market_decided_to_strongly/d5xetg1/

and here:

&gt;The fact that they didn't have a single patent before setting up the pledge is proof enough to me that this was purely a defensive move based on the news of some other corporate planning to monetize Craig Wright's patents.

&gt;It's still a good move to protect Bitcoin while at the same time protecting Blockstream.

&gt;&gt;[â]ferretinjapan [+72] 1 point 3 months ago 

&gt;&gt;I wouldn't be so sure. Patents take a long while to be approved so the fact that they don't have them in hand does little to assuage me, they could've filed dozens already for all we know and they're simply in the early stages of approval, and besides, you can be certain that when Blockstream gets sold (not if but when as BS is a startup, they're designed to be sold) those patents will pass from their control and any previous agreements will mean nothing.

&gt;&gt;If they got the patents and gave them to a non-profit I'd trust their motives, as doing so would serve exactly the same end and ensure the patents are not abused, not by them, or by anyone else, but I bet Greg will fight very, very hard to avoid that situation. He'll come up with all sorts of excuses, handwave it away, etc. . Those patents are a means of controlling people he currently can't herd according right now.

Not only is it asking a lot for people in rural areas, or even people in non rural areas who aren't very computer proficient, to grasp how to buy, store, and transfer bitcoins with confidence and peace of mind, it is even more challenging to expect them to wrap their mind around the still very volatile market. 

Gold is completely different. You buy gold from a reputable source and bury it in your backyard if nothing else.

So I agree that it isn't going to be currency devaluation causing the whole world to rush into btc. We see a rush into btc when the Chinese yuan is devalued but that's really only coming from the Chinese who already understand and value BTC and the other bitcoiners around the world who chase that price action. 

The market cap is still a measly $10B or so. Nothing with a market cap that small will ever be considered a safe haven for storing wealth.

Do I think this means that Bitcoin won't ever moon again? No. I just think it's gonna have to come from bitcoiners themselves getting more and more confident in the technology and BTCs ability to hold value. Bitcoiners don't even have the confidence to get back to the ATH right now, and for good reason. There have been a lot of rekting. You also have a vocal minority of bitcoiners or would be bitcoiners constantly telling you bitcoin is broken and that you should really be looking at alt coins.

However, once bitcoiners themselves can really hold tight to their bitcoins,really believe in them as a store of value, and see that the technology is able to evolve (come on Segwit...) then they will hold tight, the price will rise, and non bitcoiners will rush on board when they see the price going up, and only when they see the price going up, period.

It's like this trump thing. Yes we saw a tiny trump pump. Was it even a tiny bit related to non bitcoiners suddenly getting interested in bitcoin? Of course not. It was just bitcoiners speculating.

But either way, Xtreme Thinblocks (already deployed in Bitcoin Unlimited) or Compact Blocks (already deployed in Bitcoin Core) also pretty much refute this theory because they make block transmission very quick.

Until then, I shall embrace my bitterness and growing disinterest in short term bitcoin happenings, while faintly hoping that the ecosystem eventually manages to escape the trap it's currently in.

In that optic, scaling is a fairly tiny piece of the picture. Sure, letting blocks get full when there was plenty of lead time is, applying Hanlon's razor, plainly stupid and likely damaged bitcoin's adoption by discouraging various use cases, but even if segwit or whatever else deliver some glorious scaling, it won't fix bitcoin's underlying governance issue.

d9y9h30,tobixen,23,"I'm a local bitcoin trader, exchanging bitcoins with cash for a commission - and I usually used ""priority"" in mycelium when sending bitcoins, not to give the customer a bad customer experience.  With ""priority"" one can be reasonably sure that the transaction gets included in the next block, the probability is very small (but present) that it will take more than an hour.  Waiting is usually not an option, zero-conf is the norm.  Once a cash-buying blockchain.info-using customer resent me the transaction with fewer inputs and higher fee after the 72-hour timeout, except for that, no noteworthy incidents.

With ""standard"" there is a good probably that the transaction will be processed within one of the first blocks, the problem is just that every now and then the transaction may be delayed with some 12 hours, giving a terrible customer experience for anyone having better expectations to bitcoin transactions.

Usually priority was between NOK 1 and NOK 2, but I have noticed lately that frequently the recommended priority fee in my mycelium (I empty it frequently and get large amounts of bitcoins into it, it isn't filled with dust) now is between 10 and 20 NOK, which is more than USD 1.  I'm running with small margins and I'm doing both big and small exchanges - the profit from my small trades is often insignificant compared to the time I put into them - paying such a high fee is just not an option for the smallest trades.  It could be that it's just mycelium that has lifted it's standards though?

This is a usecase that screams for some kind of off-chain solution, but they are just not available at the moment.  I do believe the 1 MB block size cap is a major obstacle to adoption at the moment.  If we would have lifted it to 2 MB or 8 MB in a hard fork already in 2015, we could have been on the moon now.  Perhaps we'd even have lightning ready by now, one shouldn't underestimate the cost of the current community rift and arguing.

Even with lightning becoming a standard, 1 MB will prove to be too little in the long run.",2016-11-13 17:43:59

d9ydynw,shyliar,20,"Actual all time low of around 0.00212 was reached in February 2013. In August of 2013 it looked like that low was on it's way to be repeated. Forums were barraged with comments about Litecoins death. In November of 2013 LTC reached it's all time high. Fact is no one can predict next low or high.

As for what Litecoin has going for it here's my list:

- Capable of four times as many transactions as Bitcoin in a ten minute period. Frankly if payment processors had adopted Litecoin in the past year current Bitcoin block discussions would be irrelevant (and likely the price of both coins higher). Anyone who has watched these discussions understands the immediate advantage of a network with larger transactional capability.  

- Faster confirmation times. The only people who don't think this is important have never spent a single coin or they have patience that the average person does not possess.

- The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks.

- Anti-spam.

- Fast well established network. Current Hashrate is 1,643 GH/s. Since scrypt is memory intensive it is known to be approximately 1000 times slower hardware wise in comparison to SHA256. Fair comparison to the Bitcoin network requires multiplying that hashrate by 1000 (1,643 TH/s). The fact is for most of Litecoins history the hashrate has been relatively high and secure. Those comparing it to the Bitcoin network without considering this 1k factor are either being disingenuous or just ignorant of the facts.

- Continuous development look here at number of releases in past few years: https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/releases.

- Upcoming new features and active development look here for whats happening in 2016: 
https://litecoinassociation.org/data/roadmap.pdf

- Longevity. Many coins have temporarily eclipsed litecoin as they were marketed for the purpose of increasing the fiat accounts of a small group and emptying the accounts of new users. Unfortunately this has been detrimental to crypto-space in general.

- Great community. Definitly helps when consensus is needed.

- Fully supported by GoCoin a growing merchant payment processor used by thousands of merchants https://www.gocoin.com/ as well as other processors such as coinpayments, Asmoney, Alfacoins and Coinify

- Liquidity. You can sell thousands and not crash the market. Maintains value. Look at the chart here indicating volume in the last 24 hours relative to other coins http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets in fact volume has remained high month after month for years.

- The speed, liquidity and value of Litecoin is useful to traders seeking arbitrage opportunities between exchanges.

- Now on GDAX soon to be on coinbase.

- Upcoming release to include a on-chain adaptive block size scaling solution. This will substantially increase the transactional capacity of Litecoin. 

- Planned anonymity features for an upcoming release. https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/53c0v6/confidential_transaction_for_litecoin/

- Fair release. In a crypto world of premined and ICO releases many appreciate this fact. The code was released well before the Genesis block was mined and everyone knew when it would be going live; therefore, individuals could anticipate and get their miners and software ready.

- It's primary function is to be a cryptocurrency.

- Still mineable in many western countries even after electrical costs are factored in. Here in Canada my Titans still make a profit long after shutting my Neptunes down.

- It will always maintain the integrity of the blockchain (no hard forks for special interests).

- Security.

d9yq9lq,jstolfi,99,"When Alice wants to send a payment to Bob, and there is no payment channel between them, the LN's ""routing system"" is supposed to find a path of two or more channels that connect them, whose intermediate nodes are all online and willing to help, and whose channels all have enough clearance (unused funding) to carry the payment amount plus the fees demanded by the intermediate nodes.   Once the routed is identified, Alice and Bob negotiate with the intermediate nodes to arrange the necessary channel payments.  If the negotiation fails, the routing system must find another path, without the problematic intermediaries.

Just to get started, the LN ""routing system"" will have to work for a million users, who will be constantly getting online and offline.  It must work even while millions of payments change the clearances of several million channels each day, by amounts that in principle are known only to the two users connected by each channel.   It must do that in a way that scales to hundred of millions of users and possibly ten or more transactions per day for the average user,  without requiring each user do a thousand times more work just to process the same number of payments.  That is the *technical* routing problem.

No one dares to guess what topology the LN will have.  The only topology for which the *technical* routing problem has a known solution is the totally centralized one:  there is a single big hub (or a small cartel of cooperating hubs), and all users have one channel to that hub.  Then the hub knows precisely the clearance of all channels, every path has two hops, and the only intermediary -- the hub -- is online ""by definition"".  But that is just Visa...  

For any reasonably distributed topology, there is still no known solution for the routing problem  even just on paper; and it is quite possible that there may never be. 

In fact, strictly speaking, the routing problem in a decentralized topology is unsolvable.  If Alice has three outgoing channels, each with 10 BTC clearance, she cannot send a 15 BTC LN payment to anyone -- even though she has 30 unspent BTC of her own, locked up in the LN.  And, in any reasonably decentralized topology that is not centrally planned, a large fraction of the users must have several payment channels -- otherwise the network will have two or more disconnected sub-networks.

Besides the technical problem, there are economic and usability ones.   Each intermediate node may have its own legal and personal constraints (""I will not forward dark market payments"", ""no payments to Iranian users"", whatever) and will presumably require a fee for his service; so Alice and Bob do not want *any* path, but would very much prefer a *short* path (which also increases the chances of the negotiation going through).  The intermediaries of an LN payment cannot steal, freeze, or reverse  the funds sent through it, true; but a user may irreparably lose all the payments that are sent to him, if he makes a mistake or fails to react in time to certain situations.

Moreover, the LN will only reduce on-chain traffic if each payment channel is used by many LN payments.  For that to happen, when a user who makes 1 payment per day creates a payment channel, he must lock into it, in advance, enough bitcoins to cover the maximum imbalance of payments that he expects to make through that channel in the next couple of weeks, at least.  For the same reasonl, a user who wants to be a middleman in multi-hop LN payment must lock up enough bitcoins in his outgoing channels to cover the maximum imbalance of *other people's* payments that he intend to push through them, over many days or weeks at least.

Finally, the LN will start reducing the on-chain traffic only after most bitcoin users have joined the LN and locked their bitcoins into it.  Until then, the LN will actually increase the on-chain traffic, since its users will often need to close and re-open channels to send/receive payments to/from bitcoin users who are not in the LN yet.

The existing LN ""implementations"" do not really solve the technical routing problem, and do not address the economic problems at all.   They are like those 1:100 scale models of buildings that architects make: which are not just too small to live in, but also lack many essential details like foundations and reiforced skeletons, interior spaces, elevators, plumbing, wiring, etc..  

That (being generous) is the state of the LN now.  Telling people that ""the LN is already implemented"" is very close to fraud: like the contractor telling the client that ""the buildings are ready"" when he means the scale models only.",2016-11-14 04:03:24

This resilience can make Bitcoin a better money.

In contrast, competing deliberately **incompatible** implementations, which will result in chainforks, are probably a bad idea, and may cause confusion, reply attacks, new liabilities for custodians and loss of funds.

No, that claim is false.  There are no routing solutions, only mock-ups that do not qualify even as proof-of-concept prototypes.

Payment channels are completely designed and work (technically) as advertised, but they are to the LN like bricks are to buildings.  Just because you can make the former does not mean that you can make the latter.

Ditto for multi-hop payments -- they work (technically) once the path is known and all nodes in it are cooperating.  But finding the path is the routing problem.

I also added picks that were chosen by different people, so some days if 3 different people would pick BOS -140 3u then I would have 9u on that game(wouldn't recommend placing more than 5% of you bankroll on ANY bet, ANY BET CAN LOSE... looking at you Clinton). I made 1u equal to 1% of my bank roll. I also made sure to only follow the people with a positive record. This is the list of the people I tailed.

From May 15, 2016 to June 4, 2016 I tailed every single pick and recorded it down in a spreadsheet(young no job... lots of time) This amounted to around 750 picks before I stopped. Here is a graph of the performance with each dot being a bet(it was kind of a weird spreadsheet). 

http://imgur.com/a/omJSR

One unit was 4mBTC or around like $2.50. I ended up going around negative 200mBTC before I stopped. A total of 4000mBTC was wagered so it ended up being like -5% ROI, which honestly isn't terrible.  

**This is what I have to say about the experience:**

* Even with tons of time on my hands this became very strenuous to tail everything and write it down. This was half the reason I stopped

* I also stopped because I was losing money.

* Use excel as a tracker and not google sheets because once you get a lot of data points in it becomes very slow regardless of your computer speed and internet connection.

* Track you bets - seriously do it, helps to keep you in check  

* Unless you are really experienced and you actually want to make money I wouldn't recommend trusting your own picks

* There is a lot about statistics I want to learn because I wonder if I tracked long enough to show a significant correlation of losing money

* Only tail people who track there picks publicly and have a following(unless you want to put in work to track smaller handicappers beforehand)

* I wouldn't pay for cappers, although I have paid for two ""premium"" twitter accounts to follow, we'll see how that turns out. 

*Be wary of tippers who seem to have ulterior motives (usually selling you a product, advertising a sports-book)

* Anybody can have a good streak, just cause some dude is up 20u in two weeks doesn't mean that it is going to continue. Some have been pushing a profit consistently, /u/ybk321, /u/Simaoms, BreakEvenBoys on Twitter, there are definitely more that I don't know. 

* Going back to winning trends, some people track on fansunite and you'll see them make a profit for like 2 or 3 months maybe longer and then the next months lose it all. This honestly confuses me and scares me. 

*anyone can lose their edge against the books(I don't know how to account for this)

* It's really annoying to be tailing and figure out the line has moved the wrong way by the time you get to it (happens so much smh)

* There was this guy in the nitrogensports chat named RealG and he supposely started with $500 and made  over like $300,000 in the end I think. I still haven't decided if this dude was that good at betting. It was faked. Or he just had a crazy run, he was actually on reddit and took down a post asking for advice on how to cashout in bitcoin cause I presume his lawyer he hired told him to(I stopped following the situation maybe someone can update us). 

* sports betting is more addicting than anything I can think of --&gt; so don't bet more than you can afford to lose and then probably less than that


After all of this I'm only tailing 5 people and using 1u as 10 mBTC ($7). I should also mention betting with bitcoin is a bet in itself because it could crash at any moment. I am now on the long road to recuperating an around 20u loss on Clinton(I promise I have learned my lesson). If I lose my $700 bankroll. I quit. Sike, I'll probably look into programming an arbitrage betting program and failing miserably or by making so much profit I get banned from all the sites, ha. Anyways this was more for me to think about betting. Best of luck and stay smart and self-aware.

da111ae,ethacct,31,"I want to highlight [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5cuqcl/daily_discussion_14nov2016/da0ykeu/) by /u/GrossBit - not because I believe it's wrong, but because I think it points out different ways of looking at Ethereum.

I agree that if you go in expecting a 33x return this month (or, potentially, ever again) then you're going to be disappointed.  Those opportunities don't come along very often, simply because they're not very sustainable.  I also know there are day-traders like /u/Arbitrage84 who slide in and out, trying to catch waves and trends and knives, and make a few percent here and there -- and there's nothing wrong with that method either.

But if you've seen any of my posts before, then you know I'm in it for the long haul (and you've also seen me use the following links, but that's because I feel like they do the best job of describing the potential for what Ethereum could become).

Bitcoin is like a lump of gold that sits in a safety deposit box, and is intrinsically valuable because of what it is.  But that's not the purpose of Ethereum. I think the vision for Ethereum's future is that is acts as the 'oil' which lubricates a large, vastly complex machine.  Vitalik himself [said a year and a half ago](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/13/visions-part-1-the-value-of-blockchain-technology/) that the value-prospect of Ethereum is not in a killer dapp, but in the convergence of many different systems all using Ethereum as the underlying foundation at the same time.

So imagine, one day, when a shipping company realizes they can save a few million dollars per year by implementing [IBM's supply chain software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0LsnzAe1Yg) and decided to buy a few hundred thousand ETH to get started.  Later that year, an eccentric millionaire from China decides he doesn't trust his government and wants to move all of his money into DGX tokens, and buys some ETH to fuel the transactions.  In 2018, Golem is moving full-steam ahead and a few server farms open up which require ETH to move the GNT.  Multiply this times a thousand (or a million) different endpoints and dapps, and that's where the value for ether comes from.  It doesn't happen overnight, it takes time.  And while all of this is going on, progress is still being made by the developers on the protocol, and it's become improved and battle-hardened, and it gets to the point where the electricity required to secure the network is minimal, and sharding/lightning networks allow for thousands of transactions per second.  It seems like 'ponzi-math' right now, because it doesn't actually DO any of these things yet.

The question is whether you think it will.  Are the developers are capable of delivering, and do you believe adoption will occur on a large scale?  To me, the answer to both of those questions is 'yes,' but I can't guarantee it.  The problem is, it's a bit like e-mail in the early days of the internet -- yes, it's way faster and more convenient than sending a letter through the postal system, but hardly anyone had an e-mail address, while everyone still had a postal address.  Fast-forward a few years later though, and that gap has gotten a lot smaller.  Nowadays, you'd be shocked to find anyone who *didn't* have an e-mail address.

So hey, $20, $10, $5, whatever.  I think the next major price jump will be whenever proof-of-stake is successfully implemented (and suddenly people realize that 1,000,000 new ether aren't being made and entering the market every month any more) and then after that, I'm not sure.  Or maybe it all gets flushed down the toilet, because it's crypto.  Who knows.  At any rate, I don't see a blockchain with more progress, more promise, better developers, or a brighter future.  As soon as I do, I'll jump ship in a heartbeat, but I think it will be harder to beat the head start Ethereum already has.

da108u3,americanpegasus,25,"My bigger concern would be divisive personalities attempting to fracture the community by blowing small and trivial issues up into sound bites that splinter our efforts off into many directions.  
  
What you need to watch out for is not censorship from this community, as I do not have any corporate allegiance - nor intend to establish any.  I have a day job which provides very well for me, and Monero is about more than getting rich to me and the other mods / devs.  
  
No, from my many years of studying how social warfare works, one of the first tenants in a successful attack is to divide a community.  After all, a strong and unified movement can be terrifying to those who wish to see it fail.  Far better to introduce seemingly insurmountable obstacles amidst the believers so that they do your work for you.  
  
This can be done by using multiple accounts to make it sound like there is a consensus that some decision by the devs is insidiously destroying a tech.  In fact, with some creativity and a little money behind the warfare, someone like JP Morgan could launch a surprisingly effective social assault on Monero.  
  
Step one: Find something reasonable that me or the other mods do, like delete excessive zerocash topics.  Or the point of attack could also be technical, like say at the next hard fork we implement Ring CT and they choose to use that to divide the community.  
  
Step two: Come up with many emotion based and character based attacks around whatever you can.  Claim that AmericanPegasus actually works for the US Goobernment so he can't be trusted (which I do, as a low level military peon).  Use multiple accounts to make a big rallying cry that the tyranny is killing Monero and vow to split off into a new community (or three).  Use money, power, and influence to pressure as many prolific members of the community to join you as possible.  At a minimum, they will be confused and disrupted.  
  
Step three: continue to support your new splintered community, and engage in continued character assassination across the board.  Do your best to degrade legitimate conversation on /r/Monero with useless topics that only complain about things that aren't even a problem.  Whenever the mods tell you to please get back on topic, should 'ZOMG censorship!' at the top of your lungs and make as much of a fuss as possible.  
  
Step four.  Ideally you can provoke mods and devs into emotional reactions to your social warfare, which will only serve to strengthen your case.  How can people trust the project when it's ran by such children?  
  
Step five.  Laugh all the way to your new Gold Level JP Morgan account.  
  
------  
  
It's a good thing I'm one of the good guys, because that's a taste of how I would go about disrupting a critical community such as this.  In fact, looking at Bitcoin, I'm sure you can draw your own parallels.  
  
Bottom line: this stuff will happen eventually, and likely more insidiously than what I described.  **Monero is going to threaten a lot of powerful people in ways they have never been threatened before.  We aren't going to a $trillion market cap without surviving a few social wars.  Expect it.**  
  
And just remember these words when it happens, and hold fast to the message and the principles of Monero - true decentralized and untraceable digital cash.  I don't always have all the answers, and I make mistakes, but trust that I and the devs/mods have the best in mind for Monero the technology... not our own pockets.

You can't fill every block 100% full for various reasons, so 800-850K average is ""pretty much full"" like a highway that has reached vehicle capacity.  Adding more transactions just creates a ""traffic jam"" and a lot of transactions get delayed.

In such an environment, the miners prefer to fill their blocks with fee-bearing transactions.  Back when blocks were only half full (a year ago), some miners would throw in zero fee transactions to be nice.  Now, after the reward halving, they want all the fees they can get.

Personally, I now only use bitcoin for large transactions, like 0.5BTC, so the fees don't eat me up.  This is called ""working as planned"" for the Core developers - drive up the fees, and make bitcoin itself a settlement layer.

The first thing he said was: that is really expensive! And now he is done with bitcoin and very happy with his fiat.

I know, we can argue all day that he is a moron, Im a bad teacher - and many other reasons. But, at the end of the day - the fees MUST be lower if we want bitcoin to go mainstream.

da26q94,theymos,36,"&gt; CSS abuse and comment manipulation

They often repeat the lie that comments are somehow manipulated, edited, or deleted using CSS. This isn't true. No editing takes place (and probably isn't possible), and if we wanted to delete a comment, we'd just delete it. Our CSS does something very simple: when you load a full comment page, the CSS just expands all comments that were collapsed due to being below-threshold. (You can tell which comments have been uncollapsed due to the /r/Bitcoin CSS because they'll have a [+] next to them instead of a [-].) This prevents a small number of users (or sockpuppets) from being able to significantly reduce a /r/Bitcoin user's ability to participate in discussions. Spinning this as censorship requires impressive doublethink; I have seen *many* big-blocker posts unhidden due to this CSS.

The other stuff in that medium post is either well-known /r/Bitcoin policy or lies. For example, even though they've been persistently trying to find a (nonexistent) link between me and Blockstream, the best they've come up with is that I am somehow owned by Blockstream because I once *paid* someone who would in the future end up being employed by Blockstream.

As for /r/Bitcoin policy, I've been very clear about it: If you don't like the policies, then you can leave. Subreddits are not democracies. We *could* just willy-nilly delete all comments that we don't like, as /r/The_Donald (for example) does. But as I said in that nice quote of mine about discovering Truth, I think that it's usually better to consistently apply moderation policies which allow for a substantial diversity of ideas. And that's what /r/Bitcoin strives to do, tempered by clearly-stated and reasonable (we believe) limitations such as the prohibition on contentious-hardfork-implementing software.

This argument though has massive holes in it and completely misses all of the nuance and consequences of raising the block size limit and the deployment of such a fork.

The ""censorship"" of clients implementing contentions hard forks (XT, Classic) is because theymos considers those clients to be altcoin clients. This is because they implement a contentious hard fork (i.e. does not have broad consensus) and thus follows different consensus rules. The key idea here is that compatibility is not the same has following the exact same rules. Furthermore, because it is a hard fork, it completely changes the consensus rules and thus would become an altcoin should it fork and two forks of the Bitcoin blockchain exist afterwards.

One common thing cited in that post are the number of points that a thread or post has. However, it is a well known fact that vote manipulation by r/btc'ers has and potentially continues to take place, thus making those points not representative of the actual voting opinions of users here at r/bitcoin.

The article also tends to attribute the actions of one moderator to be the collective agreed upon actions of all moderators. This is obviously incorrect as is even stated in one of the screenshots. This also contradicts (what I believe is) theymos' view on moderator actions, the mods can interpret the rules as they see fit. Moderator actions do not necessarily represent what all mods believe and follow.

Take some things with a grain of salt, such as where is quoting what banned users have said regarding the circumstances around their ban. Obviously most of those users will be pissed off and they may (probably) not be explaining everything that actually happened and may be paraphrasing or taking out of context statements made by mods in order to make their position seem more credible.

That doesn't do Bitcoin any service for adaptation and survival. If one implementation has a weakness, then they all share that weakness, and they could all die. Think in terms of evolution; each implementation should be unique and fill a niche in the environment - then the implementations can flounder or flourish as the environment decides. This ensures continued survival as a whole - like a living species. 100 non-unique potatoes may cause a catastrophic potato famine. 100 unique potatoes insulate against damages that might incur against any 1 strain of potato.

Furthermore, because bitcoinâs difficulty adjustment period is two weeks long, with ten minutes per block, whichever branch of the chain has the majority of hashrate behind it is almost certainly guaranteed to be the decisive winner; the chances of a fork producing two different bitcoins are low.

da3z140,ViaBTC,31,"I believe that until Bitcoin has achieved mainstream worldwide adoption, we should not be so strict about the size of the blocks, we should be allowing more and more users to use Bitcoin. All miners have a minimum transaction fee for every transaction, so when the number of transactions is great enough, transaction fees will be sufficient. Even if Bitcoin were already accepted by the mainstream, and ignoring the technical debate, we should not impose too strict a limit on the block size, because having predictable transaction fees and confirmation times is very important for the user experience.

da3tg90,ViaBTC,30,"Mining empty blocks is a necessary consequence of reducing orphan rates and maximizing profits, and it doesnât directly harm the Bitcoin network. It takes a bit of time from finding a block to having it broadcast to all of the nodes. As soon as a block is found, we begin mining the next one, and if a block is found in a very short time from the previous one, we donât have time to validate and fill it with transactions, leading to empty blocks. When a full block reaches our nodes, we just begin mining the next block. If we donât do this, then we will end up with orphaned blocks. Bitfury is foolish, and they donât understand the significance of this. You can see on blockchain.info, every month they have one or two orphan blocks. If we didnât do it this way, our empty blocks would have been orphan blocks instead.

We have also spent much time increasing our block synchronization, we use what I call âBlock high-speed networkâ technology to propagate blocks quickly. We have deployed nodes around the world for this purpose, and we use something similar to Xthin to get propagation times from 15 seconds down to ~1 second, and an additional 0.5 seconds to verify each block. On average when we broadcast an empty block, within ~1.5 seconds we can start mining a full block again. You can see a comparison here: https://twitter.com/ViaBTC/status/794054512390467584. Also, our empty block rate is almost the lowest: https://btc.com/stats/pool?pool_mode=month",2016-11-17 13:44:02

The point of using the term ""code monkey"" isn't to denigrate anyone's technical abilities (which frankly I'm not in any position to evaluate).

So while we might think of ""management"" as the miners, node operators, and investors who run the Bitcoin network and give it value, they don't directly pay the salaries of the developers. The developers are volunteers (and/or employees of a private company whose interests may not be totally aligned with the interests of the Bitcoin network as a whole).  And so you've got a collective action / free-rider problem.  That problem isn't insoluble, however.

da5d3x3,nullc,56,"&gt; The productive attitude in an Open Source project is to report bugs or submit Pull Requests, not blog about them.

They've never reported any of these ""bugs""-- but for these, the deeper reason appears to be that there isn't anything to report.

AFAICT  many of issues were actually caused by changes they made to code they didn't understand.

For example, #1 -- both the GUI and RPC return clear errors when the fees are nuts and don't ever make it to the code in question.  But I could see how an implementation thats ripping out the fee handling might break those invariants. Here is a picture of trying to pay a fee over the maximum in the GUI: http://people.xiph.org/~greg/temp/absurdfee.png  ... no transaction is created and life goes on like normal. RPC does the same thing. *Moreover*, if you do end up with a transaction in your wallet that can't go into the mempool in Bitcoin Core (which wouldn't happen due to too high a fee (see above) but could due to being too low-- though the wallet works hard to keep you from doing this to yourself),  you can simply right click on it and select 'abandon transaction'.

The #2 item is entirely about debug-lockorder, a highly specialized set of development testing harnesses which are _never_ used in production (they trash performance, and can cause spurious failures, among other issues). They replace every lock (code that synchronizes multiple threads) with instrumentation that records the locking infrastructure and can detect misuse that could cause deadlocks. They're a bit ugly but their uglyness is basically contained in a single file. BU's solution was to scramble up the whole codebase just to facilitate some special testing infrastructure which users _NEVER_ run. The fact that its implementation is a bit platform specific isn't especially interesting-- at least not for us. It would be fine to improve its portability if someone cared, but reorganizing the whole codebase in a fairly illogical way isn't a great way to go about it... and to call it a bug that it isn't portable is more than a stretch.

From a quick glance, #3 appears to be a place where BU was crashing because they [unsafely made message handling concurrent where it wasn't before as part of xthin](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/10#issuecomment-183506227); AFAIK none of those crashes ever existed in Bitcoin Core. (and if there was some race there that was never reported... Well, the findnodes infrastructure-- legacy from Bitcoin's creator-- has now been gone _completely_ for a while in Core... BU is based on fairly old code).

Perhaps the biggest and most concerning danger here isn't that they don't know what they're doing-- but that they don't know what they don't know... to the point where _this_ is their best attempt at criticism.

To explain hard forks, bitcoin is a protocol with a bunch of rules. Certain rule changes break network compatibility. Meaning, anyone who does not upgrade can no longer participate in the network. There are a few, highly highly contested (especially opposed by the technical community) hard fork proposals floating around, and groups that are very actively pushing adoption of these proposals.

The mods decided that while discussion of hardforks is okay, discussion of hardfork implementations is not okay unless the hardfork has widespread support (none of them do). This is resented intensly by the camps that support the hardforks (not surprising).

And lots of drama. Bitcoin is money, so people care more. Also everyone likes to think they have a qualified opinion, which means strife is more common and more intense, because nobody trusts any of the experts even when all the experts agree with eachother. Think the climate change debate but 5x as awful.

So the mods end up deleting a lot of posts which are genuine spam, a lot of posts which are not necessarily spam but are definitely controversial, and a lot of posts that are just plain misinformation.

I think this is a major social problem in the Bitcoin space.

In other types of projects, we'd have a sufficiently big list of ""cool projects"" that we could direct people to who weren't competent enough to work on the very core, but that isn't working out in Bitcoin development. One reason is Bitcoin Core is relatively simple: it'll always have orders of magnittude less code in the codebase than, say, the Linux kernel, simply because what it does is orders of magnitude less complex (we don't have to support thousands of different types of device drivers).

The other problem is ironically that Bitcoin Core _is_ simple: it looks easy to contribute too until you understand the implications of what you are doing better. I myself experienced this first hand when I initially learned about the Bitcoin protocol and read the codebase: my first reaction was ""this code is so simple, and obviously this scheme works and is a great idea!""

When asked how to ""earn consensus"" he basically says that any and all changes need to go through the full BIP process before even being allowed to be discussed on the subreddit. That's really funny because I don't remember SegWit going through the full BIP process before Blockstream and Core were able to make endless posts about it. In fact, I cannot think of a single change to the protocol they've ever made that was required to go through a nearly-complete BIP before they started flooding the sub on the subject. 

So far we have learned that anything which Core or Blockstream proposes as a protocol change can and will be posted about on r\bitcoin with or without any amount of BIP being finished. What's worse is that the pre-BIP discussion should not ever be censored from any bitcoin forum, ever. Why? Simply because what actual users and the general public thinks does matter in bitcoin. Anybody opposing the so-called ""anti-consensus changes"" can simply cite a lack of consensus in the community by way of censorship. If nobody on the largest forums is ever allowed to talk about certain changes to the protocol before they are pre-approved by the Core team then that means the devs are 100% centralized in a single repo. 

Who cares if bitcoin client development is completely centralized in a single repo? The same people who would care if all the bitcoin nodes or mining hardware were kept in a single location. In other words, it is in everybody's best interests to not have any part of bitcoin, from the hardware to the software, be invested in a single point of failure. Core can promote anything they want without any BIP completion on the largest forums and nobody else can even talk about their changes without going through the Core repo first.

da4nbbf,cointastical,21,"All proof-of-work (PoW) cryptos are vulnerable to the 51% attack.

This attack might be performed for various reasons.   We're probably familiar with the potential for a state actor to perform a 51% attack that would censor all transactions and thus freeze / shut down the network completely.   Another 51% attack might be for the purpose of double spending against exchanges -- an attack that would be performed for the potential for profit from the attack.

But this same ""attack weapon"" is available for the reason of pushing through a soft fork.    A cartel of miners with at least 51% of the current hashing capacity wanting to activate SegWit simply uses a modified client that ignores any blocks that are not signaling SegWit.    Technically, there is a 100% guarantee this cartel (with 51% of the hashing capacity) will succeed in activating SegWit (assuming they own the hashing themselves, or if a pool, the miners using that pool don't leave.)

Now doing this has collateral damage.   Even if you are a miner who is using a pool that is using the latest Bitcoin Core and is signaling SegWit, you would still be harmed from the attack by being deprived of mining revenue some of the time.   This is because your pool would mine the longest chain, and in some instances the tip of the longest chain would be a block that does not have SegWit signaling and thus that block your pool is trying to extend upon will not be extended upon by the cartel.

So to ensure that you (or your pool) continue to receive mining revenue you would need to make sure to use the same software (or implement the same rule) that the cartel is using.  Effectively, what this means is that you would join the cartel as well. 

This hopefully will not be necessary, but is very possibly what we would see if a SegWit blockade at the 10% level doesn't fade away naturally.   There doesn't even need to be an actual attack for a cartel to become effective.     This is because if the cartel attack is performed, those blockading (not signaling SegWit) will lose 100% of their work, as none of their blocks mined will mature (to becoming spendable).   So **just the threat of a cartel attack occurring** (and thus guaranteed loss of revenue) **might be enough to convince miners to defect** (leave pools that are blockading SegWit).  And these defections alone, even without an attack, might be enough to cause signaling to reach 95% and SegWit to activate.

da5ingy,spacecrustaceans,20,"&gt;For commonly used 1024-bit keys, it would take about a year and cost a ""few hundred million dollars"" to crack just one of the extremely large prime numbers that form the starting point of a Diffie-Hellman negotiation. But it turns out that only a few primes are commonly used, putting the price well within the NSA's $11 billion (Â£7 billion) per year budget dedicated to ""groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities.""

In terms of encryption the majority of VPN's will use 4096-bit RSA keys alongside AES-256, and not limit themselves to 1024-bit keys as the article suggests is the 'commonly' used encryption method. 

[AES-256](http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) is the standardized encryption specification. It's used worldwide by everyone from corporations to the US government. It's largest key size is 256 bits. This means that the **key**, the thing that turns encrypted data into unencrypted data, is string of 256 1s or 0s.

With each character having two possibilities (1 or 0), there are 2^256 possible combinations. Typically, [only 50% of these need to be exhausted to yield the correct key](http://www.interhack.net/projects/deschall/deschall-faq.html), so only 2^255 need to be guessed. How long would it take to flip through each of the possible keys?


When doing mundane, repetitive calculations (such as brute-forcing or bitcoin mining), the GPU is better suited than the CPU. A high-end GPU can typically do about 2 billion calculations per second (2 gigaflops). So, we'll use GPUs.

Say you had a billion of these, all hooked together in a massively parallel computer system. Together, they could perform at 2e18 flops, or

     2 000 000 000 000 000 000 keys per second (2 quintillion)

***1 billion gpus @ 2 gigaflops each (2 billion flops)***

Since there are 31 556 952 seconds in a year, we can multiply by that to get the keys per year.

      *31 556 952
      =6.3113904e25 keys per year (~10 septillion, 10 yottaflops)

Now we divide 2^255 combinations by 6.3113904e25 keys per year:

     2^255 / 6.3113904e25

     =9.1732631e50 years

The universe itself only existed for 14 billion (1.4e10) years. It would take ~6.7e40 times longer than the age of the universe to exhaust half of the keyspace of a AES-256 key.

On top of this, there is an energy limitation. The [The Landauer limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle) is a theoretical limit of energy consumption of a computation. It holds that on a system that is logically irreversible (bits do not reset themselves back to 0 from 1), a change in the value of a bit requires an entropy increase according to kTln2, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the circuit in kelvins and ln2 is the natural log(2).

Lets try our experiment while considering power.

most high-end GPUs take around 150 watts of energy to power themselves at full load. This doesn't include cooling systems.

     150 000 000 000 watts (150 gigawatts)

***1 billion gpus @ 150 watts***


     1.5e11 watts

This is enough power to power 50 million american households.


The largest nuclear power reactors (Kashiwazaki-Kariwa) generate about 1 gigawatt of energy.

     1.5e11 watts / 1 gigawatt = 150

Therefore, 1 billion GPUs would require 150 nuclear power plant reactors to constantly power them, and it would *still* take longer than the age of the universe to exhaust half of a AES-256 keyspace.

1 billion GPUs is kind of unrealistic. How about a supercomputer?

The Tianhe-2 Supercomputer is the world's fastest supercomputer located at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. It clocks in at around 34 petaflops.

***Tianhe-2 Supercomputer @ 33.86 petaflops (quadrillion flops)***

     =33 860 000 000 000 000 keys per second (33.86 quadrilion)

     3.386e16 * 31556952 seconds in a year

2^255 possible keys

     2^255 / 1.0685184e24

     =1.0685184e24 keys per year (~1 septillion, 1 yottaflop)

     =5.4183479e52 years

That's just for 1 machine. Reducing the time by just one power would require 10 more basketball court-sized supercomputers. To reduce the time by x power, we would require 10^x basketball court-sized supercomputers. **It would take 10^38 Tianhe-2 Supercomputers running for the entirety of the existence of everything to exhaust half of the keyspace of a AES-256 key.**

da649zp,aquahol,49,"/r/bitcoin is one big ad for the company Blockstream.

Blockstream received 76 million dollars in funding from financial institutions like AXA. Blockstream does not have products, customers, or a publicly known business model. And it is very unclear why companies like AXA would want to support a bitcoin company, as bitcoin poses a threat to many of their business sectors.

Employees of Blockstream also happen to be the most active contributors to the Bitcoin Core repo on github. Contributors who disagreed with them were pushed out of the project. They are attempting to push through code changes that are very controversial among the bitcoin community.

The changes Blockstream is attempting to push through will turn bitcoin from a cheap and fast way to make payments into an expensive and priveleged system. They envision consumer users using ""second layer"" solutions to transact money (second layer solutions happen to be what blockstream is working on) with bitcoin itself becoming an expensive ""settlement layer"" for financial institutions to use.

/r/bitcoin head moderator /u/theymos has been shown to have close ties and possible financial dealings with Blockstream.

When repeatedly asked to, management and employees of Blockstream refuse to condemn the censorship of /r/bitcoin or theymos, and continue participating in the places that are censored in their favor.

Any posts critical of Blockstream or Bitcoin Core, or that speak favorably of other bitcoin code projects like Bitcoin Unlimited, are summarily deleted from /r/bitcoin.

A significant number of people now gather at /r/btc, which is not subject to censorship. Despite being not easily found by new users, /r/btc has seen greater growth in readership numbers than /r/bitcoin over the last year.

Theymos claims that he only deletes things that ""don't have consensus"" and then cites the greater overall subscriber numbers of /r/bitcoin as proof that his ideas have consensus and /r/btc is a radical fringe group.

However, the opinions Theymos holds are generally only held on /r/bitcoin and other heavily censored sites he controls, like bitcointalk, bitcoin.it, and bitcoin.org. somehow his opinions do not enjoy much support at all in any place where bitcoin is discussed without censorship.

da63huu,nullc,37,"&gt; Satoshi was also an incompetent developer 

This is a claim spread by folks like Mike Hearn, but it simply isn't true. Bitcoin's original release was _very_ well written with an exceptionally low defect rate.  It wasn't flawless, but it was far above average and more reliable than many of the additions that came after.

It wasn't, however, very modular... but it was also only about 10kloc or so! Adding a lot of modularity then to such a small system would have been a mistake: the modularity likely wouldn't have matched the future needs and it would have added a lot of complexity and likely introduced bugs.

The real substance of those complaints often centered on the common fixation of B-grade programmers: coding style-- this believe that anything that doesn't look exactly like what the person was expecting is ""bad"", a misunderstanding fueled by the fact that actually bad code also usually looks unexpected.  People with more experience have usually learned that there exist many mutually contradictory coding styles which are all well considered by experts and can all deliver world class results.

As far as the perspective of Bitcoin's creator on the subject-- remarks like that come from discussions along the lines of ""could a flooding system work _at all_"", a fact that was rather surprising to a lot of people that a system so seemingly non-scalable could be a starter at all.  The idea that you _could_ throw few racks of hardware at it and scale it to effectively infinite levels shatters that perspective. After all, the competition offered no decentralization at all so showing that Bitcoin could match their scale, even at the expense of decentralization, is an important proof point for the design.

Bitcoin's creator was no stranger to the inherent trade-ffs between load and practical decentralization and in one of the [last public posts](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917) he made he pointed out ""Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices"". -- and these were remarks made before any of us had really tried out the system running at scale and realized that the hidden costs built up _much_ faster than we would have guessed.  Back at the end of 2010 I thought 1MB blocks could be handled without trouble, but what we found was that the software needed a LOT of complex optimizations to even keep up with that.

Basically, a company called blockstream makes products that use the bitcoin protocol. If bitcoin continues to develop as it did from 2008-2013, then bitcoin will have more features and blockstream will be irrelevant.

A few core devs founded this company because they can funnel traffic from the protocol to their company, while simultaneously blocking any development. They bought out most of the core developers and brought them onto the blockstream team, either as employees or contractors. They've demonized any other bitcoin software and monopolized the bitcoin protocol to close their technical stranglehold on bitcoin.

Meanwhile, anyone that wouldn't cooperate was purged from the development team and smeared with /r/bitcoin propaganda. These are many of the original developers, like Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, and Peter Rizun.

Look, the problem with your line of thinking. (Which applies even more to hardforks) is that it results in giving veto power to random minorities. Which in turn guarantees Bitcoin cannot compete with cryptocurrencies which fork more progressively. 

Being this careful isn't a virtue. And it is definitely not something which is objectively good. 

The only reason I'm in favour of blocking SegWit is to be more bold and promote even bigger changes. 

If you want to be careful because Bitcoin is this 10 billion dollar market, then: don't! Money doesn't need your protection and meddling. It needs a free market. All manipulation hurts Bitcoin:

1. Core as a software development process being unable to create anything contentious. 
1. Core as a group of developers all pushing for off-chain consensus forming by a limited group of developers
1. Preferring/promoting high activation percentages for fork activation (giving a random minority of miners veto power)
1. Theymos censoring opinions (and banning people) which he deems dangerous
1. Community members launching personal attacks towards people who they disagree with
1. Launching DDOS attacks at competing bitcoin clients
1. Launching DDOS attacks at miners which dare vote for things they don't agree with
1. Community members lying, twisting and spreading FUD for the greater good
1. Calling people who disagree with you sockpuppets and dismissing them outright

Both of those things are currently usable on Bitcoin mainnet without segwit, so LN is possible without segwit.

However, without segwit or another malleability fix, LN channels have to deal with situations where transactions get mutated (""malleated""), which makes them get stuck at various steps.  Preventing them from getting stuck permanently requires either introducing trust (which we don't want to do) or setting some annoying timeouts that limit the efficiency of channels.

LN can also take advantage of many of segwits other [benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) such as:

- **Increased security for multisig:** every segwit transaction uses multisig, and because it's a new protocol, it can trivially make use of the new segwit output format that allows using this feature.

- **Script versioning:** can be used to add new features to Bitcoin more easily than they can be added without segwit (some features being made more easy to add than others).  Two features currently being researched are MAST and signature aggretation---both of which can provide modest increases to the capacity of the network and which can help improve transaction privacy.

- **More block space:** meaning more channels can be opened or closed in any particular block.

- **Better cost accounting for transactions:** related to the above, this provides benefits to people who produce transactions that reduce the short-term and long-term load on full nodes.  Lightning-style transactions are effective at doing this, so they benefit from this segwit feature.

Also, fixing malleability for upgraded software makes designing LN-compatible (and any Bitcoin-compatible) wallets much easier in general, so that's a huge plus too.

You could add the metadata to that too in a simple way, fe. numbered folders, each containing one release, inside description, source etc. and files and a simple app to search this. That could be a webapp. Basically an offline backup of just the content of the site, not user data or private communications from the forums.

Make the entire thing modular. Separate filesharing from metadata which would make metadata live forever (no takedowns) or even decentralize that (a web of nodes (servers or people) each having the whole backup of the metadata and exchanging the updates to it, similarly to how you download the bitcoin data when you install the client) and files available in big, searchable chunks through various means - private trackers (perhaps released as scene releases?), public trackers, private servers, servers like MEGA, hand to hand exchange etc.

da82qvq,kustonoy,23,"Hey, dear /r/ethtrader (and /r/bitcoinmarkets) visitors, 
today i am going to give a small TA on some of the coins that are traded here. The plan right now is to do weekly or bi-weekly 
posts here on Sunday/Monday where i cover some aspects of current price dynamics. In some of the recent posts, it appeared to me that 
many users here reject TA as a useful concept. For me, TA is not a set of rules on what to do, but a set of indicators that can help to 
assess risk appropriately. In my recent trades, i have found several crucial mistakes where i just didn't listen to TA indicators and have misjudged the risk associated to the trades. At the same time, i have found it difficult to trade in cryptotrading solely on basis of fundamental analysis.

Before we start: i will **not** tell you what to do, and i will not say what the *right move* is, but just try to illustrate common risk factors in trading. Any move could be the right move when the associated risk is managed properly (e.g., timing, size of the position, etc.). I will also not always disclose my positions, since it makes it more difficult to stay flexible and change my opinion on short time frames. 

**BTC/EUR:**

https://i.imgur.com/s4VZMAV.png

Bullish daily pattern, only slightly overbought on the RSI (1). We can see a pretty solid trendline, which was touched on one important occasion (2), but was eventually dismissed as a pretty powerful bull trap. Powerful in the sense that the trend continued and still is good, with an ADX of ~35 (3). Prior to this, even negative rumors on regulation of BTC in China were not able to halt the trend for very long. In conclusion, i find it very risky to bet against Bitcoin right now, with all the implications to trading any altcoin (=large long positions). On the other hand, getting into BTC right now also offers not the best risk/reward due to the overbought constellation. But since there are no particularly bullish positive news driving the upward action, i see more upside on this one. Yes, you could argue that Yuan devaluation is very bullish news for BTC, but it is not directly connected to the fundamentals of BTC.

**ETH/EUR:**

https://i.imgur.com/R23WFMz.png

For ETH, i will consider only the ETH/fiat curve because it is simpler to describe and i only trade the ratio because of higher volumes. The chart is difficult to evaluate, since the volume is so weak. I almost always consider weak volume as a bearish sign of receding interest in a coin. Accordingly, there is a pretty strong technical downtrend, measured by the whopping ADX of 60 (1), which for me is hard to ignore. However, the trend might very well weaken in the next days, as good news is on the horizon in form of the spurious dragon hardfork. I can see a few green candles, with ETH going to 10.30â¬ for a few days in next week, especially since the RSI shows a weak (!!!) form of bullish divergence (2). I think a dead cat bounce is due. If we could close 4 days in a row above 9.60â¬, this might point to potential mid-term upwards movement. But on the downside, i assume 8â¬ will be revisited sooner than later. Right now, the price movement is somewhat confined due to low volumes, but this could change if things get worse. Definitely more downside than upside on this one.

**XMR/BTC:**

https://i.imgur.com/AnpRjBh.png

I believe there is no clear trend. If BTC surges up, i see XMR utilizing the full 2STD Bollinger Bands, which were widened during the temporary peak on 14.11. (1). This means we could go below 0.0065 again, but this is not very likely in my opinion. Currently, there is an obvious head-and-shoulder configuration with low volume, usually a bearish sign for XMR. However, if the head-and-shoulders signal proves to be fake and we go up instead, i would consider this a very bullish sign. Still, the temporary cap could very well be 0.012, as /u/redembr has pointed out several times (2). 

**Wildcards:**

There are some other coins that i have looked at in the previous days. All altcoins are in red, but some are due for a bounce in my opinion. In particular, **DASH** and **XRP** could be good candidates after suffering devastating downtrends. Definitely risky trades at this point, but maybe some are interested. I have posted my reasoning yesterday, but can elaborate further if there is interest.

That's it. People who are interested in TA discussion can tell me where my projections are misguided, since there are people with more expertise than me.",2016-11-20 20:42:28

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has dropped out of the R3 CEV LLC blockchain group. The investment bank was one of nine original members of R3, founded in 2014 to explore the use of the distributed database technology in Wall Street infrastructure.

The technology, best known for underpinning the system that trades the virtual currency bitcoin, has garnered increasing attention as a way banks can save billions of dollars and make old-fashioned processes faster and more efficient.

But not all blockchain firms are the same, with different banks backing different ventures to exploit the technology. As of Oct. 31, Goldman let its membership lapse in R3, one of the higher profile efforts, but the firm will continue to work with blockchain technology, a spokeswoman for the investment bank said.

The online distributed ledger is best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, but banks want to use it to speed up transactions, cut operations costs and better secure the banking and other infrastructure. Blockchain is said to provide an immutable record of transactions and identities. This could eliminate middlemen that perform these services in the existing financial infrastructure.

Turnover is expected, an R3 spokesman said. âDeveloping technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time,â he said in an email.

As R3 builds blockchain pilots, the group is also seeking equity investment from members in exchange for a stake in proceeds from future technology and products, according to a person familiar with the matter. R3âs 70 members include Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase and State Street Corp.
In April, R3 revealed a key early product called Corda, which is a distributed ledger to manage financial contracts. The group has also run a series of blockchain pilots with subsets of its membership, including one where 11 banks traded electronic tokens of value among offices in North America, Europe and Asia to simulate financial transactions over a five-day period. In November, 10 members of R3 tested a Know-Your-Customer system that allows a blockchain ledger to manage and verify partiesâ identities.

Goldman has committed to blockchain through investing and through internal development. The bank in 2015 was one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd. Goldman is also seeking patents on two blockchain-related inventions, for foreign exchange trading and digital currency.

Blockchain has not yet been deployed widely for commercial use, in part because the legalities are unclear. Regulators have not made statements about the requirements blockchain-based systems must meet. Nasdaq Inc.âs Linq exchange for trading shares in private companies is one of the only blockchain-based financial systems in use.",2016-11-21 22:53:53

da9dhfh,jonny1000,29,"&gt; It needs to show it really is anti-fragile. And for that we can't just sweep perceived fragilities under the rug

I agree with this.  But we need to recognize that Bitcoin is not perfect and does have vulnerabilities.  An alternative  implementation can be a ""menace"" (as Satoshi called it) and the community rallying together and advising people not to run this incompatible version is part of what makes Bitcoin robust.

&gt; Because it has never happened and I don't know how the market and how the network is going to react. When we have been through this once and acknowledged the possibility of it, there will be less uncertainties.

When making comments like this I think its important to recognize that not all hardforks are the same.  Consider three possibilities below:

**1 - ""Strong consensus"" hardfork - Potentially Safe**

The hardfork occurs on the condition that there is no significant opposition in any section of the community. A minority has veto power. The activation threshold could be a 95% softfork, imposing a new rule that miners MUST flag support for a hardfork, which will then occur after say 6 months.  Bitcoin Core seems to advocate something like this.

**2 - ""Chain split"" hardfork - Potentially Safe**

e.g. The Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic hardfork, or Bitcoin Clams

One section of the community disagrees with another part of the community and wants to go in a different direction. A flag day or checkpoint is set when the two chains diverge. A strategy is in place to mitigate the replay attack problem. There is no activation threshold and miner support for the new chain can be very small or very high. (Let the market decide)

**3 - Harkfork with large mining split and asymmetric advantage - Unnecessarily dangerous**

e.g. BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, BU

There is a hardfork attempt that activates at a specific miner threshold that ensures both chains may survive, e.g. 75% vs 25%. (Even worse there is rolling voting, unnecessarily guaranteeing a significant miner split at the point of no return, rather than voting windows, which only makes a large miner split possible). At the same time the original chain has the ability to ""wipe out"" the new chain if it becomes longer than it, erasing its history and causing loss of funds. The characteristic that people lose funds makes this method dangerous. It is unnecessarily dangerous in that there is no significant advantage in allowing the funds to be erased. However, the new chain can never wipe out the old chain. This type of hardfork is particularly dangerous as the more successful the new chain is, the more compelling it is for speculators to try and erase it and make profits.  This makes victory for the old chain highly likely.  Investing in the old chain can offer large profits to speculators, who can capitalize on the asymmetric nature of the hardfork.  Please note, that despite what BU/XT supporters say, which is the 10 minute target time ensures the 25% chain won't produce any significant number of blocks, exchanges do not need to wait for blocks to be produced to allow their customers to start trading the two coins against each other and allow the price of the old coins to rally, in a speculative, self-fulfilling, highly profitable frenzy.  As an investor, I hope you appreciate how compelling that opportunity is.

The reason many people so strongly oppose BU, XT and Bitcoin Classic, is because they feel its the textbook example of the worst kind of hardfork, that has a very high probability of ensuring people lose funds and the integrity of the system is damaged.  As Satoshi put it, it ""can be pretty ugly for the minority version"".

Right. So that I might again be able to again contribute to the discussion, might I ask what part of my last post the mods considered unacceptable for readers to see?
""Exactly.
So many people, apparently even some developers, fail to understand that Bitcoin does not require consensus.
Bitcoin CREATES consensus.
Miners will only opt for larger blocks if they believe a higher value Bitcoin with the backing of exchanges, businesses, and individual users will be the result.
Once 75% is reached and the grace period begins the other miners will make the switch because being alone on a rapidly dying and inoperable chain is economic suicide.
That's simply how the incentives work out. At its heart Bitcoin isn't any specific code, Bitcoin is actually a system of incentives structured so that multiple individuals following their own best interest results in a consensus that is beneficial to them all.
When I hear developers crying that the sky will fall, I think it less likely that the fundamental design of Bitcoin is broken and does not work, and rather that they are perturbed that the Bitcoin system is not theirs to command.""

You've obviously been around Bitcoin for a long time, and you know a lot of the history regarding the technology &amp; coders, and the politics &amp; economics.

You've identified a couple of key facts which are crucial to moving this debate forward:

(1) The debate is rigged. Discussion of technical details is ignored.

(2) Blockstream's business plan is 100% dependent on preventing on-chain scaling.

When I read your comments where you raised these points, it was a major epiphany - explaining how we got into this mess, and how we can get out.

Basically, if I understand you correctly, they don't *care* if our technology is better. They're actually quite happy to deploye *inferior* technology (SegWit-as-a-soft-fork - more complicated and hence more risky than a hard fork) in an attempt to trick people into giving up their right to vote (hard fork) - and the only reason they're doing this is so Blockstream can remain in power permanently, and prevent on-chain scaling.

This is now a battle of politics and economics - not of technology. The technology isn't all that complicated - increase the blocksize, then fix transaction malleability and fix quadratic verification time - and move on from there. Anyone can do that - not just Blockstream. Now the battle is political and economic - we should reject Blockstream because they *want to prevent us from voting.*

&gt; Blockstream's business plan is contingent on Bitcoin being unable to perform onchain upgrades, and they are very clearly working to stymie onchain upgrades.

dab69cc,Lejitz,39,"&gt;do you know why MH did never talk about those channels again?

&gt;And do you know why Satoshi talked about datacenter-nodes despite those plans?

I don't know why.  I have my suspicions.

I suspect Mike Hearn had ulterior motives for wanting to keep transactions on chain.  There is no way around the fact that Hearn wanted some form of blacklists.  He backed off once he was slammed for advocating such.

I also suspect that Satoshi knew he only had a rough idea for how to use payment channels to scale, but if he wanted to show people that Bitcoin *could* scale, all he needed to do was a little math that showed *A method* with data centers.  That method is easily understood and explainable (i.e., it's more sellable than a half-baked idea that confuses the matter).

Almost all of us (myself included) got into Bitcoin with the understanding that scaling would require data centers.  I never liked this--I saw it as a Trojan horse of sorts that would be adopted as decentralized and would scale into fiat--but I accepted it as a given and a possibility that it could remain ungovernable (plus, for investment purposes, I was okay with a Trojan horse if it made me richer and had a chance to remain decentralized).  Because of this widely-held understanding that this is the only way for Bitcoin to scale, most of us (myself included) were behind Gavin when he took the fight to the community.  However, I quit accepting his and Hearn's arguments in August 2015, when I finally stepped back and re-analyzed.

I realized that the Lightning Network, which had been proposed in February 2015 (just a couple of months before Gavin started the fight), changed the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse.  I realized that with a blockchain fee market (discussed in the white paper under incentives, and made possible by Satoshi's block limit), and with the routed payment channels, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.

Of course, at that moment, I began to question the motives of Gavin and Hearn.  Why, right after the Lightning paper (which showed a better scaling method), did they all of the sudden take their fight to the community?  It would seem that such a concept should have given them pause, but instead, they acted in furious haste (as though their window of opportunity was closing).  I suspect that's how they viewed the situation--their window was closing.  Just as Hearn wanted blacklists and no Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain, and LN is a huge threat to that.  The other threats to that are Maxwell's confidential transactions and coin swap and Mast and Schnorr and side chains.

If you think about it, the best way to prevent transactions from going dark is to take the control away from ordinary users.  The easiest way to do that is to bump the cap to 20 MB.  At that point, ordinary users could not even stop a fork, because they couldn't afford to even run a node.

That's what I suspect this is all about, and I think the guys at Blockstream (one of whom I suspect is part of the ""we"" that made up ""Satoshi"" in the white paper) are the guys who are trying to prevent Bitcoin from going down the path of fiat and financial monitoring.

So directly to your question.  I suspect Satoshi *sold* the most easily understood scalability method just to show Bitcoin could scale, and he discussed the more advanced, more-difficult-to-understand, and less developed method of scaling only with those who could understand.  Payment channel scaling was probably only a rough idea that he suspected could work, but needed development.

Edit:
When I refer to Bitcoin as a Trojan horse adopted as decentralized and slowly becoming fiat, [Roger Ver calls it PayPal 2.0, and he is literally fine with that.](https://www.coinjournal.net/roger-ver-paypal-acceptable-risk-bitcoin/amp/).  PayPal 2.0 is not really accurate, it would actually be more like Federal Reserve Note 2.0, but the point is clear either way.  The other side knows that removing the block cap destroys decentralization.",2016-11-23 02:08:28
dab0dlu,Lejitz,36,"Satoshi referred to payment channels as ""unrecorded open transactions.""  They later took on the name ""payment channel.""  (Similarly, the white paper never once mentioned ""blockchain"" or ""block chain"", but referred only to chaining blocks together).  

And then he referred to ""high frequency trading"" as the function of making payments back and forth to never be recorded on the chain until closing the payment (i.e., payment channel).  He would do this by constantly ""replacing"" the contents of the ""open transaction.""

Here is a link to the 0.1 code where such a replacement was allowed

https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L434

That's the origin of the payment channel.

Also some interesting history.  I am sure you have seen the 2009 email Hearn claimed was from Satoshi, where he claimed [Bitcoin could scale beyond Visa levels](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=149668.msg1596879#msg1596879).

But what I doubt you have seen (because it was conveniently left out) is the explanation Satoshi gave Hearn, which was basically a conceptual Lightning Network (minus the routing) using payment channels.

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-April/002417.html

&gt;Here is how Satoshi explained it to me, in his words:

&gt;An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime. . . .

It's really an interesting read to realize how far down the road they (meaning Satoshi) were thinking.

Fine.

But it pains me to see you disparage the BU devs. We (the BU community) are just trying to do what is best for Bitcoin, and that means having diverse client implementations, allowing the blocksize to increase (which you are on board with), and facilitating user input in forums that are not censored (which is really important!).

dabcsz3,CBergmann,21,"wow, this was the most coherent, troll-free explanation of a small blockers perspective. Thanks for that. I learned something (what rarely happens on reddit)

I'll try to answer it and give you my point of view. Maybe this helps to bridge the gap.

There are many things I agree with. An inflation free, well-secured, more or less infinitely scaling bitcoin without becoming centralized / governed is a good goal, and I agree that we will run into trouble if we do all this onchain. I also think that we should do our best to realize this *method* to scale. 

Other than you I however don't think this *method* should be enforced. I think it should grow organically. Maybe transaction volume will offload to altcoins or payment channels, maybe it will result in datacenter-nodes. I don't think this will happen soon, and even if, it will be a big step forward from the current system (since you still hold your priv keys and since mixing coins will still be possible). If the government of datacenter-nodes gets too rigid (demanding KYC for transactions, blocking tx) bitcoin will loose properties the market is well aware of. So the price will crash, people move to altcoins.

While I like your vision forward, I don't share your dystopic fear of the other path. I think the best future would be to reunite both paths: let it grow organically, improve onchain scaling, start payment channels, develop sidechains (if they ever will really work), develop better altcoins, make agreements about sustainable blockspace use, improve privacy, and so on ... I assume the cryptocurrency system as a whole has long become secure against ""government regulates Bitcoin nodes""-attacks. Like Satoshi said: The technology to do it is here.

Another thing is the ""conspiracy""-part. All what you say makes sense if you assume bad motives from Mike and Gavin. The ""communication restriction"" here, the ""ideological purging"" of the development team, the army of pro-core-trolls, the lack of cooperation with other development-teams, the complete resistence against minor compromises ... all makes sense if you think there is an ongoing state-level attack and mike, gavin and so on are the agents of this attack, and ""your team"" is just defending itself. 

I don't think so. AFAIK Mike did only propose a method to do black/whitelists like they are long done by other companies; he never tried to make them part of the protocoll / the consensus. Also this was a minor part of what he done, and unfortunaly a reason why many things he developed have never become part of bitcoin. And Gavin did compromise with Clazik far enough to make any kind of governance-explosion in nodes impossible. 

If I'm allowed to paint a counter-conspiracy-theory - I'd say that there is an ongoing attempt to purge bitcoin development, to character assasinate people that don't match the ideological preferences, and a large-scale manipulation with social media and a horde of fulltime trolls. I not even assume bad faith. But it makes me incredibly said to see the community splitted, good developers gone, angel investors stonewalled as trolls, early adopters raging on both sides, and everything falling apart in a never-ending quarrel, instead of changing the world.

The prize for Bitcoin development to take the one path you prefer is a horrible dividing, a political desaster, a brain drain, a destruction of the community. It would have been easy to choose a reuining solution, about one or 1,5 years ago, but it was not choosen, and now it's too late. We have to live with a gap, it will not go away.

Any transaction which has a fee greater than 1 Maxwell kicks someone else's transaction out of the next block and ""Blocks the Stream"" for that person.  With this measure we would be able to chart the growth in the Maxwell over time.  When the Maxwell reaches $5 for an average transaction it will be then known as a ""BlockStream"".

You can have one free server running at any time.  Log in with your Github account and it will allow you to create your server using your Github ssh-key.  Servers are free for 2 hours and expire after that time (unless you choose to add more time via credit card or bitcoin).  It's a quick and easy way to demo some code on a live server or just play around with a few popular Linux distros.  

We also provide the ability to create a button for your project allowing you to let people create a server with your service/project running on it for free to try it out.  Create a yaml or bash user-data script and others can launch servers with it.

Edit:  Figured I'd share a bit more information.  For the last 11 years on and off I've run a small Linux distribution (SymphonyOS).  I work for a well known cloud host by day but in talking with users learned that it's a hassle sometimes to create an account, billing profile and all that when you just need to quickly test or share something so I built this in my free time.

Do you expect to make money on this?

Honestly, no idea.  I have a decent credit grant that will cover free 2 hour servers for a while so it was worth trying out.

How do I log into my server?

All servers are created with ssh-key authentication only.  You are provided the option to select from the ssh keys on your Github account when you create a server.

dadyu5o,ldpreload,36,"The tool you want is a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), a data structure where every time you add some content, you include the hash of the old data structure, and it's very efficient to care about only a small subset of the entire data structure.

Reddit would add every comment ever to the Merkle tree, and lay out the tree so that each comment thread, and then maybe each subreddit, is a sub-tree (so that I don't need to actually hash all the comments in, say, /r/nyc when all I care about is /r/boston). When a redditor reads a comment thread, they request that particular sub-tree of hashes from Reddit, as well as the comments themselves. Then they make sure that the hashes of the comments match, and there's a path between that sub-tree of hashes to the top-level hash of the entire Merkle tree. (This involves requesting a small number of hashes for other sub-trees, and trusting them&amp;mdash;which is okay, because other people are reading and verifying those sub-trees. That's the entire trick of the Merkle tree.)

Reddit publishes the top-level Merkle tree hash every time someone comments anywhere on the site, and periodically, other people check that the new tree does in fact contain the old tree. If something was removed from the old tree, sound an alarm.

When a comment is deleted, Reddit still provides its hash (otherwise the tree would break), but the API no longer lets you retrieve the comment itself. You can't verify the authenticity of the hash, but that's okay because there's nothing to verify. You _can_ verify that the sub-tree containing the hash is the same sub-tree as in previous versions of the Reddit Merkle tree. (You can brute-force the comment, but that's not a huge problem because you could have just mirrored the comment thread before the comment was deleted.)

This should even be able to support edits: the important thing is that the structure makes it clear when a comment was edited, and if it was edited without the knowledge of the person making the comment, they can detect that; they just look periodically for all their own comments in the tree. As long as they keep track of which comments are theirs, no complicated system of each redditor having their own public/private keypair is required.

When you write a comment, you make sure a new Merkle tree is created and that you can trace a path to your comment. Once that's done, you're guaranteed that any future tampering with your comment is visible.

This is a centralized Merkle tree. A Bitcoin-style blockchain is a decentralized Merkle tree, with the entire proof-of-work mechanism in place so that it's reasonably trustworthy despite being decentralized. But Reddit is a single website, so that's not needed here, and avoiding it helps performance significantly; there's no block to mine, they can just append every comment as it happens. (A possible performance optimization is to publish the new tree every 3-ish minutes, which lines up with the current period where you can edit a comment within 3 minutes without an asterisk showing up. You just need to verify your comment after 3 minutes.)",2016-11-25 01:50:01

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1611#msg1611


Satoshi:

&gt;**I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.**  The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint.


Gavin:

&gt;Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later.  They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network.

&gt;I admire the flexibility of the scripts-in-a-transaction scheme, but my evil little mind immediately starts to think of ways I might abuse it.  I could encode all sorts of interesting information in the TxOut script, and if non-hacked clients validated-and-then-ignored those transactions it would be a useful covert broadcast communication channel.

&gt;That's a cool feature until it gets popular and somebody decides it would be fun to flood the payment network with millions of transactions to transfer the latest Lady Gaga video to all their friends...


Satoshi:

&gt;A second version would be a massive development and maintenance hassle for me.  It's hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while upgrading the network without a second version locking things in.  If the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance of staying with the official version.  If someone was getting ready to fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about the risks of using a minority version.  This is a design where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version and I'd rather not go into it, and I don't have to as long as there's only one version.

&gt;I know, most developers don't like their software forked, but I have real technical reasons in this case.",2016-11-25 03:09:59
dae7j7r,killerstorm,30,"While we are here, let's discuss ""having the official protocol specification"" vs ""reference code is the specification"".

Developers who are new to Bitcoin are often surprised or even outraged by a lack of official specification. They consider it a sign of network's immaturity.

Indeed, specifications are usually immensely useful for network protocols: when different systems disagree, one can just look up in specification and fix the offending implementation.

But the thing, this approach doesn't work for cryptocurrencies: at a point when there is a disagreement, there is already a serious risk of large financial loss.

Thus you need _prevent_ disagreement, not fix it after the fact.

Obviously, a specification written in English makes it impossible to prove that an implementation adheres to the specification, as English is often ambiguous, and you have to rely on human opinion anyway. (This is exactly what happened with this geth/Parity fork.)

So you gotta use formal specification, i.e. a specification written in a language computer understands. In other words, a specification must be in code.

The difference between programming language and specification languages is rather thing. It was [demonstrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CurryâHoward_correspondence) that there is a correspondence between computer programs and mathematical proofs.

A program which exhibits no undefined behaviour can serve as a specification.

If he deposits them in the bank, the income tax people come after him wanting to know where he got millions. To protect himself, he has to reveal his customers, and then theyâre screwed too.

The problem we are talking about is essentially laundering money, turning black money white. This isnât easy to do with bitcoin, otherwise all the drug lords in the world would no longer have rooms stashed with banknotes, theyâd just have bitcoins on keychains. Once money *becomes* bitcoin itâs relatively safe and anonymous, but **you canât avoid that first step where real actual currency is traded for bitcoin**.

dag8n5o,hoffmabc,52,"First off, right up front: I have never said I was against on-chain scaling (or off-chain scaling for that matter) and I'm certainly not railing against segwit. And as far as our business model at OB1 goes, there is no value to shit on any potential idea that could bring Bitcoin to everyone. I do support scientific critique of all ideas though, which I think is hard to disagree with.

I also am not shitting on the Core dev team. I think their accomplishments along with anyone else who ever contributed have been incredible and from someone whose only accomplishment to the core code was a PR for proofreading that was closed almost immediately I certainly have no reason to complain about their work. 

My concerns mostly relate to the longevity of this project due to the way conflicting ideas and people are treated. There has for quite a while been a situation in which I believe competent developers either are turned off by the perception that Bitcoin is a clusterfuck or that they find the prospect of getting new ideas into the codebase too daunting. I've seen this from non-Bitcoin people we have hired and from within my extensive developer network. Anyone outside of the core team mostly gets hammered on all sorts of personal levels including motivations, past projects/failures, personal flaws, which I'm assuming is why the Mimblewimble creator is anonymous. 

I've spoken to several people about my concerns and the responses have mostly been positive and frustration for why parts of the community are so against what they're creating. There is certainly a massive team of blind supporters on both sides willing to attack the others at will. It used to be just scholars and scientists fighting over the merit of new ideas, but it's progressed to full on trolling, which creates even more disarray. I'm not sure at this moment what the solution is.

I fully expect to see these responses:
a) BU is right
b) Core is right
c) Bitcoin is what it is; no one can do shit about it (The MrHodl Theory of Life)
d) This is why altcoins rule

I try almost always to not shit on people personally or directly and rather their ideas. I won't hesitate to call people out on shitty behavior not bad ideas and will still suggest and help on making the community better however I can.

NORMIES LEARNING TO BLOCKCHAINZ LOOK HERE

Tutorial (getting cablegate.zip and other files):
https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5e55p3/a_simple_blockchain_decoding_tutorial/




HOW TO GET THE KEYS (AND MORE) FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN:

The goal is to make very simple code that is easy to use and understand so that everyone can do this. This is a rough explanation of how it works.

There are two main approaches users are taking to decode messages in the blockchain. Scanning transactions, let's call this 'tx scanning', and scanning blocks, let's call this 'block scanning'. The main reason users are not yet able to see meaningful content is because both approaches have to be combined. 

TX SCANNING:

When you scan by transactions, you look for a transaction number (tx id), and decode its contents. When you know the tx id, you can easily see which wallets were involved. Some messages require you to combine the decoded data from multiple tx ids. You can identify which tx ids are relevant by looking at transaction histories of the wallets involved. This strategy is used for the 'Cablegate Backup'. 

In that case, the list of tx ids is directly told to the readers in the first message. However, you can compile this list on your own by 'tx crawling'. To do this, follow these steps:

. For each tx, look at the wallets that received money and find those that spend it (in this case it is only one per tx).

. For that wallet, look at its transaction history and find a transaction that follows a similar pattern, i.e., it involves multiple wallets and only one spends the funds.

. Continue doing this until you are not able to see the pattern repeat itself. 

BLOCK SCANNING:

When you scan by block, you will be able to find encoded data more easily but it is harder to extract the tx id and wallets. One benefit of block scanning is that you can explicitly search for file headers and important strings. 

For example you can directly search for the magic numbers in GPG files. When you find one of these, you can then tx crawl from that starting point in order to get all pieces of the file. 

More concretely, if you want to find the Cablegate Backup with a block scanner, you could search for the magic number of Zip files. Then, when one is found, you can find the tx id that contains it, and finally tx crawl to get all the pieces. Yet, file headers are just one of the many other patterns that can be used to find important transactions. Examples of others are:

. Magic numbers: Look for the first bytes in different types of file. 'file' can be used in UNIX.

. Ability to compress: Compress the decoded output. If the size is reduced, the output is possibly a message or part of a file.

. Text: If the decoded output has text, it might have information. 

. Keywords (Very important): Search for relevant keywords, e.g., checksums for files in Wikileaks.org, checksums for the insurance files, hashes, dates, names, time stamps, etc. 

. Reversibility: Some messages are in reverse and need to be flipped. This should be tried both before and after decoding.

Continued 

&gt;&gt;&gt;

Both scanners have to be used. The starting points for the searches should be Wikileak's wallet, important dates (for example, during the DDoS attacks), previous messages and checksum hashes. 

The Cablegate Backup was a bit simpler than the more recent messages. In that case, only one wallet spent the funds in each transaction, and simply looking at wallet's next transaction was enough to find all the pieces. 

Newer messages are bit more complicated. Some of the wallets that receive money make multiple transactions with no encoded data before proceeding with the 'real' transaction. Moreover, in a lot of cases, all wallets involved spend the funds (not just one). 

Therefore, the crawler has to keep track of all wallets that receive funds, and all future transactions of that wallet while using techniques (like those above) to detect encoded data. A transaction tree should be kept and the pieces of each files should be combined in multiple orderings. 

If you implement the process described above you will find all the keys, other backups and other files that are not released. One way to test your code is to search for checksum hashes for files that have already been published at a specific date. There are multiple messages in the blockchain that include file hashes and dates.

Blocks 434304-435711, &amp; 383000-383100[/spoiler]

I recommend you use a local copy of the blockchain (fully downloaded copy on computer not one a server is providing) and carry out the search on a computer that has no internet access. Work in groups and share the process. Remember to look at other cryptocurrencies as well and to encode your findings into the blockchain yourself.

dafkb8o,nullc,21,"Bitcoin Core 0.13+ uses C++11 a five year old revision of the C++ standard that adds many features which improve code clarity, safety, and performance.  0.13's adoption of C++11 comes as part of a long transition that begin in the 0.11.x timeframe.  0.12 is fully C++11 compatible but doesn't require it yet, 0.13 requires it but only in relatively minimal ways and in new features so that bug fixes there could have be backported to 0.12. 0.14 will require it much more extensively, and 0.15 will likely go through and change out all the old pre-C++11 ways of doing things to more modern approaches.

Ripple, for example, required C++11 from day one.  I believe this is also the case for the C++ ethereum codebase.

In any case, this is not something new with segwit.

Every current Linux distribution worth mention has C++11 support but some parties are on older versions for various reasons, some better than others.

For these users there are several options:

The Bitcoin.org binaries are statically linked and will happily run on very old distributions, including ones without a C++11 compiler.

People can also compile their own static binary on a newer system, like the Bitcoin.org binaries-- but letting them make customization. (With the build process in Bitcoin Core it's also possible for anyone to _exactly_ produce the binaries the project distributes... many people successfully doing that is a mandatory part of the release process for Bitcoin Core).

Another option is to simply install a newer compiler, for example-- for RHEL/Centos newer compilers appear to be available at https://people.centos.org/tru/devtools-1.1/5/x86_64/RPMS/  and https://people.centos.org/tru/devtools-1.1/6/x86_64/RPMS/  (GCC 4.7 or better is required, RHEL/Centos 7 ship with GCC 4.8)

dag498j,Erumara,18,"This seems a simple question, but it is not.

Firstly, $0.10 USD/kWh is not conservative by far, if you are talking about China, assume $0.04 USD/kWh *or less*.

Secondly, no-one knows how many of what miner is out there operating. A huge amount of current hashpower is still being generated by S7's and A6's, a smaller amount by S9's and R4's, a tiny amount of A7's, as well as older miners people may still operate on free electricity, or at a loss.

So let's see: If we assume 60% of current hashpower is .25J/Gh or lower, that gives us 1.2EH = 255,319 S7's or equivalent consuming ~331MW @ 0.04 USD/kWh = $318,638 USD/Day = $2,230,466 USD/week

The remaining .8EH made of 64,000 S9's or equivalent will consume ~76MW @ 0.04 USD/kWh = $73,728 USD/day = $516,096 USD/week

To say Bitcoin miners consume ~400MW of power at a cost of ~$500,000 USD/day ($0.05 USD/kWh just to be safe) is a nice ballpark figure.

So $500,000 per day may seem like an incredible amount, but considering the $12B marketcap for transactional security, ~80BTC/day in transaction fees and 1800 BTC mined every day worth ~$1.4M USD, it seems like a pretty small price to pay for security **and** freedom from central banks.

For comparison: based on these numbers it costs the world ~$182,500,000 per year to operate Bitcoin at this size/efficiency. In an interview one Bank of America spokesman made the claim that **it costs Bank of America over $1,000,000,000/year just in moving cash around their own company**, not including storage and infrastructure.

When really what they should be asking themselves is which one of these networks is moving fast and breaking things bc that is the one that could turn into a giant.

All this talk that Bitcoin has to be cautious bc it is sound money is complete bullshit and will look like complete bullshit in 1-2 years time.

Everyday Ethereum is pushing the envelop technologically, which means the power of the network is growing which means the size should eventually grow which means the price of the native token should rise. (Just today raiden POC announced)

Focus on the Bitcoin network and the Ethereum network, not the silly currency that you can collect like stamps. If you focus on the network you see where the real value, the fundamentals, are happening. 

Segwit looks like a nightmare. Bitcoin has abandoned scaling on chain. Are you fucking kidding me.

Right now the Ethereum network is sprinting ahead. But you can't sum up what Ethereum and ether is in a sentence, partly bc it is still being built.

Bitcoiners sense that we are speeding past so the fudding is in full force, along with attacks and other b.s.

But yeah focus on the networks. Right now the Etheteum network has been having a rough time due to dos attacks. But lots was also learned and hopefully the bloat will be cleaned up soon.

Will probably be easier to shill Ethereum once it is more fully formed, not that shilling is a good thing lol.",2016-11-27 04:46:07
daheyvr,tulasacra,30,"&gt; The above process appears less convergent than Bitcoinâs longest valid chain rule idea. In BU Miners are said to converge, due to the ârandom walk modelâ (https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/faq). Has this random walk model been tested with an altcoin? Are there plans to try this new model in an altcoin before Bitcoin?

this is exactly how bitcoin works right now.

(Imagine there are 50% chinese miners and 50% usa miners. they prefer their chain. However they accept the other chain if it has 1 confirmation more (AD1). And it is practically impossible that they keep adding blocks at the same time to both chains (random walk divergence). Therefore we would have only one chain even in this worst-case 50/50 split.)

&gt; Miners are encouraged to observe the MG, AD and EB settings in the network, and then adjust their settings to correspond to what other do, using the new âemergent consensusâ methodology. This methodology seems like a âsocial consensusâ type system. Why is this seen as robust as the existing framework? Is this this likely not to scale, like existing social consensus systems and result in disputes such that the nodes diverge onto different chains? Has this been tested on an altcoin?

again, this is exactly how bitcoin works today. (Miners are encouraged to observe what version of bitcoin node software other miners run, and decide emergently based on their self-interest if they want to upgrade or not.) 

BU emergent consensus is not a new ""social consensus methodology"". It is a different name for the ""nakamoto consensus by greed"".

&gt; What are the thoughts on a malicous miner trying to cause problems by deliberately mining a block with a specific size that is designed to split the hashrate into two, based on observing EB settings?

how is this scenario different to what is already discussed in the FAQ? (https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/faq)",2016-11-27 18:14:50

Segwit is not the end all be all, there could be several other proposals like it that are rejected during the coming years before we reach the necessary consensus to upgrade. Bitcoin is still an infant technology that has many decades of tinkering ahead of it. We might not see mass adoption or a killer app for 10+ years.

dagr5cl,tl121,18,"My ""profound incompetence"" came after profound disgust at the spaghetti code in the code base.  I am familiar with complex code, including entire operating systems with file systems, in which it was possible on the spot to find the code that was creating a particular bug in a new release, despite my never seeing a single line of code for a completely new file system.  This was not the disgusting mess that Core holds rule over.

The point being that the UTXO set can easily be processed in the inner loop of validating a block, through the appropriate data structures which can be on secondary storage.  The IO operations per second available today on solid state memory is tens of thousands of times greater than the transaction processing capacity of the bitcoin network so this represents no serious problem.  In addition, there is no limit in I/O operations give by individual storage devices since the UTXO database can be sharded.  

The only nodes relevant to the operation of the network today are the mining nodes (pool nodes if you like, although some pool mining hardware belonging to a single owner) and the nodes users run for their own personal benefit. Nodes that are not associated with mining provide no significant value to users of the network except their owners, which get the benefit of privacy and trust. So long as there are a sufficient number of nodes with open ports to service SPV clients any individual node is basically useless except to its owner.  At some point in the future if Bitcoin grows there may be a shortage of nodes to service SPV clients or bootstrap new nodes or nodes that have been off line for a while.  If this happens, then there will be a value to additional nodes and it will be possible for a marketplace to compensate these nodes for their services.  At present, the cost of actually running a node is so incredibly cheap that there is no point in even considering this situation. (The only nodes that are of significant value are the pool nodes and they do charge their users for the services they provide.) At present, my node runs on a 1 TB SSD.  I am certain it will have more than sufficient capacity for any UTXO ""bloat"" for the foreseeable future, unless of course the software is grossly and arbitrarily inefficient (which wouldn't surprise me, either, given the general quality of code and system design in Bitcoin to start with -- the quadratic hashing being one example).

I dispute the modeling that shows that Bitcoin mining becomes unstable without a block reward and a continuous backlog, a problem that will almost certainly not occur in my lifetime. However, I know from decades of experience that running a system that requires a backlog is unworkable, because queuing systems are unstable when operated at capacity.  What is really amazing is that the so called ""experts"" fail to understand basic queuing theory. In addition, these ""experts"" fail to understand that there is a difference between a hard real-time system (actual system failures) vs. soft real-time system (unhappy users).  These ""experts"" have put forth a road-map that ""scales"" based on a layered approach that uses a layer 2 network that requires hard real time performance (LN needs this for safety of funds to prevent counter party risk) on top of a system that does not guarantee hard real-time performance, nor can it come close if run at an arbitrary capacity limit. This demonstrates profound lack of intuition on how complex layered systems actually operate and the problems they can have that involve cross-layer congestion collapse. There are many examples of this throughout the history of computer networking, it's not that this is a new field.

Many of our users have rightly been frustrated with this requirement (as are we as we were looking for alternatives even before 1.0 was released).

Now it's possible to distribute the data more and make orders asynchronous and our 2.0 version which does that is under heavy development.

But to make it work you need to be able to make escrow payments asynchronously. But the way LN works, you can't really do escrow payments without all three parties being online at the same time. So it's basically back to the ""every node must remain online"" model which we know people don't want. 

And it's ironic because some of the most ardent LN proponents in the other sub also criticize OB 1.0 for requiring nodes to remain online 24/7. It's like they don't even understand what they are advocating for. 

And look at the criticism I got over there for raising UX concerns (the very concerns **they** raise about OB 1.0). Someone class act even made an entire post mocking us essentially for trying to address these concerns and, of course, it's one of the top posts.

daid58u,FaceDeer,88,"Once upon a time there was a kingdom named Ethereum. It was a young but rapidly-growing kingdom, with many progressive ideals and new ideas.

The older kingdoms around it were stodgier and less creative - particularly the biggest and oldest kingdom in the world, the Land of Bitcoin. Their citizens had few rights, their towns had only a small number of pre-defined businesses that were allowed to run shops, and their streets were narrow and congested so few people could even get to those shops anyway.

The King of Ethereum wanted his kingdom to flourish, however. So instead of making laws that only allowed a few basic activities, he (and his many Dukes and Duchesses who were just as clever as the King was) got together and came up with a set of laws that allowed the citizens to do all kinds of things that other kingdoms didn't allow.

This was a dangerous and delicate thing to do, though. No matter how wise the King and his Court were they couldn't foresee *all* things that were allowed under their laws. In addition to the people who celebrated because they'd be allowed to build productive businesses and fun carnivals and all manner of things to improve the kingdom, there were people who celebrated because they saw new opportunities to wreak havoc.

And so it came to pass that a fell trickster began to spot flaws in the clever King's laws. He found ways to confuse and confound the kingdom's bureaucrats with demands that took way more time for them to perform than the fees associated with the tasks suggested, and soon the legitimate business of the kingdom ground almost to a halt under reams of unprocessed paperwork.

Edicts were passed to change the laws, making it more costly to submit applications for the tasks that were occupying the Kingdom's time. This too was a dangerous and delicate thing to do, since changing the laws required all of the many offices and town guardsmen to update their lists of how to do things at once - otherwise they might conclude that their fellow guardsman or office was doing things *wrong*, resulting in a schism that could split the kingdom. That had already happened once before, when Prince Classic took ten percent of the Kingdom's territory to form his own Kingdom (with blackjack and hookers), and nobody wanted to see that happen again.

The new laws were sound, however, and established in an orderly fashion. The trickster who had confounded the Kingdom of Ethereum seemed to have been rendered powerless. But then he deployed his most terrible and annoying spell. He had discovered a means of submitting citizenship applications virtually for free, and began creating legions of lifeless scarecrows that were all recognized as citizens of the Kingdom.

Thousands of scarecrows, *millions* of them. The Kingdom of Ethereum became a kingdom of straw, with real living people  almost impossible to find among the dummies littering the broad streets. But the law said that citizens were citizens, even if they had no life and performed no services, and that they had to be accommodated and catered to by the Kingdom's over-extended social welfare programs.

This clearly wouldn't do. So a second edict was prepared, and spread to all of the King's knights. It would need to be executed with *great* care. For when the night finally came on which the edict came into effect, all of the straw citizens would be declared open game for anyone who should wish to strike one down. But only the ones made of straw!

The night came, and with it the Purge began. It continued on into the morning, and the next day, for there were *many* scarecrows. For more than a week the kingdom seemed to have ground to a halt again but instead of a flurry of paperwork bogging everyone down it was a snow of straw and burlap from the legions being struck down.

And indeed, due to the trickiness of getting the laws right there was a slight mishap - the Parity Guard and the Knights of Geth had a slight disagreement over exactly when and how a particular scarecrow was to be disposed of. Fortunately the Knights of Geth quickly realized they were in the wrong and stood down, and the Kingdom remained unified.

Soon it will end. The crafting of new scarecrows has been forbidden - at least, not without paying a proper fee - and half of them are already gone.

Meanwhile the surrounding kingdoms look on, laughing but also baffled about why the Kingdom of Ethereum would go through all these shenanigans. And the Classic Principality ponders whether they should purge their own population of straw men. But those are tales for another time.",2016-11-28 10:26:52
daihdar,nullc,54,"From a mechanics perspective they could be autoadjusted... with about one line of code. Bitcoin's creator made a conscious choice to not do that.  Presumably the reason is that-- at least stated as simply as that-- it wouldn't serve a productive end.

As far as we can tell, the blocksize limit exists for two main reasons (plus a number of incidental engineering reasons)-- one is to protect node operators, who are the not-directly-compensated protectors of the immutability of the system's rules, against miners who get directly paid to include more and more transactions. Auto-adjusting like you suggest would fail at this goal, since miners could simply bloat to whatever they wanted.

The second reason is to create market reason for transaction fees to exist in the first place-- so they can pay for security to support he system. In a fairly and competitive market with well distributed miners, if blocks aren't consistently full the rational price for fees would be nearly zero, which can't support a high difficulty needed for security. So from that perspective that 'optimal filled' percentage is 100%-- in fact, beyond, 100% because if a block empties the mempool completely it will eventually be in a miners strong economic interest to attempt to [orphan the last block instead of mining the next](https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a54).

dahppo8,bitusher,51,"&gt;EDIT: this being said, I do believe that Core should come out with a solid road map to a block size increase now that segwit is ready. 

The reason there isn't definitive dates on the roadmap is because software engineering and testing often takes longer than anticipated . Core gave an expected date for segwit release and than was highly criticized for delaying the final tested version. I would much prefer they take their time and be thourough than follow the move fast and break things standard we see in ETH.

Another issue at play is that we have some great ideas as to how to improve bitcoin -MAST/Schnorr sigs/LN ect, but all of these things are a work in progress and the priorities may change if new events occur or new information is realized: 

Examples:
1) Segwit with a HF wasn't a priority until Luke Jr had the brilliant idea how it could be rolled out with a SF making it much safer and quicker to deploy than with a HF. This changed the priority to focus on segwit. 

2) If blacklisting started to become a thing I would want all devs to ignore any work on tx throughput and only focus on fungibility as fungibility is much more important. 

3) Satoshi's original idea of SPV clients was to couple them with Fraud Proofs for security. We have never had fraud proofs and it is doubtful a good solution will be found to this which in turn indicates that full nodes are much more secure than SPV nodes. If someone found a solution to fraud proofs than we as a community would be much more comfortable increasing the blocksize to a point which further centralizes full nodes to a degree.

(2) Segwit's capacity increase doesn't come with an increase of the UTXO set bloat permitted-- one of the main drivers of node costs-- 

(3) Because lite wallets don't generally need witness data, segwit allows them to operate with less bandwidth than they do today (where they're forced to take witness data just to check txids, then throw it out).

(4) other nodes that are fetching the chain but not verifying it could skip fetching witness data. For example, the current Bitcoin ""Classic"" code doesn't verify signatures for any block where the miner has specified a timestamp more than one day (*number of cores) ago from your perspective.

(5) Making improvements like aggregation much more practical to deploy is still am important improvement, even if the benefit isn't realized yet.

The problem with BitcoinCore goes beyond the quality or choice of approach. The problem is that they want to develop their ideas **to the exclusion of other developers** and force everyone to use their code. The forced code comes from censorship, spreading fears about other development teams and approaches, making agreements with miners directly and other backdoor room deals. Backroom deals, middlemen and these censorship tactics are what Bitcoin was meant to replace. If we keep BitcoinCore we are trading the banking industry for central-planning developers like Mr. Maxwell who believe their toxic ideas to be better than others without compromise.

Bitcoin will never be decentralized until it has multiple competing teams (without politics) working a layer above a reference protocol that doesn't cripple the system. At the moment, the 1MB cap is part of the protocol, but there is not a good reason for preventing natural market forces from determining the correct blocksize.

Think about it: one company or government could corrupt BitcoinCore and then influence everything, thereby destroying the P2P Electronic Cash system we want and turning it into a for-big-bank settlement network.

Further, don't forget that the big banks have a massive incentive to turn Bitcoin into a settlement network. It would allow them to replace thousands of expensive employees that handle inter-bank settlements for legacy systems while preventing P2P transactions due to the excessive on-chain transaction cost. LN hubs can be considered middle-men that make money off of each transaction, just like the current banking industry (once again, what Bitcoin was built to prevent!). LN hubs require locked funds and after something goes wrong it would be too expensive to close a channel - users would have to accept losses. If Bitcoin becomes a settlement layer it will no longer be for Peer2Peer, it will be for Bank2Bank and Peer2Hub2Peer.

&gt; by Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

A factor of 10 every 5 years is about 60% increase per year.  But bitcoin's daily traffic has been growing much faster than that.  By the end of 2010 there were about 500 transactions per day; five years later, in Dec/2015, there were 200'000 -- 400 times as many, not 10 times.

Third, what part of Segwit + hard fork to 2mb is a compromise from the big blockers? Taking on Segwit? Not making blocksize completely unlimited? Honest question. 

Fourth, ""They think core will leave blocksize at 1mb forever"" is a terrible reason to block Segwit progress. That's just playing politics.

If you oppose Segwit for other reasons, that's fine, but block bitcoin progress just because you don't like who the core developers are as people is ridiculous.

Fifth, Seeking 95% consensus on a change that is not very controversial is far from ""dictator"" or ""monopoly"" or ""hijacking the protocol"" or whatever you want to call it. It's the opposite.

As opposed to what the big blockers want to do which is hard fork and just make everyone pick a side. Hard forking is a form of allowing the community to vote, but it is a highly risky one. Soft forks are not perfect either but ""if we get 51% fuck you guys we are forking!""

   - *projection* (dismissing serious commenters as ""trolls"" when *he's* one of the biggest trolls here) and

daliwxq,chernobyl169,20,"I have tried very hard over the previous months to resist the conspiracy theory conclusion that you are personally, actively, consciously harming Bitcoin. I have, through it all, over the years, always given the benefit of the doubt on this. I've raised concerns several times, but I have never been the type like u\/ydtm to draw conclusions without necessity.

This post has shattered the one remaining vestige of plausible deniability that carried the idea. You demonstrate clearly and unequivocally in these statements that you absolutely and fully do understand with intense detail the nuance and history of Bitcoin, the philosophy that drives it and the model that binds it.

Still, side-by-side with this starkly honest statement about Satoshi are prime examples of the classic disinformation techniques we have come to *expect* from you. As if nobody knows your Bitcoin Talk username! The way you dodge the point is so predictable, I knew your reply would not refute the claim, but would attack the timeframe mentioned - all before I read it. Why is all that important? Well, if you have to ask, then you don't really understand what the OP is about in the first place and don't fully understand the context of this reply either.

You cannot be simply incompetent; here you echo an increasingly rare refrain that hearkens back to the days of a communicative Satoshi. It is now inconceivable for me to use the defense of ignorance when attempting to justify your motivations and understand your arguments and conclusions - you have, without a doubt, a clear understanding of the issues at the heart of Bitcoin and cannot be simply misguided in your leadership and actions.

As the fabled fictional detective is so oft misquoted: ""After you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, *must* be the truth"".

You changed, and that change is most apparent over the recent months. With that change has come definitive, causally-related reactions from the existing and past users of Bitcoin. The formally universal ideals by which Bitcoin was held have been shed one-by-one; to see this echo of the past today is truly remarkable. It betrays the inner history you carry with you - the growth of the system, the process by which the process of development was changed, the systematic shame-expulsion of knowledgeable, prominent contributors, the acceptance of VC, the conflicts of interest - all of it is still there. You're not ignorant to the truth; it's impossible to argue that you have Bitcoin's best interest at heart and are simply misguided because *you understand Bitcoin's best interest, demonstrate that understanding, and actively undermine it anyway*.

Don't get it wrong - I *never* trusted you. That's what Bitcoin is about. I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt as a human being - however, this is a benefit you have un-earned through hostile behavior. The duplicitous standard by which you behave is stark - out of one side of your mouth you assert that you ""personally avoid"" this discussion, yet post the vast majority of the reply text when the topic is raised (in a forum you consider to be hostile).

dalllse,BlackSpidy,18,"Bitcoin, ""digital gold"". 

I mentioned bitcoin's volatility today, it got me wondering how it compares to gold. If bitcoin deserves to be compared to anything other than itself, it's gold. Historically, that comparison has been all over the place. With volatility, bitcoin has had up to 30 times higher than gold and down to *under* the volatility of gold, when it comes to comparing their 30-day volatility. Currently, bitcoin is twice as volatile as gold. Currently, gold's 30 and 60 day volatility indexes are 1.18% and 0.97% respectively; bitcoin's volatility is 2.33% for the 30 days index and 1.82% for the 60 day index. I'm using https://btcvol.info/ for this info, btw.

One whole bitcoin is worth 18 grams of gold, and 0.61 oz (ounces? ounce?) of gold. One kilogram of gold is the goal I'm cheering for, we're currently at 2% (of $38,000+ a kilogram of gold is worth). Obviously the totality of that price will not come today or tomorrow, but definitely within a few decades. If not within the next decade (Jesus, how will the 2026 world look like?). 

I'm completely sure that an in-depth analysis would show bitcoin to be the more risky, less ""legitimate"" and/or less reliable of the two. But I'm confident that some day in the not-too-distant future, comparisons to gold will not be as... if I'm being honest, ridiculous (to some extent) as the comparison is right now. It looks like a coin toss as to where the price goes from here, and this tiny movement is getting on my nerves... but I chose to remain cautiously optimistic.

Using it to import drugs? You risk Irish customs seizing your package and possibly a knock on the door from the guardai.


I know somebody that has received 126g packages of MDMA from Germany and 126g packages of weed from Canada with no problems. I know somebody else who got a half ounce of weed seized from Canada. Nothing happened other than a customs letter. The guardai won't get involved unless it's clear the amount being sent is for redistribution.


The vendors stealth is highly dependant on the vendor. Do your research on the darknetmarkets forum. Some stealth methods are ingenious, some are just vacuum sealed in a padded envelope. You'll pay more for better stealth (20ish), but its worth it. Our customs are lax enough tbh.
