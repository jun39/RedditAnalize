dan7r1x,freedombit,46,"All right Millennials, get on board with Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. Put the bank and atm in your pocket and control your own future. You spend 40 hours or more a week working for money. Spend 5 hours learning how it is made, who makes it, and how it is fractionalized by banks, markets and laws.

Here is how many dollars have been printed:

dan30l4,If_IWould_,40,"I remember reading Accelerando where everybody was unsure if they were living in a singularity as they float about on Saturn bankrupt because economics 2.0 were undercutting all human labor.

It's kinda like that.  We're thinking ""Is this really cyberpunk?"" as VR hits mainstream, bitcoin is a viable currency.  Drones, 3D printing, primitive AI (Siri, Deep mind, facebook bots) are in the wild.  Every passing year the digital domain is becoming more lucrative.  Hacks are treated as life threatening to new companies.

damukex,todu,36,"Good. Welcome back!

Now we have two altclients that both compete with each other and at the same time cooperate with each other: Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic. It would be very good if Bitcoin XT would also adopt the Bitcoin Unlimited suggested way of handling the blocksize limit, because then we and miners would have three altclients to choose from. If one of those three would start to misbehave like Bitcoin Core has been doing, then the other two can take market share away from them until they stop misbehaving. 

No altclient should have more than 50 % of market share among miners and nodes, so we avoid the ""51 % developer attack"" giving unreasonably much power to just one development team (like we have today with Bitcoin Core). So when all three altclients are behaving like the economic majority wants them to, then miners should try to mine on one third Bitcoin Unlimited, one third on Bitcoin Classic and one third on Bitcoin XT. 

So, that leads me to the question for Bitcoin Classic. What is the default coinbase setting? Is it EB16/AD4 like with Bitcoin Unlimited, or maybe EB1/AD6 like Viabtc has suggested?

I assume that Bitcoin Classic votes no for Segwit activation just like Bitcoin Unlimited does.

It would also be good for the safety of the network that no client has more than 50 % of the altclient market share because if one client gets a bug, it will be easy to very quickly change to one of the other two altclients that don't have the same bug, so that the block generation doesn't get interrupted while the bug is being fixed.

dana2zt,Bengal_Tigger,24,"My 2 satoshis... invest in Bitcoin.

Not your whole life savings but as much as you can afford. In terms of banking, this is the one common theme amongst my smartest friends in the tech and hackerspace community.

It's ... dare I say it...Trump-proof. 

De-centralized so banks have zero-to-minimal influence over it. The worst thing the government can do is ban it, which would only help the cause.

My freelance graphics designer friend who moved to Thailand gets paid in bitcoins, pays rent in bitcoins, buys groceries and lives 100% financially using bitcoins. It's not only possible, it's probable.

danbf7v,nullc,20,"Not just that, but if it was running at that speed and turned off his computer as he did here ... or his internet connection went down .. or even miners got a lucky run or turned up a lot of new hashpower at once,  he'd likely never catch up again.

It's not acceptable for it to ""just fit"", a functioning Bitcoin must have nodes that are _many_ times faster for the system to actually be workable: You must be faster because mining variance, you must be faster to catch up after connection interruptions, downtime, and upgrades, you must be faster to handle DOS attacks, you must be faster due to worst case costs being many times than typical, you must be faster due to not being willing to tolerate Bitcoin totally saturating the whole computer all the time, you must be faster because as the UTXO set grows processing slows down, you must be faster because 10 minute delays processing things make you not useful for block relay between other nodes and would likely bother you... and so on.

If all of those things aren't met-- you fall behind.  If you are actually only 24x faster, that is really concerning-- it isn't enough margin.

Moreover, your system is pretty beefy-- we want a decentralized system with wide participation, not just nodes on higher end systems that a very small portion of the potential node operators would dedicate to that purpose. If 10% of the operators can achieve X per second or better, and thats what it runs at-- then you the lose the 90% that can't/won't provide for more.

&gt; They're far more power efficient, but they're not much faster in ghz.

Right, a lot of improvements have been going to power efficiency lately. I've brought this up a number of times when people talk about future tech making gigantic blocks a reality.

damj25b,haekuh,19,"This is a good lesson in general versus application specific computing. 

Please note I am making a couple guesses about your specific situation.

That little android TV box very likely has a part of its processor specifically dedicated to only video decode. Where as your processor likely does not. 

This is known as an ASIC or application specific integrated circuit. An ASIC only targets ONE task rather than a general work load. In hardware it is easy to do ONE task extremely well but very hard to do many tasks extremely well. An ASIC tells every computing task it isn't designed for to shoo and only focuses on what it is being designed to do.

A perfect real world example of this is Bitcoin mining. A couple can mine Bitcoin and a GPU can really mine Bitcoin... But and ASIC can be a whole order of magnitude faster than a GPU at mining. 

Most people might say "" how can this ASIC mine so fast? It has far less transistors, uses less power, and runs at a much lower clock speed"" the answer is that the ASIC ONLY computes Sha hashes to mine Bitcoin and NOTHING ELSE. 

Imagine it like trying to be a world class soccer player compared to trying to be a world class soccer, basketball, and football player at the same time. Chances are you can be a pretty good soccer,football, and basketball player but not a world class one. Where as you can probably be a world class soccer player with a good bit of work.

This is the struggle of modern day processors. ",2016-12-01 05:20:06
dan6og8,cardboardoranges,19,"XMR is referred to as an altcoin largely by the incumbent crypto community (i.e. Bitcoiners) and day traders utilizing the semantics of the markets.  Here in our own community we are well aware that Monero is built upon a completely different codebase that offers a vastly different set of features (some would say that these features reflect what BTC attempted to implement) from Bitcoin.  Thus, change begins with us: As we continue to assert ourselves as a completely separate entity by gaining traction through exposure, XMR will stand more and more on its own.  Even issues such as Jaxx and Exodus' implementation of Monero into their respective wallet services show that this is not some shit-clone copy of the BTC codebase (I'll spare examples but we all know to whom I'm referring), and that in order to make use of XMR requires a restructuring of the pre-existing ecosystem.  Bitfinex's decision to implement an XMR/USD pair today was a leap of faith on their part, but one that will pay off in the end for them because they were the ones brave enough to try something new, something that many of us here understand actually implements the concept of ""anonymous e-cash."" The approach of the GUI release, along with a point release prior to the next pre-RingCT hardfork are nice, but it's important to keep the big picture in mind: In ways big or small, those here that actually make an effort to contribute to the Monero ecosystem are assisting in the construction of an anonymous currency system upon which lives could depend in the future.  Think about that for a second the next time someone asks ""GUI soon??""",2016-12-01 13:37:58
dambhcj,H0dlr,19,"This is why I've always said that BU has no financial COI. If you set EB =1 &amp; AD =99999, you've just recreated a 1mb Core node, since this is the only code alteration BU has introduced. And as you said, BU can even enforce &lt;1mb blocks if that is the emergent consensus. 

This fact gives me a crystal clear path forward. That is:

Step 1:  SW fails to activate 

Step 2: more and more miners run BU. Afterall, why not, if you use the above settings to stay with Core for now, but want to hedge your bets on an impending big block fork via BU? Also , getting experience with BU software now is a great idea. Just in case. 

Step 3: once &gt;51% miners are running BU, one of them will release a 1.1mb block causing a permanent HF to bigger blocks forever, leaving core dev behind for good. 

Step 4: the entire Bitcoin ecosystem profits. Except of course, if you've been a Bitcoin Bear. Greg. ",2016-12-01 02:57:32

In other words, there's no reason for the government to track bitcoin owners because nothing in bitcoin form is a taxable income. It's an arbitrary commodity. The only point at which it is taxable is when it is converted into a currency like USD.

damnvwh,permissionmyledger,16,"I read the forum questions. The China Bitcoin community is not happy with Core's betrayal from the December 2015 Hong Kong agreement.

We were promised a 2MB blocksize increase with Segwit as a hard fork.

Immediately, the signatories aligned with blockstream began to downplay their participation, no work on the 2MB hard fork was performed by the core development group, and all energy went towards Segwit as a soft fork with no blocksize increase, but accounting tricks making segregated witness data cost only 25% of regular transaction data. 

2MB was too much of a ""decentralization risk"", but the same team immediately coded SegWit as a softfork, which creates 4MB blocks, if segregated witness data is filled at the 25% cost (4x more data for same fee).

This, all, was an epic deception and bait and switch by the core development team and blockstream. No real blocksize increase, and a huge accounting trick to make it cheaper to open up payment channels for theoretical L2 solutions that don't yet exist, and may never work without creating centralized bank hubs.

I understand their concern, even if only through google translate! I share them!

I hope we can find a middle place on all of this. I hope core is not so overrun by developer egos or corrupted by special interests that they fail to realize that a compromise is the best way forward.",2016-12-01 06:47:09

dap0gcl,belcher_,37,"The bitcoin community on reddit has had something of a schism related to the value of a constant in the source code called MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.

It comes down to two different visions of what bitcoin should be. One side wants bitcoin to be something like a digital cash/gold which focuses on the decentralized currency aspect. The other side wants the bitcoin blockchain to be a high-volume payment method a bit like the Visa card network with much less emphasis on the decentralized currency aspect.

The bitcoin-as-digital-gold view is strong in r/bitcoin, the bitcoin-as-payment-network is strong in r/btc

The bitcoin-as-digital-gold side supports the [Core Scaling Roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) while the bitcoin-as-payment-network support switches between Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. The bitcoin-as-digital-gold side is sometimes called the pro-Core side, and bitcoin-as-payment-network are sometimes called the big blockers.

Bitcoin-as-digital-gold says the blockchain should be a very secure decentralized base layer with which payment networks can be built on top of. Bitcoin-as-payment-network says the blockchain should contain all transactions including people's daily coffee.

Disclaimer: I'm pro-bitcoin-as-digital-gold.

dap4owr,olark_0x00D8D8E5,30,"Look at the bigger picture here. Bitcoin is only valuable because of the prospect that it will be a widely used 'digital cash'. Digital cash, however, will not be a currency without default privacy and fungibility. Now either Bitcoin is able to change its qualities to better resemble what a digital cash needs to be to function or something else that meets the requirements of a digital cash will take its place. Maybe Bitcoin finds a real-world use better suited to its inherent transparent nature or maybe it continues to trip up on itself and further sling-shot itself into the void of uselessness. Furthermore, people seem to lose sight of just how long cryptocurrency adoption will take till it is widely used and accepted. In this period of time many cryptocurrencies will pass and go. Only the cryptocurrencies with strong community, development and real world use-case will live on, and I can barely count on one hand the number of coins that meet those requirements. 

So to answer your question, I believe Bitcoin will likely still exist in some form in the future, even if hardly recognizable, and Monero will also still exist because right now it is the only coin that meets the requirements of a 'digital cash' and there will be a large need for those qualities in our ever spiralling society to protect our basic liberties.",2016-12-02 23:27:01

daow9k5,jonny1000,22,"&gt; but it seems like the general threat is ""careless mining pools might get left behind for a bit"".

I was thinking more of a deliberate attack.  I guess this can also happen by accident.

&gt; Do you think it's much more serious than that?

Yes I do think this is a potentially very serious attack, with severe impacts.  Please see me try to outline some below:

* During this attack, there is effectively network downtime.  All a miner needs to do is produce a block to DoS the network.  In my view, we should try to keep network downtime to a minimum

* The resolution to this attack could take a while, especially if the chain with larger blocks has the lead.  This is because we may need to wait for miners AD thresholds to be reached, and AD can be a large value

* The attacker can get 50% free assistance with a double spend attack.  For example, existing light wallets such as the commonly used Breadwallet all have AD=1 (As far as I understand, or it may be infinity which could be even worse for BU).  As an attacker I could make a payment to multiple Breadwallet users, mine a median EB block and have 50% of the hashrate support my double spend attempt for free

* Other users could see the split and opportunistically try to perform double spend attacks

* This attack vector produces wasted work, this reduces the efficiency and security of the network.  i.e. the total work of the chain deceases.   This may be of particular concern for BU, which may be in a protracted battle with Core, over who has the most work chain

&gt;  Can you think of any obvious tweaks to mitigate the impact of such an attack?

In my view, BU somewhat alters the core ""longest chain rule"" idea, any changes to this area are probably highly risky and highly complex.  They seem to take us right back to the core principals of the Bitcoin design, which is the highly convergent nature of the system.  I therefore do not see any ""obvious"" think one could do in this area.

Personally I am strongly in favor of a dynamic market driven blocksize limit.  I support BIP100, which is where miners vote for whether the limit should go up or down.

There have been numerous news articles written with his name and forum name; he was sued in California, forcing him to detail his involvement. etc.  Naming him is little different from writing Mark Karpeles.

daqmyo3,ProfessorBamBam,270,"**Why this is a very, very, very, very bad idea...**

If governments mandate backdoors, decryption capabilities and internet record storage... **How long do you think it will take for hackers and criminal organizations to access the same capabilities?**

&amp;nbsp;

**Software backdoors:** 

A software backdoor is a concealed door left there intentionally by programmers that customers don't know about, in order to let the programmer bypass any security the customer put in place to give him access ""in God mode"" to the program. This was a thing in the past because software was first used commercially and often ""in house"" produced and the local IT guy had to manually fix the software from times to times. 

It is an extra administrator account on your computer that you don't know about and that you can't remove. **Think of it like the builder of your house keeping for himself a set of key to your front and back door without telling you...**

In today's world, intentionally leaving backdoors in software is frowned upon and seen as unethical. With a working backdoor, any person that holds the key can penetrate your computer, smart phone, tablet or anything else that runs software like your home security camera system, your baby monitor and TAKE YOUR PRIVATE FILES **or put files on your computer that don't belong to you**.

Imagine your are going through a divorce and your evil spouse pays a hacker to put illegal images and videos on your hard drive remotely, then calls the cops on you and get you arrested... **What would be your chances of winning custody of your children in divorce court if the cops find images of child porn on your hard drive?** Not even imagining the prison term that would get slapped on you for having CP on your computer and the 20 years of registration as a sex offender... 

&amp;nbsp;

**Mandatory decryption capability**

The ONLY security on the internet is encryption... Whenever you do any banking online, whenever you purchase a Netflix account, whenever you make an online payment, the only thing protecting your credit card information is encryption, the famous HTTP**S**:// 

The commercial sector relies on encryption to protect their trade secrets, the banks rely on it to safeguard your money, governments rely on it to safeguard national security, the military industry relies on it to protect the secrets behind our military weapons... And you rely on it to safeguard your passwords to your bank account and facebook, twitter, instagram accounts.

Companies rely on encryption for their employees to work from their homes and log onto their corporate network.

Now imagine the government is given a ""Master key"" that enables it to decrypt any communication on the fly, what could go wrong? 

- Someone, somewhere MUST have the ""Master key"", how much money do you think would be enough for that person to ""leak"" the key?

- Russia and China, always at the forefront of industrial espionage, would probably agree to pay millions, maybe even billions to access the capability to ""read"" the military secrets of our governments. 

- You could wake up one morning only to find a hacker has emptied your bank account and retirement fund.

- You could wake up to find your Bitcoin wallet empty.

- Someone could, potentially, take over your email, Gmail, Apple accounts, steal your stuff or put illegal stuff in your online storage...

&amp;nbsp;

**Records of your online activity**

Letting the government force your ISP (internet service provider) to record every action you do online, every conversation you have on Skype, every transaction you make, every email you send **is the same thing as allowing the government to pay a cameraman to follow you and record you all day long, 24/7.**

Now why is this a bad idea? Because in an open society, **the only people that we allow the government to monitor are the criminals, the rapists and the child molesters!** Why should everyone of us allow ourselves to be monitored like if we were a rapist? 

&amp;nbsp;

**The chilling effect of monitoring**

Constant monitoring has a chilling effect on free speech... How many of you would post the comments you are posting right now IF REDDIT FORCED YOU TO USE YOUR REAL NAME?

Well with mandatory recording of your internet activity, the government would be able to KNOW **who said something negative about Trudeau, who said something negative about this or that policy and who said something negative about anyone...**

If you are a business owner and wanted to get a government contract, would you be willing to express your opinions about the current government, knowing that it could eventually prevent you from getting that contract?

If you were a private citizen wanting to run for public office, would you really post comments that reflect your real opinions if you know your opponents in government could potentially have access to your online history and use it against you? 

If you are just a regular guy, would you take the risk of speaking your mind knowing that somewhere, everything you say can and may be used against you? 

&amp;nbsp;

**What could go wrong**

- The ""Master Key"" could get leaked and then you could become a victim of cyber criminals despite your best efforts.

- Corporation who have trade secrets to protect would most likely leave Canada to go wherever they can use encryption that is unbreakable... I know I would. 

- Working from home could become impossible if the complete security between you and your employer becomes impossible. 

- The government would be putting every one of us in danger, trying to protect itself at the expense of the population. 

- Cyber criminals WILL BE UNAFFECTED because they would actively create encryption tools OUTSIDE the jurisdiction of our governments, because they would route their communications OUTSIDE the reach of our government and because they are CRIMINALS who DON'T CARE about following the law. 

**the bottom line is that honest people would lose their right to privacy while criminals will be completely unaffected.**


&amp;nbsp;

**The only time we allow the authorities to record and used something we say against us is when we are under arrest and a suspect in a crime... Why should we be treated 24/7 as if we are under arrest?**

&amp;nbsp;

**What the government is asking for is to treat every Canadian as a potential criminal.**

If you plan a hard fork properly there is nothing wrong with it.


And Bitcoin could really use a small blocklimit increase at the moment. Because even if Core would implement it in the code today and you take into account a safe activation period it would take at least 8 month or perhaps even a year before a small blocklimit increase would activate.

darr2g7,ForkiusMaximus,24,"&gt;I see that this sub tends to largely lean towards on-chain only.

I have no idea where people get this idea. Any quotes? As far as I can tell - and I read this forum daily and post a ton - no one here is opposed to off-chain scaling. The only opposition is to delaying blocksize cap increases for as-yet unreleased off-chain possibilities.

&gt;I've heard some people saying that changing block size is as simple as changing a single number, but then I've heard developers saying just the opposite, and that the actual act of forking needs to be tried on testnet. 

It's a bit more complicated than that, but not much. Some devs like to make a talking point of this, but they just mean, ""Merely changing the number doesn't make the network able to handle that number."" But almost everyone agrees 2 to 4 MB would be fine. Forking itself is something that has been done. I don't know that there are particular concerns about a blocksize increase fork itself on a technical basis. The concerns are about a ""slippery slope"" where we keep increasing the blocksize cap until no one but major data centers can run a node. This continues to strike me as a silly argument, because miners and all other major stakeholders have every interest in not weakening Bitcoin. Humans react to changing circumstances and incentives, very *unlike* an icy mountain terrain.

&gt;I've heard many whispers of nefarious motives behind core coming from this sub, with lots of mention of Blockstream.

It's just what it looks like. Blockstream is a company that employs many of the most influential Core devs, and they seem to be developing off-chain scaling solutions for profit, with $76 million in venture capital on the line looking for at least a 10x return. The debate regarding blocksize is largely about how much to scale on-chain vs. how much to scale off-chain, and since around the time of Blockstream's founding, Core has been tilting ever more staunchly toward off-chain scaling. Segwit provides a small blocksize quasi-increase if the right conditions are met, but with strings attached: it gives a 4x discount to the kinds of transactions Blockstream would likely be making heavy use of in their business. This has people suspicious for all the obvious reasons, though nothing can be proven. ",2016-12-04 21:38:41

&gt;  The rise of 26-year old Charlie Shrem was swift. So was his fall.  
&gt; 
&gt; The self-professed computer geek turned divisive digital currency entrepreneur won notoriety as the founder of BitInstant. The firm took off, attracting investors like the Winklevoss twins, and helping popularize bitcoin. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then, his whole world came crashing down. He was charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He pled guilty, and was given prison time. 
&gt; 
&gt; He had ""knowingly transmitted money intended to facilitate criminal activity– specifically, drug trafficking on Silk Road,"" according to a press release by the United States Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York.
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem got of prison earlier this year, and his experience there hasn't deterred his faith in bitcoin and blockchain, the technology behind it. In fact, an incident with a prison guard and mackerels, the currency of choice in prison, only confirmed his belief in an alternative currency system. 
&gt; A computer geek
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem opened up about his prison experience and his past on  Wall and Broadcast , a  podcast hosted by TABB Group COO Alex Tabb, TABBForum producer Anna Stumpf and Vested CEO Dan Simon.
&gt; 
&gt; Raised in a deeply religious orthodox Jewish household, Shrem describes himself as an ""outcast"" at Yeshiva high school. ""I just loved computers,"" he said in the podcast. ""I would hang out in the internet chat rooms and all of the places where all socially awkward people hang out."" 
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem first heard about the concept of Bitcoin from a friend in an internet forum he was a part of.  ""There was no website or anything,"" he said in the podcast. ""Only a white paper,"" referring to the research paper released under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakimoto that unveiled the concept. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is a digital currency in which transactions occur peer-to-peer, meaning no government or third party is involved. Shrem was immediately interested and purchased a few thousand bitcoin - at the time worth very little. 
&gt; 
&gt; Austrian parliament Flickr/Kosala Bandara
&gt; 
&gt; He caught the entrepreneurial bug early, founding Daily Checkout, a daily deal website that sold refurbished used goods, at 18. He also attended night school at Brooklyn College and got introduced to the Austrian School of Economics, an economic theory that promotes laissez-faire ideals and the elimination of government intervention. 
&gt; 
&gt; In his mind, something clicked. ""I realized that bitcoin was taking all of that Austrian economic theory and putting it into practice,"" he said in the podcast. 
&gt; 
&gt; It was on Bitcointalk.org that he got the idea for a way to make the purchasing of bitcoin faster and more accessible to the every day consumer. He launched  BitInstant, which partnered with payment processors that had physical locations at CVS, Duane Reade, Walmart, Walgreens and 7-11, among others. The site allowed people to buy small amounts of bitcoin (with an average ticket size of $300-500) and charged customers a small fee for each transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Within a few months, we enabled people to be able to buy bitcoin at almost a million locations in the US,"" Shrem said in the podcast. ""And overnight volume exploded.""
&gt; 
&gt; The company achieved an average growth rate of 1.5x per month, according to Shrem, with advertising limited to word of mouth.  At one point, the company was facilitating transactions worth a million dollars a day, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The growth of BitInstant attracted investors like the Winklevoss twins and angel investor Roger Vere. They moved into bigger offices, shrouded in secrecy. "" We needed an army security guard, our own floor, and shaded windows,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon the two man band become a 30 person office, and he admits in the podcast interview that he let the success get to his head.

&gt; 
&gt; ""I started drinking too much,"" he said. ""I invested in my friend's nightclub. In fact, I lived upstairs in the nightclub.""
&gt; 
&gt; The fall of BitInstant was just as quick as its rise.
&gt; The fall of BitInstant
&gt; 
&gt; In March 2013, regulators enforced a ruling that outlined what type of companies were now considered money transmitters.  
&gt; 
&gt; Suddenly, BitInstant was operating without a license. ""We couldn't take the risk of operating illegally,"" Shrem said in the podcast,  ""so we shut down...It was heartbreaking."" 
&gt; 
&gt; Eight months later, Shrem travelled to Amsterdam to speak at a conference. It was when he returned to JFK airport that he was confronted by a dozen law enforcement officials, a joint task force of the FBI, IRS, DEA and other officials, he said in the podcast. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem had knowingly facilitated transactions to a re-seller, Robert Faiella, whose customers were using the Silk Road, an underground bitcoin only marketplace where people buy and sell illegal drugs. The re-seller was also trying to deposit more money than the new money transmitter laws allowed for, and these transactions were done behind the scenes to get around reporting requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; On September 4 2014, Faiella and Shrem both pled guilty in connection with the sale of approximately $1 million in bitcoins for use on the Silk Road website.
&gt; 
&gt;  “Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem opted to travel down a crooked path – running an illegal money transmitting business that catered to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road,"" Prett Bharara, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement at the time. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem, who was also Chief Compliance Officer of BitInstant and thus in charge of compliance with federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws, was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website and  that he was operating a Bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, he ""knowingly facilitated Faiella’s business with the company in order to maintain Faiella's business as a lucrative source of revenue, "" according to the court report.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Even though it was Shrem’s job to enforce the Company’s AML restrictions...[he] failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the US Treasury Department about Faiella's illicit activity...and deliberately helped Failla circumvent the Company’s AML restrictions.""
&gt; 
&gt; Shrem knew what he was doing, he said in the podcast, and he admits his guilt.

&gt; 
&gt; Digitizing the Prison Economy
&gt; 
&gt; Prison ""was no country club, but it wasn't Rikers Island either,"" he explained in the podcast.  
&gt; 
&gt; One out of every ten prisoners were white collar criminals - a state senator, a judge, and a few law enforcement officials were among his group. They were all nonviolent offenders so the fear wasn't as great as in maximum security persons. 
&gt; 
&gt; That's not to say it was easy settling in. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Everything here is word of mouth,"" he said in the podcast. ""There is no Google, information is trickling in. I think the hardest part is learning to use my own resources to grow, and not the internet."" 
&gt; 
&gt; On the outside, he had this Bitcoin celebrity status, he said, and in the prison, nobody knew him nor did they care about him. ""I needed to humble myself.""  
&gt; 
&gt; Of particular fascination to Shrem was the prison currency system, which involved bartering mackerels. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, there has been a mackerel economy in federal prisons since about 2004, when federal prisons prohibited smoking and, by default, the cigarette pack, which was the earlier gold standard. Prisoners need a proxy for the dollar because they're not allowed to possess cash.
&gt; 
&gt; Every inmate can only buy 14 mackerels per week, said Shrem, so there is a certain number in circulation in the prison. Also, not all mackerels are created equal. The fish expire after about 3 years, after which their value depreciates. Expired mackerels, referred to as ""money macks,"" retain 75% of the value of the ""eating macks,"" or non-expired fish, explained Shrem. There were currency exchanges between the two, and everything had two prices in the prison. 
&gt; 
&gt; mackerel fish Wikimedia Commons
&gt; 
&gt; One day, a large number of mackerels were confiscated by prison guards and left out for any prisoner to take. Overnight, the guards essentially introduced hyperinflation, said Shrem, and flooded the market. They lost all of their value. 
&gt; 
&gt; This got Shrem thinking. He started to think about the value of digitizing the prison economy and putting it on the blockchain. 
&gt; 
&gt; If there was a shared, distributed ledger among say a  dozen inmates,  everyone would have a real-time record of all transactions that occurred in the prison. All members would have to verify and validate a transaction to make sure it was legitimate before taking place.
&gt;

daqrf3v,theymos,16,"""Small blocker"" is a misnomer. ~All so-called small-blockers support SegWit, which is a max block size increase. Many also support an eventual hardfork max block size increase. The better term is ""decentralist"".

A larger max block size would have many advantages:

* It'd be much more expensive to disrupt the network by spamming transactions, and the continuum of fees would become more smooth. This'd *reduce* (but not eliminate) the instances of stuck transactions. Though the *real* solution to stuck transactions is fee bumping by wallets.
* Transaction fees would go down, which would make Bitcoin more useful/attractive. I personally am not worried about how this would impact total mining rewards, since the subsidy is very high, it will remain high for at least 4-8 years, and I suspect that in the far future miners can be funded by assurance contracts and/or other alternatives.
* The max block size is a form of (de)central economic planning, which is distasteful for many reasons. Though I believe that for Bitcoin to have any security at all, some full-node-enforced limit (maybe not a single global limit) is just as necessary as the 21 million BTC cap (which is equally a form of economic planning).
* In the first few years of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin was extremely convenient. You could take anyone's address and send them nearly any amount of BTC immediately, usually with zero fee, and your transaction would almost always get confirmed in the next block. It felt like the Bitcoin block chain was a limitless ocean of capacity. This was really nice. Unfortunately, this was only possible because Bitcoin was absolutely tiny then, and it will never happen again on-chain, even if blocks became unlimited. A very similar feeling might eventually be possible with Lightning and well-designed Lightning-supporting wallets.
* It is a reasonable thought to argue that it'd be good for Bitcoin to grow very quickly so that it becomes so entrenched in society that fighting it becomes difficult. But anything that causes such super-fast growth would probably weaken Bitcoin's security so much that governments could easily co-opt it. Even today, the Chinese government could (via miners) totally shut down Bitcoin overnight; the *only* defense against this is a strong full-node economy credibly able to threaten a PoW change. Satoshi thought that each governments' desire to control the world's currency might eventually lead to a stalemate/compromise in which they'd agree to leave it decentralized, but IMO it's more likely their compromise would be to create some abomination. It's better to take as much time as is needed to make Bitcoin so secure and decentralized on a technical level (maybe even more than Satoshi thought possible) that it is beyond attack from any adversary.",2016-12-04 03:20:21

The history here goes something like this (exact timing and order of events cannot be certain):

* nullc posts an explanation showing [OPs post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5g3weu/blockstreams_creator_changes_bitcoin_network/) was inaccurate and FUD, but does so by posting Gavin Andresen's email address (yes sort of ridiculous that was the start but read on). Note that [according to unreddit](https://unreddit.com/r/btc/comments/5g3weu/blockstreams_creator_changes_bitcoin_network/) this comment was **NOT originally** in the form of a github commit message as /u/nullc would [later claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5g6hnh/gmaxwell_has_been_banned_from_rbtc/daqa49a/). 
* moderator deletes the comment based on doxing rule and asks that he repost without the email address
* nullc reposts an image that has a github commit message that **still contains** an Gavin's email address, and cites the fact that this image is not on reddit.com 
* moderator approves/un-deletes original comment by nullc because he realizes Gavin is a bitcoin public figure and so under reddit rules the email address is ok.
* at some point nullc changes original comment to be a github commit message (this is based on unreddit showing it not being that way originally).
* nullc gets into longer discussion with moderator about the comment removal and in the course of that apparently (this part is unclear) mentions someone else's info which is considered doxxing. 
* because of that **2nd doxxing** (I think), nullc gets a temp ban on r/btc for 1 day (or so I hear).

Somehow I'm guessing the above history was involved in his reddit suspension (hopefully temporary). It probably does not help that nullc argued with the mods, posted a follow up image that still had doxxing info, continued to argue with mods, then apparently posted some other doxxing info on another individual, then in subsequent threads claimed his original comment was a github commit message when (according to unreddit) it was not.

dassaww,BootyBoots2,56,"It's a fascinating subject.
 
***
I understand when people look to the Internet and its possibilities and say ""this is the next great thing"" because in a certain sense it is: the Internet changed telecommunications, information technologies, and commerce in a which we can't possibly return to the way it used to be.

However, people were *sure* that Bitcoin was going to replace monetary systems, Reddit was going to change Police investigations forever via crowd research (We did it Reddit!) and the_donald swears it was them who singlehandedly put Donald Trump in the White House. The point is, there are technologies that have a huge impact on the development of society and we barely notice them –like vaccines– whereas others make us think that they'll be completely revolutionary, only to fail to live up to the hype (like the Soviet-American obsession with moon colonies). 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, talking about the management of propaganda is an entirely different thing, but right off the bat I can think of two questions:

* How does propaganda affect us in the age of customizable content?

* To which extent are we vulnerable to propaganda?

&amp;nbsp;

I think the nature of propaganda demands to take advantage of the heat of the moment, with the right rhetoric appropriate for the right time. If you take a look at [G.W.B Jr's approval rates](http://www.gallup.com/poll/116500/presidential-approval-ratings-george-bush.aspx), you'll see how public support gradually fell as people realized that they were lied upon. (Perhaps [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSaAI3M51Jo#t=19m27s) does a better job at explaining this point). I think people are not extremely easy to manipulate in just any circumstance: rhetoric without a proper event where people will agree with populist conclusions is useless. 

But, is Internet propaganda as effective as the propaganda of old? Ancient propaganda used to be distributed by leaflets of mandatory reading of material such as Marx's communist manifesto, so the state was in control of its spread. In the age of customizable content, that is not possible because the companies that profit with our navigating time are concerned with providing algorithms that *suggest more personalized content that appeals to us* based heuristically on others' preferences (and also, nobody can force you to consume content that you don't want to unless you live in a country like N. Korea, and there are just a handful of those left). So, in a way, I think **the Internet is not good at disseminating specific ideologies, but instead, it's good at reinforcing and polarizing them**. If you take this election into account, Youtube provided equally to liberals who looked for liberal content as it provided conservatives with conservative content. ",2016-12-05 12:30:20
dat10wy,theymos,45,"Yeah, 1MB forever is entirely survivable.

Lightning relies on all participants making a few on-chain transactions every once in a while, so while all current traffic and then some would comfortably work, it wouldn't scale indefinitely on the main chain.

Probably one or more high-volume sidechains would be created for both direct transfers and eventually any Lightning channel-open/close transactions that don't fit on the main chain. There are three types of sidechain that could be used for this:

* SPV-security sidechains and drivechains rely on the majority of Bitcoin miners being trustworthy. A majority of miners could steal all BTC on the sidechain. Bitcoin proper doesn't have this flaw. I think that this type of sidechain would only be reasonable for small values: experimentation, microtransactions, etc.
* Federated-security sidechains use signing by a group of centralized functionaries instead of mining. If there are many functionaries in many different countries, then IMO this is more secure than the above sidechain types, even though it is technically centralized. It can also have very short times between blocks. This'd be OK for somewhat higher values IMO.
* Bitcoin-security sidechains have the same security as Bitcoin, but this requires a softfork in Bitcoin, and then all Bitcoin full nodes must also be full nodes on the sidechain, so maybe this violates your assumption of no successful softforks/hardforks. Though the previously-mentioned sidechain types can usually be *converted* into Bitcoin-security sidechains at any point after their creation, so this is an especially easy upgrade path: by the time there's a desire to make a sidechain Bitcoin-secure, it'll probably be well-tested and popular.

Alternatively or additionally to sidechains, you could do some of these things:

* Blinded bearer certificates allow a bank (which may actually be a multisig arrangement requiring signatures from many independent parties) to issue bearer certificates which can be redeemed for on-chain BTC or transferred to other people. Transferring bearer certificates involves giving the recipient a signed transaction which they then register with the bank to prevent double-spending. Because blind signing is used, this is more anonymous than Bitcoin, Monero, and even Mimblewimble. It is also extremely efficient/scalable. A wallet based on these certificates might ask the user to say something like, ""I trust Bank1 with x BTC, Bank2 with y BTC, etc."", and then the wallet could automatically diversify among certificates issued by these different banks in order to reduce overall risk.
* Everyone could open a very-long-lasting payment channel with one hub of their choice, and then there would be a network of long-lasting payment channels between all of the hubs. Transferring BTC to someone would go from you, to your hub, maybe through some intermediate hubs, to the recipient's hub, to them; all through payment channels which probably already exist. There would be only a few main hubs, though the only barrier to creating new hubs would be somewhat higher costs, sort of like how email works. This is called the hub-and-spoke idea, and it results in significantly fewer on-chain transactions than Lightning, which doesn't have hubs.
* Before the current incarnation of Ripple, the idea of Ripple was something different. It was sort of like Lightning, but using debt and trust rather than guaranteed payment channels. You would say, ""I'm willing to loan 2 BTC to Alice and Bob"", and then maybe Bob would say ""I'm willing to loan 1 BTC to Carol"". Then if Carol sends 1 BTC to you, this is executed by Bob loaning 1 BTC to Carol and you loaning 1 BTC to Bob, so no on-chain transaction is necessary. Later on, if Bob wants to pay you, you just reduce his debt, again without needing an on-chain transaction. On-chain settlements would occasionally be necessary, but as the trust graph grows they become increasingly rare. If 100% of Bitcoin users used this system and formed a connected trust graph, then I think that no on-chain transactions would be strictly necessary. The main downside of this system is that it is somewhat fragile (ie. if you trust someone *incorrectly*, then you can lose BTC).  (Note that this has very little to do with the design of today's Ripple, whose usage of the name Ripple was a horrible bait-and-switch.)

Now, I don't think that it'd be very *good* for Bitcoin to be 1MB-forever:

* Most of the above solutions have some downside, usually increased centralization. While centralization in upper layers is better than allowing *Bitcoin proper* to become insecure or centralized, it's still not ideal. Lightning is nice because it combines many of the benefits of these more centralized systems without actually requiring any centralization/trust, but it does require some on-chain transactions. So it'd be really good if Bitcoin can at least handle enough transaction volume for most people to comfortably use Lightning. And in fact I suspect that increasing the max block size to levels required by Lightning will, when necessary, not actually be controversial. (We're not even close to needing this right now.)
* Switching from today's Bitcoin to a mostly-settlement-only Bitcoin would be really jarring. There's a lot of distance between where we are now and where we'd need to be in that sort of environment: in wallet design, user expectations/training, the overall ecosystem, etc. If all work on scaling suddenly stopped today, I think that we would quite quickly find the need to make this transition, and most Bitcoiners would find the process to be very uncomfortable.
* I'm not sure about this, but I kinda feel that it'd be ideal for people to always be able to do large transactions (&gt;$100 or so) directly on-chain. It'd be like the difference between wire transfers and ACH transfers in the US. Then you can keep most of your BTC directly on the Bitcoin main chain as a sort of ultra-high-security ""Swiss bank account"", and you don't need to rely *too* much on possibly-less-secure layer-2 solutions.",2016-12-05 16:52:01

A backdoored machine could also exfiltrate your keys via sidechannels in signatures and input/output ordering.

&gt;  ephemeral OS 

Intel Management engine can easily bypass any ephemeral-ness of your OS, so if you have hardware that only runs your wallet while disconnected the management engine can carry data to/from the internet.

Moreover,  many applications can't really be run offline. You can't run a Bitcoin exchange with entirely offline computers, for example. :) (you could have an offline cold wallet-- but thats the most you could do).

So good use of offline systems is critical but it doesn't replace the need for more trustworthy hardware.

das5q2j,Dunning_Krugerrands,15,"I don't see why anyone is disappointed because I don't see why people expected anything much at this stage.

* The platform is completely new best practices and software tooling need(ed) to be develop.
* Half the platform is not built yet. (WISPER, SWARM, RAIDEN, MIST, lightwallet, and android/ios libraries are in POC)
* Developers like consensys, maker, augur had to literaly build their own tooling.
* It takes time to secure funding.
* No other crypto has any significant use other than DNMs &amp; speculation and bitcoin has taken 7 years and $1 billion in VC funding to achieve very little.
* The user base for crypto is tiny and so there is little to gain by rushing. Dapps need to deal with barriers to use and slowly grow their customer base and tailor their products to the market by quietly working with a few key customers.
* There are dependancies within the ecosystem e.g. some apps need exchanges, stable coins, identity or whatever.

I'm pretty sure that the DAO delayed everyone by a minimum of 4 months but leaving that aside anyone who believed that we would be seeing multiple  Dapps with mass market adoption at this stage was already delusional. Despite solidity looking like javascript, building decentralised semi-financial applications on a completely new platform is not as easy as throwing up a node.js app (or whatever the current framework du jour is) and becoming an overnight success. There are a bunch of development and more importantly legal and business development issues to deal with. This is how business works. You do not just develop a product and win. Apparent overnight successes are the result of 3-5 years of tuning and building a business.

Incidently:

* SWARM/IPFS+filecoin which are part of the core functionality will provide very cheap decentralised storage, media streaming and database functionality on which applications can be easily built and are already in POC form. How do you value this I don't know but to give you some context Dropbox has a market cap of 10 billion.
* Loads of significant Dapps are in development and have either conducted trails or shown POCs e.g.
 * Augur [have a POC](https://app.augur.net/)
 * Digix [have a POC](https://app.digix.io/) the issue is making it user friendly and growing the userbase
 * [Golem](https://golem.network/alpha.html)
 * [jaak.io](https://twitter.com/jaak_io) are quietly building
 * [Provenance](https://www.provenance.org/news/) [have conducted trials and have initial customers](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/07/blockchain-fish-slavery-free-seafood-sustainable-technology)
 * [Chronicled](http://www.chronicled.com/) have initial customers
 * I don't know what the hell [consensys](https://consensys.net/ventures/spokes/) are up to but they had POCs ages ago.
* You are saying **I demand my mass market consumer Dapps NOW and if they don't exist the platform is a failure** but what you are missing is that **the smart business move is to  take time to get the product right and wait until things are ready rather than launching early and crashing and burning** .

A lot of things need to come together for adoption outside of the bubble but they are coming together so at some point in 2017 conditions will be right:

* User friendly Mobile wallets capable of running Dapps like [status.im](https://status.im/).
* Instant sync with light client
* Raiden instant payment
* SWARM/Filecoin storage
* Whisper messaging fully functional
* Ethereum naming service and human friendly names
* On chain identity services
* Stable and fiat pegged coins
* Metamask &amp; Mist will be out of beta and actually released.

At this point a compelling Dapp has a good chance of being a mainstream hit because

* Mobile wallets/Metamask/Mist and speed will make it actually possible for the average joe to use Ethereum Dapps.
* Swarm &amp; whisper will allow dapps to actually be decentralised
* Stable coins will allow people to pay for stuff with actual money.

But not before. Any Dapp released before will be niche because there are too many barriers to mainstream use. So that is why there has not yet been a hit. Not because of some huge problem but rather because conditions are not yet right and dev is not trivial.

datm419,TVTestPattern,35,"All the feels brother...

I'm 20 years older than you and I truly wish I had some great advice that might help you. What you and I both need is a time machine...

The sad truth is it's going to get much worse before it gets better.

You're miserable and that's not sustainable... so the outcome is basically inevitable. (Which I'm sure you already suspect) The only option for you is do your best to prepare yourself personally and financially for what's coming.

Once she knows the game is up it'll be on like donkey kong.

She will come after every aspect of your life like  the golden hoard and strip you financially, socially and emotionally. 

To that end, stash as much of your financial resources as possible. Pull as much cash as you can out of your account(s) and convert it into untraceable assets. Physical gold and bitcoin are good choices since you can make those untraceable. DO NOT purchase these assets directly from your account... her lawyers will ask the court for all your financial records and follow any paper trail to discover what you have. If you just pull the cash you can claim you gambled it away, or lost it in some other untraceable fashion.

She will torpedo your social circle... and since you're mormon, it's going to be a clusterfuck. As I understand it you could even be excommunicated. Cultivate relationships with single guys in advance... you will want that support.

The kids will probably be the most painful part... and there is very little you can do about it. Her attorney will use the cookie-cutter approach. They will question your mental state, make accusations of violence and drug/alcohol abuse. They will allege neglect and emotional/physical abuse. It's a shit sandwich and you will be force to take several bites.

You might consider doing a consult with every prominent divorce attorney in your area to create a conflict of interest if she tries to retain them.

Keep a journal to document what a POS she is, as well as any other evidence you can which will reflect poorly on her. You might even manufacture situations to give her enough rope so to speak... adultery would be a plus, but her breaking the law would be better.

I know it sounds brutal, and it is, but believe me when  I tell you that you will be amazed how vicious they can become. Your snowflake will try to gut you, and it's brutal.

I destroyed decades of my hard work and sacrifice by not understanding the truth... don't be me.

These people have an agenda to change Bitcoin from what was originally proposed into something very different - not P2P cash, but P2P gold, something only megawhales and banks can play with.  If you accept that Bitcoin is ""digital gold"" then you might be tricked into thinking that the marginal onchain transaction cost therefore is the cost to expedite physical gold from point to point overnight or faster - theoretically $100s per transaction.

dau3rcq,jessquit,28,"&gt; You need to understand that if you add additional layers to bitcoin, those are not 'separate things'

So do you.  You're part of a group of people advocating remaking Bitcoin from what was originally proposed into a different kind of thing altogether - and they call this utter transformation of the money-concept ""immutability""!?!  It's astonishing the doublespeak they use if you aren't paying attention.

Turning Bitcoin from ""P2P cash"" into ""P2P settlement gold"" is literally ""mutability"" of the money in the most profound sense possible.  Particularly when you have also worked in scalable information systems, and you believe in a vision of Bitcoin that *scales onchain* as I do.  That's the real immutability: keeping the ""money concept"" the same.

So I go back to the original question that you kinda ducked.  When did you give up on P2P cash as proposed in the white paper, and believe that only a radically different vision could ever work?

Edit: I have no problem with people wanting LN to work - I have a problem with having vaporware jammed on top of the vision of Bitcoin that isn't being allowed to work.  There are a lot of great ideas for onchain scaling that are being squashed by Core's politics.  Stop foisting your Layer 2 solution onto Layer 1's scaling problem.  Layer 1 should scale to support as many transactions onchain as securely feasible.  Layer 2 can stand or fall on its own.  You claim a background in information systems.

I'm definitely not too proud to admit when Greg is right, and he might be right about the idea that full consensus for an upgrade is too easy to block in order to ever work.

Point being, if this is true, then the only way to perform an upgrade to Bitcoin is to perform a full-fork or spinoff coin (also called a fixed height fork).  One side can follow the ""unchangable"" rules, the other side can follow the ""upgradeable"" rules.

When I saw what you posted, I immediately thought that you were a big-blocker and we were fighting against greg/etc.  Because that's truly the way I (and others in /r/btc) see it - we're fighting against the evil corp who has taken over bitcoin.

I'm just speaking for myself, but I've been a long-time bitcoin user (since 2011).  But what I see now is not what was envisioned from the original Bitcoin paper, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  The refusal to allow for larger blocks just shows that bitcoin (in its current state) will NOT be used by the average person, instead the average person will use services on top and it won't end up being much different from the current banking system.

I'm not sure why the fact that blockstream is financed by large banks doesn't bother so many of you here.  Why would a large bank want Bitcoin to succeed?  It makes me immediately suspicious of the motivations of blockstream.  But beyond that, blockstream only makes money if Bitcoin doesn't work as originally intended, if they can get people to use their new service instead of the bitcoin blockchain itself.

Why doesn't that bother people, that blockstream is so influential on the direction of development of bitcoin, yet they have such a glaring conflict of interest when it comes to how bitcoin is used?  Of course they are going to claim that we cannot safely increase the blocksize because they only make money if we can't use bitcoin itself.  I don't like to call people shills or paid or whatever, but it really confuses me that so many people just accept this company as being ok without questioning their actions or motivations.

And then there's the unsolved decentralized routing problem with LN that no one seems to have an answer for.

Finally the censorship on /r/bitcoin is pretty over-the-top.  We can't even discuss alternatives without fear of getting banned.  Again, this just makes me more suspicious of the motivations of those doing the censoring.  If the alternatives truly sucked, why would we need to censor discussion of them?  Especially on a place like reddit?  Shouldn't those alternatives naturally fade away if they are terrible?

I don't know.  I'm just an average guy who knows a decent amount about tech and computers.  But it seems to me like blockstream has essentially commandeered bitcoin.  It seems they are bent on neutering it by sticking with the low block size limit so that they can either keep it from being a real threat to banks or build their own banking service on top of bitcoin.",2016-12-06 05:03:59

If we do that, if we start doxing  we lose any moral authority to complain about censorship.  We become the problem.  We become 'those nasty people in /r/btc who act in a hostile manner'.  We become the bad guys.  

We are not bad guys and we should not want to be bad guys.  We should continue to make it clear that our disagreement is a technical and philosophical one about the future of Bitcoin, not a holy crusade against one person or company.  

If we are going to win the block size war, it must be with good ideas and solid arguments, not by illegally attacking the people behind the opposition.  

Besides- who Theymos is doesn't much matter, just as the real identity of Satoshi doesn't matter.  What matters for either of them is what they do online.  

So let's stick to ideas, and hope our ideas are better.  That's what mature people do, and it's what we must do.  ",2016-12-07 19:04:01

dawcfjh,ziggamon,20,"Circle Internet Financial Ltd., one of the most heavily-funded digital currency startups, will no longer offer customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoins.

The move, disclosed by the company Wednesday, is the latest indication that the financial revolution that bitcoin’s early developers had hoped to spark isn't playing out as planned.

Bitcoin remains a closely watched virtual currency, and its value is rising rapidly. But it is still a niche product, often traded by speculators and investors who own it as a hedge against traditional government-backed currencies.


Meanwhile, bitcoin’s underlying technology, blockchain, is widely being studied in the financial services industry as a possible tool to make everyday banking and complex financial processes faster and easier.

Circle, backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and venture-capital firms such as Breyer Capital and General Catalyst, says it will continue to use blockchain as a way to expand its fast-growing international payments business, which it hopes to integrate peer-to-peer money transfers into text, email and other digital messages.

The company’s mobile app, called Circle Pay, makes transfers in dollars, euros and pounds. Jeremy Allaire, the company’s chief executive and co-founder, says Circle remains committed to using blockchain, to facilitate money movements between individuals and across borders. The company plans to continue using bitcoin and other digital tokens behind the scenes to settle transactions in traditional currencies.

“Our vision has never been, let’s adopt a new currency,” said Mr. Allaire. He he said that bitcoin hasn’t evolved quickly enough to support everyday financial activities. “We want to realize overall consumer benefits without having to be a bitcoin buying-and-selling exchange.”

Circle says its blockchain-aided payments in traditional currencies have been growing multiple times as fast as its bitcoin payments.

“The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,” Mr. Allaire said of bitcoin. “We’ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.”

Circle’s announcement comes less than a week after a federal court ruled that the Internal Revenue Service could serve digital-currency startup Coinbase with a summons seeking detailed information on customer transactions. Coinbase, which hasn’t been charged with any wrongdoing, said it would fight the “government’s sweeping request.”

Circle, which said it hadn’t received a similar letter, will partner with Coinbase for Circle customers who want to continue to buy and sell bitcoin. The price of bitcoin has risen in recent weeks, with some investors using it as a hedge against inflation, like gold.

This week, Circle also said it plans to release free software code, known as Circle Spark, that can be used by digital payments providers to meet various rules including anti-money-laundering regulations when transferring money via the blockchain. Circle believes that using blockchains is cheaper and faster than traditional rails, like bank transfers or card networks.

By releasing its software to the public, the company hopes to spur a global network of banks and fintech firms to use the blockchain to help move money across borders, and integrate payments with chatting and other digital activities. That could help Circle to emerge as a major competitor to payment apps like PayPal Holdings Inc’s Venmo or Zelle, a soon-to-be-released app operated by a network of big banks. Circle is initially partnering with apps in South Korea and the Philippines.


Circle is still small relative to Venmo and the banks, who are doing tens of billions of annual person-to-person mobile payments. Circle is on track for over $1 billion in transfers this year, and it is growing quickly. Its cross-currency transfers have grown 300% in the past six months.

Circle’s bitcoin volume, meanwhile, grew just 50% a year.

This is a big blow for me actually wanting to use bitcoin anymore, and I just got done having fun messing around with my new shiny ledger.

davggrn,BeijingBitcoins,17,"This chart is a companion to this other diagram: https://i.redd.it/bbxv0my3tw1y.png

It appears that ""spam attacks"" are initiated when there is high transaction volume coupled with slow block finding times (an inevitable fact of Bitcoin, not a failure of the network). 

This chart seems to indicate that slow block finding times do not always lead to transaction backlogs (aka ""spam attacks""), this only occurs during periods of high transaction volume or especially slow block times. 

Another observation I make is that these transaction backlogs occur even with &lt;10 minute average block finding times. Although the protocol targets 10 minutes, enough new hashrate comes online consistently that 10 minute avg. times have never really been a thing ([chart](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/block_time/5y?r=month&amp;s=cardinal&amp;t=l )). If this is the state of affairs when the network is ""overclocking,"" we can imagine how much more dire this situation will become when new hashrate levels off. There are not very many more huge jumps to be made in ASIC performance, so I think that in the near future, new hashrate added as a % of total hashrate will be much less than it is right now, bringing us closer to a 10 minute average block time.

This form of short-sightedness is endemic to a small subclass of corporations (like Circle) who have taken a self-destructive antagonistic stance towards a huge group of people they've collected into a homogeneous ""uncooperative"" bucket.

This is just demonstrative of a lack of planning, a lack of simple outreach, and an internal cognitive brokenness when they accept the false narratives they've been sold.

Some advice, I suppose-- especially if you're going to speak truth to power in rbtc:

&gt; In general we will not allow personal emails addresses, even ones on github accounts, because that loophole would be abused by less than honest users. We can deal with each case as we see them. I would also say that if email addresses are not very important to the post or comment then leave them out. It immediately raises flags with us on the witchhunt front if they are not important to the context. PI is rarely black and white!

edit: just to make it clear blockstream is a heavily funded private company with many core devs on their payroll, and Greg Maxwell as CTO. and according to [their wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream) they are ""one of the largest contributors of funding for Bitcoin Core."" 

im not saying they aren't trying to help bitcoin. but, i am saying they are, as a company, trying to satisfy investors. their product, according to their wiki, is sidechains. i have to assusme they will be trying to profit from use of these sidechains. and because of this, i would also assume they would prefer a bitcoin that incentivized the use of these sidechains.

BIP152 is a bad copy of Xpedited. The bitcoin unlimited team created thin blocks, and instead of thanking the BU team and implementing the technology into Core, you had Matt C. knock it off with ""compact blocks"" (BIP152). You then proceeded to make life as difficult as possible for the BU team.

&gt;(and is a protocol that resists short ID collisions...). Using ""Xpedited"" instead of plain old Bitcoin Core would be a step back.

The short ID collision attack is not a viable or effective attack in the wild. Even if it was, it affects your copy cat implementation ""compact blocks"" too. Xor'ing doesn't make it significantly more computationally intensive to brute force your copy cat ""compact blocks"" vs using the original innovation that you copied, Xpedited/Xthin.",2016-12-08 13:34:53

daxzbgh,ricco_di_alpaca,45,"SegWit is controversial because it will remove the wedge issues from Bitcoin as well as threaten business models of many already failing businesses in the space.

There is virtually no technical objections to it. (There are several pseudo-technical ones, and a few economic/political ones). However, Bitcoin is now plagued with politics at the moment.  From the early days of Bitcoin, a lot of tradeoffs didn't have to be made.  

Wedge issues are the key to political control - they are issues that will allow a community to be divided.  Division is the key to any kind of major overhauls or changes.  In this case, the wedge issue is capacity.  SegWit solves this both in terms of a short term immediate bump, as well as allowing scaling at levels not possible on-chain.  This is a huge threat to politicians who NEED to have a crisis to gain power.  Those who invested in failing businesses who need the protocol to change drastically in order to meet the explosive growth their investors demand (or else they fold), absolutely need to shake things up.  You'll see who has been supporting these changes in the past, and you'll see a large number of companies that either have failed, are clearly failing, or have completely pivoted away.  They need the protocol to change to make money.  These businesses care about one thing - making money.  Whether or not that aligns with users of Bitcoin is a completely different story.  One only needs to look at something like Circle, that used Bitcoin as a mechanism to secure Venture Capital to grow the company, before completely moving away from it.  They have no loyalty, no stake, no interest in protecting the platform.  They are willing to sell out any privacy features because they already must comply with anti-privacy laws.  In fact, the harder it is for Bitcoin to remain private, the better off they are since it reduces their compliance.

Those who wish to harm Bitcoin also benefit from division.  I'm not sure if we are seeing that yet, but the fact that Mike Hearn was actively working for a competitor during his trashing of Bitcoin, makes me think we probably have this already.  Wedge issues give them a way to stifle innovation or cause chaos.  A blockchain split or division of the community is a huge win for them.

So how does SegWit remove this?  SegWit will solve capacity issues for a long time.  Short term, because it's an immediate 2x capacity increase.  Users are free to upgrade at will as they need the extra capacity.  But even more, with layer-2 solutions like LN, where middlemen are not even needed, you have scaling at millions times the level we have today, opening up more use cases than today.  Once users have this, how can you possible draw political support from users?  The hardest kind of revolution to lead is one when people are fat and happy, and SegWit will deliver that.  There will no longer be a wedge issue for many years.  They are dead in the water.

So allowing SegWit to activate is a huge threat to them.  They cannot allow it to happen.  Politicians do these kinds of tricks all the time - they never pass permanent tax cuts, they always make them temporary and tie them to when election years are coming up.  They create solutions that are destined to fail, simply so they can campaign to fix them in the future.  They cannot have success, otherwise people will not need them.  This is why Bitcoin politicians like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Olivier Janssens, Roger Ver, Mike Hearn, Jihan Wu, Jerry Chan, and Peter Rizun are desperate that this does not activate.  They cannot have Bitcoin succeed.  Those who invested in middlemen businesses also are failing.  Brian Armstrong, Jeremy Allaire, Roger Ver, etc..., all need Bitcoin to depend on middlemen for their investments to ever pay off.  The second Bitcoin becomes able to support a massive network as P2P instead of depending on them, their investments are dead.  They don't care about Bitcoin- they care about getting rich and having power.

So when you ask - why isn't it activating - ask yourself this - who is harmed the most by Bitcoin scaling without middlemen?  That's your answer right there.  They cannot have Bitcoin scale.  They cannot have Bitcoin succeed.",2016-12-09 00:49:29

day5ds3,jjjuuuslklklk,38,"The genius part about bitcoin is the game theory behind it. Game theory is a *science,* you can win a Nobel prize for it. How anyone would want to risk the priceless network effect we have, by altering components of the game theory that got us here in the first place, not only blows my mind, but pisses me off. 

We have ONE chance here people, ONE chance to take the power back from central banks, so for all the people in the world's sake, I am pleading with you, take a few minutes to consider the facts, and at the very least make sure you have weighed out the risk to the best of your abilities. 

Right now what I think people need more than a network that can handle micro transactions, is a network that allows them to hide their money from the government. What do you think the cost of that transaction would be worth? Is $0.10 too high? What about $0.50, $1.00, $100.00? I've worked too hard for my money, traded pieces of my life for it, protecting the value of my money is important to me, as it is likely important to everyone else, and I'll be damned if I'm going to risk losing the best safe haven to be created since the big bang because I want cheap transactions. Rushing a hard fork for cheap transactions so that everyone in the world can afford them is just plain not a good enough argument for me want to risk ruining this sanctuary currency right now. If you can't afford a bitcoin transaction then go use an alt coin like litecoin, or go start BU as a new coin now if it's so fucking great.

&gt;This is good for Bitcoin!

I ""like"" reading about conspiracy theories and think a lot of shady things have happened in the past, but any internet community relating to conspiracy theories is populated 100% by insane people because they've seemingly driven out everyone else. 

There's no point in discussing or arguing with these people. The standards for proof that supports their theory are nonexistent, and the standards for proof that disproves their theory are impossible to match. Many of them seem to believe basically every theory that gains popularity on the internet, which is probably why ""see, we said they were spying on us!"" turns into ""that also inherently means that our theory about Hillary being involved in a satantic child sex slavery ring based in the hidden basement of a D.C family pizza joint is 100% fact!"" There's almost nobody that believes that Sandy Hook was a false flag, but 9/11 was *not* an inside job from what I've seen. You have to start getting into lizard people territory before some of these people go, ""come on, *that's* ridiculous.""

Spend some time in these communities. These people aren't interested in the truth. They're interested in identifying the ""official story"" or commonly accepted truth, and then believing the exact opposite of that. It's a very easy way to make yourself feel like you're smarter than everyone else.

The reality is that there is **a lot** to be suspicious and concerned about when it comes to large corporations and our government, but they don't *actually* care about making the world a better place. The fact that they turn every single last thing into a conspiracy theory and the fact that they're so plainly stupid about most of it just stigmatizes skepticism and probably makes it even harder for anyone to effectively criticize things that deserve to be criticized.

If you're into gaming, we can do that together if we share any games in common&lt;3 or just sit back and watch some Netflix and relax together.

If you aren't sure about jumping into a full week, do a 3-day trial with me for $100 to ensure compatibility :) This will include 1 kik session!

Themed GFEs include all of this for the same price (unless stated otherwise), as well as extras that coincide with the theme that you choose!

Be it finding a girl, flirting appropriately, getting her all hot and bothered, or just knowing how to treat that special lady, I am here to help!

I will be straightforward when necessary, but mostly kind and encouraging. And maybe we can learn somethings through...how do you say, ""hands-on"" experience? ;)

Workout Partner: I've recently gotten back into the gym since I am on summer break from college, and everyone knows it's easier when you have a buddy! Or in this case, a sexy and fit girlfriend cheering you on ;) I run 3 days per week, train martial arts 3 days per week, and do bodyweight workouts at home on off days. We will encourage each other, set goals, and meet them together! We might even be able to come up with some fun rewards for you if your goals are met ;) hehe!

day3o4w,ricco_di_alpaca,19,"This isn't a conspiracy.  I'm not suggesting.  I'm suggesting people have rational personal interests to make sure SegWit does not get approved.

Roger Ver is a great example.  Though I haven't seen any evidence he's actually a top 3 investor after his alt-coin losses and malinvestment in shitty companies and his large payroll to shit on Bitcoin.  His riches in Bitcoin may very well be a fishing tale at this point, even if he owned a large amount long ago.

He has investments in companies that need explosive scaling in a short timeframe for his investments to pay off.  Segwit destroys that.  Of course he's against it.

Jihan Wu is a different story.  He appears to want to be King of Bitcoin, and has a lot of users in China who must stay in good favor with him to get the latest mining equipment.  So he's using this as a wedge issue to exert his power over the ecosystem there.

The vocal opposition of the Venture Capital backed consumer-facing companies was clear for over 2 years.  They are the ones who signed the 8MB agreement.  They have short runways (Coinbase seems to be the lone exception here), and most are failing.  They need explosive growth immediately, or else they go bust.

So it really comes down a lot to short-term vs. long term thinking.  If your goals are short term (and won't survive to the long term, or don't have the patience), then you will do everything now to ensure things blow up now (either for good, or for loss).

I just synchronized 80 GB of state with you in a single Reddit message. This is pretty profound ""evidence"".

(As far as miners centralizing, we also saw it in practice with 700k+ blocks causing high orphaning resulting in big consolidation around it, eventually making it reach &gt;50% total hashrate until the deployment of the fast block relay protocol fixed the orphaning)

LN, on its face, sounds like a product I'm not interested in (as a consumer *and* a merchant). I've no interest in tying up funds in a channel to facilitate commerce - that's an expensive, unnecessary step that causes nightmarish logistics for my business dealings and sounds highly risky (yes, it only sounds risky, but that's what counts).

However, I would also say that a number of other financial products available fall into this category. Just because I've no interest does not mean there is no market - and I recognize that there *is* a market for it. I can envision a future in which LN-style transacting is ""the norm"", and in that future, I can see myself tying up funds in channels to facilitate commerce.

However, that future is very detached from the actual present - the road from here to there is paved with questionable materials. The puzzle of decentralized routing has yet to be solved (despite 25 years of effort toward it across multiple applications) - until a serious, coherent solution to this problem is presented, the Lightning Network cannot be realized.

db0m4rm,ergofobe,17," /u/luke-jr, please explain where you came up with this figure and how you propose to incentivize 85% of Bitcoin users to run full nodes? We are nowhere near 85% today. I can't recall any point in the last perhaps 5 years where we have been close to 85%. And more importantly, I can't fathom a need for that high a percentage of users to operate full nodes unless you expect no more than a few thousand users. 

For the security of the network, we need enough nodes such that no government or hacking organization has the ability to take down the entire network faster than new nodes can be spun up.  A few thousand nodes scattered around the planet is probably sufficient for that.  I should also point out that for this purpose, it's also vitally important that we have a variety of independently developed node software so that only fundamental protocol level bugs could be exploited to take down the entire network simultaneously. 

And we need enough nodes that all SPV clients can find a full node that is not overloaded. If we make the assumption that one full node can serve only 100 SPV clients and that each SPV client will connect to 6 full nodes, we need 6%, but software optimization will probably reduce that ratio over time to 1000s of SPV clients per full node. 

But saying we need 850m nodes to support 1b users seems like overkill. So please back up your claim.

* In June 2012, the largest block to date was mined at nearly 500kb (#181919).

* July 2012 saw the implementation of the `-maxblocksize` option (soft limit), presumably in response to the ""spammy"" block full of SatoshiDice payouts.

* Block sizes continue to grow, approaching 750K throughout 2013. **No 1MB block had been mined**.

* In March 2013, block 228538 is mined, including the monstrous 500kb transaction `659135664894e50040830edb516a76f704fd2be409ecd8d1ea9916c002ab28a2` - this is the first block to exceed 750kb (let us call that a ""full"" block). Obviously, in order to mine this transaction and claim its 3 BTC fee, a miner would have to either mine it to the exclusivity of other transactions, or produce a ""full"" block. This miner chose the latter.

* Still looking for the next ""full"" block to follow, don't really have great tools for the job. 03/12/14 (Dec 3) is a promising date as it sees a spike in average transaction volume and block size, but I haven't dug into the individual blocks of the day (gotta do other things, IRL calls..)

&gt; 1MB blocks showed up pretty much immediately when Bitcoin Core made the soft limit configurable.  
 - nullc

Setting aside that Bitcoin Core didn't exist back then (it was bitcoin-qt), the soft limit was configurable as early as July of 2012, and the first block to exceed 800kb wasn't mined until March 2013, 9 months later. This is a far cry from ""pretty much immediately"".",2016-12-10 05:27:45

This is a common misunderstanding about the system.  To the extent that miners are concerned about orphaning at all they can eliminate it by centralizing further.  This is precisely how they've always responded to high orphaning in the past.

Moreover, if for some reason they couldn't take the high payoff strategy of centralizing further; they can simply use improved relay techniques which render block propagation times arbitrarily independent of Bitcoin size.

There can be no orphaning controlled equilibrium blocksize. (not to mention, if somehow there were one, there is no reason to believe that it would support the existence of any Bitcoin nodes outsider of the mining pools at all).

Do you have any evidence that the church changed because of him? All he did was get them to fork out five grand in a fine (one fine among thousands that election against various organizations in that pdf) a mere pittance for the LDS church.

&gt;I would almost guess he already has lots of evidence.

But he does not even claim he does have evidence. And if he did have it why would he need to ask for it?

Let's look at what we actually have here. What if I started a campaign claiming that /u/latterdazed has committed a bunch of crimes. But I did not present any evidence; I just hoped that other people would dig some up for me. How credibly do you think people should take me? Perhaps I should not accuse people of crimes without actual evidence that they even committed these crimes. Maybe that is just me, though. 

&gt;I will put all my eggs in his basket

Did you put all of your eggs in /u/anointedone's basket when he claimed to have an ""October Surprise"" that would bring down the church, ""kick it to the curb,"" and be the ""Mormon Apocolypse""? Did he con you into giving him some of the 50,000 pounds that he bilked out of the good people at /r/exmormon? Did you put all of your eggs in /u/mormondocuments' claim to have an audio recording of the big twelve admitting that the church is a fraud? were you one of the guys he conned into giving your money to his bitcoin wallet?

Given the track record for these things, I would say that just an ounce of skepticism is warranted. Add to this the fact that I have pointed out multiple claims by Karger that we know are lies and and I would say much more than an ounce.",2016-12-11 01:30:11

db38h1k,Nooku,25,"Many flaws in your argument.  

The strength of Bitcoin as a currency is exactly its deflationary nature.

It's the first time in human history that we have the technology to have a true deflationary currency, and it's totally untrue that this would not be a good property of a currency.


Deflationary currencies will still be spend, but more thoughtful. It's the perfect answer on our throw-away culture. Inflationary currencies make companies produce meaningless products, and makes people buy them.

Deflationary currencies make both companies and people more picky and choose on what to make and what to buy.

This is an important and necessary property for a sustaining future.

People have been brainwashed in schools to learn that inflation is good for the economy, but these assumptions are all based on the assumption that all currencies are de-facto inflationary. And are only in support for 1 of the possible conomical systems: in this case capitalism.


Now that we have found the tehnology to have deflationary currencies, this requires a whole new way of thinking which has not reached the books and lessons about economics. And which challenges our conventional thinking.


You have to think more openly and out of the box if you are going to take a look into the effects a deflationary currency would have. Of course it challenges the current form of capitalism which in itself is a result of inflationary currencies. But that does not prevent us from building a different type of capitalism that thrives with deflationary currencies.


For now, deflationary currencies are great for preservig wealth and making the earths resources more valuable instead of a must-use-quickly in the race against inflation.


Because inflation is a race, it is exhausting our planet and leads to overconsumption. 

If Ethereum ever wants to challenge Bitcoin as a currency, it must become deflationary too.",2016-12-12 15:19:09

db2l6mp,kissmyMAST,15,"Yes, I see it. You don't. Censorship in action! 

Here is what I wrote:

&gt;The only technical complaint I've heard about segwit was that it's complicated. I'd be curious to know if there are others.

I am violently opposed to bait and switch SegWit as a soft fork, and would support SegWit with a size increase as a hard fork, as originally promised. Hopefully the below will satisfy your curiosity as to why.

        size_t nSize = GetSerializeSize(*this, SER_DISK, 0);
        int witnessversion = 0;
        std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt; witnessprogram;

        if (scriptPubKey.IsWitnessProgram(witnessversion, witnessprogram)) {
            // sum the sizes of the parts of a transaction input
            // with 75% BLOCKSTREAM_CORE_BANKSTER_DISCOUNT applied
            nSize += (32 + 4 + 1 + (107 / BANKSTER_SCALE_FACTOR) + 4);
        } else {
            nSize += (32 + 4 + 1 + 107 + 4); // the 148 mentioned above
        }&gt; 

This is the C++ soft fork SegWit code that gives signature data a 75% discount. The makes digital signatures, which make up a bigger portion of P2SH transactions, four times cheaper than other transaction data.

This discount was never discussed or debated. It was simply inserted into the code by core developers who (you come to your own conclusion) are being paid by Blockstream. Blockstream is a private company that took $76m in corporate venture capital money from companies such as AXA and Digital Currency Group, which is partly owned by Western Union.

Before banning me or censoring me, please note that everything I have written so far is 100% factual and verifiable, and this trend will continue below. If this post is censored, I will make sure everyone knows about it.

Now, complicated P2SH transactions are needed for sidechains and Lightning Network. That gives Lightning Network and sidechains an economic advantage over regular Bitcoin transactions.  

In addition to no one really using it today, which makes it a dubious replacement for Bitcoin, Lightning Network has centralized routing that creates big hubs (banks). This is because the routing solutions proposed today, flare and onion, are naturally going to look for the shortest, cheapest route, which encourages bigger hubs with more Bitcoin locked up.

Therefore, soft fork SegWit is going to forever alter Bitcoin and give an unfair advantage to companies like Blockstream that plan to make money from lightning and sidechains. 

Personally, I'll never let soft fork SegWit activate. The miners and business/user community that hasn't been bought off wants a hard fork size increase and SegWit as a hard fork, without the 75% discount that was inserted into the code by developers who are paid by Blockstream without any public debate.

The fact that we've waited this long to scale is setting Bitcoin back years. Circle leaving is another warning sign. Investment and interest drying up is another sign.

So that's my technical complaint, and the economic ramifications of why I don't want a 75% discount in the C++ for P2SH transactions, because Blockstream said so.",2016-12-12 06:22:54

The BTC bulls seemed to put much faith in segregated witness but by the looks of it, SegWit is a *long long* way off  from gaining consensus. IMO, this is what is holding BTC back from breaking through 800 and then a new ATH.

ETH on the other hand has been dragged through the mud and dealt with many problems, but persevered.

I think all the price points people are talking about are indeed critical resistance levels. $780-$790 and 5500cny most of all, but I think it's only the speculative whales and fishies who really care about those resistance levels and I think the people who really need bitcoin or who perhaps know something about the ETF that most of us don't couldn't care less if they pay $680, $730, $760, or $790. 

Anyways... I didn't say much here and I have little evidence to support what I'm saying but I think for the most part we are in fairly uncharted territory for bitcoin. ",2016-12-13 01:06:17
db3usq7,ThomasZander,21,"&gt; Honestly, is the goal really to be just like Visa or Paypal

The goal is to have people **use** Bitcoin. This means bigger blocks. Otherwise the network is limited to a tiny percentage of the population and will be over taken by any competitor.

&gt; If having blocks this huge creates the need for massive 'datacenter' nodes 

There is no reason to believe that this is the case. In fact, we have lots of evidence to show that we are certain it will not be the case.

In my [blog](https://zander.github.io/posts/Scaling%20Bitcoin/) I showed that, today, a node can validate 368 million transactions a day.  I explained how a goal of 50Million transactions a day, in 5 years, is really easy to do on normal home computers.

In short, you can stop worrying about decentralization being compromised by growth.  It is more the opposite, now we know most home users can keep running Bitcoin even with significant growth it becomes obvious that when there are more users we'll have more people that can run nodes. And more nodes is good for decentralization.",2016-12-13 03:23:55

The sentiment is quite different today. Some people are moonish and others believe that bitcoin's bull market is about to come to an end. 

In my honest opinion, both are plausible. It is possible that bitcoin will top at $800 or so and drift downwards. However, unlike the earlier break of 1k, we have thousands of people shorting and looking to exit. If we do indeed break 1k, the short squeezes will be of epic proportions and there will be sellers hording at the exit. The sell side will be heavily depleted, and, we might indeed see 10k a coin within the next few years, if not more.

db4160g,textrapperr,15,"&gt;At its foundation, Bitcoin always was, and remains, a monetary system. Its main use cases are those closely concentrated around creation, transmission, and storage of a value token: the bitcoin.
Ethereum was never intended to be a money and payments system though many think that, in time, it can accomplish these and related use cases far better than Bitcoin does

So the next time you see FUD about Ether not being currency or a store of value you can copy paste this snippet.

&gt;Ether exists to serve the Ethereum platform, which represents far more than an opportunity to trade in a cryptocurrency. The value of ether comes from the fact that the platform has unprecedented potential to re-architect the way we live.

So Ether is way more ambitious than Bitcoin...

&gt;The success of private Ethereum blockchains, which are making businesses work better every day, does not depend on the currency ether or even the existence of the public blockchain, but in time the synergies between private and public will prove immensely valuable.

Right now people don't see private chain adoption as a value add to the public chain, but they could be way off base

Its a fucking bitch.. To say the least.

Need to first image the current market so everything stays as it. How much data do you think that image is 200+GB maybe more. All the seller profiles, users messages, feedback, users accounts, Vendor feedback, wallets, etc. Thats just imaging the market. Then they would need to image the bitcoin server, God forbid they loose all those transaction. Thats another 200GB of Data. So for the first few hours I wouldn't have been surprising if the guys had been sitting around drinking vodka waiting for the downloads to complete. You now that felling. looking at a bar for a few hours while it slowly gets closer and closer to the end. Not much else they can do then.

And they NEED to shut the site down to image it because there would constantly bee new things added if they didnt shut it down. Could corrupt the image being downloaded.

Then they need to take that image, reconfigure the internal source code for the new server, upgrade database, security, and the dreaded 'load balancing' of servers, which even some professional can take several hours to compute and deploy correctly. Then Even after the images are uploaded and the code is refined...

They still can't take it online just yet, they need to test it. And Desnake need to try to break into the site while it is running on a sandbox. Don't want someone else doing it while the site is broadcasting right?

Oh and thats just for a clear-net market, Fuck must be a few times harder for .onion domains and maintaining the anonymity of the servers while staying full operational. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they had been coding all night/day, fell asleep on the desk, will be waking up shortly to start working again. 

JUST think ABOUT it. Alpha-Bay has been adding feature other markets have never seen before. FE Vendor's remediary wallet (incase of fraud), Autoshop (closed Now), the tumbling withdrawals, Vendor stats. They have been around for the longest a market has been around. They have clearly invested much time and are clearly very very talented professionals who have from day 1 (the interview with the Admin on Deepdotweb) the Admin/Admins of the Market has a very clear intention to keep the market around for a very very long time, partly because they are hosting it from ""A very comfortable place where they are not worried about authorities""

I also think many here, have never had this happen before, but those of you who are veteran users from Agora, already know that this is 100% normal. Agora was down once for an entire week, and came back with faster load times the Google. 

Admins / Devs really take a lot of time to build a Market, and even more patients waiting for users to actually use it. Better still grow it to one of the biggest and most reliable Markets around. It hard work, luck, timing, persistance and innovation 

They don't want to have anything to do with that Bullshit DHL ""Invite Only crap"" Alpha-Bay is litterally open to ANYONE like a DNM market should be. IF you are New user, and want to try (for example) MDMA for the first time. You (at least speaking for myself) would not try to find and invite to DHL. The DNM are 'supposed' to make using drugs,  easier, and safer for everyone. Not just those who have an invite. IMO if you are doubting if it is or is not a n exit scam, put yourself in their shoes. They could have some downtime right now, and make operations run much faster smoother and maybe even organized better saving them much effort later in time. 

For the most part this is their job, You think they are coding internal source code for the market every single day? Hell no. Maybe refining it, but I concur that they usually work really hard for a period of time (like this one) and then sit back and watch the systems run as their commission wallets pile up. Alpha-Bay likely has all the cool feature probably because the Devs became tired of kicking rocks and needs a project to work on, so they build these extensions that you now see deployed. 

Take the day off guys, Chill back. Roll on up, I get a strong feeling they're not going anywhere and are only making it safe, and better for eveyone to use. I just remember Agora days, when you would go to log in and be se a ""server Not responding"" Error. Pan over to Reddit and there are a dozen new threads about how they are exit scamming and whatever whatever. Relentless they they always seemed to come back online better. And to the very end gave notice that they had been planning to stop operations soon and that all users should remove funds by XXX date. 

TO a degree I can't wait, I bet the refined version is going to be able to handle much more traffic while maintaining a very fast load time.

Games that sell better make more money which translates into job security, bonuses, and/or growing the company to have two production teams and thus create new jobs and opportunities for advancement. 
* Piracy is illegal. You may have a VPN so that you can't be caught, but I don't know that that will be fool-proof forever, and to most of us the threat of a potential legal problem isn't worth it. 
* Pirated games are infamous for containing viruses.

It also has many current use cases for which it is clearly the most practical solution (gambling, darknet, ransomware, capital flight, and speculation). 

I think that's right.  Really great old comment on this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mb27q/bitcoins_vast_overvaluation_appears_caused_by/cc7i6y8/).  But, in the context of the ""scaling debate,"" all that really does is point out that Bitcoin's current main use cases aren't very fee-sensitive, and thus that the increased fees resulting from the arbitrary 1-MB block size limit aren't *yet* doing that much damage.  Which explains why the [""forking pressure""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4005sq/the_futility_of_efforts_to_block_the_stream/) hasn't yet built up enough to overcome the inertia keeping the 1-MB block size limit in place.

But what that point *doesn't* do is actually justify the 1-MB block size limit. [Here's how I usually put it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ckgb8/roger_ver_on_twitter_high_bitcoin_tx_fees_are/d9xl50p/):

It's **very** unlikely that 1 MB is the ""magic number"" that is getting the current tradeoffs just right (or is even within an order of magnitude of that number). Even if it were, it's essentially impossible that it would **stay** the right number as conditions change (e.g., as technology improves). And to me, it's obvious that an approach like that of Bitcoin Unlimited, which allows the limit to be set in a flexible, emergent (and decentralized) manner, is far superior to the approach of simply following the top-down diktat of a handful of interest-conflicted developers.",2016-12-15 02:26:48

&gt;???: Roger, what's the importance of nodes in the bitcoin network to you?

&gt;RV: So the importance of nodes in bitcoin to me is to provide the redundancy in the blockchain, right? The more copies of the blockchain in the world, the harder it is for someone to say it's a fake copy of the blockchain that undoes certain transactions or whatever. Someone else can say, no, there's thousands of copies. It's not the right one. So the more copies of the blockchain, the more difficult it is for people to censor bitcoin. And the more choices that SPV wallet users have for connecting to nodes. We don't need 100% of the people using hte bitcoin protocol to be running full nodes that implement the protocol.

So when you believe the only purpose of a node is to be redundant file storage and nothing more, of course you will neglect the importance of running one.

db8sigh,rodeopenguin,78,"It is a very complex issue but as simply as I can:

Bitcoin was intended to be digital cash that can be used *just like* cash, either in person or over the internet.  Cash doesn't require a bank or a card or a payment processor.  You can use cash to buy things as large as a house or as small as a stick of gum.  All of these things are true with bitcoin with the added benefit of security, anonymity, and being able to transact online as well as in person.

Two years ago the community started warning about bitcoin needing a basic upgrade in order to continue to grow.  Most were in agreement with this upgrade but a few were not.  The lead mod on r/bitcoin did not want the upgrade.  

This person also happens to own all the other major communication channels for bitcoin online.  So he began censoring and banning all discussion of upgrading bitcoin.  There were several attempts to upgrade the network, but with no communication channels to rally support, they have failed one by one.

The community became divided and many people lost interest with all of the fighting and stagnation.  There was a time when large companies like Microsoft, Dell, and Overstock.com were rapidly adopting the currency.  Now I can't even remember the last time a large company started accepting it.  The momentum is gone.

You might be asking ""Why wouldn't they want to upgrade bitcoin?"".  This is a very complex question.  Basically they believe that upgrading will open up bitcoin to a specific kind of attack.  Many engineers disagree, including a former Google engineer who has since given up on bitcoin.

We can have a disagreement about the upgrade but we should be able to openly discuss it, and that is most peoples main issue the r/bitcoin moderation team.  But they know that if we are allowed to discuss it openly then they wouldn't get their way.",2016-12-16 06:35:14
db92f0f,singularity87,71,"People should get the full story of r/bitcoin because it is probably one of the strangest of all reddit subs.

r/bitcoin, the main sub for the bitcoin community is held and run by a person who goes by the pseudonym u/theymos. Theymos not only controls r/bitcoin, but also bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.com. These are top three communication channels for the bitcoin community, all controlled by just one person.

For most of bitcoin's history this did create a problem (at least not an obvious one anyway) until around mid 2015. This happened to be around the time a new player appeared on the scene, a for-profit company called Blockstream. Blockstream was made up of/hired many (but not all) of the main bitcoin developers. (To be clear, Blockstream was founded before mid 2015 but did not become publicly active until then). A lot of people, including myself, tried to point out there we're some very serious potential conflicts of interest that could arise when one single company controls most of the main developers for the biggest decentralised and distributed cryptocurrency. There were a lot of unknowns but people seemed to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were apparently about to release some new software called ""sidechains"" that could offer some benefits to the network.

Not long after Blockstream came on the scene the issue of bitcoin's scalability once again came to forefront of the community. This issue came within the community a number of times since bitcoins inception. Bitcoin, as dictated in the code, cannot handle any more than around 3 transactions per second at the moment. To put that in perspective Paypal handles around 15 transactions per second on average and VISA handles something like 2000 transactions per second. The discussion in the community has been around how best to allow bitcoin to scale to allow a higher number of transactions in a given amount of time. I suggest that if anyone is interested in learning more about this problem from a technical angle, they go to r/btc and do a search. It's a complex issue but for many who have followed bitcoin for many years, the possible solutions seem relatively obvious. Essentially, currently the limit is put in place in just a few lines of code. This was not originally present when bitcoin was first released. It was in fact put in place afterwards as a measure to stop a bloating attack on the network. Because all bitcoin transactions have to be stored forever on the bitcoin network, someone could theoretically simply transmit a large number of transactions which would have to be stored by the entire network forever. When bitcoin was released, transactions were actually for free as the only people running the network were enthusiasts. In fact a single bitcoin did not even have any specific value so it would be impossible set a fee value. This meant that a malicious person could make the size of the bitcoin ledger grow very rapidly without much/any cost which would stop people from wanting to join the network due to the resource requirements needed to store it, which at the time would have been for very little gain.

Towards the end of the summer last year, this bitcoin scaling debate surfaced again as it was becoming clear that the transaction limit for bitcoin was semi regularly being reached and that it would not be long until it would be regularly hit and the network would become congested. This was a very serious issue for a currency. Bitcoin had made progress over the years to the point of retailers starting to offer it as a payment option. Bitcoin companies like, Microsoft, Paypal, Steam and many more had began to adopt it. If the transaction limit would be constantly maxed out, the network would become unreliable and slow for users. Users and businesses would not be able to make a reliable estimate when their transaction would be confirmed by the network.

Users, developers and businesses (which at the time was pretty much the only real bitcoin subreddit) started to discuss how we should solve the problem r/bitcoin. There was significant support from the users and businesses behind a simple solution put forward by the developer Gavin Andreesen. Gavin was the lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto left bitcoin and he left it in his hands. Gavin initially proposed a very simple solution of increasing the limit which was to change the few lines of code to increase the maximum number of transactions that are allowed. For most of bitcoin's history the transaction limit had been set far far higher than the number of transactions that could potentially happen on the network. The concept of increasing the limit one time was based on the fact that history had proven that no issue had been cause by this in the past.

A certain group of bitcoin developers decided that increasing the limit by this amount was too much and that it was dangerous. They said that the increased use of resources that the network would use would create centralisation pressures which could destroy the network. The theory was that a miner of the network with more resources could publish many more transactions than a competing small miner could handle and therefore the network would tend towards few large miners rather than many small miners. The group of developers who supported this theory were all developers who worked for the company Blockstream. The argument from people in support of increasing the transaction capacity by this amount was that there are always inherent centralisation pressure with bitcoin mining. For example miners who can access the cheapest electricity will tend to succeed and that bigger miners will be able to find this cheaper electricity easier. Miners who have access to the most efficient computer chips will tend to succeed and that larger miners are more likely to be able to afford the development of them. The argument from Gavin and other who supported increasing the transaction capacity by this method are essentially there are economies of scale in mining and that these economies have far bigger centralisation pressures than increased resource cost for a larger number of transactions (up to the new limit proposed). For example, at the time the total size of the blockchain was around 50GB. Even for the cost of a 500GB SSD is only $150 and would last a number of years. This is in-comparison to the $100,000's in revenue per day a miner would be making.

Various developers put forth various other proposals, including Gavin Andresen who put forth a more conservative increase that would then continue to increase over time inline with technological improvements. Some of the employees of blockstream also put forth some proposals, but all were so conservative, it would take bitcoin many decades before it could reach a scale of VISA. Even though there was significant support from the community behind Gavin's simple proposal of increasing the limit it was becoming clear certain members of the bitcoin community who were part of Blockstream were starting to become increasingly vitriolic and divisive. Gavin then teamed up with one of the other main bitcoin developers Mike Hearn and released a coded (i.e. working) version of the bitcoin software that would only activate if it was supported by a significant majority of the network. What happened next was where things really started to get weird.

After this free and open source software was released, Theymos, the person who controls all the main communication channels for the bitcoin community implemented a new moderation policy that disallowed any discussion of this new software. Specifically, if people were to discuss this software, their comments would be deleted and ultimately they would be banned temporarily or permanently. This caused chaos within the community as there was very clear support for this software at the time and it seemed our best hope for finally solving the problem and moving on. Instead a censorship campaign was started. At first it 'all' they were doing was banning and removing discussions but after a while it turned into actively manipulating the discussion. For example, if a thread was created where there was positive sentiment for increasing the transaction capacity or being negative about the moderation policies or negative about the actions of certain bitcoin developers, the mods of r/bitcoin would selectively change the sorting order of threads to 'controversial' so that the most support opinions would be sorted to the bottom of the thread and the most vitriolic would be sorted to the top of the thread. This was initially very transparent as it was possible to see that the most downvoted comments were at the top and some of the most upvoted were at the bottom. So they then implemented hiding the voting scores next to the users name. This made impossible to work out the sentiment of the community and when combined with selectively setting the sorting order to controversial it was possible control what information users were seeing. Also, due to the very very large number of removed comments and users it was becoming obvious the scale of censorship going on. To hide this they implemented code in their CSS for the sub that completely hid comments that they had removed so that the censorship itself was hidden. Anyone in support of scaling bitcoin were removed from the main communication channels. Theymos even proudly announced that he didn't care if he had to remove 90% of the users. He also later acknowledged that he knew he had the ability to block support of this software using the control he had over the communication channels.",2016-12-16 10:17:17

They review more things than it seems anyone could have time to have bought, used, and taken the time to write reviews for. It's doubtful they're not paid, and in fact they often are. Or is someone that's ranting and raving as if they've nothing else going on in their lives trustworthy? Ever notice, especially in politics, how some people seem to comment extensively all day about the same subjects? Are they paid shills and brigaders? The premise behind reddit is that in general good submissions are valued by most people. That means not the few who are brigading. 
* Comment Voting values. Countless comments are downvoted that are relevant, thoughtful, and sincere, because hive-mind stupidity. Suppose anyone's vote counts, but only a fraction, say 1/3, *if they do not comment*. A voter that *responds to a comment* has a value of 2/3. A commenter that starts a thread of discussion, say 2+ comment responders, has a vote value of 1. This or some variation inspires not only a discussion, but a discussion that inspires further discussion. ",2016-12-16 01:34:45

While this was all going on, Blockstream and it's employees started lobbying the community by paying for conferences about scaling bitcoin, but with the very very strange rule that no decisions could be made and nothing complete solutions could be proposed. These conferences were likely strategically (and successfully) created to stunt support for the scaling software Gavin and Mike had released by forcing the community to take a ""lets wait and see what comes from the conferences"" kind of approach. Since no final solutions were allowed at these conferences, they only served to hinder and splinter the communities efforts to find a solution. As the software Gavin and Mike released called BitcoinXT gained support it started to be attacked. Users of the software were attack by DDOS. Employees of Blockstream were recommending attacks against the software, such as faking support for it, to only then drop support at the last moment to put the network in disarray. Blockstream employees were also publicly talking about suing Gavin and Mike from various different angles simply for releasing this open source software that no one was forced to run. In the end Mike Hearn decided to leave due to the way many members of the bitcoin community had treated him. This was due to the massive disinformation campaign against him on r/bitcoin. One of the many tactics that are used against anyone who does not support Blockstream and the bitcoin developers who work for them is that you will be targeted in a smear campaign. This has happened to a number of individuals and companies who showed support for scaling bitcoin. Theymos has threatened companies that he will ban any discussion of them on the communication channels he controls (i.e. all the main ones) for simply running software that he disagrees with (i.e. any software that scales bitcoin). 

As time passed, more and more proposals were offered, all against the backdrop of ever increasing censorship in the main bitcoin communication channels. It finally come down the smallest and most conservative solution. This solution was much smaller than even the employees of Blockstream had proposed months earlier. As usual there was enormous attacks from all sides and the most vocal opponents were the employees of Blockstream. These attacks still are ongoing today. As this software started to gain support, Blockstream organised more meetings, especially with the biggest bitcoin miners and made a pact with them. They promised that they would release code that would offer an on-chain scaling solution hardfork within about 4 months, but if the miners wanted this they would have to commit to running their software and only their software. The miners agreed and the ended up not running the most conservative proposal possible. This was in February this year. There is no hardfork proposal in sight from the people who agreed to this pact and bitcoin is still stuck with the exact same transaction limit it has had since the limit was put in place about 6 years ago. Gavin has also been publicly smeared by the developers at Blockstream and a plot was made against him to have him removed from the development team. Gavin has now been, for all intents an purposes, expelled from bitcoin development. This has meant that all control of bitcoin development is in the hands of the developers working at Blockstream.

There is a new proposal that offers a market based approach to scaling bitcoin. This essentially lets the market decide. Of course, as usual there has been attacks against it, and verbal attacks from the employees of Blockstream. This has the biggest chance of gaining wide support and solving the problem for good.

To give you an idea of Blockstream; It has hired most of the main and active bitcoin developers and is now synonymous with the ""Core"" bitcoin development team. They AFAIK no products at all. They have received around $75m in funding. Every single thing they do is supported by /u/theymos. They have started implementing an entirely new economic system for bitcoin against the will of it's users and have blocked any and all attempts to scaling the network in line with the original vision.

Although this comment is ridiculously long, it really only covers the tip of the iceberg. You could write a book on the last two years of bitcoin. The things that have been going on have been mind blowing. One last thing that I think is worth talking about is the u/bashco's claim of vote manipulation.

The users that the video talks about have very very large numbers of downvotes mostly due to them having a very very high chance of being astroturfers. Around about the same time last year when Blockstream came active on the scene every single bitcoin troll disappeared, and I mean literally every single one. In the years before that there were a large number of active anti-bitcoin trolls. They even have an active sub r/buttcoin. Up until last year you could go down to the bottom of pretty much any thread in r/bitcoin and see many of the usual trolls who were heavily downvoted for saying something along the lines of ""bitcoin is shit"", ""You guys and your tulips"" etc. But suddenly last year they all disappeared. Instead a new type of bitcoin user appeared. Someone who said they were fully in support of bitcoin but they just so happened to support every single thing Blockstream and its employees said and did. They had the exact same tone as the trolls who had disappeared. Their way to talking to people was aggressive, they'd call people names, they had a relatively poor understanding of how bitcoin fundamentally worked. They were extremely argumentative. These users are the majority of the list of that video. When the 10's of thousands of users were censored and expelled from r/bitcoin they ended up congregating in r/btc. The strange thing was that the users listed in that video also moved over to r/btc and spend all day everyday posting troll-like comments and misinformation. Naturally they get heavily downvoted by the real users in r/btc. They spend their time constantly causing as much drama as possible. At every opportunity they scream about ""censorship"" in r/btc while they are happy about the censorship in r/bitcoin. These people are astroturfers. What someone somewhere worked out, is that all you have to do to take down a community is say that you are on their side. It is an astoundingly effect form of psychological attack. It's the exact kind of attack being discussed in this video.

**That is what is so insane about this video. The video is talking about vote manipulation against this list of users. But the actual list of users are the ones doing the damn manipulation. This is how insane the world of information has got. The astrotrufers are being presented as the victims. Its just insane**",2016-12-16 10:17:31

* Showing downvoted comments to counter the vote brigading.  Seems clear that the prefered method to manipulate discussion in the method shown in the video is making sure certain user's comments dissappear under downvotes.

db8wy09,awemany,25,"&gt; First of all: you are changing the serialization format. With an immutable dataset such as bitcoin, this is a very high price to pay because it means that every software will have to support two completely different serialization formats indefinitely. You can never deprecate the existing format.

Although indefinitely might in *theory* mean *forever*, I can imagine that a better serialization format will be used in 99.9% of cases in the future, and at some point most wallets dropping support for it.

If you then come across an arcane, old-type transaction in the old format, your wallet might signal an error and you might want to get an old client fired up to process that transaction - should you deal with that data directly.

But miners and full nodes probably need to support this forever or at least a very long time, yes.

I think we should take some more time (years) to get this right. I think /u/ThomasZander's efforts are promising, but I really think we should think this through.

**But this also is absolutely true for SegWit.** Lets wait until after a blocksize increase and when the dust has settled on this issue and when the space might be (again) more polite and professional and less flamewars are fought.

Lets not rush something that needs support forever, and lets not rush on touching what might be delicate trade-offs between off- and on-chain transactions with SegWit either. More thoughts [here](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-852#post-31878).

In pictures, movies, we see them as ALL working in sweatshops. Maybe that's true for 90% or what not, but 10% of them read and might have access to the internet (made up stats). So a 3rd world 'er who has access to a similarly stylized education as an American will be just as knowledgeable as they are (well relatively).

So there are a LOT of fields that are intellectually driven : Education, Finance, Media, Legal, Politics, Pharmacy, so on. Essentially all fields with average pays of $50 or more are likely intellect driven.

Now these are often what people refer to as 'service' industries. However, I'll just give you one example.

Pretend you start a firm where you offer customized legal review. Someone emails you a paragraph, you respond back with a page of customized analysis, which would cost say $100 for an American lawyer. Now what you do instead is send this to an African who replies and you pay him $1, and sell it to the American for $100 and profit 99%, with perhaps a smidgen of review.

As it applies in this situation, the person I'm speaking of took a service that would ordinarily cost say $10,000 and hired Africans to do it instead. Where as 1 person normally performs 3 of these things a year, she now performs around 30 per year or 1,000% more productivity than the average in her field, while spending less than 1% on the labor required to generate the revenue.

For various reasons, I really can't be more specific, but don't think she was the first to think of it, just the first person I meet who happen to do it from home to escape a shit job, and now is one of the richest people I know, as she's hiring more and more Africans and paying with Bitcoin.",2016-12-16 03:02:23

db8u1q5,theymos,23,"Yeah, it's been clear to me for a long time that Reddit is basically the perfect manipulation platform, and is widely used as such by advertisers, political groups, etc. People *feel* the Reddit groupthink strongly, but the group is very easy to manufacture using vote manipulation and sockpuppets. /r/Bitcoin tries to improve this somewhat with moderation, vote-score hiding, uncollapsed comments, etc., but it's a real uphill battle.

The underlying problem is that Reddit relies on easily-gameable *global* vote scores, and gives moderators no way to defend against bad vote behavior. I see three possible solutions to this problem:

* Prevent votes from being manipulated. This seems very difficult or impossible, and you still end up with the problem where the actual voter pool becomes mismatched from the intended voter pool. For example, Reddit has seen that some readers of /r/all do not appreciate the mostly-legitimate upvotes of /r/The_Donald submissions. Similarly, many subreddits are created to be serious, but then they eventually find that their voting pool becomes filled with people who appreciate funny articles/comments more than serious ones, resulting in ordering other than what the community's original population intended.
* Make voting scores non-global by changing them so that they are calculated based on a per-user web of trust. For example, the system might automatically create a level-0 trust list for you by taking the list of everyone you've upvoted more than 5 separate times, and then recursively building up a trust network by going through their trust lists. Only votes by people in your trust network would count. If you go down many levels (4-7), your trust network will be very large even if your level-0 trust list is quite small. This would make manipulation much more difficult, and it also makes vote scores and voting more meaningful. Although trust networks would be very large, it is possible that people would end up somewhat insulated from very different opinions in this system, but to be honest I think that this is what most Reddit users want, even if they wouldn't admit it; voting/ranking of any kind is probably incompatible with serious and challenging discussions.
* Give moderators more editorial control so that they can defend against vote manipulation more actively. For example, moderators could manually order submissions/comments, and give them flair denoting them as ""helpful"" or whatever. Obviously this would not be good if you want an environment of totally-free discussion (for that, elimination of voting or the above idea are better), but in many cases it'd still result in useful communities.",2016-12-16 07:06:29

db89o73,eeksskee,23,"No.  There is this FUD narrative that ETH is not in China and ETC will win there.  It's FUD that is used to market ETC to the FOMO crowd.

In fact, the opposite is true.

* ETH already has a $5mm ICO that happened in China for [Firstblood](https://firstblood.io/sale/).  The only ICO in ETC so far was [the BorgDAO](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1611845.0) and that was a scam that rested on telling people they could port over ETH Dapps to ETC -- I don't use scam lightly, they have disappeared after raising a bunch of money from BTC and ETC holders.  I wouldn't be surprised if the same thing happened to whoever invested in the DaemonDAO which got the ETC sub excited.

* Shanghai hosted ETH's Devcon2. 

* There are numerous ETH devs and miners in China and always have been.

* Hell, Vitalik is fluent in mandarin and his GF is from China.

There is no ""go straight to ETC.""  The people developing Ethereum are developing on ETH and supporting the ETH chain.  The people ""developing ETC"" are literally copy and pasting that ETH development onto ETC the best they can, with some mistakes here or there as the code diverges.  They haven't even caught any of the bugs or mistakes that ETH has dealt with.  Besides the fact that copy pasta will only get harder and harder for the ETC maintainers, they are also not adding anything of value to date.  They jawbone immutability and are focused on ""monetary policy.""  As an ETH ICO investor what they choose to talk about the most indicates they don't understand what the point of Ethereum is and think it should just be the same as Bitcoin.  A losing battle if there ever was one.

If you think the point of Ethereum is ""monetary policy"" than you should just buy Bitcoin instead, whose existence is defined by its status as money.  ETH is a platform for Dapps to interact with other Dapps and benefit from network effects of that ecosystem.  It may never work and it may never happen but that has been the vision since day 1.  If that vision happens, ETH will be the de facto reserve currency of that ecosystem which will give it reliable intrinsic value.  It's very speculative and may never happen.  ETC is an attempt to recast Ethereum as Bitcoin -- which is to say, it has no point right now.

**Decision tree**: 

* If you want sound money in the form of cryptocurrency, buy Bitcoin. Undisputed sound money king right now.
 
* [If you believe Dapps will be a thing](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@eeks/synergistic-dapp-block-chain-party-my-ethereum-eth-investment-thesis), then buy or follow ETH because it has 99% of all Dapp development and it will not be easy to switch them to other platforms or to copy/paste their code onto ETC because they are a mix of code and real world services.  Dapps so far seem like they will take at least 2-3 years from start to actual launch, if they ever launch at all or ever happen at all.  So all the Dapps that are closest to launch and whose tokens are on ETH, are on ETH and that isn't changing.  Augur, Digix, Maker, Gnosis, FirstBlood, Plutus, Iconomi, et cetera,  The Dapps that will be on ETC or declared for ETC -- you won't see those launch for 2-3 years from now.  ETH has a multiyear lead on Dapp development, a dominant lead in security, price and community, hell even based on reddit sub growth.  These are tough advantages for a copy and pasted coin to overcome.  We'll see.  The best thing they could do is something different but to date they retain the name, a confusingly similar logo, and are just copy/pasting ETH code.

* If you believe in FOMO or think ""monetary policy = 21mm coins = moon,"" buy ETC this second.  I have 800 other alt coins with fixed coin limits that you can also buy, including DGD, MKR, 1ST, SNGLS, REP and many other tokens on ETH.  If it's that simple, these tokens should be worth 10x more, no?  They all have fixed supply.  On inflation incidentally, when ETH switches to POS (which ETC apparently doesn't want to do), the monetary policy of ETH will be borderline deflationary and the supply will likely inflate less than ETC for the next several years.  

A lot of this jawboning about ETC (""immutability,"" ""sound money,"" ""monetary policy"") is a bit nonsensical.  Worse it has nothing to do with value-adding technological progress.  Ethereum of any variant (ETH, ETC, Expanse) is worthless unless the tech adds value and innovates and works.  The ETH devs (the Ethereum Foundation and Eth Core) are focused on that, specifically making ETH scale (sharding, POS), making it have innovative security (POS), making it have anonymity (ZKsnarks), adding the prereq lite wallets, UI improvements, et cetera.  Their development has an unrelenting release cadence.  The ETC devs and leaders are focused on ""monetary policy"" and misleading announcements (too numerous to list but suffice to say when they announced that MSFT had invested in ETC that was a bunch of bullshit designed to pump the price and not true).

I own BTC and ETH, having mined the former in 2011-2013 and participated in the latter's ICO.  I sold all my ETC at much higher levels than today and used the proceeds to buy ETH Dapp tokens.",2016-12-16 00:22:21

dbb1up3,Mr_Yukon_C,53,"&gt; Is there an aircraft hanger where thousands of bitcoiners dredge the internet for Ethereum comments and reply the same day with negative comments such as: ...

Pretty much, yes.

You have to realize, there is a LOT of money tied up in Bitcoin (a failing technology, BTW).

*Most* of that money is from low-information ""investors"" who haven't done their homework and likely bought into it because they heard of or saw somebody else doing it, or because a trusted source advised them to.

Beyond that, they see gains (for now) and aren't interested in hearing about the *true* underlying problems that are literally crippling BTC's future.

Along comes Ethereum which on both paper *and* in practice, does *everything* that Bitcoin does, and then a whole lot more.  So defensiveness ensues (along with outright attacks) in the form of what you describe in your submission text.

That being said, no crypto that makes its way to becoming ""mainstream"" is going to do so without passing through trial after trial of fire.

TheDAO was not an Ethereum protocol problem.  It was 2 lines of flawed contract code that were exploited and allowed for the funds of TheDAO to be *stolen*.

6 months is a long time in crypto, and that's how long it has been.  It's pretty far in the past and I personally would answer ""no"" TheDAO is absolutely NOT giving Ethereum a hangover.

There are certainly BTC people that wish that were the case.  But the reality is, any worthwhile emerging technology (which is what Ethereum *really* is) is going to find its own way through the boom -&gt; bust -&gt; boom -&gt; bust -&gt; ad infinitum cycle.

When we're in a ""bust"" phase, all of the BTC people who fear Ethereum will attempt to persuade anyone willing to listen that TheDAO proves Ethereum is useless.

Amazingly, during the booms those same people are nowhere to be found.  Funny how that works, isn't it?

dbajp0p,papabitcoin,19,"&gt; There is nothing more dysfunctional about it than an order book at an exchange sitting with open limit orders.

Are you really as thick as you appear to be by repeating this nonsense? Seriously!  Large numbers of people can execute their positions on an exchange by altering their buy or sell price.  On bitcoin however due to **inelastic supply** if lots of people alter their fees still only a few of them make it into the next block/s.  People observing this may then add transactions with fees even higher - this leads to fee escalation in an unpredictable manner.  Moreover, people wanting to take a position on an exchange can execute their trade ""at market"" knowing that their trade will go through - or if they are not in a hurry and looking for the best price they can set a limit.  There is no ""At market"" fee for bitcoin as for one thing you never know when a block will be discovered and you never know what fees for new transactions will occur.

&gt; Segwit is the only widely deployed, tested, and ready to go solution for that.

Yes the concerted fud campaign and attacks on anybody who tried to go a different direction have been very effective - haven't they?  Just because something is ready to go doesn't mean it is a good choice.  We have had months of unnecessary congestion and confusion which could have been avoided.

I dispute the article you linked to.  They even talk about potentially bitcoin needs to be inflationary in the future.  No!  We are a considerable distance from no more block rewards.  It is quite possible that block rewards will continue to increase for beyond the next couple of halvings as bitcoin price rises.  Not only that, even with adjustable block size limit such as BUs I still think that eventually the number of transactions desired to be transacted on the chain will exceed the physical contraints on the newtork - but by the time this happens we will be in a much better position to deal with this - layer 2 solutions will be bedded in and, we will probably have far better ideas for how fees should be managed.  Harking back to your exchange example - you know ahead of time what brokerage you will be paying before you execute a trade on an exchange.  In order to have a more functional bitcoin there may be better ways for miners to set their base fees so that people don't end up with stuck transactions - more research and thinking needs to be done.",2016-12-17 10:37:59

As for the DAO yes I never see Ethereum mentioned outside this sub or the main Ethereum sub without seeing the DAO mentioned: that is perhaps fair but what really has happened as a result of the DAO is much more nuanced than is what is usually portrayed by mainstream writers (or Fudders).

The narrative goes the DAO was a disaster and caused Ethereum to crash.

Well yes, but a more complete story is that the DAO caused Ethereum to become much much stronger with improved best practices, better tools, solidity language development and so on.

The a more complete picture is that big dapps like gnosis, augur, and Digix have been delayed by the DAO.

We don't have a good way to measure this right now, but I think everyone would agree that the current situation is abysmally failing in this regard.

Additionally, the IBD costs continually increase faster than technological improvement handling them. Calculations show that in order to keep IBD costs the same, *after* taking into account tech improvements, the average block size should be no greater than 300k.

Current legitimate on-chain demand is indeed far in excess of 300k (I estimate about 650k-750k average per block), so clearly we cannot simply cap the block size to 300k today. But similarly, increasing the block size when we don't need to is somewhat foolish and risks Bitcoin's long-term survival. It is an acceptable risk, which is why most people are willing to accept it as a compromise, but it would objectively be better not to do it. Hopefully miners will avoid increasing the de-facto (ie, soft-limit) block size even after segwit activates.

(Note that once Lightning goes live and starts to acquire usage, we may see a substantial drop in block-space demand, perhaps bringing Bitcoin below the 300k marker at least temporarily. But that is still yet to be demonstrated in practice.)",2016-12-17 13:39:13

I will again try to provide some useful TA for you. Although it might not reflect your approach to trading/investing, it might still be useful as an orientation point for price action. 

**BTC/EUR:**

https://i.imgur.com/V7XatoV.png

In trading, there really is nothing more irritating than someone clinging to an opinion that is constantly falsified by reality. In my previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/5hiztz/daily_discussion_10dec2016/db0zqo5/), I have argued that the bears should be winning a decisive battle @~735€, putting the trendline on the daily in jeopardy. Well, apparently I was wrong according to reality (i.e., charts), so I was that fool for at least two weeks. The bullish outcome of this battle is that the trend, measured by the ADX, is recovering and looking to accelerate (1, red curve). Why is this important? It is important because an accelerating trend gives room for bearish corrections on the 4H charts, which still are in compliance with the bullish daily charts. This, in turn, is important because you should not be afraid of corrections that still respect the daily trendline (2). There is now room for possible corrections that can only be healthly for bullish price dynamics. In fact, I think a correction is order soon, since we are entering overbought territory on the daily RSI. This is a very bullish sign, since it means that the bearish RSI divergence was cancelled (3). Due to these potential corrections, leveraged traders should tread this area with caution. I conclude that we are still in an uptrend, in a healthier one than the upswing in June that left buyers exhausted and caused the Bitcoin market to crash due to a minor BFX issue (4). 

**TLDR: Slightly bullish (with possible corrections)**

**ETH/EUR:**

https://i.imgur.com/AWblAKh.png

With a cap to the upside of the recent ETH bounce, the season for catching falling knives has reopened and everybody is invited to try their luck! I think that we are entering a pretty important consolidation zone, which should decide whether we will retest the 8€ resistance (1) or fall down to the 7€ support line (2). Looking at the uncannily accurate daily trendline (as recently posted by /u/Arbitrage84 a few times), I think it will be difficult to challenge this current trend, which is quantified by an ADX of ~55 (3, red curve). A bullish trend reversal takes some time and is bound to fail numerous times. However, I am not expecting a crash to new lows in the next week, but to continue meandering in the 6.80€-8€ area for some time. If this ranging acitvity confirms, then this could be a good accumulation spot for holders, but probably can give a lot of false signals to daytraders. 

**TLDR: Sideways, bearish bias**

**XMR/BTC:**

https://i.imgur.com/1aYP5Tt.png

Well, well, the cool kid seems to have trouble passing the tests at the end of the semester. After the major release (https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/5i5wvd/monero_v0101_wolfram_warptangent_released/), the teachers rebuke the disappointing upside price action &amp; volumes. XMR bounced off the new intermediate resistance @0.011 quite handily (1). To make matters even worse, XMR is starting to get bullied by ETC &amp; FCT, which show bull(y)ish volume signatures and some profitable price swings. I am not sure what is going on with XMR, but it looks like an overall declining interest in the coin, at least until the next major release in January. Unfortunately, until then I do not see how XMR is going to retain it's alpha status on the schoolyard ... maybe easy access to DNMs is not so good after all? I don't know what I can analyze here, after all it's just going sideways. But with such a low trend, the next breakout should be a major one.

**TLDR: Disoriented, looking for its purpose**

**Wildcard: ICN/BTC**

https://i.imgur.com/N85u7p2.png

I saw that many of you have interest in the ICN coin. I have taken a look at it and I am not very fond of the recent price action on the daily. It looks like the bullish trend is heavily challenged and I think that a bearish bias has been installed by a broken triangle (1). However, I think that this bearish bias is going to be challenged during the major release of the funding platform in the next days (20.12.). I expect a good bounce from the current levels to the upward bounds of the declining daily trendline. But I think the double top (2) is pretty much confirmed and should constitute a major resistance zone. Concerning the fundamentals of this coin, I am not sold on the portfolio, which caps Bitcoin at 15% and has some questionable entries (LSK, STEEM), see https://medium.com/iconominet/detailed-iconomi-cryptocurrencies-index-icnx-update-8ed2b0158665#.oya3cnbrt . Also, a rebalancing of the portfolio on a monthly basis, in my opinion, is too slow to adjust to the heavy weekly swings in the cryptomarket. Despite these obvious problems and the resulting underperformance of the ICNX fund, I did not read a lot of criticism here yet. I think a beginning bear market will incite some discussion about this.

You don't need a stroke to forget something.

If you key is not long and generated by a cryptographically strong random process then it will be cracked by brainwallet crackers.

There are very very few situations where relaying on a memorized (or worse, human generated) bitcoin key is prudent.  Instead, generate a key strongly and store multiple copies on durable media. You can encrypt those copies with an easily remembered passphrase that some trusted friends and family also know (or which you've recorded elsewhere).

While that sounds kind of similar it is massively more secure: some guy in china with a FPGA farm can't crack that (doesn't have the encrypted data). And it's much harder to forget (and if you do forget, you can potentially get it cracked yourself).

The only time memorization should be used are basically spy movie plots... emigrating illegally across a war zone and you need to travel with nothing because you expect to be caught and searched...   and even then, you could hide a backup back where you came from so there would be a chance of recovery if you did forget it.

With Bitcoin, you hold the money on your own computer, so you don't have to completely trust a for-profit corporation with your money and to decide reasonable rules. Right now cash is being phased out across the world, our payments are being increasingly done digitally, plastic cards will disappear over time too. Even without Bitcoin, they eventually won't be able to hold/touch it. It's a logical evolution, change is just difficult for people.


2. **sending of money to long user- unfriendly addresses to be a bit overwhelming**: **SHOW THEM**. Pull our your smartphone, scan one of their QR codes and let them to see the money transfer in real-time. That blows any arguments out of the water. Additionally you can show them a simple address book in one of the wallets, or something simple like a Coinbase wallet link.


3. **the fact that no one can understand the open source Bitcoin code makes them not trust it.**: Your family probably **uses the Internet every single day**, without fundamentally understanding how it technically works. Still, **they trust it** with their personal information, sending of money, pictures, private conversations,... **ask them why**. If they can't give you a decent answer, you can explain to them that nobody is in control of the Internet. The rules are created and developed by smart people from all over the world and then made publicly available for people to review and challenge. Changing those rules is very hard, as it requires a large democratic vote to change them. This is still hard for people to trust, but you need to give them time to let it sink in. With the Internet the threshold was low, if your information gets stolen, it sucks but most people care less. However if your money is lost or stolen, that's a much bigger deal to people and they will be far more reluctant.


Hopefully that helps a bit.",2016-12-18 18:23:16

If we take lightning network out of the equation, segwit alone is not a long term solution. It serves as a solution for a few years (at best), before once again an ""old fashioned blocksize increase"" again becomes our best solution.
segwit is gambling new, additional technical debt and new real-world-untested risk for the promise that a better scaling solution would exist in the future (which is largely today promoted as lightning network -- which I am very skeptical against because LN is either centralized, and becomes regulated(which many users don't want), or decentralized, which requires a blockchain, much like Bitcoin, and is like a new Bitcoin within Bitcoin that would have to pass the test of the time, and doesn't really add anything besides creating another layer of complexity (and vulnerability).

* There is no guarantee that once the bitcoin is transferred that the seller will actually follow through on a promise. If you add in escrow services and government enforcement, you basically have a standard bank.

* Without a central bank to manage things, bitcoin can tank in value overnight because of the actions of just a few people.

If there were an agreement with the other miners that they would switch to larger blocks provided someone else ""went first"" then it could happen quickly and safely with no long term effect.  And if there was reluctance to be the first mover and bear the brunt of orphans, I don't think this amounts to much in the scheme of things, since a few orphan blocks would be more than offset by the subsequent growth of bitcoin.

dbf49ep,redrick_schuhart,72,"Hmmm, this is worrying. I've been lurking in various places following this so here's my explanation of what's been going on:

It's widely theorized that Julian Assange was rendered on October 16/17. This triggered a Dead Man's Switch - an automatic release of Phase 3 of Wikileaks leaks this year. But to prevent tampering with the information, he's hidden the information in the Bitcoin blockchain. As well as transaction information, Bitcoin allows you to include files in a transaction. So what happened is:

- Julian didn't check in by Friday
- Wikileaks automatically spent nearly all of its bitcoins sending payments around the network
- included in those payments were damning leaks on - I believe - 9/11 and Tavistock. 

Because of the way Bitcoin works, those leaks have now been replicated to every single box on the network that 'mines' or verifies transactions. The blockchain is basically a giant ledger of every transaction that's ever been made. It's a big file (100Gb) made of blocks that the whole network needs to verify (I'm skipping the details a bit). The point is that no one entity is large enough to take over the whole Bitcoin network because it requires too much processing power. This means that the blockchain is a place where you can store things that a) cannot be deleted and b) cannot be tampered with. Cablegate was released like this and is still there of course, encrypted and split up over many transactions. 

So what a bunch of groups have been doing is scanning the blockchain for transactions originating from and to Wikileaks from Oct 17 to Oct 29 to see if they can find the files and the instructions for decoding them. It's like putting a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle together where there are tens of thousands of other unrelated pieces in the pile. However they have been making progress. But the closer they get, the more people seem to disappear and the more threads get deleted. And now endchan itself is unavailable.

We are talking about insane growth and insane benefits from this technology, even if fees go up 10x again next year.

After a discussion yesterday, I'd like to bring back the topic of counterparty risk. Because I see new people coming in, I'd like to inform them that leaving your money to someone else, be it a bank, an exchange, a darknet market, a borrower etc etc, you face the risk of never getting your money back!

In Bitcoin there have been many hacks, ponzis, scams which have affected it price very negatively.

Some of the most famous ones where : Bitcoinica, Mt. Gox, BTCe, Poloniex, BitStamp, Cryptsy, Shapeshift, Gatecoin, Bitfinex, BTER, Vircurex, Mintpal, Bitpay, Cavirtex, Bitquick, the DAO, Bittrex, cloud mining scams, p2p lending, Darknet markets exit scamming/getting bust etc. The way they were hacked varied, some didn't lose customer funds, others refunded them, others lost altcoins etc, but the danger of losing everything is still there. 

Coinbase has had problems with the IRS demanding customer info, Cryptsy lawsuit because they helped Cryptsy's CEO steal and cash out customer funds, freezing accounts for gambling etc, not giving customer's Ethereum Classic after the Fork and so on. 

Some of the 'old guys' know about all that and prefer to stay safe. Others keep risking it. Just be the smart guy! Very few people profit from trading or arbitrage! Do you think you are in the 10-20% of people that constantly make money trading? Chances are you aren't... In a year you could have made more than 2-3x just by holding your coins in a private wallet!

Some people were lending money at Bitfinex to earn interest (more than 10% per year). Guess what happened to them... They initially lost 36% and then it went down to 18% due to BFX's clever trick. And some people just kept USD in that exchange thinking nobody could take it from them. 

Don't get distracted by high yields by any altcoin like Dash, Nubits, Lending Club or Cloud mining scheme. 90-100% of all those are scams or just unable to keep their promises. Some people might have profited, but on the expense of others, and in total, more people lost than gained.

And you are going to ask me: What if I want to sell or buy some coins? How do I do it? Well, nowadays there are many ways where you can do that safely. Might not very cheap, but these are probably some of the best ways to do it :

Localbitcoin, Bitcoin.de, Paxful, Wallofcoins, BitBargain, Bitsquare, Tether (Omni Dex), Mycelium local trader, Purse.io, itBit, Gemini or  Glidera, are some ways where you can buy coins with very little counterparty risk and OTC. If you'd still insisted in trading, BTCC and Kraken are currently the best exchanges!

The best way to buy coins would be to buy them with your debit/credit card and get them sent to your private wallet instantly! Some exchanges/services that I know are Glidera, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Bitx, Coinsbank and CEX.io. There might be others, but I don't know how good they are (I never buy with credit cards btw).

I once deposited coins and sold them on Kraken and within 1 day I had my Euros in my SEPA account. Selling coins is riskier and the only 100% safe way, is to exchange BTC with cash with someone that you trust.

Edit : I used to sell coins via Localbitcoin a few years ago. I would buy from an exchange and sell it for more there. After some time, I stopped using Localbitcoins. I had a small customer base, which I trusted and they trusted me. I'd work simply with bank deposits. At some point I trusted them and they trusted me so much, that I would send them the coins even the day before they'd make the deposit. I never had a single problem.

But, I had problems when I started... I sold coins on Localbitcoins and someone tricked me on my first trade and I released the coins. I also had a problem when I sold coins with Paypal. I was young and naive, but luckily I didn't lose more than 200£. For selling you might need to do some KYC or use services like Moneypolo, OkPay and Perfect money. Avoid services where someone can reverse a transaction. These services are great for sellers, but as a buyer you might lose your money if you get hacked.

It isn't just about the exchanges getting hacked. What if you get hacked? Someone could easily steal all your details and even if you had 2FA on, they could steal your funds (something extremely hard to do, maybe impossible, if you had a hardware wallet.

Finally, arbitrage isn't that profitable. The probability of one exchange getting hacked is lower than the probability of one out of five exchange being hacked. So you have to expect losses from at least one exchange... Bitstamp, BTCe and Poloniex made their customers whole again and that's very honorable, but how many more blows can they take? What if they lose altcoins and they take the route of socialised losses? ",2016-12-20 21:17:28

on the last page it states at 5:24 am (what appears to me to be) that they have discovered (potentially) a discussion that was (potentially) between JA and Satoshi? Which was talking about hiding files in the (74,000) blocks on genesis. 

It appears (again catching up to speed) That the conversation was over storing large amounts of data and Bitcoin was in dissidence over them using the blockchain to store the files. (due to bitcoins infancy). (didn't want to take the heat) as that would destroy them too early in the game. 

This led JA to state: NO not the files themselves Just the hashes. 

At which point the lights went out. 


Others can judge. It is the final page of the 39 page archive, and I can't say this with validity. However that text string likely (was enough) to kill the website, being the potential magnitude of the working groups discovery;

- Oct 21st: Largest DDoS attack to ever occur on US internet. Wikileaks tweets to imply the attack originates from its supporters, asking them to stop. No evidence supports claim. (Note: Oct 21st is the first Friday after Julian Assange went missing)
 
- Oct 26th: 4chan users successfully successfully decode their first message in Wikileak's blockchain(bitcoin). The blockchain is blocked with fees and 43000 unconfirmed transactions appear in the mempool.

That DDoS attack took down the DyN DNS service provider. Afterwards there was a bullshit story about how some insecure Chinese-made internet cameras were exploited to do it. Then the blockchain was clogged with high transaction fees, somewhere around $10 if I remember correctly. 

Both of these events point to massive state-sponsored attacks to prevent the Dead Man's Switch from activating. That 4chan thread was quickly deleted. So was the 8chan one.

Quadratic != Exponential. I see this all the time in semi-technical articles. People use ""exponential"" to mean ""super-linear"" as in more than linear growth. Maybe it seems irrelevant, and maybe for some purposes it is, but the difference between quadratic and exponential is gigantic. Doubling the users in Bitcoin should increase the price approximately 4 times, which is awesome. It should not square the price, which would be outrageous.

The genius of this approach is that it eliminates the take-it-or-leave-it black-and-white 1st generation voting mechanism that Satoshi left us with which has been Bitcoins political Achilles heel. Let me explain. 

Satoshi explained that proof of work could serve as a sybil-discouraging voting mechanism. Many of us loved Bitcoin for that aspect of it: voting incentives are strongly biased to favor only code changes that result in greater economic utility and efficiency.

However the binary decision logic employed in the first gen code (a block is always either completely valid else it is completely invalid) creates a too-powerful disincentive to mine a ""challenger block"" for other miners to ""vote on with their hashpower"".

But the boolean logic makes no engineering sense. For example the network has no way of differentiating how it reacts to these blocks: 

1. A 1.001 MB block

2. A 1 GB block 

3. A block that pays the miner 200 BTC

All of these are held to be ""equally valid / invalid"" under the current consensus logic. Clearly they are not all equally objectionable!

What is needed is a way for nodes to express more fine grained control over their voting logic. Your approach represents a very elegant way of empowering the users with the ability to do more than simply accept or reject, but to *express fine-grained preferences.* ",2016-12-20 03:39:08

&gt; in 16 years, the block reward is down to less than a bitcoin per reward…. 16 years is MUCH smaller than 100 years

And that same Bitcoin would be very valuable if Bitcoin was able to grow in that same timespan. Replacing the current mining reward with tx fees is also weird btw, because who knows that level of security we need. The fact that we pay $1,500,000 per day to secure bitcoin does **not** mean we actually need it. 

The weird thing is that the same people who want the blocksize limit, also claim that 1 Bitcoin can reach millions and take over the dollar. That kinda needs bitcoin to grow in price. Does a factor 2 every four years sound ok to you? ;)

&gt; there would always be a fee market

Pretty sure John also says the same thing. The thing we are fighting is an artificial fee market. Pushed by censorship and attacks by the likes of you. 

A fee of zero, can be the result of a fee market. 

&gt; Having a myriad of pools does not equate to having a myriad of independent mining hardware operators.

And a mining operator would be smart to not even let himself control the hashing power. As that would be highly unprofessional and very risky. His investors (or his own wallet) depend on a miner not to be that stupid. 

You falsely believe that Bitcoin is secured by decentralised mining. I assure you: it is not. 

Miners being centralised is entirely self-reported. You could be none-the-wiser if they choose to hide their identities. 

No. In reality Bitcoin is secure because of incentives. A bit sad that you censor the biggest Bitcoin forum while you don't actually understand Bitcoin.

&gt; As I stated, irrationality and speculation rule the price.

Yes, and the more you kill bitcoins utility, the more that will become a reality. Which will turn it into a bubble. 

You are promoting more irrationality, with the reasoning that the market is already irrational. 

DOES NOT COMPUTE

&gt; An ability, through encryption, to replace and supersede password based authentication through a challenge/response mechanism (sign/verify) without risking the integrity of the private key that controls such funds.

What does that have to do with Bitcoin? You think the rest of the world runs on password? 

&gt; as more entrants get into bitcoin, more technologists and entreprenuers build solutions to utilize bitcoin

Nope. People are actively pushed out of Bitcoin. Developers and businesses will choose alt-coins which do support a reasonable scaling plan. 

You think /r/btc is devoid of developers? The list of people pissed of is growing and growing. And you are one of the instigators. 

&gt; $10K bitcoin while fun to fantasize about is infeasible.  Many institutional investors and profit motivated holders will exit as we approach this rate, causing a price equilibrium.

Wait, what? That is not even that much higher. 

Maybe you are tearing Bitcoin down to be right? Self fulfilling prophecy much?

You are plagued by ""unknown unknowns"". Just ponder that for a minute.

They're all shills! They must be getting paid!""

You understand C++. You understand cryptography. You understand non-disclosure agreements signed with people paid by central bankers. But you apparently don't understand much else.

You don't understand yourself. You don't understand certain important aspects of Bitcoin - the ones involving markets and economics. You don't understand people. You don't understand me. 

The fact that *you are blind to your own blindness* merely heightens the hubris.

You're digging yourself into a hole, Greg. It's literally the only thing you know how to do. Oh, we all ""get it"" now. It is who you are.

The mess you've created for yourself and the people around you involves issues which you will never be able to understand. Issues involving real people in the real world. And issues involving who you are.

There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with you, carrying on the way you have for the past few years - when instead you could have been a hero if you had just said, ""OK fine, let's do 4 MB blocks, to keep everybody happy. [I already said the tech would work fine with bigger blocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4jzf05/even_a_year_ago_i_said_i_though_we_could_probably/) - and it's more important to keep the community together and moving forward, rather than getting 100% of my preferences.""

But... uh-oh... That means the reason you're refusing to support 4 MB blocks has to do with *you* - not with AXA.

Again, these are things which you are apparently *constitutionally* unable to see - and even ""unable to see that you're unable to see"". 

Unknown unknowns.

Bear in mind - this is a *mathematician* dissing you.

But some mathematicians know a bit of Zen - they know enough to know enough about *themselves.*

Do you know anything about *yourself?* Quite frankly, you don't seem to.

Self-awareness is one of the most important things there is. Nobody can know everything - but if you know what you *don't know* - then at least you can make allowances for your blind spots. It's fine to have blind spots - as long as you know where they are. This is one of the main benefits of self-awareness - knowing not only your strengths, but also your weaknesses. 

Maybe a person knows they don't know how to cook. So they don't cook for a dinner party, and there's no problem.

In all honesty, you don't seem to know much about economics. It's quite different from mathematics - it looks somewhat mathematical (indeed many economists want to be mathematical) - but it involves a lot of sociology as well. Nassim Taleb expressed this very well - when he pointed out how economic models often failed in the ""real world"".

One of your main problems is that you are attempting to do economic central planning for Bitcoin. You're attempting to impose centrally planned blocksize (which is too small relative to the actual technology in the real world), which is leading to centrally planned fees (which are too high relative to the actual market in the real world) - **and your arrogant ineptitude in this area is really starting to fuck up Bitcoin.** 

In the grand scheme of things, this is an innocent fuckup which anyone could make. Because there are plenty of people who don't know much about economics. Even many economists don't know much about economics. It's ok. But fortunately, we still have markets, which set prices, and which set money velocity (transaction throughput) - even though many economists would be incapable of centrally planning these kinds of things.

And here's where your fuckup becomes fatal. You don't know much about economics - but you apparently *don't know that you don't know* much about economics. You're trying to do central planning for several parameters of Bitcoin - the size of its blocks and its fees - when this is something which almost no economist would attempt to do in any other market. Most markets do not have their throughput and prices determined by ""some guy"". These things are determined by ""a few million guys"" - all the people participating in that (decentralized, permissionless) market.

This is probably the main problem most people have with you. I've told you repeatedly over the years that I think you're good at C++ and crypto. It's not a backhanded comment. I know enough about those areas to know when I've met someone who knows a *lot* about those areas - and I know you do.

But you don't know much about economics - and you don't know that you don't know much about economics - and here you are, trying to be the central planner for what could turn out to be the most important economic system in the history of the world - and most of what you've been doing has been to destroy the system that Satoshi made - and now you're even engaging in this weird ""tell"" (a term from poker terminology) where you can't even bring yourself to say the guy's name: Satoshi.

We all see this. But you don't. Which is why we've been yelling and yelling and yelling and yelling at you for these past few years. Not because we're ""getting paid"". Hell, there are better ways to make money than arguing with you till we're blue in the face. Nobody would do it for mere money.

Bitcoin transactions demand a variety of resources from nodes, including disk storage, bandwidth, RAM, and CPU processing power, and increasing blocksize increases the demands on all these things (in an especially dramatic way for CPU time without segwit). [A study of the issue](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf) has shown that ~4MB blocks is the highest Bitcoin could go without kicking ~10% of existing nodes off the network outright just because of network propagation times (and these nodes would just barely be able to keep up--catching up would likely be impossible). Thanks to the N² signature hashing problem (which is fixed with segwit), even 2MB blocks open Bitcoin up to attacks that could leave nodes stuck verifying single blocks for over an hour. UTXO set growth is also a big concern long-term--the more it grows, the more nodes need to cache in RAM to attempt to remain operational. Larger blocks increase the rate at which this set can grow, and the current costing structure generally makes it undesirable to combine multiple inputs to ""clean up"" the UTXO set. Segwit addresses UTXO concerns through its new costing, which makes inputs significantly cheaper than outputs.

As far as I can tell, Core is not opposing big blocks because of some desire to centrally control the fee market, but because *they don't want the Bitcoin network to crash and burn*. Without many of their previous improvements to Bitcoin (like libsecp256k1 speeding up verification 7-fold or whatever it was), the network would already be exploding. You can argue about the economics all you want, but if the underlying software is broken, then Bitcoin doesn't just not work well--it doesn't work at all.",2016-12-21 07:03:03

dbh51xq,ydtm,86,"The Conclusion is epic - and could serve as an excellent TL;DR:

&gt; **Segregated Witness is the most radical and irresponsible protocol upgrade Bitcoin has faced in its eight year history. The push for the SW soft fork puts Bitcoin miners in a difficult and unfair position to the extent that they are pressured into enforcing a complicated and contentious change to the Bitcoin protocol, without community consensus or an honest discussion weighing the benefits against the costs. The scale of the code changes are far from trivial — nearly every part of the codebase is affected by SW.**

&gt; **While increasing the transaction capacity of Bitcoin has already been significantly delayed, SW represents an unprofessional and ineffective solution to both transaction malleability and scaling. As a soft fork, SW introduces more technical debt to the protocol and fundamentally fails to achieve its design purpose. As a hard fork, combined with real on-chain scaling, SW can effectively mitigate transaction malleability and quadratic signature hashing. Each of these issues are too important for the future of Bitcoin to gamble on SW as a soft fork and the permanent baggage that comes with it.**

I bought with little over $1200 (2-3 month salaries for most people in my country - Slovakia) on Bitstamp for $139/BTC. It went to $266 in just 5 days AND then started crashing. I was in disbelieve because I couldn't imagine this thing could crash because it kept rising since January when we talked about it with coworkers.

You couldn't do shit at the time of the crash because the whole platform was lagged. Looking at my trade history on Bitstamp I see that I sold at $233 (not bad right?). It started rising from there suddenly (a dead cat bounce which I haven't heard of back then) so being a rookie I bought back at $238 (the top of the cat) and shat my pants as it kept crashing again. I somehow managed to escape at $159 after almost 2 hours of frantically hitting that refresh button (I wasn't the only one I suppose). Worst 2 hours of my life.

I was so exhausted, with a very little money left so I just cried like a little bitch (I was 24).

dbgse8t,petertodd,56,"You know, one of the things that I found during my time in Kenya is that many Kenyans find it insulting how so many westerners assume that all Kenyans are subsistence level poor, or that the only problems worth solving are for the poorest in the area. There's a lot of Kenyans whose incomes - or their businesses incomes - are comparable to those in western countries, yet could still benefit greatly from the easier capital movement that Bitcoin provides. Equally, those same people could benefit greatly from true scaling solutions like Lightning... but that's no different than anywhere else in the world.

I was on two panels while I was there, and one of the points I made during that was we shouldn't start by assuming everything in Africa is totally unlike western countries, and the problems we face are completely dissimilar. Kenya is still a capitalist democracy with uncensored internet - in fact, better mobile internet than I can get at home. They still eat similar food and have similar brands as back home. Sure, there's a lot that's different - for instance the amount of private security in Kenya is beyond any other place I've ever been - but by assuming *everything* is different biases you to assuming that you can't learn from each other, and we certainly can.

dbh5235,nullc,53,"Unfortunately, this article contains many outright untruths.

This it too long for anyone to address point by point-- probably will take people days of effort to do so--, but some random examples: 

&gt; Most seriously, there are no enforceable constraints to the growth of the non-SW UTXO.

Sure there is, the amount of non-witness data in a block ends up with the same limit it always had.  One of the reasons we were able to convince people worried about a blocksize increase that segwit's capacity increase was safe was because it did not increase the UTXO bloat exposure.

&gt; This makes future soft or hard forks to Bitcoin more difficult as multiple classes of UTXOs

There aren't multiple classes of UTXO, they are all equal, differing only in their scriptPubkey, just like 2 of 3 multsig is different from 5 of 7. And just like a transaction can combine multisig and non-multisig using scripts they can also combine segwit and non-segwit using.

&gt; However, the signatures are more expensive to validate than the UTXO,

That isn't the case-- signature validation is one of the faster parts of block validation since our work on libsecp256k1, and unlike the rest it is perfectly parallelizable. On my desktop signature verification is more than 50 times faster than the rest of the process.  It is also perfectly prunable so it doesn't result in a long time storage cost for full nodes.

The page's pseudonymous author also behaves quite dishonestly, with claims like:

&gt; Greg Maxwell has postulated that “abandoned UTXO should be forgotten and become unspendable,

which is referring to a page which _explicitly_ says otherwise: ""(some of this) represent(s) different security and economic tradeoffs and I don't think those could be ethically imposed on Bitcoin even if a simple majority of users wanted them (as they'd be forced onto the people who don't want them)"". I've been highly outspoken that that kind of thing isn't an option for Bitcoin; although it is _technically_ interesting because it would address some long term issues. In Bitcoin we need to use different approaches to control UTXO bloat, such as those which are part of segwit.

I popped in briefly last night to alert everyone that the rising wedge I was soapboxing about yesterday broke to the upside. In case you missed it yesterday:

THE RISING WEDGE IS A LIE

All joking aside, it wasn't actually a lie. It was a pretty textbook rising wedge pattern. However, it actually broke to the upside instead of the downside. While that's certainly uncommon for a rising wedge, it was never completely out of the question. 

So now the question becomes, ""what does the future hold?""

From a chart perspective, things are looking pretty rosy. The rising trendline that pushed us up and over the rising resistance line should clear $800 within the next few days. So I'd imagine we're going to stay north of $800 for quite awhile. 

In the short-term, bitcoin is approaching stupid overbought levels. Bitcoin doesn't always care too much about that, but it's something to be mindful of.  

If you are already in a long position below $800, well done! You ignored my advice from the past few days and you're sitting pretty in a position that you can likely ride out to at least $900 and possibly a test of the ATH (and maybe even beyond!). 

If you followed my advice from the last few days, I expect you will have another opportunity to buy back in after a test of $800. It could be awhile before that test materializes though, so either be patient or FOMO now and hope for the best.

Did she ever use any of the profit for herself or her bills? Did you ever use her bank for bitcoin? Did she ever see you make these deals? Did she ever take you or go with you to meet anyone to do these deals?

These are must answer questions. 

Let's say they don't get the package and they don't catch you dealing again. They can get you on a conspiracy charge. This means they have enough evidence that you have dealt drugs in the past and you will still get the same amount of charges as if they actually did catch you.

Here's where those questions come in handy. There's also a lesser, but still hefty, charge of a co-conspirator. If she helped you, in any way, to buy or sell drugs, she can be charged just like you. She might get less prison time but she will be in trouble.

dbitlr7,nullc,45,"I'm very interested in knowing how they got access to develop for SGX in secure mode with remote attest.  When I last attempted it, Intel was not eager to provide access to anything but the insecure debug mode for anyone outside Intel.  If they would have provided access we'd already be using it.

There are many cool ways to use remote attesting trusted computing to improve security for Bitcoin.  Peter Todd and I worked for a while on designs for private and secure micropayment banks a couple years ago: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146307.0

Constructing a payment channel this way seems sensible, especially for small values.

I'm personally most interested in using SGX to take protocols which are already mostly secure without it and make them more secure, or mostly private and make them more private.  For example, many protocols have an opportunity for a user to behave abusively and jam the protocol but no funds can be lost.  With the trusted execution they could only perform those attacks with the added effort of breaking SGX. Another example is that a simplistic coinjoin protocol has a master who learns the input/output correspondence though blockchain observers do not-- avoiding that with complex crypto opens up many DOS attacks-- with SGX this final piece of the  privacy could be protected by the trusted execution.. People do these things today without the added strengthening of SGX, they'd be strictly better with it, and so if SGX is exploited they are still no worse off.  Or simple things like implementing velocity limits without a third party or making your transactions distinguishable (which doesn't even require remote attest).",2016-12-23 07:24:09

Next, i'm looking at the pattern of Nov'12 halving and Nov 13' mega bubble. If we follow a similar pattern as before and assuming this cycle takes longer than before, we should see a mega spike by late October 2017. By then, we should have already built a solid base in the 1000's and we will be ready to ascend to permanent 4 digit prices (maybe 5 digit in case of the spike) Before 2018.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/found-the-elusive-man-at-the-heart-of-the-hollywood-sex-abus

The stuff that is proven and public knowledge from court transcripts and financial documents, etc. is way more solid and interesting than the Pizzagate-type shit. And again it connects Colllns-Rector to some very powerful folks.

dbm2yyg,r0tekatze,120,"There are a few benefits to bitcoin, such as the ease of laundering and anonymity, that make it attractive.  It is also easier to trade with in some scenarios, due to the process required to support fiat transactions. Because it's instant, too, and much cheaper than Paypal or Western Union, it's useful for international transfers. 

Additionally, it can also be used to conduct trades where sanctions are in place, making it an important asset. There is a hospital in Iran that used to use BTC in the purchase of medicines, although a lot more went into the smuggling side of things. I've heard stories (although I cannot ratify them) of persons resorting to Bitcoin just to get food on the table.

Bitcoin is not just herd mentality. Admittedly, this plays a big part, but there are so many scenarios where a currency like bitcoin is preferable (and not all of them are immoral), that it makes it highly unlikely that non-fiat, anonymous currency will disappear any time soon. 


Edit: I've also just been considering the potential for currencies like Bitcoin to be responsible for new developments in cryptography and internet safety. This is also a consideration.

dbltjty,sciencehatesyou,31,"Let us not forget the long history of panaceas:

* Multisig: This was supposed to fix all security issues. Except no living being can figure out how to use it and the user experience is super shitty, so it was relegated to use by professionals who work at exchanges and know what they are doing. Just kidding, Bitfinex! No one even pretends that multisig adds any security any more.

* Sidechains: This was quite the hot item when it was announced. So hot that it killed off altcoins. But the ""trustless reverse peg"" turned out to be a bunch of handwavy bullshit and never materialized. If you want to experiment with a trustless altcoin today, you cannot use sidechains, and that was the whole point of sidechains.

* Smart Contracts: ""Money is only the first application,"" they used to say. But it turned out that it was also the last app. Smart contracts had to be developed by Ethereum, which took over what butters see as their own territory, namely, hype. Butters now end up constantly shitposting about ETH because they are bitter about their inability to claim this new area. 

* Segwit SF: The main point was to increase the blocksize. Ooops, no, it was to fix transaction malleability. Oops, no, it was to create a fee market to prepare us for the coming coin apocalypse in 2041, because butters can never be too prepared. Even the Chinese miners, who go along with just about anything, got pissed off at this shitshow, and now, it will not activate.

* Lightning Network: This doesn't work unless Segwit is activated, so it's dead now. Without Segwit, I can steal cash out of the channel, so this dumb idea isn't going anywhere.

* Off-chain scaling: No one knows what the big peer-to-peer credit network between incorrigible gamblers and casinos as well as addicts and their dealers looks like. But that doesn't stop the butters from claiming that they can compete with SWIFT with this non-existent network. Wanna send money to the west coast? I'll just send it to my dealer Big D, who has a credit relationship with a diseased whore who has a john, who knows a guy ... This is supposed to be the future.

* LN Routing: Speaking of which, routing for the Lightning Network doesn't exist. The only topology that is efficient to route over is a single hub-and-spoke, with a bank at the center, and *some deluded butters are lining up to actually make this happen, the same deluded people who oppose big blocks because mah-de-centralization*. Also, routing leaks information, like how much credit you have with your dealer Big D, and how much of it you used this week.

* Confidential Transactions: Confidential what? Even the IRS knows how to trace Bitcoin transactions now, and ZCash completely cut into Bitcoin's main selling point. Anyone remember how they used to say ""Bitcoin is anonymous?"" Then it was ""Bitcoin is pseudonymous?"" Well, what is it after your exchange turns over all your info to the Feds?

* Teechan: This was announced with a whitepaper but without a prototype, which is an improvement over the usual butter way of announcing bullshit on an irc/slack channel, but in any case, my bet is that these guys don't have any code. In the fine tradition of Craig Wright, when it comes time to unveil the code ""in a few weeks,"" there'll be a huge no show and following public embarrassment.

Before Bitcoin existed I could never get paid properly when working remotely (Western Union always had too many problems, which ended up costing me a few of the clients because of the problems/friction/inefficiencies of WU), banks were never a solution either (too much bureaucracy to open an account, ridiculous waiting times for transactions to clear (30 days), outrageous fees, etc.) all of which got in the way for me to earn money to sustain my family.

At this point it was clear it wasn't going to work (because of the banks and their ways), I start considering alternatives like manual work for getting some income, IT jobs are almost non-existent in my area.

Until one day I suddenly decide to start using Bitcoin, and everything went as expected (""finally saw light at the end of the tunnel, the depression begins to fade"" kind of moment).

End result: I do the work and deliver, I get paid in BTC, and suddenly our livelihood depends 100% on Bitcoin now and I'm 100% in control. We couldn't be happier.

I still use banking services in the form of Bitwage[0] for clients who aren't familiar with Bitcoin. Bitwage provides US/EU bank accounts which I then pass to my clients and then Bitwage sends the equivalent funds in BTC back to me (this comes handy because the clients don't even need to know I'm using Bitcoin, it's only a local bank wire for them).

That said, most of my clients are happy to use Bitcoin nowadays, thus removing banks and all of the intermediates from the equation.

I hold my earnings in Bitcoin and I sell only when I need the cash to pay our bills, buy our food, etc.

Bitcoin is an amazing technology and it's incredibly liberating/life-changing, I'm very grateful that it exists.

The Long pole broke down and fell back into the $850s.  The bounce was pretty shard and relatively fast.  This morning we just broke the box indicating a positive break out.  Obviously this is bullish.

What formation does this form?  It is a run of the mill double top break out, after a bullish catapult.  I don’t think the order is significant, but it sounds nice.

We predict tops of formations two ways:  The first is to count the width of the formation.  In this case the formation is just three columns wide.  Add these three boxes to the break out and that is one projection of this break out.  At these prices, it will take us to about $950.

The second way to project the top is to overlay the previous breakout column over the current column.  The last breakout was 16 boxes.  If we lay that over the current column the sixteen boxes will rise to $1,020.

Keep in mind, we are entering rarefied air.  We’ve only been down this road twice—once on the way up, and the other on the way down.  Embrace the trend and the positive news.  But be aware of bad news and the onslaught of negative bitcoin perceptions from the major media (CNBC, Bloomberg, and Fox Biz.)

From here on up, we have so little history to count on, making predictions are going to just be the textbook reading of the tea leaves.  But thats OK.  We can afford good tea now,

We will still need TumbleBit's efforts, until CT activates and makes this possible.  CoinJoin is currently more deployed than TumbleBit, but it has a nagging problem with information asymmetry between makers and takers (i.e. it leaks), and TumbleBit's deployment readiness is fast changing.

One important aspect of CT, and a benefit to building upon it with this direction of work, is that everything is compatible with pruning.  This is good for a sustainable full node population!  

The technical difference of decent pruning will result in Bitcoin destroying Monero, in the long run.  It does mean, however, that the conversation about when we are ready to activate CT will get noisy, as there's currently well over $100M in Monero that will be fighting bagholding obsolescence.  

Zcash is also not prunable, so this will help Bitcoin crush that schism as well (at the price of yet more bagholder-investor noise in the CT activation discussion).

dboapjr,nullc,15,"A key point here is that a softfork like segwit gives you _strictly_ more options as a user:

If you want your node to shutdown when an unknown softfork activates, like you'd be forced to do with a hardfork but without the hardfork risk that you end up on some attacker crated fork,  you can do that. Your node will detect and [alert you](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/temp/warning_in_gui.png) about the softfork.. and you could set it up to shutdown until you upgrade it.

(I haven't really encountered anyone else that wants that behavior-- but if you want it: you can have it!) 

But you can do the following things that you cannot do in a hardfork:

You can see the notice, check out the softfork.. and decide to ignore it: it doesn't change anything you care about, has no effect on you-- you'll keep working fine. You won't be validating the new rule, but it doesn't involve anything you care about so you're good to go.

OR You can see the notice and start up a new upgraded node, and put your older software behind it, undisturbed.  This means your old node will only see blocks that are valid under the new rules, but nothing else changes-- so no disruption to your existing custom software or processes, no risk that the upgrade has new behavior that disrupts your activities. You have the full enforcement of the new rule but aren't forced to change your software (which may be customized or unmaintained).

And users can decide which of these things they want to do-- upgrade, ignore, firewall  on their own timing.  They might start off firewalling or ignoring and then upgrade when its convenient for them; as part of rolling out other changes to their system...

and not just convenient for the end users: for their software vendors:  Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic were massively behind the softforks that came out while there were active, even though those proposals were a year+ old when they were released in core, and even though XT/Classic were mostly just copies of core which those changes applied cleanly to, meaning minimal effort to deploy.  Had they been hardforks, the users of those versions would have been forcefully pushed off the network and denied use of their preferred software. (In those cases, it probably would have been in the user's best interest-- but in principle this is not good).  Because hardforks  result in worldwide forced upgrades rather than giving users a choice of responses and timing they deprive users the freedom from running the software they choose.

&gt; The only valid point (in principle) is that we can do a lot of things much cleaner in terms of code quality if we free ourselves from the constraint of backwards compatibility.

One can't avoid the need for backwards compatibility without confiscating people's Bitcoins-- if you have a forced change to an ordinary transaction format, then coins stored with presigned locktimes or with HSMs that enforce transactions rules may become totally unspendable. Backwards compatibility is a cheap tax for preserving the properties of Bitcoin that people expect! :)

From a technical perspective, XCP just has a weak design. It can't support anything like SPV clients, making its operating costs very high. It's also very easily blocked, so if Bitcoin users do start to perceive it as a threat you could expect that it might not work so well in the future.

dbpfiy3,dilpill,50,"I went a year and a half ago, when they were in default and the Peso was pegged artificially high (with restrictions, tariffs, and taxes limiting access to foreign exchange). There was a parallel market that the government tacitly permitted with an exchange rate 35% weaker than the official rate. 

Officially, Buenos Aires was about as expensive as New York for many things, but cheaper than Mexico for a variety of goods and services the government subsidised. I was able to quickly make a local friend (something I recommend when visiting anywhere - it's a valuable cultural exchange for both parties and gives you advantages normally out of reach for unfamiliar tourists), and he gave me the location of a business that charged only a slight premium on the ""blue"" rate. Our party brought $600 cash that we were able to convert for 15+ARS apiece when the official rate was 9.2 (before hefty government-enforced forex fees). At that rate, it was straight up cheap there.

Ironically, since the liberalization of the exchange rate, the Peso has stabilized only slightly weaker (~16 ARS), despite the fact that prices have risen by about 50%. It's not much cheaper today than it was when I went, but there's no option to use the ""blue"" market for a more favorable rate. 

I do recommend Argentina though. Buenos Aires is beautiful, the food is terrific, there are tons of cultural things to do, and the Subte (metro) is fast, cheap (like $.35 a trip) and convenient for almost anywhere you'd want to go as a tourist. 

One caution is that petty crime and scams are common. 2/3 of us had a bag with valuables stolen. I lost a laptop and a prescription I would withdraw from if I went without, and my friend lost EVERYTHING including his passport and wallet.

Acquiring my prescription was time consuming and difficult... I went to the emergency room with a police report, but couldn't get the drug because they don't write prescriptions and didn't have the drug on hand to dispense since it was only used for smoking cessation there. I eventually got it by visiting 3-4 independent pharmacies, showing my police report and begging for understanding my lack of prescription.

My friend was literally walking to a cab to get to the airport when it happened to him, and the other friend and I had already left (different airline miles...). He couldn't get any money or assistance with shelter and food through official channels, including the US Embassy. No one would allow him to pick up money others  sent him without identification, which had been stolen. I ended up using Bitcoin to get him $200 in Pesos (thanks anonymous guy who literally delivered it and verified him by phone). That was enough to get him a temporary passport, food, and a place to sleep. The airline didn't charge for the changed flight, and he got home the next day.

dbohbe4,killerstorm,39,"I live in one of ""red"" countries (Ukraine). People here are well aware of inflation, and thus avoid using local currency (UAH, Ukrainian hryvna) for savings.

The law requires people and businesses to use local currency for payments. Thus it is impossible to use Bitcoin for payments (I guess that's what you mean by ""main currency"") without violating laws. (Just like it is impossible to use US dollars and so on.)

However, it's fairly easy to convert UAH to US dollars or euros, so that's what people do. Typically they keep savings in USD and EUR. Some people also invest in gold and real estate.

Still, it's kinda impractical to do a conversion every day due to fees and general inconvenience, so generally people keep some UAH as pocket money for buying groceries and whatnot (\*), while keeping larger sums in USD and EUR. 

While yearly inflation is significant (about 20%), it hardly matters when you only keep a relatively small sum in local currency and spend it quickly.

People could use Bitcoin for savings, in principle, but it has several disadvantages compared to US dollars: higher conversion fees, higher volatility, cybersecurity risks, etc.

But an important advantage is that Bitcoin doesn't depend on banks and government, and cannot be stole if you do it right. Ukrainian banking system is very unstable, so this is an important factor. So it might make sense to put a fraction of one's savings into Bitcoin if he can secure them properly.

( \*: If one is paranoid about inflation, he can get a USD debit card from Ukrainian bank and use it to buy groceries, etc. Bank will do the conversion automatically. But it charges a conversion fee.)

dbplzlf,decipedetimes10,21,"&gt; This is so obvious you are trying to talk others into doing this to benefit your position.

This is an absurd accusation which I find so frustrating that I'm now going to rant:.

I'm trying to be a helpful participant in a trading sub. You're running around yelling ""troll!"" at everyone who says something which might dare indicate that ETH is not headed for the moon tomorrow and then claim that I'm the one trying to bolster MY position? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

Your ""obvious"" observation is nothing more than naivete and short-sightedness. 

I essentially told people to make their decision now and stick with it to not get burned. Why? Because there are a lot of noobs around here, and it's how I've gotten burned in the past and others inevitably will. You may not want to admit it, but ETH is in a downtrend and BTC is in an uptrend on **very low volume**. That means it's real and the bubble hasn't even started yet. When BTC explodes, a lot of these ""true eth believers"" will capitulate and try to make some quick eth and as a result get burned.

""TROLL TROLL TROLL! OMG ETH MUST BE AT $21+ TOMORROW and FOREVER ANYTHING ELSE IS BLATANT MANIPULATION BY WHALES AND YOU'LL NEVER LOSE IF YOU JUST HODL LIKE A TRUE BELIEVER SHOULD!"" 

1. The markets care very little about the fundamentals or the arguments going on around these technologies; except as they feel it might **immediately** influence the price. 
2. The markets care primarily about which way the markets appear to be going. Up trend? BUY! Down trend? SELL! 
3. It didn't take mainstream adoption to reach $1200, and it didn't take mainstream adoption for it to reach $960 after being declared dead. So why on earth would it take mainstream adoption to reach $2500 or $5000? 

Here's my position: 

* Bought 4 BTC at $800/each in 2013. ""OMG MOON TO $10k!"" --""hodled"" as a good noob should and got burned.
* Bought 2k ETH at the ICO; sold them for about $1 last December to pay off debts thinking i'd have no problem buying back in march for about the same. 
* Saw Mike Hearn leave the BTC team and lost faith in the project; cashed out Bitcoin to buy back into Ethereum--about 500 ETH.
* Been trying to regain my original ETH position ever since. Decided that this was my priority and that virtue signaling about the technology is a no-win game.
* Sold my ETH for bitcoin about a week ago, waiting to buy back into ETH as I believe that BTC is ultimately a suicided technology, having suffocated itself with in-fighting, manipulation, and all the things that that very community supposedly stands against. 
* I have about a hundred more ETH in unrealized gains thus far, I expect to get another hundred while people like you are screaming ""hodl!"" and your eth stack is staying the same size or your fiat stack is getting smaller as you buy more.


&gt; you are trying to talk others into doing this to benefit your position.

For the record, not everybody here is convinced that a random internet post by a nobody on a tiny subreddit is enough to influence the market. Just apply a tiny bit of logic to your accusation, please. The kind of traders who would take partisan investment advice from a sub like this would most likely be holding so little ETH that it would do NOTHING to anyone's position except their own. Is it not possible that someone is actually genuinely interested in just trying to be helpful--regardless of whether or not you agree with their advice?

But obviously this isn't where it started. More importantly, they view each other as peers and mutually support one another.

Bashco and theymos explicitly support blockstream as the ""true vision"" of bitcoin, or at least describe it that way for their own interests.

When I've spoken to some of the bigger Bitcoin businesses--usually to encourage them to increase their nodes' block size limits and publicize doing so--I'm met with a sort-of ho-hum hesitation ""Peter, we'd love bigger blocks but we don't want to rock the boat--we'll only increase our nodes' block size limits with community consensus."" But by being ho-hum like this, they signal to the market that they're neither serious nor committed to larger blocks.  And so nothing changes.  

We need to get the word out that the health and evolution of the network _depends_ on people expressing their preferences through signalling and commitment strategies, like you describe.  You're not ""breaking consensus"" and threatening the stability of the network; the network is not that fragile--you're just communicating your preferences to the other participants. If you want bigger blocks, you don't have to wait for anything.  Simply run a node that accepts bigger blocks today!  And if you're a Bitcoin business, signal the fact that you're doing so to the rest of the community.  

We'll win this war, node by node, and hash by hash.

dbqpetm,kwanijml,39,"Or for anyone interested in the slightly-more-sophisticated-than-the-meme version of this idea:

Probably the most persistent and universal thing giving bitcoin (the token) value, is the utility of its in-built payment network (and the pseudonymity and censorship resistance qualities which come along with it)...that utility is inseparably connected to each unit token as a share of that. There are plenty of other, more ethereal reasons for people to value it (all of which ""backs"" the bitcoin currency in the same fundamental way which the requirement of paying taxes in dollars ""backs"" that money).

The creation or evolution of money on a market (vs. by government fiat to promote or sustain it's existence) faces a coordination problem in getting to that point of ubiquity and liquidity, such that it's primary use-value is in fact use as the most saleable token of indirect exchange (I.e. that is when something becomes money...which by the way, bitcoin is does not actually serve yet as money in any significant economic sphere; and that point that Morpheus is talking about is essentially when bitcoin becomes a unit-of-account money).

Markets are slow to create money in the face of this market failure/coordination problem. Thus, market monies of the past have often been commodities which had some significant non-monetary use-value prior to becoming money, which naturally put them in to the hands of many people (e.g. gold's use for jewelry) and bootstrapped those commodities to the point that their good monetary properties (fungibility, divisibility, scarcity, etc) could manifest and ensconce the commodity in place as the most saleable commodity such that it is mostly useful for indirect exchange itself, rather than the non-monetary utility.
There is even an argument to be made that a money is ideally free from the demand and supply shocks which come from the other uses of the commodity. In this way, and because of its superior monetary properties; bitcoin excels beyond gold and other commodity monies of the past.

But what is not well understood and appreciated even among bitcoin enthusiasts, is that bitcoin is not yet money...that it is still in a phase of price discovery and trying (as it were) to overcome the catch 22 coordination problems which are arguably more present with a token like bitcoin...which has less of an obvious non-monetary value or use-component with which to bootstrap itself into widespread holding in the first place, such that its monetary properties can manifest in closed transaction loops as a token suddenly valuable for itself; it's use in indirect exchange.

This is where the hype and the booms and crash cycles of its price, and the speculation and FOMO come in to play: these are market mechanisms whereby we (in both an emergent and unconscious...but also a conscious and entrepreneurial fashion) are *willing* and artificially promoting bitcoin into position as the most saleable commodity. We are using the prospect of massive gains to coordinate merchants along with their vendors and customers to simultaneously have an individually rational reason to adopt bitcoin (even though firms aren't normally in the good habit of getting into foreign currency speculation at the expense of their regular business)...we are making the profit opportunities too high for these players or most anyone to ignore, thus they all start demanding the token for itself rather than as a proxy for the ""real"" money that they ultimately want to exchange it for right now.

dbq72b0,ForkiusMaximus,36,"First of all note that Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't ""do anything"" to the consensus rules by itself. It instead lets the user set the blocksize settings. *The user is free to set them to match Bitcoin Core settings,* in which case there is no difference from now. All BU does is make it easier for the user to change the settings without having to know how to code. 

Thus BU is not fundamentally a ""bigger blocks"" implementation. It's a ""user control"" implementation. It simply recognizes that when Bitcoin is at trillion-dollar market caps it will make no freaking sense to have consensus rules be tied to easily co-optable centralized development teams (as all dev teams are). Instead coordination on consensus rules will have to happen in a decentralized fashion where each economically important node and miner makes an informed decision rather than trusting Papa Core.

If people think this will lead to bigger blocks, it can only be because the ecosystem of economically important nodes and miners want bigger blocks and believe there is no danger of centralization. You can thus see that Core's position is innately paternalistic, thinking that the devs know best about how to design incentives and economic constraints. Realize that not a single one of the devs at Bitcoin Core (nor, to be fair, any other team) have demonstrated any expertise in incentive or economic design, except Satoshi who is now gone.",2016-12-29 04:55:43

The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.

In Bitcoin's source code, hashcash the e-mail anti spam system that nobody ever used is nowhere to be seen. Bitcoin uses sha256 hash collision to a target value, hash collision is as old as hashing itself.

Because the pole was 13 rows high, the drop down could be between 6 and 7 boxes.  Thats one more box down on the drop.  

So…if you are shorting, we may have another $10 from the overnight low.

Going lower than that could be problematic for the longs.  Here is why:  If there are a lot of leveraged longs coming in from the past break out at $920 they are going to start going into the red.  And margin calls are going to start coming in.  On top of that, the traders are going to see we are not hitting the ATH on this trip, and they will start to bail out.

If we go into the $920s, the resistance drops down to the 900 range.  I am not sure of the Yuan price in that range…but people trading in Yuan don’t like to lose money either.

I am cautiously optimistic.  The trend is up.  We are still up based on the chart—meaning that the short term movement is up and the long term movement is up.

I think going into this weekend we won’t see Dow 20,000.  The PBOC could devalue again, and hit the scary 7:1 ratio of Yuan/Dollar.  The Italian banks would go belly up.

Or nothing could happen.  The GOOD thing about bitcoin is that its a 24 hour market, so you CAN bail on a long weekend.

So, here are the new numbers:

Moving up to $960 or more means a reversal into a column of Xs (up).
The Negative break down is at $850.  I don’t think thats in play at this time.
The overall trend reversal happens down at $640.

My guess is that it reverses above $960 at some point today.  But that we just bounce around waiting for something to push it from the outside.

Enjoy your long weekend, and I wish us all a Happy and Healthy New Year.

dbs03sa,ASAPDarl,37,"I think that is partially the reason. Both are anti-establishment figures. Also, the people using reddit in 2012 are very different than the ones in 2016. I don't think that there's actually a ton of crossover in who is supporting them, it's just that both were popular at their given times.

This is complete guesswork, but I'd venture to say that the people using reddit in 2012 skewed much more towards the Aaron Swartz/bitcoin/Internet society crowd that is big on libertarianism and hence supported Ron Paul. You still sort of see that with the way that reddit generally treats things like privacy issues and Edward Snowden.

Since then, reddit has become much bigger, more mainstream, and it's user base is much more reflective of a young crowd that is Internet savvy enough to know about reddit, but lacks other defining features due to its size. This crowd is much more generically liberal. This is in contrast to other social media sites like Facebook, where older, less savvy Internet users have joined the community. ",2016-12-30 09:59:49
dbrpp0q,etheraddict77,32,"Vitalik actually calculated how secure Bitcoin is when you take away the mining rewards.  **It would cost approx. between 2-4 million USD to perform a so called “Maginot line” attack - source:** https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/

He then outlined why PoS is so much more secure and was even confident enough to put a number on attacking PoS - **his result, if BTC were to switch to PoS it would cost 20-100 million USD to attack Bitcoin**

&gt; Hence, with proof of stake, we may see an attack cost of $20-100 million for a network the size of Bitcoin;

Vitalik probably knows better than a random surfer dude, no offense to https://twitter.com/Ragnarly/ 

Also, he did absolutely no research on Ethereum and why the forks help to secure the network. Devs in the EF are high-level math wizards that have a good understanding of game theory, economics, programming and everything else in between. I would put my money on those people any day over a random pseudonym with the name Nakamoto.

No offense to Nakamoto and early Bitcoin devs, but a system where the founders are unknown will never work in reality. That is just one of the thousands of reasons why BTC can not become a dominant payment system. Accountability, attribution, you name it - all of that is missing and can therefore not be used in enterprise environments.

dbrs3f8,DeviateFish_,28,"Just gotta say that uh... most of those points are actually true.

&gt; Ethereum is centralized

It is.  See: setting supporting the fork to be the default[^[1]](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4t52xg/geth_1410_return_of_the_eth/); setting default gas fees (that aren't diverged from) and setting recommendations for fees during spam attacks[^[2]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otJMRqYpRO4LHpiiKk1Izfg1cjIB7IgGfb-gl0uSZ6M/pubchart?oid=2027361538&amp;format=interactive); colluding directly with exchanges to stop ETH trading hours after the DAO drain was discovered[^[3]](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4om0wl/the_exchanges_are_against_a_roll_back_hard_fork/); and more.

&gt; Vitalik is dangerous

I don't think this one is particularly true.  He's naive and maybe slightly impulsive (see ^[3] above), but I don't think he's ""dangerous"", per se.

&gt; ""Ethereum Classic"" is the original Ethereum.

Well, technically it is, since a hard-fork is, by definition, a change in the consensus rules.  ETC opted out of that change, choosing instead to maintain the older rules variant.

&gt; The DAO hack was not a big deal and was not viewed as a existential threat at the time. (revisionist history)

It wasn't.  Neither Vlad[^[4]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4rohdy/vlad_zamfirs_thoughts_on_the_hard_fork/d52rmej/) nor Vitalik^[citation&amp;nbsp;needed] considered the amount of stolen funds to be a threat to PoS.

&gt; The Ethereum blockchain is no different than a centralized database because transactions are just rolled back willy nilly.

Yeah, this one's pretty trash.  However, the grain of truth at the core is that the EF + miners + exchange ""cartel"" is basically the DBA of the system--provided sufficient incentive, they could indeed ""roll back"" (aka ""non-standard state change"") anything they wanted to, provided they make a big enough show of support for it.

&gt; ""Ethereum Classic"" follows the law of code, not the law of man. If you believe the ""rule of law"" then you must select ETC. (These idiots do not understand the law of blockchains which are decentralized communities of humans.)

I think you're misinterpreting this one.  I think it's referring to the whole ""code is law"" thing that people were abusing and twisting to try to support the fork.  ""Code is law"" was a phrase that basically meant: if you wrote a contract (""law""), the code enforced it.  If the code you wrote wasn't what you intended, well, too bad, because it's the representation of the ""law"", but you implemented it incorrectly.  The ""code is law"" could be rephrased ""contracts are law on the blockchain--and in the event of a dispute of interpretation, the code has the final say.""

&gt; ""Ethereum Classic"" has control over the hearts, minds and behavior of all their community members to prevent any disagreement.

Wat?

&gt; Ethereum supply growth is unlimited.

Technically true.  Ethereum's issuance rate is 5 ETH per block, with no caps, no reduction--only the PoW difficulty bomb to eventually slow the issuance, but not stop it.  The issuance decreases over time (at the cost of throughput), but isn't capped.

&gt; ""Ethereum Classic"" follows Austrian economics while Ethereum does not.

Roughly speaking, if ETC goes through with their issuances changes, this will be true.

&gt; Proof of Stake is an ""insult"" to the mining community

Absolutely 100% true.  A switch to Proof-of-stake represents a pretty big loss to any miners invested in mining ETH--because they won't be able to mine it anymore, and will have to switch to the next-most-profitable coin.  In some ways, it's basically a ""thanks, but we don't need you anymore"" and a boot out the door without so much as a parting gift.

&gt; Charles Hoskinson is Ethereum's former CEO.

True[^[5]](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-hoskinson-1a95a4b4)

&gt; ETC value will be more that ETH.

Definitely wishful thinking.

*********

So... lots of that is actually true.  Whether or not you agree with it on a philosophical level doesn't affect how true it is.

For what it's worth, even vitalik used to be against the idea of hard forks.[^[6]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z712z/this_community_must_demand_blockchain_evidence_of/cfr4il0/?context=3)",2016-12-30 06:54:40

Well It's not about the $0.30 per transaction specifically, but for now number of people that can use Bitcoin is severely limited.

If, for example, a million of chinese people simultaneously tried to buy Bitcoin tomorrow and put it in their personal wallet, the network would be made unusable for weeks.

It only doesn't happen because once the network starts to crawl, people become discouraged and stop trying ""this bitcoin thing"".

dbrcrz1,ferretinjapan,20,"&gt;I agree that this seems troubling at least short term, but Bitcoin simply has too much support and love by people for it to die out or be ruined by stagnation and lack of development / fixing the scaling issue.

Tell that to myspace and friendster. The reality is that network effect needs momentum, IOW, it needs room to grow and be more and more accessible and useful to users. Imagine if the telephone system had been crippled so that only 100 people could use it at any one time? Or if you could only talk for 10 mins each day? Or if as more users were added to the system, it cost more and more to make a phone call. Saying network effect will keep it in the lead is a poor argument as things almost never turn out like that unless you have been able to create an artificial monopoly. Bitcoin has the exact opposite of a monopoly on blockchain based networks and if they don't find a way to grow in a sustainable manner, other blockchains will outmanoeuvre and outgrow them given enough time.

Scaling aside, given that governments are relying more and more on blockchain analysis, as well as tracking users spending via the blockchain, you will find more and more people wanting privacy due to the risk in receiving coins from possibly illegal sources as well as having to jump through hoops to prove your coins are legitimately acquired. I've already been on the pointy end of this and this will only increase. This is a burden for merchants, and users, and Monero relieves both of that burden to police themselves, so it's not necessarily a desire for privacy, but a desire to not be forced to police or self censor themselves. Monero fits the bill for this, and makes it impossible for governments to dig deeper than the user or merchants own spending/receiving history. Coupled with the fact that it has a flexible blocksixe, as well as other sensible mechanisms, I think Monero is set to become a serious competitor, network effect and price isn't going to stop that from happening. While Bitcoin spins it's wheels, Monero is only going to gain ground.
