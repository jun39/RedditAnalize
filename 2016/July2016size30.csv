d4ua456,cos1ne,184,"If Laszlo had not paid 10,000 BTC for the pizza bitcoins would likely be worthless now. The currency only has force if you can spend it and if everyone is hoarding the coins then it is worthless. 

At this time you could mine hundreds of coins in a day because of the nature of bitcoin, the first are easy and it gets progressively harder to mine the more that are revealed.

IIRC at the time Lazszlo actually got a deal by spending *only* 10,000 BTC for a pizza since they were essentially worth nothing at the time. You can thank the rise of bitcoin on the people who spent rather than hoarded, and those early adopters likely did not spend all their thousands of bitcoins and are probably doing pretty okay today.",2016-07-01 03:18:06

d4v7heo,midnitewarrior,45,"That answer is far from complete.

I've had my card stolen 6+ times, and I've worked in the payment card industry.

Card features are superior to bitcoin in more ways than you mention, especially for the consumer.

First, cards backed by Visa and MasterCard typically credit cards and some debit have either an extended warranty feature or will intervene on your behalf in a merchant dispute. If you cannot resolve a merchant dispute with bitcoin, you are out your btc, nobody will fix it for you. 

Cards often have rewards in place where you earn miles or points. There are no bitcoin point systems.

Cards typically give you a year-end report showing you how you spent your money.  Bitcoin wallets give you lists of bitcoin addresses and any notes you may have added if you bothered.

Cards are taken at millions of merchants around the globe.  As far as merchants who accept bitcoin, [there are dozens of us, DOZENS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI) /s

You carry huge financial risk if your bitcoin wallet is compromised, lost, stolen, or password is forgotten or stolen.  Unauthorized transaction with cards are always refunded to you unless you fail to tell your bank within 48 hours of when you discovered the problem. They make you whole again with a little paperwork.

Cards are extremely simple to use and understand. For most, bitcoin is ""magic internet money"" that they cannot understand and when they do, may be fearful of deleting their wallets.




The downsides:

Goods prices are slightly inflated to account for the cost of clearing cards vs less expensive forms of payment. There are costs for every form of payment, even cash.

While merchants are on the hook for card fraud, merchants make a lot more money than that by accepting credit cards and can serve more customers because of the speed of card transactions. Consumers buy more when they have access to credit, which leads to greater profits which fraud bites in to. Card transaction speed is slowing down with slow chip readers though.

Merchants can accept cards using offline transactions and process them later. They accept risk with that, but for some merchants they can accept that risk.

Is the system secure? Nope. But it has strengths, and every system has a weak link. There is real risk of loss for consumers with bitcoin, and no risk with cards, that's the biggest. My grandma can use cards easily, however I wouldn't trust her with more than $20 in a bitcoin wallet. Yes merchants feel card fraud, but they typically earn more from extra sales by accepting cards than it costs them.  Keep in mind merchants are willing participants in accepting the fraud. I know they don't like it, but it comes with access to cards.

That being said, consumers would be better off if credit cards didn't exist, but they do, and bitcoin is never going to eliminate credit cards, because people want access to credit.

For the record, I think bitcoin is a great value store, a great money transfer vehicle, but inferior method of payment for consumers in Western markets.",2016-07-01 20:38:24

&gt;Well this little miners rumor out of china is a great demonstration of market manipulation via FUD if nothing else.

&gt;Pretty crazy though... Rumor gets posted with zero proof, /r/btc starts celebrating and saying that the price is going up because of it (yeah the price is totally going up dude to miners stating they are going to war against developers via hardfork 10 days before halving...), the post gets deleted from r/bitcoin as FUD, and everyone claims censorship.

&gt;At first I think: It really shouldn't be censored. It should be allowed to go all the way to top post in r/bitcoin, and then the first comment you read should be ""this is bullshit and this is why...""

&gt;However, did you guys see the posts on the ""mempool issue"" a couple weeks ago in /r/bitcoin? It was blatant vote manipulation. A core developer came in to address it and couldn't get above like 4 comment karma. Meanwhile bullshit comments in favor of classic and a 2mb increase were upvoted to oblivion.

&gt;Censoring is bad but letting /r/bitcoin be relentlessly manipulated is probably worse.

&gt;Edit: Go have a look at /r/btc comments on this guys. ""I might actually buy bitcoin again"", ""I might take money out of alts for bitcoin"", etc...

&gt;/r/btc folks are as good as butters at this point. Their attempts to FUD will only get worse as the price rises after they sold all their coins. These people do not share the motivations and goals of a hodler right now because they ar enot hodlers right now. The good thing is you know these fuckers gonna buy back in soon regardless.


I still think, the discussion should be permitted here on r/bitcoin too but it seems the moderators disagree...

d4v5vt2,jeanduluoz,33,"This might be a little bit off topic, or pertinent to your BTC investments, depending on your time frame. I come from a macroeconometric background myself, and this completely slipped by me as i kept my nose buried in the data often.

As we track interest rates and economic performance, we essentially manage that behavior with monetary policy. Weak economy? Devalue currency which reduces interest rates, which then makes money less expensive and easier to invest, which encourages the economy to grow. So what's the big-picture monetary policy?

We're on [almost 40 years of borrowed growth](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fed_funds_rec.png&amp;w=1484). That is essentially subsidizing the american economy with dollars from the from the future, and that's fine with me if it works. But it doesn't work. We clearly got &lt;1% growth for a 1% change in monetary expenditure, so each time our economy ""recovered,"" we used a little bit more of our ammunition. Another way of thinking about it is that we never really improved our economic total factor productivity (real growth driver) to the point where it accounted for 100% growth, and covered this up with debt funding to ""create"" the rest of the growth, and now we're up against a wall (0% interest rates). The only choice left is to return to TFP growth rather than debt growth, and that means drastically changing the fabric of our economic infrastructure.

In 2009, the idea of negative interest rates was mostly laughed at - the term is ""zero-bound"" because our monetary policy is bounded by this interest rate floor. Since then, we've found empirically and theoretically that interest rates can go below zero with little disruption to the economy. That's not *exactly* surprising because markets aren't perfectly efficient - people won't start stuffing all their savings under their mattress because their bank still provides safety, even if they're being charged for the privilege. But going far beyond about -0.1% and you will start to see some wonky behavior. For example, you would be paid to borrow money to buy a house, which is how mortgages would work in a negative interest rate environment. 

But we do *not* have the ability to slash interest rates 5% - 10% as we have always done in the past. We've tried things like ""operation twist,"" which adjusted the yield curve to pull a bit more value out of monetary policy. It was kind of genius, but not highly impactful. 

So here is the US - 40 years and trillions of dollars outside of equilibrium. Other countries are in the same situation. What happens? I would not be surprised to look back at bitcoin one day and realize that the halving was entirely priced in, etc. etc. and a lot of this value growth was just simple forex value projections. The only chance is to drive labor productivity through technical advancements now - and we don't have the money to maintain our physical infrastructure or invest in our technical infrastructure. Even if we did, we wouldn't know or agree on how to do it.",2016-07-01 19:13:15

But in case of you making a mistake, with Bitcoin, it is you who are punished for it, not someone else who did not make a mistake.

You're not really selling someone on Bitcoin with that argument. As much as I don't want to screw over a local business, decisions I make are based solely on my own self preservation, so with that argument I would easily take the credit card from the company that 99% of the time backs me even when its my own fault.

d4uq6ue,Emocmo,26,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Good evening.

Sorry its been so long, but I actually found a job.  I started last week, and lo and behold…they expect me to work and not use their internet for bitcoin trading.  Can you imagine?  

So, we had a good reversal and break out today.  After the mess for the past couple of weeks the moves back upwards have been decent and steady.  it is almost as if the pop up into the 700s was premature, and we just went back to the way its been trading for a while.  Which is fine with me.

As this is the end of the month, it is interesting to look back and find the 6 in the columns.  And looking at all of the movement for the past four weeks, it gives you a sense of how crazy this has been.  It is also good to note that we ended May in the $540 range.  That is more than a $100 gain for the month.  Thats not much to sneeze at.  And, if you were trading this right the movements were wide and fast.  Making a profit in this kind of market seems too easy,

Don’t get used to it.

So, where do we go from here?

The latest breakout comes in a formation that is 6 columns wide.  That last breakout went from $660 to $770.  Therefore using those two measures (adding the width to the breakout OR overlaying the last breakout onto this column) the projected top for this next movement is somewhere between $720 and $750.  Based on the last run ups, that seems reasonable.

Now what else is going on in the world?  The Brexit tossed the world into the blender for a couple of days.  But more importantly, there are some banks in Italy that seem to be on the edge of the cliff.  Also, Chinese continue to devalue the Yuan—which appears to be the catalyst for yesterday’s move.

Silver and gold are on a tear.

I am thinking there is more going on in the financial world than the business media is telling us.  Just the fact that I heard someone today mention “surprise” that silver was popping today makes you wonder if these people even know what they are talking about.  In the Alt media, Silver has been the most talked about potential hit for the past year or so.  

I think we might be in for more fireworks than the average Fourth of July has in store.  But we shall see.

Once again, I apologize for not being around…but those other guys pay me.  And a lot more than beer tips!  :-)

d4uu35q,BOBsagetBUTforHULKS,24,"As a casual lurker who sorta hates the guy because I think he's barred out and ruined a ton of teenagers lives who didn't understand what they were doing, two things shock me about this. 

First - knowing nothing more than the open fact he was arrested before for pressing pills, my simpleton ass was able to successfully find his real name and info in under 10 minutes about a year ago. Some comment mentioned his previous arrest and the area it was in. Googling two obvious queries was all it took to find him and his blog. 

Second, and WAY more important IMHO: If a random DNM reader like me was able to find Q's real name in minutes a year ago, why the fuck is he still operating? Private pharma likely has tens of millions at their disposal to hunt him down privately, and the US government probably knew who he was 15 seconds after registering as ""quantik"" on whatever market he first used. 

The fact that he's free means one of the following:

 - there is a bigger case that for the time being requires him as an active informant, likely biker related or organized crime

- they're waiting for the right situation to occur that will allow him to be extradited to the US and charged with ""life, no parole"" crimes

- private pharma actually is benefitting from the massive increase in Xanax use across the country, and is putting pressure on the governments to take their sweet fucking time


  There are known deaths from his product, a drug epidemic stemming from his operation by itself, and his identity has been one Google query away from even my Grandma's IE browser. 

What the fuck am I missing here? I saw an unrelated thread 6-7 months ago that mentioned his real name and had ""that' picture of him in it, on a topic that wasn't rule breaking or remotely related to him or xanax. That post got scrubbed like 60s later, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who caught it and assumed it had to confirm my original query as accurate.

d4xbkz8,ydtm,31,"So now you /u/nullc are saying Cobra is a:

&gt; non-existing developer

Oh but wait - Cobra *was* a dev back when it suited your purposes - ie, back when you included him as a ""signatory"" on your so-called ~~stalling~~ scaling roadmap (just search for cobra on [this page](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/)).

**You're so trapped in your lies that just admitted now that one of the devs who signed your ""roadmap"" actually _does not exist_**

Anyways, how about you focus on *attacking Cobra himself for his lunacy in proposing modifying a whitepaper* - instead of focusing on attacking r/btc for trying to defend the whitepaper against some anonymous person named Cobra who you seem 100% certain doesn't work for Blockstream (despite the fact that he's anonymous and he just happens to be the owner of the website where Blockstream publishes its public messages and you just happened to include this ""non-existent dev"" as one of the 57 devs who make up the mythical ""dev consensus"" which you beat everyone over the head with in your attempts to pretend that somehow you actually have support for your shitty code).

But it's actually kinda cool that you're getting so contorted now with all your never-ending lies and distortions that we finally have *you stating on the record that at least on of the signatory ""devs"" on your so-called ""roadmap"" _doesn't actually exist_.*

**You always miss the point**

As usual, all you're really accomplishing here is just letting more and more people see that your behavior is part of the overall pattern of dishonesty and corruption from you guys:

- You always think it's more important to protect Blockstream, than to protect Bitcoin itself.

- Your company is associated with lunatics who lack basic understanding of fundamental notions about academic publishing and open-source projects: in both cases, thinking it's perfect ok to commit the outrage of hijacking a project or hijacking a whitepaper.

Seriously, all you're really doing here is engaging in your usual nit-picks and distractions - instead of focusing on the big issue, which is: *the anonymous owner of the website where your company publishes its stuff, and who you listed as a developer supporting your roadmap even though now you claim he's a ""non-existent"" developer, is now proposing hijacking the Bitcoin whitepaper.*

**You focus on irrelevancies and create confusion**

And at this point, it's really sleazy of you to even be engaging in these semantic games, about whether some non-existent dev in December who signed your roadmap does or not represent you when he now tries to violate basic norms of academic publishing by violating the whitepaper defining the project.

Given the amount of confusion you guys keep spreading, it's perfectly normal that some people would have a hard time keeping track of which of your anonymous phantom devs really ""exist"" or not at this point, or what the relationship between Core and Blockstream and bitcoin.org is, and whether or not subcontractors like Luke-Jr are actual employees or not, or whether the Adam Back actually was or was not representing Blockstream (who probably paid for his flight to Hong Kong, right?) when he signed the HK agreement which turned out to be a lie anyways.

**You created this cesspool and then you complain about it**

You guys bitch and moan all the time that r/btc spends so much time engaging in ""personal attacks"" against you - but you bring this on yourselves and you deserve all this criticism and more: because you, and the people associated with you, lack the most basic understanding of the fundamental rules of open-source development - and now you've shown everybody you also lack the basic understanding of how academic publishing works - and in both cases, it involves hijacking and propagandizing. You lie and censor and cheat and fudge and then you bitch and moan when people have the nerve to actually point this out. You turn the community into a cesspool and then [you have the nerve to turn around and complain about the mess that you yourselves caused](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wu57h/blockchain_cto_gregory_maxwell_unullc_says_rbtc/). 

**Your priorities are screwed up**

If you were *really* against what Cobra was proposing, you wouldn't focus on the fact that some people are confused about whether or not he does or does not work for Blockstream (and by the way, the fact that he's anonymous and nobody seems to know who he actually is makes your assertions that ""he doesn't work for us"" pretty vacuous - and on top of that, you also try to maintain a phony appearance of keeping guys like Luke-Jr at ""arm's length"" from your company, saying ""they don't work for us"" - which is only about half-true, since although he's not an *employee*, he is apparently sometimes a *contractor* - which means that in some sense, Luke-Jr *does* work for Blockstream).

Really, it's almost impossible to know who exactly works for you and who doesn't, you guys just keep things so nebulous and always move the goal-posts so much, in whichever way is most convenient to suit your interests at the moment.

**You flip-flop all the time**

Case in point: one of the things you've been beating people over the head with is that you have some sort of ""dev consensus"" behind your crazy too-little too-late overcomplicated ""roadmap"":

&gt; /u/vampireban wants you to believe that ""a lot of people voted"" and ""there is consensus"" for Core's ""roadmap"". But he really means only 57 people voted. And most of them aren't devs and/or don't understand markets. Satoshi designed Bitcoin for *the economic majority* to vote - not just 57 people.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/

Oh and lookie there... in the list of ""devs"" who were signatories to your ""roadmap"", there's someone named ""cobra"":

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits?author=cobra-bitcoin

So... See what I mean? When you wanted to create the illusion that your fucked-up, hated roadmap has ""dev consensus"" back in December 2015, then Cobra *is* a dev for Bitcoin.

But today, when Cobra says ""Hey let's break all the rules of academia and rewrite Satoshi's whitepaper because it's toxic"" - oh, now suddenly you, the CTO of Blockstream, come out here to these forums saying ""Cobra isn't a dev.""

Why don't you make up your fucking mind? How the hell can people be expected to figure out what you guys are up to, when you keep playing fast and loose with the facts like this?

**You spend more time crippling Bitcoin than developing Bitcoin**

All we get from you is lies, delays, broken promises, half-truths, omissions, crippled code, artificial limits, rising fees, broken UI, shitty user experience, foot-dragging, blame-shifting, roadmaps that help your company and the owners behind it (eg, the insurance giant [AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)) - and most recently (the Hong Kong ~~delaying tactic~~ agreement) people who sign agreements where they can't even make up their mind whether they represent Blockstream or not and then end up reneging on the whole thing anyways.

The whole fiasco with the HK agreement (Adam flip-flopping over whether he was signing as an official of Blockstream or not, you calling people ""dipshits"" - and then finally the whole agreement turning out to be yet another lie / stalling tactic anyways) is starting to give people a glimpse into the fact that there must be a lot of ""arm-twisting"" going on behind the scenes at Blockstream, as you are faced with the massive task of forcing a bunch of devs to work against the interests of the Bitcoin community by inventing bullshit excuses for trying to cripple the Bitcoin network - for Lord knows what reason, whether it's simply because you all stupid enough to believe that you'll somehow be able to make money off your ridiculous sidechain vaporware Lightning Network, or maybe because your owners ([AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)) don't want cryptocurrrencies in general to succeed at all anyways, so they're trying to sabotage Bitcoin.

Who the hell even knows anymore. You guys are just all over the place, enjoying and abusing the inertia which has left you in the driver's seat of Bitcoin development for these past few early years.

**People are starting to see through your bullshit**

Due to your utter incompetence / corruption, you're going to be ousted from your position of power at some point.

So just keep fucking up - keep defending Blockstream with your stupid nit-picking points when everyone else is defending Bitcoin from outrageous attacks by Blockstream and its associates. 

More and more people are starting to realize that you and your devs are mediocre when it comes to coding and downright [toxic](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4klqtg/people_are_starting_to_realize_how_toxic_gregory/) when it comes to project management, user experience design and community relations (with both users and devs) - on top of being utterly ignorant when it comes to [economics](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=author%3Aydtm+economics&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) - which is why, despite spending tens of millions of dollars and years of efforts trying to hijack Bitcoin for your own unknown purposes, you have utterly failed to stop the constant and growing tide of resistance against your efforts to hijack Bitcoin - because people still want Satoshi's Bitcoin, and no matter how hard you try, you'll never been able to persuade them to give that up for Blockstream's overpriced, slow, confusing pseudo-Bitcoin.

I understand why people want to do the hard fork, really I get the point of bailing people who lost out to slockit's incompetence. A lot of them believed in Ethereum and wanted to support it.

I think where we are not connecting maybe is: we either have (a) a network capable of running unstoppable applications or (b) a network that can stop an application if enough political capital is gained.

People here are proposing this may be the foundation of a new model for an internet interface, web3, I'm not a big fan of the name and think a better client could be made and I have been working on one. I agree that there is a potential for a new way to develop a conception of how the internet can be structured in a more decentralized way. 

If we are going to agree this could possibly be that, a new possibly improved form of internet. It must not be allowed to have its applications be stopped and we can not start putting political code in the protocol.

If this is a new internet, ask yourself would we ever let someone modify the TCP/IP protocol to specifically add in politics that benefit a select group of people? Even if it was a new concept, that would not justify building in censorship tools. We should be equally as outraged at the concept with Ethereum if anyone is going to take it seriously.

If this is as important as everyone here agrees it is, we should not be compromising something with this much importance's integrity so quickly into the life of it. 

**Yes, 150 million is a lot of money, but please let me try to explain why its not meaningless loss.**

It shows Ethereum's price to manipulate the blockchain is above 150 million. You must have more than 150 million and hopefully much much more , you can't change anything for political reasons and the economic wall functions to prevent changes to the ledger. The blockchains value relates to this being very high because more money can be safely stored. In the case of Ethereum,  *this becomes proof the design requires more than 150 million to manipulate it, which would be assuring everyone they could trust it for more serious things, like a possibly a decentralized news organization or other structures that would require a lot of trust.*

Honestly if you want a network with a flexible database, it may be better to do a delegated proof of stake and have a permission DB. It would be much faster, easier to shard and more efficient than the current version of Ethereum, Ethereum is interesting because it is using a blockchain. The blockchain's entire design is to create an economic wall to prevent anyone from modifying the ledger so we can all trust it. Everyone regardless of culture can trust they can use it and its equitable as we can engineer it. It remains a country neutral global computer that can be something to connect everyone regardless of culture.

Yes, it sucks that ""bad"" guys go free, but its the same sacrifice in a modern justice system, we have to allow some guilty people walk to ensure no one is wrongly punished. We don't want to even give the chance for a contract being wrongly punished and shut down because the majority of shareholders want to program their political system/beliefs into the protocol level of the new internet. It should just be a piece of engineering, politics should be on a higher level. 

What makes Bitcoin so valuable is that its not manipulatable, which for a currency also means not counterfeitable. We can calculate right now roughly how much money it would take to try to attack the network based on electricity use. It is a very large number and growing. If we do this we are setting the price to change the ledger in Ethereum, and thats just a bad use of a blockchain. 

If we hard fork, we are setting a price, even if it changes over time, we are saying if you gain x amount of political capital you can change the ledger and add politics, and that level of politics should not be built into the protocol.",2016-07-03 11:45:26

In other words, **the linked posts contain links to posts from small-blockers who use the terminology ""dev consensus""** - which is the evidence you were asking for.

Of course, you have to *click one additional time* to get to the citations you were looking for. 

And I could possibly apologize for the fact that I already provided this evidence before - but really it's not my fault that we've been fighting here over basically the same issue for the past few years, and that there's already plenty of *old* posts refuting your tired arguments, so there's not much need to keep writing new ones. 

Because remember, the argument here is simple: **Bitcoin needs bigger blocks now, and your so called ""dev consensus"" against such a thing is mere propaganda / illusion.**

---

Plus, in addition to earlier posts from me providing the evidence you asked for, I also included a generalized web search for the terms:

""dev consensus"" bitcoin

which also provided more of the evidence you asked for - from all over the web, and from various sources.

---

So... I gave you the evidence you requested - from old posts by me, and from other sources too.

The fact that this evidence is not ""novel"" is entirely irrelevant. It's also not even complicated or interesting. 

In fact, it's simple and boring: 

**Bitcoin needs bigger blocks, and small-blockers falsely claim some kind of non-existent ""dev consensus"" as one of their tactics for attempting to oppose this common-sense scaling approach.**

Yes it's simple and boring and we've heard it all before because I and countless other Bitcoin users have said it all before - but that isn't really something you can object to: if anything, it's simply more evidence of how long you've been wrong and how long people have been aware of this.

You are being more obtuse than usual today, by pretending not to see these things. Maybe you're just stressed or tired. It must be exhausting having to semi-defend non-existent devs who support your stupid non-scaling approaches by sabotaging academic publications.

A tip: Don't attack the people who are denouncing Cobra. Don't even worry about whether they night have (understandably) gotten confused into thinking that Cobra is associated with Core/Blockstream due to the fact that he owns the site where Core/Blockstream publishes its non-scaling roadmap and stuff.

Instead, try being simple and straightforward for a change: **Join the people who are denouncing Cobra for his attempt to sabotage academic publications.**

It's really that simple. Instead you prefer to waste everyone's time playing your stupid little games of hair-splitting and semantics, when instead you should just take the short and sweet approach and **denounce academic sabotage.**

Or is that too simple and boring for you to do?

The fact of the matter is, ""dev consensus"" is a term which is frequently used by small-blockers trying to create an illusion of support for their lunacy.

Obviously, I didn't invent the term. I cite it as an example of dangerous propaganda which should be recognized so that it can be rejected.

Plenty more citations can easily be found via a simple web search:

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bitcoin+%22dev+consensus%22&amp;ia=web

Basically, Core/Blockstream with your toxic attitudes towards devs and users chased away all the sane devs who know that the simplest and safest scaling for Bitcoin right now is moderate blocksize increases within the limits of the current hardware and infrastructure (somewhere around 4 MB, according to the Cornell study and studies by /u/jtoomim) - and voilà, you claim you have something called ""dev consensus"" when all the devs who you *didn't* chase away magically happen to agree with your too-little too-late overly-complex roadmap.

The very fact that bitcoin.org felt the need to publish a list of 57 signatories to your so-called roadmap - signatories where you now admit some are ""non-existent"" - is of course an implicit use of the term ""dev consensus"" - trying to create the illusion that the ""experts"" support your so-called roadmap - when you yourself now admit that some of those ""experts"" are actually ""non-existent"".

On top of that, I've corresponded with Cobra in the past and it seemed clear to me that Cobra knew nothing about what was going on inside blockstream. So much so that I don't mind outright refuting the claim without equivocation.

Beyond that, your argument fails basic logic:  You might as well argue that Bitcoin Classic wants to rewrite the Bitcoin Whitepaper. If Cobra's anonymity means that maybe he secretly works for Blockstream, then it no less means that maybe he secretly works for Bitcoin Classic or MIT DCI (both groups who keep their specific sources of funding secret) or Roger Ver, or space aliens or what-not.

d4y0ist,BobAlison,33,"This interview highlights something that's become obvious over the last year or two. Bitcoin is an immature technology that's too often treated as a mature technology.

Mature technologies are invisible to users, who seldom know how or why the thing they're using works. Since the title mentions cars, the automobile is a prime example. It's a luxury to use a mature technology like a car. But in the early days you needed to be an mechanical expert to use one. Not much fun for the nontechnical, and quite risky.

A lot of the ""problems"" the Bitcoin community is accused of seem to relate directly to this problem. We're dealing with an extremely immature technology. Yet users too often approach (and promote) it as if it were mature.

This exposes users to manipulation by people with persuasive skills and an agenda. One manifestation is the con artist, who deliberately tries to deceive. Folks like Craig Wright understand this situation very well and can use it to great advantage. Another is the sincere non-technical user. And there's a spectrum of disinformation sources in-between.

This phenomenon was on full display during the height of the block size limit brouhaha. Time and again, users were dubious of the distinction between hard and soft forks, leading to dark conspiracy theories about why the limit wasn't being raised.

More recently, Lightning Network has been attacked as a Bilderberg-led plot to corral Bitcoin users into a centrally-run financial system.

This also plays out in daily personal tragedies like users failing to back up and losing large sums of money, or failing to understand the profoundly negative privacy consequences of combining AML/KYC with a public block chain.

In fact, the information asymmetry problem rears its head in just about any discussion of security, privacy, fungibility, extensibility, or incentives I can remember.

Correlation is equal to Covariance(X,Y) / Stdev(X)Stdev(Y), and covariance = SUM((X - averageX)(Y - averageY))/n.  When we use the actual X and Y instead of change, we get a big clump of Xs that are all somewhat close to one another, and same for the Ys.  This can create a garbage result in either direction, but I think more often the numerator overwhelms the denominator.  For example, consider the following series:  5, 5.5, 5.3, 5.8, 6, 5.5.  The standard deviation is 0.35, which is a tiny portion of the average value of 5.52  In contrast, the standard deviation of the change is 8%, which is a huge percentage of the average (absolute) value of the change: 7%.  The former kind of gets lost as statistical noise. 

The closest I can offer to real intuition for why statisticians almost always use the change in a variable is that it's the change that we almost always care about, right?  The absolute level of bitcoin or the absolute level of transaction volume has no inherent meaning to us.  What we're trying to explain is whether bitcoin will go *up* or *down* based on an *increase* or *decrease* in transaction volume.

Or one last way to think about it: when you do statistics on a time series, the equations don't know or care where a particular value is in the time series.  It doesn't differentiate between the first and last value.  But obviously *we* do care, since we're trying to identify causality.  ",2016-07-04 11:38:35

So... TL;DR: If the new counterparty-free hard asset Bitcoin becomes a powerful currency, then companies like AXA (and most other members of the Bilderberg Group) will lose trillions of dollars since they will no longer be able to control the world with their legacy ledger of debt-based ""fantasy fiat"" which they ~~ninja-mine~~ quantitatively-ease (QE) into existence out of thin air - hence they are trying to quietly destroy Bitcoin, by ""investing"" in Blockstream and strangling the network with artificially tiny 1 MB blocks.

But on paper, they're not. This is no different than if I made a site called ""FlowerSlots"" and all you do is take pictures of different flowers, put them in the slot machine and see if you win more pictures of flowers or lose.... but then a different website, exchanges those pictures of flowers for USD currency.

Even if they were the owners of a site like OP Skins (which they aren't), as long as they are 2 different LLC companies, I'm like 98% sure it's still legal, however you still could argue a pretty good case it's online gambling. **HOWEVER**... if you could in any way shape or form buy skins on their site using USD **OR** they have a currency called ""Credits"" on their site to play ""ULTRA"" if they let you pay with USD to buy these credits and play the games, then it would be illegal, but they don't.

""I'm just going to post this one last message on the topic, I feel we all each are starting to understand each other's positions. We may disagree but at least we can't say we didn't try to understand each others position to the best of our ability.

I understand why people want to do the hard fork, really I get the point of bailing people who lost out to slockit's incompetence. A lot of them believed in Ethereum and wanted to support it.

I think where we are not connecting maybe is: we either have (a) a network capable of running unstoppable applications or (b) a network that can stop an application if enough political capital is gained.

People here are proposing this may be the foundation of a new model for an Internet interface, web3, I'm not a big fan of the name and think a better client could be made and I have been working on one. I agree that there is a potential for a new way to develop a conception of how the Internet can be structured in a more decentralized way.

If we are going to agree this could possibly be that, a new possibly improved form of Internet. It must not be allowed to have its applications be stopped and we can not start putting political code in the protocol.

If this is a new Internet, ask yourself would we ever let someone modify the TCP/IP protocol to specifically add in politics that benefit a select group of people? Even if it was a new concept, that would not justify building in censorship tools. We should be equally as outraged at the concept with Ethereum if anyone is going to take it seriously.

If this is as important as everyone here agrees it is, we should not be compromising something with this much importance's integrity so quickly into the life of it.

Yes, 150 million is a lot of money, but please let me try to explain why its not meaningless loss.

It shows Ethereums price to manipulate the blockchain is above 150 million. You must have more than 150 million and hopefully much much more , you can't change anything for political reasons and the economic wall functions to prevent changes to the ledger. The blockchains value relates to this being very high because more money can be safely stored. In the case of Ethereum, this becomes proof the design requires more than 150 million to manipulate it, which would be assuring everyone they could trust it for more serious things, like a possibly a decentralized news organization or other structures that would require a lot of trust.

Honestly if you want a network with a flexible database, it may be better to do a delegated proof of stake and have a permission DB. It would be much faster, easier to shard and more efficient than the current version of Ethereum, Ethereum is interesting because it is using a blockchain. The blockchains entire design is to create an economic wall to prevent anyone from modifying the ledger so we can all trust it. Everyone regardless of culture can trust they can use it and its equitable as we can engineer it. It remains a country neutral global computer that can be something to connect everyone regardless of culture.

Yes, it sucks that ""bad"" guys go free, but its the same sacrifice in a modern justice system, we have to allow some guilty people walk to ensure no one is wrongly punished. We don't want to even give the chance for a contract being wrongly punished and shut down because the majority of shareholders want to program their political system/beliefs into the protocol level of the new Internet. It should just be a piece of engineering, politics should be on a higher level.

What makes Bitcoin so valuable is that its not manipulatable, which for a currency also means not counterfeitable. We can calculate right now roughly how much money it would take to try to attack the network based on electricity use. It is a very large number and growing. If we do this we are setting the price to change the ledger in Ethereum, and thats just a bad use of a blockchain.

If we hard fork, we are setting a price, even if it changes over time, we are saying if you gain x amount of political capital you can change the ledger and add politics, and that level of politics should not be built into the protocol.""",2016-07-05 21:53:23

Similarly, with the Lightning Network (particularly when used on top of an artificially-constrained main chain), ""anyone"" can (in theory) ""settle on chain at any time,"" but *everyone* can't because of the main chain's limited transactional capacity. So it seems that the Lightning Network presents the potential for a ""bank run""-type systemic failure, but instead of being caused by a shortage of ""cash in the vaults,"" it's caused by a shortage of ""tellers."" Now that might not sound as bad: ""Well, ok, but there's enough money in the system for all 'depositors' to ultimately be repaid in full, it just might take longer than people like because of this really long line that's being serviced by only a single teller.""

If there is *any* doubt if LN will work, it should not be forced on a 10 billion (and rising) USD economy by an unelected group. No doubt they are bright people. They are free to innovate, but on their own side project.

Add to that, the LN  user process is *more* complicated than vainilla bitcoin, which is the last thing BTC needs. It is already too complicated for many users, which is hurting adoption (and price) massively. 

There are millions of people interested in BTC and drawn by the rising prices, but scared off by  i) crooked exchanges, ii) complicated UIs, and iii) poor security. iv) what they see as an experiment dominated by elitist techies. This elitist myth is 90% false, especially on this subreddit, but these are the blocks BTC has to overcome.
 
The most popular sites in the world: Kickstarter, Google, Wikipedia, Medium, stripped the User Interface *down*. Busy people like minimal. Thelonius Monk: ""Simple ain't easy""

How is LN going to work when it adds a layer of hassle to buying? The best apps save people mouse clicks. The difference between 4 clicks and 10 can make or break a site. Some developers don't get that, and blame the 'stupid user' as their VC money runs dry.

Developers are people who will spend 5 hours programmming an upload form. Users have 5 seconds of patience, and 100 alternative choices in every industry. Some CS geniuses just don't get that. 

I don't think instant transactions are necessary right now. 15 mins is an acceptable time to wait if there are other positive tradeoffs, like simplicity and stable, organic scaling. I always thought buying a coffee with a smartphone was overkill. 

So Core are going in the wrong direction. They won't be able to keep their promises. If they step aside or increase the block size a little, I think people will have a lot of respect for them. They can spend the next 50 years making brilliant apps in a hundred billion dollar economy. If they don't start to listen, they will wake up one day and find that people have made their own solution. It's already happening now.

You can't scrute the Chinese. I've seen Westerners, especially Americans, dealing with Asians a lot out here. The western businessman will make a lot of promises he can't keep. The Chinese will listen and maybe superficially agree, because of face-saving culture, and the way that some westerners tend to brow-beat Asians. There's a South Park episode that shows this.

So if Core don't respect everyone's common sense interests, they will force the network to come up with its own fix. I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese are ready to switch to a new protocol within a few weeks. If they do that, Core will look bad. Or maybe there will be a shaky technical transition period which affects the public perception/price negatively. If that happens, Core will look bad. Or maybe the standoff will continue. If that happens, Core will look bad. Sorry, that's how I see it. We've been patient.

So I would step aside, or just adopt a simple, popular, 2-4MB solution. Respect the wishes of the majority and stop trying to paint us as cranky conspiracy theorists.

The value of the halvening 4 years from now is not the same as the one in a few days.  As the event approaches, it becomes relevant on ever-shorter timescales and thus affects the price differently.  People investing on decade-scale timelines have already considered the next few halvenings accordingly.  Someone trading on a daily scale does not, instead considering what it will entail as a news event, or the short-term effects on miner economics, etc.

There's also the huge issue of risk; future halvenings don't matter if you think it unlikely that Bitcoin will survive that long.  Every day that Bitcoin doesn't fail changes this risk assessment, and therefore the consideration that future halvenings must have.

d53g16f,Capt_Roger_Murdock,40,"One of the huge problems with the article is that it assumes we're ""at a point on the curve"" where increasing the block size limit would decrease ""decentralization"" which isn't necessarily the case. Assume for example that the current block size limit were 0.5 kb, thus allowing for exactly one average-sized transaction per block. I think pretty clearly increasing the block size limit from there to say 50 kb (thereby allowing a 100-fold increase in throughout) would represent a net *increase* in the ""decentralization"" of the Bitcoin network by any reasonable metric. And even if we *are* at a point where further increases in the limit would result in a decrease in ""decentralization,"" it still becomes a question of whether or not the trade-off is worth it (e.g., if we could increase on-chain throughout 1,000-fold at the cost of a 0.0001 percent reduction in ""decentralization,"" that would presumably be a no-brainer). [Related thoughts here.](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-671#post-23562) Another major problem I see with the article is the way it ignores the tradeoffs / added risks that are inherent in any layer two solution.

Edit: Someone in the other thread asked me if I was sure I understood the difference between throughout and decentralization. I think my response made some good points so I've reproduced it below.

&gt;Yep, pretty sure (although obviously one of the tricky points here is that there's no single agreed-upon measure for ""decentralization""). But the goal of decentralization is censorship-resistance. The point behind my extreme example is that at a certain point, your attempts to guard against censorship result in self-censorship. In other words, if you cripple yourself in an effort to prevent others from hurting you, what good is that? Back to my example, I think it's pretty clear that a block size limit that allowed literally one non-Coinbase transaction per block would not result in a healthy ""decentralized"" Bitcoin ecosystem -- *again, by any reasonable metric*. How many of the world's 7 billion people would have a prayer of opening or closing a LN payment channel with a main chain that allowed a maximum of about 50,000 transactions per year? (BtW, it occurred to me after my original comment that blocks would have to be bigger than 0.5 kb to allow for coinbase transaction and assorted overhead, not that it's important to the point I'm making.)",2016-07-08 07:10:42

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4rqspr/dont_increase_the_block_size_for_bitcoin/d53dv08

&gt;  This is a great article, but it doesn't address one particular point that needs to be discussed.

&gt; Even though things like the Lightning Network are capable of offloading a huge number of payment transactions from the main bitcoin network, it still requires on-chain transaction pressure for end users to open and close payment channels, or rebalance those channels, over time.

&gt; First, it is important to note that this is not a short term problem. In the short term, simply removing payment transactions from the main blockchain should free up a lot of on-chain capacity for new users to open and close channels.
However, there are real limits here as well. Eventually, there will not be enough on chain capacity to support the number of new users who wish to open and close payment channels.

&gt; Once again, this is not a short term problem, but it is a long term one.
Once this becomes the case, there are two ways to solve the problem. First, we could raise the main bitcoin blocksize to accommodate more channel open/close requests. However, as this article argues well, this may not be desirable.
The other solution would be to on-ramp new users via two-way-pegged sidechains (another piece of technology which does not yet exist). A two-way-pegged sidechain functions essentially as a 'shard' of the main bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to transact value which is 100% pegged to bitcoin on the main chain, safely and securely, 

&gt; Another benefit of sidechains is that there can be many of them, each suited for particular markets, use cases, volume, security, and value.
One of the most remarkable aspects of the Lightning Network is that it can freely inter-operate across multiple sidechains at the same time, so long as they offer the same requisite cryptographic features as the bitcoin network provides.

&gt; There is now a clear path forward to scale bitcoin to support every use case, every person in the world, and even every single device in the world, so long as we proceed carefully and are patient for these new layered technologies to come online.

If Bitcoin doesn't switch from Core to something else then Bitcoin will most likely fail and be replaced by another CryptoCoin with developers working to scale the Network and improve capacity.

d53ff95,aminok,12,"If major hacks of contracts are not reversed, it will lead to consumers smartening up and not investing their money in contracts without doing proper due diligence. That was the result of the MtGox hack on Bitcoin. The aftermath was much more secure exchanges and much more diligent consumers. Not reversing the hack eventually made Bitcoin stronger.

&gt;""In the department of economy, an act, a habit, an institution, a law, gives birth not only to an effect, but to a series of effects. Of these effects, the first only is immediate; it manifests itself simultaneously with its cause - it is seen. The others unfold in succession - they are not seen: it is well for us, if they are foreseen. Between a good and a bad economist this constitutes the whole difference - the one takes account of the visible effect; the other takes account both of the effects which are seen, and also of those which it is necessary to foresee. Now this difference is enormous, for it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favourable, the ultimate consequences are fatal, and the converse. Hence it follows that the bad economist pursues a small present good, which will be followed by a great evil to come, while the true economist pursues a great good to come, - at the risk of a small present evil.""

d53ljhj,carlosliza,12,"My comments on the article:

If keeping the block size artificially small is good, then why not lower block size to 100kB? According to the author's reasoning, the smaller the better, right? What the article does not address is that the block size will need to be increased eventually if Bitcoin is to succeed.

There are some problems with the author's reasoning:

1. ""Raising the blocksize breaks those parameters, hence everyone must upgrade at once, or else be kicked off the network.""
a. In XT and Classic implementations there is a grace period to upgrade after the countdown to the hard fork is triggered.
b. The way Bitcoin or any other standard work is: either you follow the economic majority, or else (you become irrelevant). Deal with it, it's the way the world works and I hope libertarians agree with this. So, yes, in case of a hard fork, either you upgrade, or else.
c. If a hard fork is so catastrophic and Bitcoin is to grow, the sooner the hard fork is made, the better. Less people would need to upgrade and there would be less disruption.

2. ""As much as you think you know about Bitcoin, these guys know and have considered more.""
This is my favorite. An appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. It is impossible to dispute it because Core developers (""these guys"") will always know more than you, no matter how hard you try. Such a statement and all the reasoning that derives from it have no place in a rational debate and ought to be outright dismissed.

3. ""So Roger and his allies have resorted to acting like politicians""
Well, they have freedom of speech as you do, don't they? Core's allies have resorted to manipulation and censorship, like politicians I guess.

Bottom line:
The reason why miners don't increase block size right now is the same reason why people don't refuse socialism right now.
Because it is hard to fool people when it comes to money, the block size will eventually be increased no matter how hard the small blockists try or Bitcoin will die.

If Bitcoin does not fork and money goes to an altcoin, that altcoin will eventually have a governance crisis and will need to fork. The development team of Bitcoin Core or any altcoin may be made of brilliant people, but they aren't gods -- they are still humans. They will eventually have bad ideas and try to impose them so the coin will have to fork or die. If Bitcoin overcomes this crisis without forking, it will have to fork later when another crisis arises or a successor altcoin will have to fork at some point.

If a cryptocurrency cannot successfully fork (according to the author a hard fork is dangerous) then the whole idea of cryptocurrencies is dead and we had better go back to government-controlled money. I have faith that Bitcoin or an altcoin will be able to fork successfully. What I don't know is when it will happen or whether an altcoin has taken over Bitcoin by then or not.

We should overcome the idea that forks are terrible. Forks are a normal and healthy way of solving disagreements in an anarchist society.

Proponents of removing the artificial and centrally planned limit on the Bitcoin block size right now want that Bitcoin forks before it becomes irrelevant and an altcoin has to fork.",2016-07-08 09:28:05

d53we05,FreeToEvolve,11,"&gt; Then miners will have to charge many times more for fees, that will snowball to offset the increasing lack of transactions. Lightning network will further starve the blockchain from fees

This sequence of declarations has so many contradictions that I don't know where to start.  

First, miners don't *charge* fees.  They accept the highest fees into their blocks.  Meaning that if fees increase, it is *only* because there are transactions to *choose* from.  Or users are *competing* to get theirs included.  So there are low fee and high fee transactions and they have ignored the ones with low fees due to running out of block space after accepting the ones with higher fees.

Second, if transaction volume is *low* then they will accept whatever fee they can get since their mined coins are only valuable because they are confirming transactions.  $2 in fees is better than nothing.  Whatever the largest amount of fees they can accumulate, no matter how small that amount may be, is what they will include in a block.  There is literally no situation in which miners can ""charge"" fees or that ""high fees means few transactions"" that makes even a modicum of sense.

Third, lightning network will do the *exact opposite* for the network in regards to fees.  By making each on-chain transaction the conglomeration of thousands of *off-chain* transactions, users/channel holders can pay far more in fees and still pull a profit.  It would have the effect of lowering individual transaction fees, while *significantly* raising the final fee for the on-chain channel close out.  (Basically splitting a very large fee over hundreds small transactions)

Who are the underserved? Poor people? If that's what you mean, they _definitely_ care about transaction fees.

&gt; In their mistaken zeal to keep Bitcoin cheap, Roger Ver and his supporters are pushing policies that jeopardize the health of the network.

Like what? Do you mean that 2MB (or  even 20MB!) blocks are jeopardizing the health of the network?

&gt; Raising the blocksize breaks those parameters, hence everyone must upgrade at once

A hardfork would obviously be orchestrated, just like softforks are (albeit the same method(s) aren't possible as all nodes absolutely need to upgrade).

&gt; Lightning Network can scale Bitcoin to thousands or millions of transactions per second and reach everyone in the world, with no such tradeoff [of raising the blocksize]

Scaling to thousands of transactions absolutely needs an increase. Have you even read about Lightning Network?

&gt; Telling this select group of developers on why the blocksize should be raised is like lecturing Tom Brady on how to throw a football

So other people don't have a valid opinion.

&gt; but cheap is not what Bitcoin’s real users are looking for.

How can you claim this?  
EDIT: Also, isn't using ""real users"" a bit of a No True Scotsman?

&gt; Critics of this viewpoint say that we don’t want Core experts running a monetary system, like the Federal Reserve’s army of economists. This comparison is disingenuous at best. The Fed makes quasi-economic/political decisions that affect everyone, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate. Bitcoin is a voluntary software program, and if you don’t like their policies, there is no shortage of altcoins you’re welcome to use. 

This is such a silly argument. Bitcoin Core does not _own_ bitcoin, that's why they call themselves Bitcoin Core and separated from Bitcoin.org. So the argument that you should go to an altcoin if you don't like the polices of Core is just mindbogglingly ignorant.  
So who really owns bitcoin? Everyone, including miners whom have showed support for a blocksize increase hardfork.

&gt; As libertarians, we believe in markets as the way to test ideas and products, not politics. Well, the market has tested Roger Ver’s ideas over and over again. Supporters of increasing the blocksize launched Bitcoin XT, which failed to gain adoption. Then, once their most prominent supporter departed Bitcoin in a whiny ragequit, they launched Bitcoin Unlimited, which also failed to gain adoption. And after that, they launched Bitcoin Classic, and…. well, you guessed it; it failed to gain adoption.

BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic are three _different_ teams. Who are ""they""?

In regular programming, a hack is a generally inelegant solution that works, but does so by exploiting some bit of functionality that wasn't really meant to be used that way, etc.  

In more 'traditional' hacking, you're exploiting systems in the code.  It could be exploiting buffer overflows, tricks to elevate permissions, etc. etc.  The target was designed as a system to protect against malicious use, but due to complexity, they tend to be exploitable.

Social engineering is just another example of this; there are systems in place to try to protect your account information, but good security is often very user hostile.  Think about how many people have lost Bitcoin; it's a secure system (though you still have to follow best practices to make sure you don't use a compromised system) but just one mistake and there's no undo button.

For companies, you can make your customer service responsive and empowered, but then they become easy to exploit.  If you set up more secure systems, customers complain that 'they're no help'.

d55gwvt,ProHashing,22,"The default client does not handle the money transmission application very well.  For example:

* It isn't possible to send money to multiple recipients, a task which bitcoin does easily.  We create 100 separate Ethereum transactions per day to send money, which is half as many as the 159 transactions we create in the 159 other coins combined.

* It queues sends if there isn't enough ether available in the account, which can result in huge losses of money.  We lost hundreds of dollars the other week when we resent payouts after one of the exchanges did not execute a timely withdrawal.  We found that the failed payouts had been queued in memory and that they went out first, and then they went out again because we had resent them.  In banking, transactions must be atomic, and either succeed or fail immediately.

* You can't lock in the transaction fee until after the money is sent, and the fee reduces the amount of money the recipient receives.  There are many applications where you need to pay a certain price for something, and paying an exact price is difficult in Ethereum.  

I edited this post to state that while it is possible to figure out how was spent on gas, you can't get a guarantee on that until after the transaction is committed.  With every other coin, the workflow is BEGIN a new database transaction, insert all payout rows and see if there is a CHECK constraint violation for negative balances, then attempt to execute payouts in one sendmany. if failed then rollback, otherwise update the rows in the same transaction with the transaction fee and commit the transaction.  In that workflow, you are guaranteed to have the database consistent with the actual payouts.  The CHECK constraint violations are critical for preventing massive losses if there is an unforeseen bug in some other component of the system.

&gt;When the DAO failed, the markets overreacted. There is no doubt about it. Ethereum's value was cut in half overnight. When viewed pragmatically this makes zero sense. Ethereum is and never has been about the DAO.

1 Ethereum's loss in value simply paralleled the artificial creation in value as people bought ETH to feed the DAO.  The rally from $7 (or at least $10) to $20+ was entirely because of the DAO.  The bubble burst and we're simply returning to pre-bubble levels, at least at first.

2  Supply and demand.  The dissolution of the DAO will flood the market with supply - ETH that was intended for active investment that people now have absolutely nothing to do with.  A decent chunk will be sold on the open market.  This is separate from rational/irrational fundamentals; it's simply reality.  Some % of the ETH purchases that drove the price up in April and May will be sold because they were bought for reasons that no longer exist.

3  The DAO failure revealed that the ethereum network isn't ready for smart contracts with financial liability.  Developers can't yet write secure code and we haven't yet developed best practices to deal with the inevitable problems.  There's a whole lot of both social and programmatic infrastructure that needs to be built before ethereum is ready for prime time.  In other words, the DAO failure revealed that ethereum is still in Beta, both culturally and in terms of coding smart contracts.

Ethereum is 6-12 months away from being useful for anything.  It's where bitcoin was in 2010.  Fair value today is $4 imo.

No, it's not. Visa is a dollar-denominated credit transfer system. It's important to understand how Visa is different from Bitcoin, even though both can be used as payment.

&gt; Credit is not real money, but can be used for payment. 

&gt; You own money because you control them, either because you have them in your pocket or because you are the only one who knows the keys.

&gt; Credit is not real money, but can be used for payment, it is even better for some purposes.

&gt; Credit is an agreement for you to receive the money in the future. You own the contract, but you don't own the money. You depend on that the debtor is able and willing to pay.

&gt; One severe problem with credit, is that while it exists (before it is paid back or defaulted on), it affects the demand and supply curves for real money and thus has a downward price effect on money.

&gt;To compare it to a traditional IOU, let's say you hand me an ounce of gold in exchange for a little piece of paper that says ""Roger Murdock agrees to pay to bearer on demand 1 ounce of gold."" One of the risks with this arrangement is obviously that when you show up with your IOU and ask for your gold back, I might not be able to give it to you because I simply don't have it anymore (e.g., maybe I lost it or traded it for booze or female companionship). ""But hey, with the LN, the other party can't (easily) run away with your funds because they're locked up in the payment channel."" Well, ok, great. The other risk with the traditional IOU is that even if I have the gold, I might refuse to hand it over when you present me with the IOU. ""But hey, with the LN, the 'IOU' is an unbroadcast Bitcoin transaction. All you have to do to ensure that it's honored is broadcast it to the network and succeed in having it mined into a block in a timely manner."" Well, ok, but there's the rub, right? There are no guarantees that you'll be able to do that.

d56nwzx,jstolfi,19,"&gt;  the most they could do is delay transactions and do doublespends during that time

A single miner (or a cartel with majority of hashpower) would probably have no motivation to do double-spends, but it could dictate transaction fees and policies, blacklist addesses or IPs, impose any soft-forks that it wanted, and even impose hard forks.

It all will depend on how many users are dependent upon their services.  That is how banks can get by with high fees, reduced service hours, transfer delays, etc.: they know that people will rather submit than do without their service.  

A monopolistic bitcoin miner, or a majority mining cartel, would have a nearly captive user base of drug users, ransomware victims, and the like.  It would also have good leverage over clients who use it for tax evasion, bribes, and other assorted criminal or socially reprehensible payments.  A drug user would not mind paying 10% of the transaction value as miner's fee, and would not care if the miner is blacklisting some business, charging demurrage tax on long-term holders, or imposed a hard fork that restored the 50 BTC block reward with no halvings.",2016-07-10 23:26:48

and

[**Don't Increase the Block Size for Bitcoin Transactions**](https://fee.org/articles/dont-increase-the-block-size-for-bitcoin-transactions/)

(Spoiler alert: the reason we can't increase the block size limit is ... ""decentralization."") BTW, I think this is my favorite part:

&gt;The Bitcoin developers are experienced programmers and cryptographers, and they’re most certainly not ignorant of economics. They have spent years studying every line of the source code, developing new features, and understanding the economic ramifications of those changes. As much as you think you know about Bitcoin, these guys know and have considered more. You can have an hours-long conversation with someone like Peter Todd or Eric Lombrozo on things like UTXOs, Merkle Trees, Block Headers, or other dense topics.

&gt;Telling this select group of developers on why the blocksize should be raised is like lecturing Tom Brady on how to throw a football.​

There are no words.

Anyways, I've already [written at length](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/page-671#post-23562) about why I think this basic argument is garbage, but I had a few additional thoughts I wanted to share. The small-blockists seem to assume that an increase in the block size limit *always* translates into a decrease in ""decentralization"" (however the hell that's defined). After thinking about it some more, I think there's an easy way to demonstrate pretty convincingly that this is false. More specifically, I think you can show that, **at least for a block size limit below a certain threshold of ""smallness,"" it is clear that increasing the limit will result in more ""decentralization"" (by any reasonable metric for ""decentralization"")**.

The first thing to note is that the ""smallness"" of a particular block size limit should be viewed as being *relative* to the amount of transactional demand that exists. (Thus, the 1-MB limit wasn't particularly ""small"" at the time it was put in place, but it is becoming increasingly ""small"" as transactional demand continues to grow.)

With that in mind, imagine a block size limit that would allow for only a single (non-Coinbase) transaction in each block. I don't know exactly how small that would be while still allowing for the Coinbase transaction and the basic block overhead (maybe 1.5 kb?), but it doesn't really matter for the point I want to make. The point is, we're talking about *tiny* blocks and a Bitcoin main chain that would allow for a maximum of about 50,000 transactions per year. Now imagine that transactional demand is simultaneously huge -- all 7 billion people on this planet are attempting to use the Bitcoin blockchain as the backbone for the global financial system. It should be pretty apparent that in this scenario, the Bitcoin ecosystem (if we assume for the moment that it could somehow survive under these absurd conditions) would be *hugely* ""centralized."" The LN would obviously be a complete non-starter. If the world's population formed a line to make a single on-chain transaction to open a LN payment channel, it would take us around *140,000 years* to work our way through that line. That seems unworkable, no? I suppose you could imagine a traditional banking model built on top of the main chain, but clearly the only real use for the actual blockchain would be as a ridiculously-expensive interbank settlement network. Maybe the billionaires of the world could hold some of their wealth on-chain, but everyone else would never touch anything other than Bitcoin IOUs.

The goal of ""decentralization"" is supposedly ""censorship resistance."" The point behind my extreme example is that, **at a certain point, attempts to guard against censorship effectively result in self-censorship**. In other words, **it makes no sense to try to protect Bitcoin against attacks ... by crippling its functionality**. (""I know. If I cut off my arms and legs, I'll make for a smaller target."")

I'm sure the small-blockists would argue ""well, but you're example is so extreme. *Clearly* at 1-MB we're above the 'threshold' you're referring to, such that further increases in the block size limit would result in decreased 'decentralization.'"" Sorry, but no. First of all, of course my example is extreme. It's intended to be, because that can be a useful way of illustrating a principle. And no, it's not at all clear to me that we're ""at a point on the curve"" where increasing the limit would result in decreased ""decentralization."" (In fact, my strong intuition is that the opposite is true.) So... prove it.

I think my extreme example is also useful for highlighting the fact that the cost of running a full node, looked at in isolation, is obviously NOT a ""reasonable metric for 'decentralization.'"" It's ridiculously simplistic and one-dimensional. Just as an aside, the small blockists probably like this metric because it seems like the one that should *unambiguously* favor the conclusion that ""smaller blocks = moar decentralization,"" but I think that's only *necessarily* true if you take a static view of things. To the extent that larger blocks and a non-crippled Bitcoin fuel much higher levels of adoption and make many more people *want* to run full nodes, that demand should incentivize more businesses to innovate to offer solutions that bring down the cost of doing so. (I admit that argument might not be entirely convincing to the extent that all or most of the costs associated with running a full node involve ""off-the-shelf""-type components. In other words, there are presumably *already* huge incentives for entrepreneurs to bring down the costs of storage, bandwidth, etc. But in any case, I think it's still kind of interesting theoretically as a reminder of the importance not to view things from a static perspective.)

So what's the real takeaway from all this? I mean, who the hell knows where we're at ""on the curve"" and what the optimal block size limit is right now, i.e., the one that most perfectly balances all of the supposed tradeoffs? And who knows what it will be tomorrow since we have to keep in mind that we're dealing with a constantly-shifting target? I think the likely answer is: *no one knows*. Not even Gregory Maxwell, the Tom Brady of cryptocurrency. ""When it is realized that the problem is impossible, the solution becomes simple."" (Ok, I just made that quote up, but it sounds good.) What I mean is that the ""solution"" here is to stop treating the block size limit as a ""hard-coded consensus parameter"" and instead allow the limit to be determined via a flexible, emergent (and decentralized) manner by adopting a Bitcoin Unlimited-type approach.

d57247x,severact,24,"The most plausible scenarios, in my opinion, are:

(1)  Bitcoin never solves the problem that network security is proportional to miner fees.  As the coinbase reward goes down, transaction fees don't rise enough to compensate.  People realize that an X billion dollar currency that can be attacked with only a Y million dollar investment in mining hardware is not very secure, and interest in bitcoin wanes.  As a variation of this hypothetical, an altcoin implements Proof of Stake, gets a lot of traction, PoS turns out to really good and provides excellent security, and bitcoin does not adapt.  Interest in bitcoin dwindles in favor of the altcoin.

(2) Some sort of event relating to miner centralization/collusion is exposed, and confidence in bitcoin tumbles. 

(3) 51% attack by some really well financed government or other entity.

(4) Interest in bitcoin just declines.  For whatever reason (maybe something better comes along, maybe not), people just lose interest in bitcoin and it goes on a long, slow decline to irrelevance. ",2016-07-11 05:55:01

Well let just say quite pathetic. 

 If you let problems like this happen(lack of communication) No matter if the person is at fault and are doing illegal things or whatever...they need to be in the loop at least with progress updates because they then make you look stupid for responding to a tattletale and ""public"" criticism.. and because you then put aside all your rules of business just to stop some stupid rumour type shit on reddit. 

Lets atleast ACT like a professional company (Even if you're  not.)

Btw.. if it is a kyc-type thing then the customer should at least get a nice ""unofficial"" notice that it is the case ..

d56z60j,Rymdbarnet,23,"There was some talk about the winklevoss ETF recently. I was just thinking about the fact that an active ETF would allow a huge inflow of capital into bitcoin, which won't be limited by the transaction/blocksize limit. Capital inflow from the ETF would just mean a lot more bitcoin holders which don't actually use the blockchain. So in the case that the ETF goes live the price can appreciate/bubble freely, even with full 1MB blocks.

A lot of people say that scalability is key for bitcoin to succeed *as a currency*, but for bitcoin *as a store of value* the blocksize limit is pretty much a non-issue.

What do you guys think?",2016-07-11 04:38:50
d57vcgp,pb1x,22,"&gt; The number one reason that Bitcoin has value right now is its promise that Bitcoin will be used and seen as useful by millions of people in the not-so-far future. Any money only has value when enough people think it has value. Any money only has value when it actually can be used. If nobody accepts it for payments, the value will not be realized either.

Bad economics lessons from professor Zander. Bitcoin has value for a million reasons. One of them is payments, which it is currently rarely convenient for due to long block times, fiat conversion costs, privacy issues and many other reasons. There are many many others. The principle reason Bitcoin has value is that it can do things that other currencies can't. That's why almost everything has value, they can do things other things can't. I already have a million ways to make payments. I don't have a million ways to keep my money on a decentralized system without counter-party trust and only using cryptography. So things like this are why Bitcoin has value.

&gt; So the number one goal is to allow millions of people to be able to use Bitcoin in their day-to-day lives. Where 'use' is defined as making at least one transaction a day. As any technology, we don't expect this load to be available tomorrow, or this year because growth happens over time and systems get build over time.

Go up to the average person and ask them if they give a shit about whether their transaction is on the Blockchain. If it works, it works, only the psychotically obsessed are devoted to doing something a certain way and no others are allowed.

&gt; The leadership was not really focused on growth very much of this basic layer

Oh yes, the sign of professionalism is taking shots at people. Show me where on this release history that improvement of the peer to peer network slowed down please: https://thebookofbitcoin.github.io/html/software/bitcoin_core_release_history.html - here is a hint, it didn't, although some people did quit working on it in a very public way.

&gt; This means that our 5-years-in-the-future goal of 50 million transactions per day is already today not an issue for bandwidth and for CPU power. In fact, out baseline system managed to go over it with over a factor of 7.

Not sure if he ever heard that not everything scales linearly. You can't just take an algorithm and say, ok it did it in 5 seconds, guess if I grow the database by 1000 it will scale in 5000 seconds? No, that's not how this works.

I shudder to think about growing the UTXO set by 100 million transactions a day, Core is addressing this in SegWit to some degree but we need to make sure that you don't need a set of super servers to sync the blockchain.

&gt; So I foresee that you will get small communities to gather around full nodes. You can let your family use it, or maybe your football club or church will set one up just to support the community. 

Evidence number one of how disconnected from reality this story is

&gt; Such a node would have no need to keep the full history till block zero. It would turn on pruning.

Pruning doesn't work in that suggested configuration, not as it stands right now

&gt; Next to that is a technique I called ""optimistic mining"" which helps miners by splitting the uploading of blocks into two parts. One is a super fast notification of the new block. Just the block-header. A miner receiving such a header validates it has valid proof of work and then can start mining empty blocks on top. When the full block has arrived and all transactions are seen. All transactions in the mempool are updated to account for the new block, and last, a new block template is created with as many transactions as fit, only then does the miner start mining it.

Optimistic mining is Orwellian-speak for ""validation-less mining"". the empty blocks it's mining on top, they are potentially invalid blocks if the preceding block is not valid. We've already had a chain of six of these validation-less fake blocks happen on the network

&gt; The goal I tried to argue from is 50 million users per day. This goal is a huge increase from today. But to make sure we do it properly, my goal is set 5 years in the future.

50 million transactions a day, in five years. With 1MB today we have around 200k daily transactions. So Zander proposes increasing block size 250x in 5 years. The Blockchain requires 50gb of initial downloading extra per year. This would make that 13 terabytes per year. 

&gt; Smart tricks like Lightning network are not mentioned at all in this document because there is no need for them. 

Incentivized nodes, instantly secure confirms, micro-payments, improved privacy, maintained decentralized peer to peer network without need for centralized heavy servers, those are not needs?

This literally argues for no progress and to just stop validating yourself and trust your Church. This is kind of like the anti-vaccination crowd, the hate for science cannot be countered with more science, because it is just disregarded.

d56r0vs,jstolfi,20,"Peter should heed the first Rule of Good Writing (or Good Lecturing):

1. If you have nothing to say, say nothing.

The name ""fraud proofs"" is misleading and may lead the development astray.  The only way to prove that a block is valid is to check the whole blockchain up to it.  Some violations of the rules can be proved by looking at one or two blocks; but a double-spend in a block B1 can be proved invalid only by verifying that the input was spent in some earlier block B2, and proving that B2 is an ancestor of B1.  (A Bloom filter in each block could help, but may be impractical) .  

A very simple client cannot find B2 on his own, but the party claiming fraud could give him a hint: the number of B2.  Then the client could request B2 from several other miners and peers, trusting that at least one of them will provide the legit B2.  The client would still have to download and save the hashes of all blocks in his view of the blockchain (and check the Merkle links whenever he syncs), to be sure that the B2 he received is indeed an ancestor of B1.

The skip list idea could be used to reduce the number of block hashes that the client must keep. Or the past blocks could be organized into trees, so that the client only has to keep log(N) block hashes and can verify a claim of fraud by fetching log(N) blocks from external sources.

About miners blocking certain transactions: besides that being being hard to detect and impossible to prove, users generally care only about their own transactions.  If the miners decide to block transactions of ""terrorists"", Cubans, or clients of a certain exchange, a user who is not directly affected is unlikely to care. 

The fact that the bitcoin protocol has no official formal spec, independent of any implementation, is by itself an engineering flaw.

Peter should know by now that there is still no engineering sketch of the LN that looks like it might work.  Until such thing exists, the LN should not be mentioned as a solution to the scaling problem.  

Peter mentioned that an isolated payment channel is not very useful because it is rare for Alice to want to make several payments to Bob.  That is bad, but the real problem is that Alice must lock in advance enough coins for *all* future payments to Bob. And there are many other problems...

d56tt42,Emocmo,17,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Since I haven’t had the time to update the overall average chart, I am simply updating the coinbase chart.

In the past two days the triangle/flags or whatever you want to call them have been narrowing.

After the recent from to $611 we quickly reversed upwards, then turned down yesterday.  Today, we’ve reversed into a tentative column of Xs.  That will not be ""official"" until 00:00 GMT.

I added a couple of lines that show the current triangle parameters.  This is not a textbook charting technique found in PnF charts.  However, I think it shows the downward resistance line and the pretty consistent upward support line.  The two lines cross in a day or so.  We need to rise above $670 for a break out and that is on the other side of the resistance line.  In my mind that would be quite bullish.  if we fail to break $670 and turn around and go back down the support lines are at $600 and the long term trend line down to $570.  

That would be unfortunate for us long holders.

I am holding right here.  I would be a buyer above $670.  Under $610, I would expect it to go down to $570-75.

I have always been a skeptical about the halving.  I just don’t see the impetus for a huge move up as a result of that.  The reduction in available coins is pretty small (less than 2%.)  I did a lot of work in my career with queue management.  An shortage of 2%, happening all at one time would be significant.  But spread out over the day?  Its just not going to make that much of an impact.

I DO think this is going to be a messed up economic week.  This might be the week DB finally shits the bed.  This might be the week of greater Yuan debasement.  And certainly, the streets in the US are getting hotter every day.

The run up to the  party conventions in the US might be pretty dramatic.

People feeling uneasy, and unsure where to put their speculative money might look at bitcoin.   I said might.

For those of you listening to Clif High and his web bots, we expects BTC to shoot up to $1k, then quickly reverse to the high $880s for the rest of the summer.  He also thinks next week is going to be ""out of the ordinary.""

I am skeptical of the bitcoin rise to $1k in the next few days.  If we break up out of $700 in the next few days I might be less skeptical.  But I agree that its going to be a hot summer in the markets (all of the markets) until September.

And my silver contracts are nearing 100%.  So, at least that is behaving nicely.  The VXX still pisses me off.

FWIW, on modern fast hardware and without the crazy indexes a full sync currently takes about 8 hours-- and you can get it down to under four if you have a lot of ram and a fast connection and adjust your dbcache.

That said, I feel your pain and the sync times bother me greatly. But there is not going to be any magic solution for users trying to keep full transaction indexes. That kind of usage is inherently unscalable, and you should probably try to figure out how to accomplish what you're trying to accomplish without the extra indexes.

The idea that the blocksize limit somehow keeps us safe is completely insane. Making sure people can continue to use Bitcoin by making sure people can't continue to use Bitcoin is insane. I posted more about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rscf0/halving_timer_and_info_submit_your_bitcoin/d540jwi?context=3) already: 

&gt;The idea that Bitcoiners are protecting Bitcoin from getting taken over by bankers by making sure only people (or systems) who act like bankers (use it for speculation) can use it is utterly insane. Making economic changes without the corresponding economic arguments and data, is utterly insane and irresponsible. Pretending Bitcoin cannot scale via a simple hardfork for merely technical reasons, that is insane but more likely completely dishonest. Being a developer or investor into the most popular cryptocurrency and not making sure that stays that way, is utterly insane. Giving a 5% minority of miners veto power, is utterly insane. Slowly killing of Bitcoin as a payment system, and then expecting the same users you kicked out to transition into Lightning, is utterly insane. Saying the barrier to entry in terms of running a fully validating node is important, yet transaction cost is completely irrelevant, that too is insane.
&gt;The most secure cryptocurrency is one which is not used. Metcalfe be damned.
&gt;You either scale up Bitcoin as much as technically possible (hardware + software) or you allow an alt-coin to take over. It is really that simple.

Maybe this is a sunk cost fallacy for them. 

Your posts clearly show the mental gymnastics Core supporters have to perform to pretend it makes sense. But it doesn't.

&gt; Bitcoin BullBear Price Update for July 12, 2016  

&gt; Market Commentary (BTC):  

&gt; The market is truly compressing within the pennant formation we showed on the daily chart in the Report yesterday, which should lead to a small breakout in the not too distant future (likely going into the weekend).  We continue to think that it will resolve to the upside, however we don't want to get too carried away considering we are still in a large trading range between 550 - 775 $ that will likely not be broken anytime soon.  That said, we could see price pushing up into the 700 - 720 $ resistance area that we have been talking about for weeks, but anymore than that is a stretch in our opinion.

&gt; The technicals are corroborating this idea on the short term charts.  We can see on the 4-hour chart below that SCMR is painting green candles, the Pip Collector is showing another green arrow on the current bar, and we are now above volume profile PoC once again.  Speaking of volume profile, it continues to fill in nicely at lower levels although there are a few notches around 670 $, as well as between 700 - 720 $, that both need to be worked on before this area can be considering fully explored.

&gt; Additionally, momentum is still sending mixed signals given that Willy is almost overbought already, RSI is chopping around in no man's land, and the Stochastic is pulling back.  Not only that, but the 200 SMA continues to flatten asprice is still below it, while the 9/18 EMA cross looks ready to flip back to bullish. Lastly, exchange volumes have fallen off a cliff this week and the A/D line is starting to roll over slightly, both of which are telling us that trading interest is waning for the time being due to the lack of volatility surrounding the halving.  The mixed nature of the technicals continue to make VST ProTrade setups less than optimal, however we think a small shot at slightly lower levels could be worth the risk.

&gt; Despite the fact that we think a rally up into resistance above 700 $ is most definitely possible over the next week or so, we would not be chasing the move at those levels.  The market is still in a wide consolidation range that should persist into August as price continues to contract, which means we want to remain in a ""buy the dips, sell the rips"" mentality for the time being.  While this may be frustrating for some traders, it is important to know that periods of digestion and stagnation typically lead to the biggest and most sustainable rallies (at least from a technical perspective).  Our patience and discipline will pay off eventually, but not before making things more difficult and uncomfortable than we may like.

&gt; GLGT!

d58wnbn,Bunslow,12,"It's a lot easier than you would think. Bitcoin is not anonymous.

Edit since I'm being downvoted: here's a research paper on the matter:

&gt;Bitcoin is an electronic analog of cash in the online
world. It is decentralized: there is no central authority responsible for the
issuance of Bitcoins and there is no need to involve a trusted third-party
when making online transfers. However, this flexibility comes at a price: the
entire history of Bitcoin transactions is publicly available. In this chapter we
investigated the structure of two networks derived from this dataset and their
implications for user anonymity.
Using an appropriate network representation, it is possible to associate
many public-keys with each other, and with external identifying information.
With appropriate tools, the activity of known users can be observed in detail.
This can be performed using a passive analysis only. Active analyses, where
an interested party can potentially deploy ‘marked’ Bitcoins and collaborate
with other users can discover even more information. We also believe that
large centralized services such as the exchanges and wallet services are capable
of identifying and tracking considerable portions of user activity.
Technical members of the Bitcoin community have cautioned that strong
anonymity is not a prominent design goal of the Bitcoin system. However,
casual users need to be aware of this, especially when sending Bitcoins to
users and organizations they would prefer not to be publicly associated with.

d59usfn,kwanijml,8,"&gt;I think there is a bright future for Bitcoin, but it'll only shine when stores start accepting it en masse. 

As an ancap, or at least a market-oriented thinker, you should understand that the only way in which the bitcoin currency is bootstrapped such that stores start accepting it en masse....is for us to first demand it, hold it, long term, for ideological reasons (i.e. not-immediately-obvious reasons of self interest) as a kind of commitment strategy in order to overcome the public goods problem inherent to the production of a new money on the market.

Otherwise, you will need to have a government(s) declare your token to be money and set the initial exchange value.  These are the only two broad ways for money to come about.  Gold took a long, long time (perhaps centuries) to come about as the most universally held and accepted medium of indirect exchange.  That's the ""under production"" of a public good on display.  Markets have ways of overcoming public goods problems (e.g. the free-riding; reply if this doesn't make sense to you in what ways free riding affects the production of a money on a market).  Most of us bitcoin enthusiasts though, are looking at this in a highly entrepreneurial way; we are employing Kirznerian insights regarding the *granularity* of emergent processes, into the bootstrapping of the btc unit into a full-fledged, unit-of-account money...and the primary mechanism right now, is hodling; that us to say: we are consciously acting as the demand sink for bitcoins, while they don't yet have that (catch 22) stability and ubiquity, and arguably don't even have the obvious non-monetary utility that gold and other physical commodities had, which propelled or helped bootstrap them to monetary status.

Bitcoin has far better monetary properties than gold or any other commodity before it....in part because it is not encumbered by relatively large non-monetary use-value....but that is a double-edged sword when it comes to getting the tokens widely, ubiquitous held in the first place, such that the most fine-grained cattalaxy naturally moves the widely held token into position of most saleable unit of indirect exchange.

Buying and holding for the long-term is so important, because a network effect must be created; monies are the ultimate network goods...which differ primarily from other goods in that demand begets demand.  

We are not creatures at the mercy of market failure: we are active shapers of the direction of markets and economies, and we are choosing to lengthen our time-horizons or time preference, and thus find self-interest in bearing the short term costs of free riders and nay-sayers.  Our holding acts as market-making (helping to smooth fluctuations), and helps create fomo-inducing periods (see: bitcoin's price cycles) and the hype necessary to build the network effect and widen the bitcoin holder and user base (and clear it from weak hands).

Even as a fairly risk averse person, I can say with confidence that in 10 years, I won't miss, say, $1000 that I don't spend right now on junk, or getting a new vehucle earlier, or even mortgage payments....but as a nearly binary value proposition that is a fledgling money (moon or bust), I will notice the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of dollars worth of increase that that small investment into bitcoin produced.

d5akw4j,Ikkinn,8,"Basically it's only value is its use as a currency (whereas gold at least has other uses) and it's terrible at its job.

Since Bitcoin has an upper limit (I think it's 20m) the only way to create more is to divide them. That's inherently deflationary as 1 Bitcoin will have more purchasing power in the future than it will in the present (assuming it becomes widely adopted and the price stabilizes). So, like gold, it incentivizes people to hold on to their Bitcoins (remember a currency only has value if it's freely traded) and will face issues with long term loans etc.

Not to mention one person holds 25% of all the Bitcoins in existence. Bill Gates wishes he had that type of ratio in dollars.

It's basically a virtual commodity since no one in their right mind believes it will become a widely adopted currency. Unlike every other commodity in the world it doesn't have any other use. It's also not nearly as anonymous as people believe. 

Some people will argue that it will be a value store if the economy truly goes to shit. I on the other hand believe that if shit hit the fan they would have a hard time trading it for real world goods and would be better off owning cartons of cigarettes to trade.

It's a social agreement that we value a finite blockchain as a ledger.

BTC is a mental short cut we use so we related the concept to our existing understanding of money.

Second layer networks distort control of the socially agreed ledger with a promise to control but it's not ownership. 

It's just a more secure way of paper money representing gold (a situation that primarily solve the limitations of gold)

Limiting Bitcoin to allow second layer networks to solve a similar problem is not ideal, it values the 2nd layer network over the social contract that gives the blockchain it's value.

Of course everyone will have the same idea, and there will be a flood of people trying to dump their money, and thus the value of it goes back down to normal pretty fast.

d5atyd1,belcher_,11,"&gt; I never liked the Starbucks analogy. i think it was a weak and confusing metaphor.
&gt; My question is why is 1 mb the right limit? when it was instituted it was several times larger than the demand. It has taken us years to reach full blocks. Now we have reached an arbitrary limit and this is the maximum forever?

Bitcoin is an engineering project, which involves tradeoffs and compromises. You could easily ask same question for the 21 million money supply, 10 minute block interval, 4 year halving interval, etc

The block size must be something finite and reasonably small otherwise bitcoin won't stay decentralized, and it won't be able to fund it's miners after inflation drops to low levels. We just had a halving where inflation dropped to 4%, we're right on schedule to start funding the miners with transaction fees instead of new bitcoins.

&gt; At this rate with no new 'layers' we will reach a point in the near future where there will not be enough room for all transaction no matter what fee they are paying. I have seen people say that low value or unimportant transactions just wont get on the blockchain. So in 2 years how many transaction will not be able to fit on the blockchain? are all of those unimportant?

*""Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded""*

Fact is there's a lot of spam out there. Bitcoin is a digital currency, not a low-cost data storage solution. I personally can't wait for [crap](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=524877.0) like [this](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1129800.0) to be priced out, which force every node in the network to store and relay (often unprunable) trivialities.

There's also a lot of understandable inefficiencies in how the blockchain is used, which now have an incentive to be fixed: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4kxxvj/i_just_singlehandedly_increased_bitcoin_network/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/47d4m2/why_does_coinbase_make_2_transactions_per/

&gt; Of course we can implement another 'layer' like lightning or thunder. Lightning and other projects with payment channels are very complex and unproven. I hear you when you say there are three great teams working on it right now. Right now it isnt working and we dont know it will work. As an investor in Bitcoin i am supposed to agree to stake the whole future of the project on a completely new system that has never been proven in the real world? Software that hasnt been released and hasnt been tested?

Well investing is risky. Go buy treasury bills if you want something safe and boring.

Fact is people are buying and holding bitcoin, the exchange rate has gone up by near [300% in the last 12 months that the block size debate has been going on.](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zczsg2015-05-15zeg2016-07-14ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv)

And every time a hostile hard fork threatened, [the market sold off](https://i.imgur.com/EVPYLR8.jpg)

Along with the [non-fakable opposition to a hard fork](http://bitcoinocracy.com/arguments/if-non-core-hard-fork-wins-major-holders-will-sell-btc-driving-price-into-the-ground), it's pretty clear that the economic majority and investors are fully behind Bitcoin Core's scaling plan.

&gt; How about sticking with our current system and incrementally raising the blocksize limit and monitoring the effects on the system and the latency issue? If 1mb is ok, 2mb will likely be ok, if we see negative effects then we dont raise the limit again.

An interesting view where a blockchain hard fork, forcing every full node to upgrade in a short time at the risk of *killing the currency* is portrayed as ""sticking with the current system"".

[We have enough data to know that even 1mb could be too much](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4a666x/sf_bitcoin_developers_bitcoins_p2p_network_the/), and how the system only survives today because of a huge amount of scaling work by developers.",2016-07-14 02:31:49
d5auupb,trilli0nn,11,"&gt;If at some point there is no negative side effects to increasing the block size and people are still bitching about it then it clearly is agenda based.

Allowing bigger blocks has the undisputed side effect of requiring significantly more bandwidth for full nodes. The decentralized properties of Bitcoin are upheld by these full nodes. Their numbers have been on a steady decline making Bitcoin increasingly centralized. Increasing the block size maximum will increase the bandwidth requirements and thus cost to run a full node considerably, which is another disincentive to run a full node.

If the number of full nodes declines too far, Bitcoin will start to lose its one and only property that gives it value: being trustless. Loss of too many nodes could well put Bitcoin into a spiral of declining confidence, decreasing price, decreasing node count, declining confidence, ... and repeat until it's dead.

d5ccgkp,bullbearanalytics,24,"Bitcoin BullBear Price Update for July 14, 2016  

Market Commentary (BTC):  

Compression is currently the name of the game as price continues to tighten between 640 - 680 $. While this may be less than optimal for near term traders, it reinforces the idea that we are in a bullish consolidation which should resolve to the upside eventually and thus bringing back volatility to the market.  Having said that, we still do not think the market is ready for that just yet, which means that we need to remain patient and tactical until we get more evidence that a breakout is imminent.  For the time being, however, we do not see that technical evidence so on the sidelines we sit.

Today we look at a slightly longer term chart in the form of the 12-hour in order to see what the medium term technicals are telling us.  We can see that the symmetrical triangle pattern was indeed broken on this Bitstamp chart as well, but again did not cause any FOMO whatsoever.  In fact, SCMR painted bearish pivot bar just two candles following the anemic breakout, and we are still not getting any new dynamic support near current levels.  We do, however, have some support coming in via the triangle apex and volume profile PoC (which are holding so far), as well as the flatlined 9/18 EMA cross.  

On the other hand, Willy has moved back above the centerline despite a stagnant price, RSI is actually turning lower, the A/D line is under some pressure, and MACD is pinned near zero.  Seeing as though more substantial support lies between 500 - 600 $ in the form of the 200 SMA, OTE long zone, multiple demand areas, and the dominant trendline, if the 620 $ level is taken out on decent volume then we will need to refocus our attention on this lower range.  

Thatsaid, if price can hold above there, and even above the 645 $ level, then the bulls will remain in control and might try to push this thing up past resistance at 680 $.  If this materialized we would be looking to take profits above 700 $ given we are able to enter the VST PT at slightly lower levels over the next 24-48 hours, but still do not want to get too aggressive seeing as though we need to break ~780 $ to resolve out of this consolidation period.  Things look fairly bullish for now, but let's not get too carried away just yet.

That it was a ""theft"" is debatable, because the attacker simply exploited a flaw in the DAO contract code. The DAO creators stated very plainly that the code itself is the contract, and that no other human interpretation matters. But even if you allow that it was a theft, it doesn't change the fundamental issue at hand: contract outcomes in Ethereum aren't supposed to be subject to the whims of the community.

Ethereum itself isn't broken; the DAO is. The investors in the DAO took a risk on a risky contract, and they lost. Forcing the rest of the Ethereum community to give them a mulligan is not only morally abhorrent, but a violation of the principles of a system that advertised ""unstoppable code"".

Tiny price movements in penny stocks produce big percentages, but the reality is that penny stocks are worth pennies for a reason, they are kaput. They are at the end of their life-cycle.

Bitcoin ist nicht kaput, it is demonstrably useful and scarce. It is at the beginning of its life-cycle. It disproves Mises' Regression Theorem, (which will need to be updated) and is the first of a new asset type - a secure store of wealth that can be used as money worldwide and transmitted over the Web like email.

What I think people forget is that the public blockchain means that the authenticity of any pattern of bits can be checked. This means for the first time we can have verifiably unique digital files. Previously, digital files could be copied and no one could tell the clones from the original.

Since almost anything can be digitised, this opens up a whole new technology and bitcoin is the (only) native token that makes the highly secure public blockchain work.",2016-07-15 15:08:25

- Failing to address performance and feature issues that preclude using Core at scale inside a Bitcoin business
- Segwit script-versioning combined by versionbits to allow for up to 29 different new opcodes to be out in the wild ready to activate at any given time.

It is pretty obvious that classic developers sorely lack in the talent department, which is why no one is prepared to fund them.

Given their lack of talent and the miserable failure that is Classic, can't see any reason to take their side in the blocksize debate. For some reason I feel more inclined to side with the Core devs who are on the forefront of cryptography and understand the science behind Bitcoin and are doing an amazing job of demonstrably advancing a 10 bn currency.

The no-talent Classic developers have shown not to be capable of anything but spreading misinformation and launch personal attacks at Core devs and Blockstream staff.

Stop spreading lies. Ethereum is less centrally controlled than Bitcoin.

To address your points:

&gt;""the current development teams seem to be doing a great job by introducing segwit, lighting and sidechains""

I agree. I'm thrilled with all three of those projects. I understand they take time, and I appreciate that they're moving forward steadily with the hard work of many very talented people. Thank you to all the teams working on those.

&gt;would do even better if /u/nullc would not have to waste all his time on tackling the personal attacks on /r/btc.

I don't support that nonsense at all, and never have. Frankly, I care more about the discourse in the community being productive than I do about the number of kilobytes per block.

&gt; it is not farstreached to say that the XT and Classic developers are totally incompetent compared to the core.

Now you're starting to make blanket statements about diverse groups of people which will inevitably degrade the quality of your argument. I don't and haven't endorsed either XT nor Classic, but I also respect the right of people to try competing for different implementations of Bitcoin. Remember decentralization?  I did think it was technically and rhetorially incorrect that those competing implementations were labelled ""altcoins"" and discussion of them banned from this sub. That was appalling.

&gt;their GitHub reamains to be an abandoned place.

Indeed, those projects didn't get the traction their supporters hoped they would. However, a sincere observer should note that they failed not because ""bigger blocks are wrong,"" but because of specific issues people had with the leadership of those projects. You perpetuated this narrative yourself when you said their ""developers are totally incompetent."" Why is this an important distinction? Because it means the advocacy of larger blocks is still very much alive within the community (which, it should be noted, does not end at the edges of r/bitcoin). Again, for the record, I didn't endorse either XT nor Classic, and yet still I advocate marginally larger blocks.

&gt;just look at how /r/btc turned out to be the ZeroHedge of Bitcoin.

Heh... well there is truth to that comparison. /r/btc turned out to largely be an angry reactionary environment to Core, which I didn't find healthy or productive. There is a very important point though: the ONLY reason /r/btc exists is because a significant number of Bitcoiners felt that an entire swath of opinion was being systematically suppressed at /r/bitcoin. When you tell a bunch of people, ""That manner by which you want to improve Bitcoin actually makes it an altcoin and not welcome here..."" then don't be surprised when the community fractures and turns into waring factions.   It should also be said, slightly in jest, that if /r/btc is the ZeroHedge of Bitcoin, /r/bitcoin has become the MSNBC of Bitcoin, blindly trumpeting the status quo, vilifying anyone who disagrees with the current leadership about any issue. It's a great way to drain out the diversity of opinion which is supposed to be one of our virtues as a decentralized community. And hey... sometimes ZeroHedge has really important news that nobody else is talking about. 

&gt; to keep the bullshit out of the conversation

I'm all for keeping bullshit out of conversations. I realize subs must have moderation. When that turns into systematically removing entire swaths of genuine discussion, it has crossed a line.

&gt;That being said, /r/btc does have censorship.

I don't advocate /r/btc

&gt;our developers are some of the smartest people in the world

Agreed. I'm immensely grateful for the work they do. 

&gt;people who are angry at coredevs are utterly clueless as to how grateful they should be to them

I'm not angry at coredevs. I am, however, advocating the importance of including conservatively larger blocks as one important and somewhat urgent aspect of the scaling challenge Bitcoin faces. 

&gt;you guys are amongst those who are cheerleading the angry, distruptive crowd

I don't think I'm cheerleading anger and disruption. I am cheerleading open discourse, anti-censorship, and conservatively larger blocks (not instead of other upgrades, but as a compliment)

I'll add that you call out Roger and myself in particular... because we have been vocal in this debate. Him and I don't hold the same opinions on this topic, though we both respect each other. And while we've both been vocal, many others in the community, specifically the leaders of other Bitcoin businesses, are just totally fed up with the level of discourse and the vilification, and they just don't even comment publicly, or at least in /r/bitcoin, any longer. 

On the topic of scale, I'm putting together a blog post that explains my opinion in long-form. People are welcome to consider it and come to their own conclusions.

Because he just continues to go off the rails even further. His approach to Bitcoin is damaging and I don't think that too many people would disagree with me. Even if he means well and thinks he's doing what's in his own financial interests. ",2016-07-17 22:42:07
d5fb4oq,PotatoBadger,17,"I believe he favors the Bitcoin Unlimited approach: No protocol-fixed block size limit. Let miners and users set their own block size limits, one soft and one hard. Notify them if the longest chain contains blocks which exceed their limit, and allow them to either increase it or remain forked from the network.

That's the main point of an article such as the OP. Miners won't generate insanely large blocks, because there is a cost function for the miner which increases as the size of their block increases. They can weigh the fees against those costs and find a market-driven equilibrium for the block size.

/u/Peter__R, please correct me if I'm wrong. I would also be interested in your latest thoughts on the issue.",2016-07-17 13:24:29
d5fg8ts,MemoryDealers,17,"&gt; Marshall Long is a moderator on r/btc and started classic.

False
&gt; Posts informing users about his history with scams (cryptsy/Garza) were ""censored"" from r/btc.

If so,  I'm not aware of it, and had nothing to do with it. 
&gt; The reason provided was that they were personal attacks, which is ridiculous given the constant personal attacks on core developers which are not ""censored"" there.

I don't know anything about that, and had no part in any of it.
&gt; Edit: The whole censorship thing is rubbish anyhow. Moderation exisits in almost all forums, and frankly bitcointalk and r/bitcoin and r/btc are all very lightly moderated.

This seems like a matter of opinion, and I strongly disagree.
&gt; Edit2: In-fact when Roger opened his new pro-classic forum he spammed links to it on general discussion on bitcointalk. Not many forums would allow that kind of spamming. 

If you think doing AMAs with all the CEOs of the biggest companies in the ecosystem is spam, then we disagree on that as well.

During one of the rounds of complaints ... One of the core contributors set up a classic node and saw a single spike that lasted only a brief time. During the same observation window, my node at home was hit with an almost constant attack (relaying blocks fast tends to get you confused with miners). But, of course, none of this stops people from suggesting that people associated with Bitcoin Core were doing it.

I think some portion of the complains was also just people who'd never run a node before and were just unfamiliar at how abusive it can be to your network connection, esp when someone starts syncing the blockchain from you.

Here, F2Pool is playing the part of the blockstream diehards, and certainly seems to channel the ideology/principle required for that scenario.

If nobody was willing to play that role, the HF could end up working out too smoothly, and not being as interesting of an experiment. 

So bring on the opinionated mining pool! Let's have some custom wallets trying to leverage trades across the HF sides and magically double their coin supply! Let's see how all those doomsday HF scenarios really pan out in practice

For learning I must recommend you read the Bitcoin whitepaper first to get an idea of what bit was intended to be.

I also recommend the cypherpunk manifesto for newbies it's only 2 pages long and gives an intro to btcland in a way.


[Mastering bitcoin by Andreas](chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/pr02.html) is a great place to start

[the developer guide is great for the basics under the hood](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide)



there are a number of books that aren't so much about the technicals [here is a link to 10 books](http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-book/)

If you think mastering bitcoin is only for experts then you should learn most CS Intro to Intro to computer science is free online via harvard through edx https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

and MIT's intro to computer science is also free online  https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-8

this will give you more real knowledge then just reading about things

After this icebreaker they will proceed to inquire what type of drugs you require, and in what quantities.  
Do not fret if they cuff you, that is probably just to make them look busy doing their job, while in actuality, they will be busy with a milligram scale in the trunk of their patrol car.

Can we really take a good hard look at what people are posting? People are posting the craziest things as facts around here with no basis. Here's some things I've seen that **no one can say with certainty is true**:

1) The HF is a bullish signal.

2) The HF is a bearish signal.

*Note: You can argue these, but please include your assumptions. You can't say the HF is bullish inherently, but you could say you believe it is bullish if everything goes well and [insert reasoning here]. But notice how I used ""believe it is"" instead of just ""is"".*

3) Coinbase adding ETH will somehow flood new demand into the market.

*Note: It totally could, but it's a possibility, not a certainty. The effect could be entirely negligible.*

4) Foreign countries ""coming around"". Most notably China.

*Note: Yes, maybe there's a low amount of Chinese money now. That doesn't mean someday they'll be instantly interested and everyone will want to buy. It's entirely possible that they simply don't like it compared to bitcoin. It's extremely difficult to tell.*

5) A post-fork dump will happen because of an increase in supply.

6) A post-fork dump will not happen because all DAO-holders would have traded out by now.

*Note: One of these two COULD be true, but no one knows. I love hearing people's opinions about which way they think it'll go, but proclaiming one as a fact without substantiation is what I take issue with.*

Maybe I'll update the list with more.

d5gyxxa,Creepsniffle,11,"Answers to your questions:

I think it is smart to have bitcoins as part of a diversified portfolio.

If you're going to acquire some I would say that a tiny fraction of your portfolio should be in it due to extreme volatility.

A cheaper way to acquire bitcoins is to simply buy them. I would absolutely dollar-cost-average on a short term (like every day or every week) vs the terms we're accustomed to in traditional investing (once a month, for example). You could also try selling things on Craigslist for Bitcoin. Be careful. Reliable places to purchase are Coinbase and Circle. I have bought from both.

Mining at home is a very costly gamble. You will need thousands of dollars in up-front capital to buy mining equipment and it will require massive amounts of costly energy. The mining equipment cannot ever be used for any other purpose. Ever.

Cloud contracts exist for mining bitcoins via a server farm somewhere (Iceland, probably). These are also expensive and it begs the question - if the company has the mining hardware already wouldn't it be a better ROI for them if they simply mined BTC instead of sharecropping to you?

The big alternative is something called Ethereum. Check my post history. Ethereum is, unlike Bitcoin, something that has real utility beyond a means of value exchange. Something to read up on.

**I can't emphasize enough the volatility of these crypto financial instruments. /r/FI is quite polarized about it but we all agree that it is hugely risky.** I don't think that gambling is too strong a word but I prefer ""speculation"" like you might be doing if buying foreign currencies.

Banks have no interest in Bitcoin. Their businesses model is to create credit out of collateral, and make money on the interest margin between loans and deposits. The higher they leverage their own capital, the more money they can make. It works only, because we have a fractional reserve system, which in turn works only because banks have a defacto money transmission monopoly and the system creates constant inflation (required for keeping a majority of deposits with banks).

Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com

&gt; When it comes to bitcoin and digital currencies, central banks might be considering the adage: “If you can’t beat them, join them.”
&gt; 
&gt; In a research paper published on Monday, economists at the Bank of England advocated that central banks issue their own kind of digital currency. Using the U.S. as a case study, they argued it could give a permanent boost to the economy of around 3%, as well as providing policy makers with more effective tools to tame financial booms and busts.
&gt; 
&gt; BOE economists John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof write that “reductions in real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs” would boost the economy.
&gt; 
&gt; Much like physical cash, digital currencies like bitcoin allow direct payment from one person to another, but they also have all the advantages of bank transfers, because large payments can be made instantaneously across the globe.
&gt; 
&gt; But the main appeal of bitcoin isn’t that it’s electronic. In fact, most money already is: Only about 5% of money in the economy is physical cash; the rest is bank deposits.
&gt; 
&gt; Rather, a digital currency offers a decentralized way to make payments without needing commercial banks to stand in the middle and record the transaction. Payments are validated by other users in a global network of computers and then updated in a shared record known as the blockchain.
&gt; 
&gt; ‘I don’t see how banks could compete’
&gt; —Peter Stella, former central-banking head of the International Monetary Fund and director of Stellar Consulting LLC
&gt; Central banks across the developed world, including the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, are now studying the potential of this technology. Were central banks to issue digital money and make it available to the general public, households and businesses would be able to bypass banks altogether when making payments to one another.
&gt; 
&gt; This could trigger a radical reshaping of the financial system.
&gt; 
&gt; “Making central bank money widely available could have an impact on deposits held at commercial banks and a knock-on effect on the banking system,” the BOE said in a research paper last year, because the new digital money would be seen as a cheaper and safer alternative.
&gt; 
&gt; “I don’t see how banks could compete,” said Peter Stella, former central-banking head of the International Monetary Fund and director of Stellar Consulting LLC.
&gt; 
&gt; Many economists would cheer at the prospect of all the money in the economy being issued by the central bank, instead of existing as current accounts or deposits, which are the liabilities of private banks. One of the authors of the BOE digital-currency paper, Mr. Kumhof, in 2012 co-wrote research for the IMF making the case for so-called full-reserve banking. He argued it could boost the U.S. economy by around 10%.
&gt; 
&gt; Key figures in American economics, such as Irving Fisher and Milton Friedman, have also advocated full-reserve banking. Under such a system, banks are forced to back every single deposit they issue to their customers with money at the central bank, essentially turning the central bank into the sole creator of money.
&gt; 
&gt; This isn’t how the monetary system works at the moment. As long as deposits at private banks can act as money, banks have the power to create an infinite amount of money out of thin air: When they grant a loan, banks just use their computers to increase the customer’s account balance.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s only when one bank needs to make payments to another that it requires actual central-bank issued cash, called reserves. Banks can always get more reserves at the central bank, for a price.
&gt; 
&gt; While this price—the interest rate—can influence how much money private banks create, many economists have long argued this control is too weak, giving birth to financial bubbles.
&gt; 
&gt; Proposals to outlaw private-bank money have seen a revival since the financial meltdown in 2008. Iceland is spearheading the charge and studying how to create an alternative system, where all money is created by the central bank.

&gt; A bitcoin ATM machine is shown at a restaurant in San Diego, California September 18, 2014. The device enables the user to convert cash to bitcoins via a QR code transfer to an application on their mobile device. 
&gt;
&gt; A central-bank-issued bitcoin would be a means for policy makers to completely control the amount of money in the economy, much like full-reserve banking. That’s not possible right now, because private banks can create money on their own.
&gt; 
&gt; For many economists, however, the focus on the quantity of money and who creates it is a mistake. They argue it’s the amount of credit and how it’s used that matters, which means over-optimistic expectations about the future will still bring about a financial bubble.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s the private sector which decides whether actually to accept those terms and conditions and ask the banks to give them the loan,” said Charles Goodhart, a professor at the London School of Economics and former Bank of England rate-setter.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, the debate dates back to the spat between the Currency School and the Banking School in 19th-century Britain. While the Currency School saw excessive issuance of notes by private banks as the reason for excessive inflation, the Banking School thought the amount of money in circulation was a result of what happened in the economy, instead of a cause.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea that controlling the amount of money in the economy will determine economic growth, inflation or credit creation has long appeared false. Since central banks started bond-buying programs in 2008, for example, the amount of central-bank money has exploded, but no inflation has materialized. Experiments to control the quantity of money in the 1980s, inspired by Milton Friedman, also ended in failure, with central banks fully reverting to using interest-rate policy by the 1990s.
&gt; 
&gt; Proposals to create a bitcoin-like central bank currency also risk alienating another set of activists: The actual supporters of bitcoin. The whole point of a digital currency, they say, is that it’s money without government.
&gt; 
&gt; “The key benefit is decentralization,” said Marco Streng, chief executive at Genesis Mining, a digital-currency company. “The best scenario is where people would not necessarily need to trust the government, they would just need to trust the blockchain.”",2016-07-20 00:42:45

&gt;Yes, Bitcoin is both open-source and unpatentable. The original ideas as published in the Bitcoin whitepaper were not patented. Inventors have a year after making their inventions public to file patent applications, and then the window is closed.

d5khv1m,headzoo,1941,"&gt; The file-sharing site generated up to $22.3 million in annual advertising revenue, the U.S. alleged.

These high numbers are very dubious. I used to be lead dev for an adult site with similar traffic numbers as KAT, and a copyright based lawsuit was filed against us by a company that also tried to claim we were earning tens of millions of dollars, but the truth is we were earning a tiny fraction of that.

The math doesn't add up. A prominent ad spot on KAT (header, sidebar) _might_ earn $15k a month, which is $180k a year. Let's assume their site has two such ad spots. That's $360k a year. They may have 4-5 less prominent ad spots earning $5k a month, which is $300k a year. They may have 1-2 bullshit ad spots (footer, bottom of sidebar) earning $1k a month. So that's another $24k a year. So all together the most they would have been making each year is **$684k**, and I'm being very generous with these numbers, because it's not easy to find high paying advertisers for ""sketchy"" websites. The more sketch the site, the more the owners are scraping the bottom of the barrel for advertisers.

Now, you don't need a lot of infrastructure to host a torrent site, but it still costs money. For the sake of argument let's say hosting, development, and advertising on other sites is 25% of their annual income. That's $171k per year. So the actual profit made each year would be **$513k**. Even if my numbers were substantially off, that's a far cry from the $23 million the feds are claiming.

I know people in the industry who own similar sites, and while they have nice houses, hot girlfriends, great coke, and drive Audis, they are not making multiple millions of dollars a year. It's almost not worth it considering they can never leave their home country for fear of being arrested.

Edit:

&gt; Vaulin was also charged with money laundering.

When the DAO caught fire and I saw forwards of chatlogs with exchanges talking about hardforking to 'fix' it, I was shocked and sent Vitalik email urging them to not do so. In Bitcoin land such a thing would be unthinkable, and I think actually impossible.

Ethereum's website has long loudly advertised (even louder than Bitcoin materials): ""Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference.""; and all that goes out the window when a service using the system suffers a highly predictable fault from a well known class of vulnerabilities?  I could certainly appreciate that ethereum could have a different philosophy than Bitcoin-- it's important that systems with many different philosophies exist-- but since ethereum has marked itself with a very Bitcoin like view, this is going to continue to create confusion in the market.

To all those people who argue 'hey, ethereum isn't money it's just fuel for a public distributed network'  ethereum classic will probably have a pretty good value proposition: better integrity with a lower access cost (assuming its adoption doesn't overtake ethhf).

The obvious use cases are the same as Bitcoin and the US Dollar, but that's rather simple in comparison to the range of possibilities.

In theory you could use this to build arbitrarily sophisticated economic systems for any quantifiable thing; an example they give that I wouldn't normally associate with currency is voting. You could have tokens which represent each individual's vote, and have a bot which collects the results of a vote and enforces the results. Other interesting uses include currency for a video game and investment in a Kickstarter-like project.

This basically seems to just be a logical next step after the invention of proper cryptocurrency, i.e. decentralizing contract enforcement and allowing arbitrary currencies to be created.

Not according to its title. Most other submissions like this get deleted.  

&gt; Hardforks are very difficult because of the way full nodes work, as I mentioned.  

Non-mining nodes do not make a hard fork any more or less difficult. They simply continue to operate on their own chain. Post-fork, another chain may be available, but the node client would need to change to operate on that new chain.  

&gt; The idea that Satoshi intended miners to be rulers of the network is clearly contradicted by the following paragraph from the SPV section of the paper (and in many places elsewhere):  

I've never subscribed to the contention that miners are ""rulers"" of the Bitcoin network, but any fork must be initiated by at least some miners.  

&gt; Satoshi's design for Bitcoin was that most people (certainly most merchants) would run full nodes, and full nodes would enforce the rules no matter what, regardless of miner support.  

I dispute that Satoshi intended anything of the sort, or community adoption of hard forks would be impossible. Nodes can choose to run code with any rules they like, but at least some miners would need to be supplying complying new blocks for them for the network to be functional.  

&gt; ... he clearly intended Bitcoin to be tamper-resistant....

That Bitcoin is already tamper-resistant does not mean that anything need be done to make hard forks *artificially* harder than they already are.  

What's hard is for a post-fork chain to establish market dominance. That's the mechanism that determines relevance in Satoshi's system.

Note longtime financial troll Isabella Kaminski whose articles 99% bash bitcoin contines to do whilst praising ethereum, this is from a publication (The FT) that removed any journalists that praised Bitcoin from writing about the subject further (Jane Wild for instance)

further:

“Bitcoin was a great experiment in monetary policy,” says Andrew Keys, the Head of Global Business Development at Consensus Systems (ConsenSys), a venture production studio for blockchain-based applications and tools.

“What it proved was that I can send you a Bitcoin without a bank,” he says. “Ethereum […] can do peer-to-peer agreements.”

Those inflamatory remarks are direct from ethereums camp. What ethereum have done is proven assets are confiscatable destroying ethereums chance of being a long term store of value, they have just repeated what the ECB did to Cyprus, helping themselves confiscate assets (whether the reason was to patch a gapping hole they invited the wrong attention from or not). Banks crossing that percieved line in the sand is what sparked interest in Bitcoin in the public eye in the first place.

With all respect ethereum is of interest to enterprise and developers as a rails for their own developemnt which is why microsoft and ibm arent using the token themselves but bootlegging their own. This fork may or may not improve any future adoption from enterprise but from a personal finance standpoint we now know are funds are potentially confiscatable.

d5m21yn,evoorhees,18,"&gt; Nice to see yet another another public tantrum about a private bitcoin subreddit's policies

A ""public tantrum"" is how you describe my post? 

&gt; this time, regarding altcoins.

If you don't think the biggest hard fork to ever occur in a blockchain is relevant in this sub *if for no other reason than to highlight the dangers of hard forks due to community sentiment* then I don't know how to respond. Animated gif #15828 about rocket going to moon... let's have another! Wall Street Journal article about biggest hard fork in history... off topic! 

&gt;  from an individual who heads an altcoin exchange. No conflict of interest there, right?

Conflict of interest? Let's talk about that. 95% of my net worth is in Bitcoin. I've been building projects and advocating the Bitcoin industry for over five years. And guess what, Bitcoin is stronger to the extent it has greater utility, and as other people build interesting blockchain assets (inevitable), ShapeShift enables easy exchange between these systems and Bitcoin. If you think that's ""bad for Bitcoin"" or ""not welcome 'round here!"" then fine, history can judge both of our opinions. Do I have a conflict of interest? Yes, I'm hopelessly biased against fiat flag money and have dedicated my life to destroying it. And when I see what *should* be the most important subreddit in the industry removing important information about how this technology is developing, I'm not going to stay silent.  I profit hugely as Bitcoin grows, that is my bias, and I'm not going to sit around circle jerking to moon gifs when important issues are affecting this community.

&gt; as far as not fact-finding in a private manner (like everyone does) by messaging mods.

I did message a mod. I messaged BashCo yesterday with the exact screenshot I posted in the OP, and asked what was going on. I got no response. Am I to bring my concerns to each gatekeeper individually before I bring them to the community? Is that the principle upon which decentralized money is to be built and discussed?

&gt; Correct. This is a bitcoin subreddit, and altcoin discussion should not even be happening here.

Unless it's negative, right? That's super healthy. Bitcoin benefits when it only hears bad echo chamber news about other parallel systems, eh? Bullshit. Bitcoin is stronger when its community is educated, wise, humble, and productive. 

&gt; if you're interested in unrestricted altcoin pumping

Now you're just working very hard to intentionally avoid my point and denounce my motives. That has become far to common a practice here. It's exactly the same kind of bullshit that the /r/btc crowd suffers from when they endeavor to smear Blockstream by attacking their perceived motives. 

&gt; You have made it a habit, since first starting your Shapeshift altcoin exchange, to periodically pump one altcoin or another here:

Sorry, that's bullshit. Me talking about other digital assets is not ""pumping altcoins"" any more than me talking about Bitcoin is ""pumping Bitcoin."" This technology is important, it is diverse, it is dynamic, and while it may offend you to hear this, Bitcoin does not constitute all the innovation in this industry. The arrogance of Bitcoiners right now is one of its biggest vulnerabilities. 

&gt; You may consider this a 'free market' in that it's 'okay' for newbies to be probably fleeced, as long as Shapeshift can profit in the meantime, and that it's 'fair'; but, this is unethical.

The fact that you believe only Bitcoin can have ""legitimate value"" and ""everything else is a dirty scam because not bitcoin"" doesn't make it true. You remind me of the gold bugs who I spent eons arguing with in 2011-2012, who were so obstinate against Bitcoin because they had grown up to believe ""only gold is money."" 

&gt; This subreddit is by and for Bitcoiners, who are interested in topics relevant to Bitcoin that help it achieve success.

I used to think that. In fact, I'm a Bitcoiner interested in topics relevant to Bitcoin that help it achieve success. This sub is becoming a net negative to that end.

However, I do have a view on cryptocurrencies vs cryptoassets. I think a lot of the early cryptocurrencies after bitcoin (""altcoins"") were great from an experimentation perspective but not valuable because they tried to do the same thing Bitcoin did: create a network where the goal is store of value and transaction abilities. Ethereum was the first thing to me to come along and create something with capabilities so new that it was worth adding. Allowing arbitrary programs is amazing, fiddling with block time/inflation rate is not.

I think we are now getting a different wave: digital assets instead of digital currencies. And this is far more interesting.

The result of that meeting was this document which they called the ""Hong Kong Agreement"" sometimes called the HK agreement for short.

https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff#.vzixs57uq

In broad strokes it says that the Miners who signed off on it agreed that they would continue to run only core developed Bitcoin code (ie: they wouldn't run Classic which had just been announced and would soon be released) and they would accept the co called ""SegWit"" changes when they were released.  In return for not running any competing implementations and accepting segwit core agreed to provide code for a hard fork block size increase to 2 MB to be available 90 days after the release of segwit code.  The timeline cited in the agreement is April for segwit and July for the 2 MB hard fork code.  So far we've seen a release of segwit code[0] in April but no sign that they intend to release the 2 MB code.  Aug. 1st is the most charitable interpretation of the deadlines laid out in the Hong Kong agreement so in order to appear to give core the maximum benefit of the doubt they are waiting until the last possible date before declaring that the HK agreement has been breached by core leaving them free to pursue other options while still being able to say they held up their end of the agreement.

It’s possible that it's better to keep the base transaction layer dumb for scaling reasons (i.e. Bitcoin) with advanced logic in higher layers. The reason so many amazing things are happening in Ethereum right now is it gives you the base transaction/store of value layer and the advanced scripting layer in one out of the box, so it's way easier to build dapps in Ethereum right now. But maybe those things are better separated long term.

Second would be that Ethereum has a serious security issue as it is (correctly so) in move fast and break things mode which is unrecoverable. I am OK with this risk though: don't put in more money than you are willing to lose, and whatever the issue is can likely be resolved, new version of the network spins up a month or two later.",2016-07-23 06:07:54

d5mttt2,peoplma,17,"I'd be in favor of a dynamic block size.  As it is now, there is sort of an obscure vulnerability.  Since dogecoin fees are so low, it would be extremely cheap (~1000 doge per minute) for someone to spam transactions and fill up blocks.  Since doge is also fast, this is 2.5X the block size equivalent of litecoin and 10X of bitcoin.  Our largest miner, F2Pool (~40% hash power) also mines litecoin and bitcoin.  Having to propagate our 1MB blocks may have a negative impact on their orphan rate of bitcoin and litecoin blocks due to increased latency and bandwidth requirements.  And block rewards for dogecoin are so small that the increase in orphan rate may be a larger financial hit for them than discontinuing mining dogecoin would be.  So it's conceivable that they would stop mining dogecoin and leave us more vulnerable to 51%.  Not just F2Pool either, all of our miners mine another coin as their primary source of income.

So there is an argument to be made from a security standpoint for dynamic max block size for dogecoin.",2016-07-23 05:28:57
d5nmuqi,Anduckk,16,"The most wrong thing here is human thinking. People think everything ""just works"". People don't get *why* Bitcoin exists and works. And many seem to think that developers are slaves which can be switched at will.

So, people (I'd say majority) don't even want decentralization. They can't see why they would need it. Why would they? It's a fact that centralized systems can be more effective which means cheaper,faster,easier access to people to the system. Sure, some 1% may be denied to access the system. But why would the 99% who can access, care? They don't even *see* that there are people who are denied, for one reason or another.

Why would bitcoiners be any different? Well, luckily *a big portion* of bitcoiners understand that *ultimate decentralization* is the base of Bitcoin. Weakening it risks the whole system to threats that can't even possibly be seen by the majority (99% vs 1%). So this is why blocksizes (and therefore minimum requirements to be part of the system) are restricted, by the community. Even today there are people in the community who *simply cannot* use Bitcoin in a trust-less, decentralized way.

Blocksizes should increase, because the tech gets better globally, but how much is too much? We need more information and need to do analysis and we get this by rising blocksizes in small steps. There are some tough problems in Bitcoin system still, for example that nodes need to process, store and share all the information and they get no compensation to do this. Miners fees do not go to them. Increasing blocksizes increases the costs to run nodes. After all the possibility to run a node must be preserved, because running a node is the only way the system stays decentralized - when everyone can verify everything if they want to.

But, again, the only big problem here is human thinking. People don't care about the future. It doesn't help that Bitcoin is extremely complex system. Bitcoin system needs work (and be developed) so human factor isn't relevant, while understanding that human factor builds the whole system and keeps it running.",2016-07-23 23:29:47

Some people on /r/ethtrader are *convinced* ethereum classic is a big plot between the hacker, poloniex, and bitcoin core devs.  The conspiracy theories going on there would be prime fodder for /r/conspiracy.  Not too many people there familiar with Occam's Razor I suspect.  

Some on /r/btc have done a complete 180 - previously championing ethereum's hard fork, but now trying to quell all talk of it now that something didn't go as planned.  

/r/bitcoin hasn't been quite as wild, but it's still not a great place to attempt discussion.

There are a couple bitcoin ETFs (one existing, a couple more on the way) but shares of these are not the same as actual bitcoin. (they represent an amount of bitcoin being held by the ETF if I understand correctly)  
Anyway, for wallets use mycelium (android) or breadwallet or copay (iphone). Never keep your coins on an exchange. Make sure you make a paper backup when you install your wallet, and keep it safe (it lets you recover your coins if you lose your phone, but anyone that gets ahold of your backup has access to your coins) If you are buying larger amounts, consider using a hardware wallet (trezor or keepkey) or a paper wallet.

I am in Bitcoin for a long time. Ethereum struck me like an interesting research project (with its own problems, but let's ignore that). The reason I never cared about it regardless was the obvious herding behind a creator. There is a reason that Satoshi disappeared, you know? A fork that emancipats from that and is genuinely grassroot _is_ interesting. That you see a lot of Bitcoin people over at ETHC now that previously did not care about ETH does _not_ mean that this is about inner-Bitcoin politics. It means that something new emerged that vibrates hard with many Bitcoiners. Specifically those who are on the decentralization side of Bitcoin, like myself.

I know this is an economically literate crowd but just for the uninitiated, devaluation makes your currency cheaper and therefore your exports cheaper, the idea being to stimulate the economy with increased overseas demand. But really all you've done is given the entire population a pay cut. You never want to win a currency war because it means you're broke.

Regular people in China are running to bitcoin as a safe haven asset. If you have the equivalent of $100,000 saved in Yuan, and they devalue their currency 4%, you've just lost $4,000.

This is also true but you don't stop main chain holders selling their coins on the fork chain to the point where it has next to no value.

and if you are going to have to change POW algo and difficulty algo and freeze coins that belong to main chain supporters on the forked chain to prevent 51% and economic attacks, well you would be better off just starting an alt coin with a proof of bitcoin burn for initial issuance.. which has also been tried in the past and failed to gain traction.

Well... yeah, I think a lot of us are Bitcoin maximalists. I think it would be a bad idea to move to an alt-coin because AFAIK most of them are scams and/or pre-mined. 

&gt; And I think there is a very massive non-vocal majority who are happy with Bitcoin (if they haven't been rattled by the annoying whining yet). And the proof is in the adoption.

I disagree, I think there's a massive non-vocal majority that would, in the question of ""Increase block size now?"" answer ""Yes."". If you remember last year, or even in 2014, there were no doubt in that the majority who were discussing in the forums here (not just some people) wanted an increase. Things have changed though as censorship is in place and a lot of people are frustrated (hence alternative forums).

&gt; Cool features are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization. More transactions are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization. Smart contracts and programmable money are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization.

Agreed. I don't think many people disagree with this, but it's not all black and white. People can still want a block size increase.

&gt; But that's just my free opinion, and hopefully you'll be free enough to make yours. Without whining, of course.

d5qlmed,SeemedGood,20,"Dash has its strengths, but cutting edge privacy really isn't one of them truth be told.  From a privacy perspective, Dash is essentially a Bitcoin clone with a mixing service built into the reference client.  If one just uses [CoinJoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoinJoin) with Bitcoin, you have largely the same level of privacy as Dash.  And like with CoinJoin, you only achieve that level of privacy when you opt to do the mixing - which can be cumbersome and time consuming.

Monero, OTOH, uses [ring signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature) to obscure transactions in a manner that's built into the basic transactional structure.  Every Monero transaction is made functionally anonymous via the use of ring signatures.  Monero also uses [stealth addresses](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/moneropedia/stealthaddress)  by default, making it substantially harder to link your addresses on the blockchain.

There are plenty of reasons to own and use Dash.  The successful implementation of a hybrid PoW/PoS operational and governance structure, the intense developmental focus on becoming digital cash (in stark contrast to Bitcoin), the community's focus on the importance of marketing to drive adoption, and its near-interoperability with the Bitcoin ecosystem are all strong points in its favor.  For privacy, though, Monero is the better choice.

I wouldn't say that. Ethereum is still very different beast to BTC and the hard fork would have behaved very differently in BTC. Bitcoin has 10 minute block time, ethereum has 15 seconds. Bitcoin has 2 weeks difficulty adjustment time, ethereum adjusts it on each block. With bitcoin having similar hard fork initially, we would probably still be waiting for a second block on the older chain, and it would be impossible for anyone to operate on the old chain.

Also, many of the problems with ethereum hard fork would be very easy to migitate, for example having a version number included in transactions before signatures are applied, which would make all transactions in the fork invalid in the older chain, and vice versa.",2016-07-27 16:59:25

d5t0v5x,EtanSivad,17,"“Come on Buddy, you can do it,” I desperately urge my Purple little friend along.  It doesn’t matter though, the Michelangelo Virus has him by the hair and is bashing his skull in.  The arena is barely attended tonight, but the screams for blood are vicious.  They’ve never seen someone fight like this, I’ve never seen Michelangelo fight like this.  I glance down at my tablet and check the date.  I should have known better.


“Maybe I... can help... you with... a search,” Buddy calls out between the blows before Michelangelo finally curb stomps Buddy unconscious.   The virtual ref materializes in the middle of the ring and holds up the hand of the victor, purple hair still gripped in his closed fist.  



The crowd starts to disperse and I make way across the concrete floor to talk to the other coach, Frank.  He set up this match, said it would be a friendly match.  I see his hand extended out to me in a symbol of friendship right below his shit eating grin perfectly illuminated in the hazy green fluorescent lights.


“Good match-” he starts to say. 



I give him a shove right in the chest and say, “To hell with you.  You knew today was March 6th when you arranged the match.”



March 6th, the painter Michelangelo's birthday.  The day the viruses payload hits, and as a fighter, it becomes unstoppable.  



“Hey man, it’s all part of the game maybe you should pay more attention when-” I don’t let him finish.  Just shove him out of the way and get back to Buddy.  



I walk down the concrete stairs into the virtual arena and pick up the shattered purple gorilla.  His eyes briefly open.  He asks, “Did I do good boss?  I help you search!”



“Yeah, Buddy, you did good.  Just rest now.”  




I pull out my tablet and hit “Reload software.”  The injured Buddy vanishes and is replaced by a new Buddy, fully chipper and ready to go.



“I talk!  I e-mail!  Can I help you search the World Wide Web?”



No Buddy, today you fight.



I make my way back to the coaches seat, but not before getting another pitcher of crap watered down beer.  “Better make it two” I tell the barkeep, this is going to be a long night.



The lights go down and the audience manages a half hearted cheer for the next round.  I hustle back to my spot and take a cursory gulp to steady my nerves.  The next match is an unranked contender, some new hot shit out of Russia.  They needed someone ranked to fight to get started in the circuit.  The money was good, so how could I say no?



The fight starts and Buddy is already throwing bananas.  The Russian, on the other hand, is just bizarre.  All blocky and confusing looking.  Can’t tell where its arms and legs are, or if it even has them.  There’s a couple of evil red eyes glaring out, that I can see.  


The Russian leaps over and grabs Buddy in a vice lock.  Right away Buddy’s leg starts morphing, and changing into an unrecognizable mess.  “Oh come on ref!” I scream, “How can this be legal?”  Somehow he allows it.  Buddy is terrified as his foot is now completely deformed like it’s been chewed up by a meat grinder, and the leg is headed that way too.




“Please to send me bitcoin you want files back,” the Russian calls in broken english.  This match is already over.  



I look down at my tablet, pull up the black market app I bought.  My thumb hovers over the launch button.  I shouldn’t do this, I really shouldn’t.  The guy I bought it off of assured me it would overclock Buddy and would be totally untraceable.  But at the cost of shortening Buddy’s life.  Fuck, I can’t do it.  



Buddy screams like I’ve never heard before.  I slam the rest of my crap drink and rally my nerves.  Poppa needs a win tonight!  I hit the overclock button.



“BONZI!!” Buddy screams.  His biceps swell comically like Popeye on a hit of spinach.  He hops on the good leg and looks down in contempt at the Russian gnawing on his other leg.  



“BONZI!! BONZI!!” Buddy screams over and over as he tears the Russian’s head right off.  The room goes silent save for the sound of pieces of the Russian dripping onto the floor punctuated by Buddy’s deep guttural breathing.    Then it explodes; the crowd goes insane over this performance.  



I start drinking straight from the pitcher this time, it actually tastes pretty damn good in the light of victory and I think tonight is going to be ok.

d5u0kka,H3g3m0n,14,"ZeroNet is cryptocurrency (BitCoin) backed and uses BitTorrent for the transfers.

There is also Swarm which is Ethereum's version.

IPFS is decoupled from any crypto currencies. Although they plan their own 'FileCoin' at some point later to incentive people to host, but it's an optional separate layer. Another one is TahoFS but that might be a bit different.

Crypto-currencies have this huge barrier to entry that people in the community seem to forget/ignore. Mainly people must obtain the cryptocurrency in order to use them. They have to get out a credit card or do a bank transfer or some other bullshit. And they must understand things like managing public/private keys/accounts/wallets/backups and handle transfers and a lot of other bullshit.

That's fine if your a crypto geek but not for everone else and it will will loose you %99.9 of the audience/community. In future it might not be an issue if we live in some cryptocurrency based utopia, but that's a while off yet.

I don't think things like .torrent files (as in the torrent index files, not the full downloads) really need people to get paid to host them. You just need enough nodes willing to to volunteer to host data locally. And maybe a client that mirrors some of the content automatically (IPFS has a JavaScript implementation, so it can even be done in the webbrowser although most of the nodes will be temporary).

Also there is no need for things to be totally, %100 decentralised. Just decentralised enough that if something goes it's not a big loss. You can still have centralised authentication for example. If it went down, we could just shrug, sign up for new accounts on something else and move on. Same with a specific web frontend.

What we need is for the databases of torrents to be downloadable and hosted in a distrusted way.

The entire PirateBay database was under a GB (actually it was 90MB for just magnet links and such without a lot of the crap). PublicBT allowed you to download a 60mb file containing all the torrents they tracked (which included all the PirateBay ones). Unfortunately pbt are now gone, and the sister site OpenBittorrent doesn't support obtaining a dump. Libgen also allows people to download the entire database of books as a bunch of torrents (unfortunately it's going to be massive, like 14-140+TB so mirroring the content isn't trivial), they also mirror all the sci-hub queries too.

It would also be highly useful to have metadata like comments mirrored.

The problem is pirate sites are incentivized to hold onto their databases and lock people into their site for ad revenue. But that fucks over the community since stuff is lost every time one of these sites goes down. Also there are plenty of 'mirror' and 'proxy' sites around already that pretend to be legit and stick their own ads in. 

Maybe we need a community effort to 'pop' torrents and the metadata out of centralised index sites. Just run some Firefox/Chrome extension that rips the stuff and dumps it out over IPFS when you visit. Or some organised ongoing scraping bots. There are a few TPB archives around but they are from 2013. There was IsoHunts 'OpenBay' they shutdown because no one bothered to work on it. TPB founders talked up a lot of stuff but nothing ever happened then the site seems to have been sold/transfered to some dodgy company that got rid of the moderators.

Maybe [matrix](https://matrix.org/) could be used for authentication, and/or to federate torrent uploads/metadata across the network. Coupled with IPFS that hosts some kind of permissioned blockchain of torrents.",2016-07-28 13:05:10

d5vt49q,HostFat,123,"&gt;Huffman then noted that Reddit often sees moderators of some subreddits behaving in a way that goes against the company’s own inclination to let things play out and generally be open. “We’ve seen that with the Bitcoin community,” he added. “I don’t disagree with you at all. Right now, our opinion is that we try to stay hands-off unless they’re breaking other, site-wide rules. That said, we have put a lot of thought into these issues. What is the best way to appoint new moderators [and] and remove old ones **in a way that the communities can do themselves?**”

I think that the best result can be that every user can choose his own preferred admin/mods, and **see the statistics** of what the other users are choosing.

So the subreddit remain the same, but every user will see the political line that he/she prefers. (and can easily switch to something else)

1. Blockstream is a for-profit corporation. (fact) 
2. A primary goal of Blockstream Blockstream's goal, like all for-profit corporations, is to make money. (almost certainly a fact)
3. Blockstream employs many core devs. (fact)
4. Blockstream's is all about sidechains (source: https://blockstream.com/fact-sheet/) and hence Blockstream's plans for making money likely revolve around sidechains.
5. Sidechains are needed when the main chain can't accommodate demand for transactions. 
6. Blockstream's interests thus lie in getting to a world where sidechains are needed. 
7. Blockstream, employing many core devs, guides bitcoin development according to its interests--which are keeping block sizes low so that many transactions are pushed onto sidechains.
8. Blockstream's small-block interests may not coincide with many members of the bitcoin ecosystem who wish, most of all, to see bitcoin grow healthily. 

Now, do I think that the members of Blockstream say to themselves ""we must stick with small blocks, bitcoin's future be damned, because otherwise we'll never make money?"" I don't, but I do think they've thoroughly convinced themselves that small blocks are the only path of the righteous, and this just so happens to line up with their corporate interests. In other words, when asking why members of Blockstream/core don't seem to be able to honestly engage with arguments for increasing the block size, this quote applies: """"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"" (Upton Sinclair).

Also, confirmations are more important for transaction reversiility than PoW. In ethereum we use 12 confirmations at 14.5s block time (~3 min) instead of bitcoin's 6 confirmations at 10 minutes (60 min).

With Casper PoS the target is sub 1s block times. Naive Sharding should allow for at least 10,000 transactions per second. With planned research, the Ethereum Foundation hopes to get Sharding to have in excess of 100,000 global transactions per second if not infinite scaling (i.e. more nodes willl always make the network faster, not create overhead that slows it down).",2016-07-29 12:35:22

Agreed, but you didn't quite do that...

&gt;faster blocks means higher orphan rate, so more wasted PoW, so less overall security

Except Ethereum makes use of GHOST, where the orphans (called uncles) actually go towards the security. So if Bitcoin and Ethereum had the same hashrate, Ethereum would actually be more secure since Bitcoin's orphans (however few) do not contribute to security.
[More info on Ethereum's block time and GHOST](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/)

&gt;One ether confirmation is really not the same thing as one btc confirmation.

True, but a transaction included in one minimally secure block (within seconds) is already far more secure than a transaction in the mempool where inclusion is uncertain. If this didn't matter, then we could just as well increase the difficulty in Bitcoin so the average block time was an hour or more and it wouldn't matter.

However, after a long enough time period where both transactions were included, they would have almost identical security (assuming the same hashrate and minus the added security of GHOST, which is not the case today as Bitcoin has a much higher rate so is currently more secure given the same amount of time).

&gt; The design of having a version number implies that the designer wanted to use hard forks for changes.

This is no stretch, not an out-of-place or reaching comment at all. It's a correct and usual interpretation of a common convention across *all* programming fields. Some concern-trolling I've seen recently has tried to assert that this isn't the case; of course it is. **The presence of a version number is origin support for an upgraded data structure that is not backwards compatible.** OOP 101, here. But let's be fair: **The presence of NOP codes and/or unused ""reserved"" fields is origin support for data structure upgrades that are backwards compatible.** So both options were intended to be available from the onset, and developers need to choose the right one for the job.

The other take-away point here is

&gt; But where SegWit tries to adjust a static memory-format by re-purposing existing fields, Flexible transactions presents a coherent simple design that removes lots of conflicting concepts.

The key phrase I see is ""repurposing existing fields"". Any programmer worth his salt knows this means ""a hack"" and if there is a better way to go about doing things, it's absolutely worth seriously considering scrapping what you are working on. This touches on the previous point: what is the right tool for the job? When it comes to fixing malleability and providing the infrastructure for other indev features, a hard fork is the obvious choice. You don't use a screwdriver to set a nail. If we're talking about a new opcode that doesn't affect existing signature styles, then a soft fork makes sense. If we're talking about altering data structures, hard fork is the answer. *SegWit is a modification to the transaction data structure, and therefore would be better introduced as a protocol upgrade, i.e. hard fork.*

To address your actual improvements: *Bravo!* You've sort of retread ground that other CS folks have braved, but it's true that tag-based data storage is almost always cheaper (byte-for-byte, OP-for-OP) than data blobs. It's counterintuitive, but true - data blobs are tough to change, tough to store, tough to encode and decode, and generally aren't worth the effort for the storage savings - sometimes yielding no savings at all.

This actually brings me to another interesting question - why do bitcoin nodes, by default, use file-based databases instead of simply offloading data storage to a database powered by SQL? When you've got 60GB of data, sequential storage is usually not the first solution, especially if the data needs to be indexed and read upon occasion. Any storage savings produced by using sequential files comes at a cost of processing overhead; blockchain data is, by design, time-consuming to evaluate and validate, so it makes sense to offload any other related tasks to an independent process or machine and allow the node to focus on the responsibilities of being a node.",2016-07-30 03:07:57

&gt; Bitcoin's market price is trying to rally, but it is currently constrained by Core/Blockstream's artificial blocksize limit. Chinese miners can only win big by following the market - not by following Core/Blockstream. The market will always win - either with or without the Chinese miners.

&gt; Bitcoin has its own E = mc^2 law: Market capitalization is proportional to the square of the number of transactions. But, since the number of transactions is proportional to the (actual) blocksize, then Blockstream's artificial blocksize *limit* is creating an artificial market capitalization limit!

Routing around Core/Blockstream's foot-dragging and obstructionism a slow process... but in the end, the market will win, with or without Blockstream. Meanwhile,l the only reason why Core/Blockstream's cripple-code is still being used is **inertia**:

&gt; A heartbreaking tragedy of inertia &amp; asymmetry in the Blockchain Rule Update Process, which makes it harder to upgrade Bitcoin: Due to a random accident of semantics, making the rules tighter (more restricted) is a ""soft"" change, while making the rules looser (less restricted) is a ""hard"" change

Eventually, inevitably, ineluctably, the market will route around Core/Blockstream and their obstructionism.

&gt; I think the Berlin Wall Principle will end up applying to Blockstream as well: (1) The Berlin Wall took longer than everyone expected to come tumbling down. (2) When it did finally come tumbling down, it happened faster than anyone expected (ie, in a matter of days) - and everyone was shocked.
