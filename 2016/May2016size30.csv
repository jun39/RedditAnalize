d2o8u4l,olivierjanss,31,"- I don't think it is dishonest at all. We're talking 3 months after. For me the first couple of days (maybe weeks) were the most representative, as everyone was mailed at the same time and had an equal chance to vote. Despite the ongoing censorship from North Korea, which still makes a bunch of people terribly misinformed. If Classic fans would start renting hashpower today and make it 80% Classic instead, I would also not consider it representative. The reason why it was representative back then, is exactly the fact that people didn't have time to game the system.
- You can't call segwit optional if you don't provide alternatives. The technical decision to push through a complicated change and risk blowing up the Bitcoin network (tx's stuck causing death spiral) which risks permanently damaging crypto and might even cause gov intervention, versus a simple increase and then doing it properly while giving people a real choice, is completely irresponsible. You basically keep everyone hostage and offer only one way out.
- Roger counts on the Bitcoin price to continue to go up (a lot). I count on transaction volume to go up. It might as well happen simultaneously. But I think the latter scenario is much more likely and can actually be backed up by real life data. You can project tx volume graphs into the future and project how Lightning would disrupt that. Without Lightning, tx volume, and consequently the collected fees, will become larger than the mining rewards. This should be the case by the next halving after the one that comes in July. Core devs are tampering with stuff and have no idea of the consequences on the economics. So yeah I'm pretty sure they will try to fix the economics they will break, next.

d2o3ogm,treebog,24,"A socialist feminist cuckolded Swedish professor and Cultural Marxist was teaching a class on Abraham Lincoln, a known statist.

""Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Lincoln and accept that the US Civil War was fought over slavery!""

At this moment, a brave, euphoric, pro-marijuana anarcho-capitalist champion who had saved $15,000,000 worth of Bitcoin and understood the necessity of the NAP and fully supported all military decisions made by the Pinochet regime stood up and held up a Confederate flag.

""What does this flag represent?""

The arrogant professor smirked quite cuckedly and smugly replied ""Racism and slavery, you stupid libertarian.""

""Wrong. The Confederacy was a libertarian utopia. If those black people didn't like being slaves... they could have just found somebody else to hire them.""

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of The Communist Manifesto. He stormed out of the room crying those statist crocodile tears. The same tears statists cry for the ""poor"" (who could be rich too if they understood Austrian economics) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, Joseph Stalin, wished he had invested in gold and become more than a sophist Marxist professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered libertarian that day and accepted Ron Paul as their lord and savior. An eagle named ""Praxeology"" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The John Galt speech was read several times, and Murray Rothbard himself showed up and sold children to them all.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He was killed by statist policemen.

Saying that miners hold decisive sway is to acknowledge a terrible imbalance in the current state of Bitcoin that *requires* correction if Bitcoin is to survive and compete healthily against the field of competition in the digital currency space.

How to correct this imbalance?

That is what we need to discuss. Together with the miners and pools. If they do not volunteer to participate in solutions, the rest of the system can transition to a new mining substrate.

It is always easier to effect change in a system by changing software, if that is an option.

Changing hardware is more painful, but sometimes necessary. Miners have substantial hardware investments, so they should be careful here.

I counsel miners: support the free growth of Bitcoin, do not go the way of constraining its growth. Only in this way can the price of Bitcoin grow naturally with adoption, and you can remain in the game even if you are not one of the largest players.

d2pfonq,_invalidusername,108,"**Craig Wright reveals himself as Satoshi Nakamoto**

*Mr Wright could well be Mr Nakamoto, but nagging questions remain*

FIVE months after Craig Steven Wright, an Australian computer scientist and businessman, was outed against his will as Satoshi Nakamoto, he says he is indeed the creator of bitcoin. On May 2nd he published a blog post offering cryptographic proof, backed up by other information, to make his case. Along with two other media organisations, The Economist had access to Mr Wright before the publication of his post. Our conclusion is that he could well be Mr Nakamoto, but that nagging questions remain. In fact, it may never be possible to prove beyond reasonable doubt who really created bitcoin. Whether people, particularly bitcoin cognoscenti, actually believe Mr Wright will depend greatly on what he does next, after going public.

In December, after he was outed, Mr Wright stayed silent. So why has he now changed his mind? “I’m not seeking publicity, but want to set the record straight,” he explains. He says he called himself “Nakamoto” after a 17th-century Japanese philosopher and merchant, Tominaga Nakamoto, who was highly critical of the normative thought of his time and favoured free trade. (He doesn’t want to say why he picked “Satoshi”: “Some things should remain secret.”)

If Mr Wright is indeed Mr Nakamoto that would not only help to illuminate the origins of bitcoin—it could also have a big impact on the future of the controversial cryptocurrency. Although the rhetoric has become less strident in recent weeks, the project has been held back by a deep split between those who want to keep bitcoin pure and those who want to modify its workings to allow it to grow rapidly—even if that means making it more like a conventional payment system. Having launched the bitcoin project with the publication of a paper in 2008, and then the first release of bitcoin software in 2009, Mr Nakamoto stepped back from active involvement in 2010. His return from obscurity would most certainly change the dynamics of the debate about bitcoin’s future direction.

Having been named as Mr Nakamoto once before, unconvincingly, Mr Wright has a steep hill to climb to convince the world that he is indeed who he claims to be. Evaluating his claim involves the application of a multi-step paternity test. First comes the factual evidence: can Mr Wright prove that he is in possession of cryptographic keys that only Mr Nakamoto should have? Second, does he have convincing explanations for the holes in the story which came to light when he was first outed in December? Third, does he possess the technical knowledge that would have enabled him to develop a system as complex and clever as bitcoin? And fourth, to what extent does he fit the image that people have of Mr Nakamoto; in particular, what do those computer scientists who have collaborated online with Mr Nakamoto think of Mr Wright’s claim to be him? These are the questions that the bitcoin community will be arguing about in the coming days—and which Mr Wright must answer convicingly if he is to convince the world of his claim.",2016-05-02 17:44:09

You would be making a horrible mistake. Satoshi is currently building a truly free market on a lone comet drifting in interstellar space far away from the jack booted nanny-state thugs on here on earth.  Once completed, he will crank up the ion engines and floor it back to earth through a bitcoin-based toll road in hyperspace.

On Satoshi's Interstellar Comet, no jack booted thug will point a gun at you and force you to connect to a ""publicly"" owned sewer system. Because we are all free men of the land, we should be allowed to dispose of our waste in ways that align with our Rational Self Interest. If you want to dig a pit on your Free Land to store your wastewater, that is up to you. If you want to connect to one of the four dozen private sewer systems, that is up to you.

If you use a private sewer system on Satoshi's Interstellar Comet make sure you do your research first. Because no nanny state exists to stifle these entrepreneurial businesses, there are no illegal regulations which restrict how they treat their water or maintain their infrastructure. Guided by the invisible hand of the free market, you get to decide if you want to pay extra to have your wastewater treated at a plant, or save a few Satoshi's and simply dump the waste into the ocean.

If you do elect to have your raw sewage dumped into the ocean untreated, make sure your sewer provider has a smart contract with the owner of the ocean it gets discharged in. There have been scams in the past where sewer providers dump raw sewage into areas without a smart contract and the ocean owner came after all the customers with a gun. Remember that Satoshi's Interstellar Comet has no illegal courtrooms, so it is up to your own rational self interest and the non-aggression policy to settle any disputes. If you get shot because your sewer provider was dumping your lead paint runoff into some free man's private ocean, it is your own fault. You should have traced the sewer line from your private land down to the outfall.

Please ignore any shills telling you who is and who is not Satoshi.  Satoshi is what you believe him to be. He loves his bitcoin holders and is constructing a glorious free market in his image.  All you have to do is buy and hold.  Ignore /r/BitcoinMarkets.  Ignore friends and family who tell you to sell.  Just hold.  When Satoshi returns, you will be glad you held.

Good luck!",2016-05-03 09:47:59

Some key quotes from the article

&gt;When interviewed in person, Mr Wright was often hard to follow, but he clearly seemed to know what he was talking about

Yep, this is how con men work.

&gt; As for the tax raid in Australia, he says that was not about him trying to evade taxes, but about how to tax bitcoin correctly

How did these journalists not look at the documents publicly released about Wright's tax scam already and not realize that the whole thing was an obvious fraud.  In order to believe his claims, we would have to believe that he purchased ""bitcoin banking"" software from the multinational company Seimens from Mark Ferrier, who was convicted of fraud in Australia for related schemes.  Isnt it obvious that multinational companies dont hire random con artists as outside sales representatives to do transactions in bitcoin?  

&gt;As proof of existence for his supercomputer...Mr Wright offers a letter signed by a local SGI director...SGI, which is based in Silicon Valley, has replied that its Australian director “acted as an individual and was not authorised.”  Wright's response : “It’s a big expensive machine, and we don’t want people to know where it is.”

Sounds like the model girlfriend in Canada story here.  

&gt; His doctorate in theology, however, remains a mystery and Mr Wright does not want to talk about it 

The only degree he has that isnt from a diploma mill and he ""doesnt want to talk about it""

&gt;He also says he can’t send any bitcoin because they are now owned by a trust.

BS.  He is the trustee, he could transfer them to another bitcoin address owned by the trust.

&gt;he rejected the idea of having The Economist send him another text to sign as proof that he actually possesses these private keys, rather than simply being the first to publish a proof which was generated at some point in the past by somebody else. Either people believe him now—or they don’t, he says. “I’m not going to keep jumping through hoops.”

d2qdp39,ydtm,31,"Actually, I think revoking Gavin's commit access is the best approach in this situation, simply because there is clearly something going terribly wrong involving Gavin.

Maybe he was duped. Maybe he was compromised. Maybe he was hacked. Maybe he was threatened. Maybe he was drugged. We just don't know. But [what he's doing makes no sense to any of use who have the most rudimentary understanding of math and crypto](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hjn4s/my_username_ydtm_refers_to_a_foundational/). It is bizarre and inexplicable.

Everyone knows that the only proper procedure to ""prove"" that someone is Satoshi is by cryptographically signing a message so that we can *all* verify it - a trivial task which takes minutes.

Instead, Gavin has allowed himself to participate in this spectacular farce.

This is not how a mathematician or security-conscious programmer would behave.

So I don't care how much we may like or ""trust"" Gavin. Rules are rules, and when the captain of the ship is displaying irrational behavior, you strip him of his command. 

So I support Peter Todd here.

Ultimately, I don't think we should have to rely on particular devs to get things right. Two plus two is always four, and all of us can independently verify that fact, without the help of any particular dev. The same applies to the (admittedly more complicated) math of Bitcoin: it doesn't depend on any one person, it's just mathematical *facts* which we can all independently verify.

When a dev starts publicly and adamantly claiming that 2 + 2 = 5 because some guy flew him into London and ""proved"" it to him on one factory-sealed new laptop - sure you wonder why, and maybe you feel bad for this dev who you once trusted and supported - but you still keep away from the project, simply as a precaution. They have a duty to protect their repo from irrational actors, and so they are doing the right thing here by keeping someone out who has violated the most basic rules of crypto.

Gavin can still work on Classic and Unlimited and whatever else - and I do hope that the code for Classic and Unlimited (ie, with bigger blocks) will come to be the code which runs on the network. Fortunately, we don't have to ""trust"" Gavin or anyone else. 

I am quite sure there is an ""optimal"" blocksize (for the world's particular environment, including the ridiculously small bandwidth imposed on /u/luke-jr by the backwards state of Florida and the latency of the Great Firewall imposed by the isolated country of China) which will eventually become evident to all of us - without any of us having to rely on something Satoshi wrote years ago, and without having to ""trust"" Gavin. Facts are facts and they will eventually prevail.

But I can't fault Peter Todd for advocating this basic security measure, in the face of this bizarre behavior by Gavin. This is one situation where I am appreciative of the conservatism and caution of the ""Core"" devs.

It is of course unfortunate that some small blockers may capitalize on this incident as a way to ostracize Gavin. And it may indeed be true that some Core / Blockstream devs have been looking for an excuse to lock Gavin out.

But still, Gavin brought this on himself. He could have remained skeptical (or simply un-involved, like Andreas). Instead, for whatever mysterious reason, he participated in this bizarre spectacle. Who knows why. 

But nobody deserves our automatic support and trust. That has to be earned. And right now, Gavin has thrown that all out the window.

d2r7kri,BobAlison,55,"Andreas is wrong. Satoshi's identity does matter to Bitcoin - a lot.

It matters because as long as that identity remains unknown, Bitcoin will face a major Satoshi coming out party once every few years. There will also be private coming out parties as well, with swindlers of all stripes claiming to have vast stores of money to post as collateral for loans. Only an expert would understand the proof, so don't worry about it.

The media frenzy generates publicity for Bitcoin. That gets people thinking about Bitcoin, but it comes with a helluva hangover when the fraudster du jour is unmasked. A bit of that taint sticks to Bitcoin every time.

But more importantly than that, think back to the block size limit debate. People who should have known better made routine appeals to authority and tried to claim the mantle of the Almighty Satoshi. The endless debates about Satoshi's original intent. The dissection, down to the atom, of Satoshi's every word. How the other side was abandoning Satoshi's vision.

How differently might that process have played out if Satoshi himself had weighed in?

There's this sinister misconception that Bitcoin is controlled by math. That the protocol stands like a majestic monument on a hill protected from defacement by the rabble below. I disagree. The Bitcoin protocol is controlled by people - people who decide what to believe and which software to run. The protocol is a work in progress subject to change at any time, and it's people who change it by their collective action.

Nothing catalyzes collective action better than a leader. If Satoshi were to make his identity known and once again start participating in the decision making process, it would change Bitcoin - perhaps irreversibly.",2016-05-04 01:54:28

There is also the sales tax case where the ATO found against him and penalized his company, Hotwire, $1.7 million. The way this worked is Wright funded the company with $30 million worth of Bitcoin. The company then purchased software from another Wright entity for $29 million. The first company then made a sales tax refund claim for this purchase and sought ~$3 million as a refund. What Wright was effectively doing was creating $3 million in real-cash refund from the tax office by transferring imaginary Bitcoins between himself. I detail how this worked [in my blog post from yesterday](https://www.nikcub.com/posts/craig-wright-is-not-satoshi-nakamoto/#ato)

That entity went from being founded to shutdown in months. The DeMorgan entity seemed to exist solely to make R&amp;D claims from the Australian government.

Wright's primary MO these past few years, prior to fleeing Australia, was using various entities to create real-dollar tax refunds out of non-existant Bitcoins. I'm surprised it worked for as long as it did.

d2r6l4o,0brain,41,"So there is this juicy quote from the first Gizmodo piece:

&gt; According to Paige, Wright eventually told him that Kleiman was the creator of Bitcoin. Later, he clarified that the cryptocurrency was invented by a group of people which included Kleiman.

(Patrick Paige was Kleiman's business partner)

Why did Wright change his story, first saying Kleiman was the inventor, then later relegating him to one of a ""group of people""?

Also, if you want to completely disregard the evidence from the ""hacked"" Wright files, there is some circumstantial evidence:

1. Kleiman was [active on the Metzdowd mailing list](https://www.mail-archive.com/search?l=cryptography@metzdowd.com&amp;q=from:""Dave+Kleiman""&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) since at least 2004, the list where Satoshi made the first Bitcoin announcement in 2008.
2. Kleiman was hospitalized in late 2010, where he would remain until April 2013. Gavin Andresen [became Bitcoin maintainer](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2367.0;all) in December 2010. And then Satoshi disappeared.
3. The time zone [checks out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37743.0). According to Stefan Thomas, if Satoshi followed normal waking hours, it would put him in the UTC−05:00 or UTC−06:00 time offset. Kleiman lived in Florida.

It makes me wonder whether it was Kleiman who actually enlisted Wright to assist with Bitcoin and not the other way around as Wright told Paige in 2015. This theory fits with the pattern of [PGP key](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/satoshis-pgp-keys-are-probably-backdated-and-point-to-a-hoax), [blog post and other falsifications](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/new-clues-suggest-satoshi-suspect-craig-wright-may-be-a-hoaxer) and [plagiarism](http://attrition.org/errata/plagiarism/it_regulatory_standards_compliance_handbook.html) that Wright has been engaged in.

A few hours later, after bitcoin/cryptography experts found the ""proof"" didn't actually prove anything and even replicated it themselves, not to mention pointed several flaws and bugs on the confirmation processes, they released a new article mentioning it and [saying the onus was on him to provide better evidence](http://www.economist.com/news/briefings/21698066-onus-on-craig-wright-provide-better-evidence-satoshi-nakamoto).

They did report on ""proof"" they didn't understand themselves. It wasn't rocket science, anyone with bare understanding of cryptography could see the flaws (as they did), but I don't blame the economist journalists much. They didn't actually use clickbait, and retracted themselves soon after they found about the problems with the alleged ""proof"".

Imagine a stock where:

 - There's limited issuance, i.e. the company can't dilute existing shareholders by issuing more shares, or split the stock, or decide the company's growth has flatlined and switches to penny dividends.

 - The stock trades 24/7 instead of during business hours, preventing a privileged 'after hours' set of traders. (Who are able to sell based on that 8pm quarterly earnings report which tanks the stock 20% in the morning.) 

 - High-frequency trading and more importantly, front-running isn't possible. (EDIT: yes, that's possible on an exchange, just not on the blockchain.)

 - Settlement/ownership occurs in ~10 minutes instead of 3-4 business days.

 - Trading fees are $0.02 - $0.05 instead of $5-$10. 

 - It's just math, you don't need TDAmeritrade to 'handle things for you, for a small fee.' Nobody can freeze your account because there's no account, or social security number, or even an identity needed to move your money around, just an internet connection. A four year old, a computer AI, a dog, or a refrigerator can buy and sell at will. 

 - The company literally can't go out of business, or be sued, or miss an earnings estimate, or have a CEO quit, or a union strike, or be broken up as a monopoly. Nobody says 'Oh man, looks like gold missed their quarterly estimate, they'll probably go of business soon. Silver is going to eat their lunch.'


The FANG stocks above trade with ridiculous, unsustainable earnings multiples. Tesla, for instance, is trading at [125x future earnings](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-05-03/why-tesla-short-interest-near-all-time-high-each-car-valued-620000-and-more). With a market capitalization of $31 billion, Tesla is valued at about $620,000 for every car it delivered last year, and about $63,000 for every car it hopes to produce in four years, in 2020. 


Yet Bitcoin, which is on track to become the world's reserve currency, with a fixed supply, immune from government inflation, quantitative easing and the ability to effortless cross borders without being taxes, seized or skimmed, is considered 'too risky'?

- Has not renounced CSW's claim to be Satoshi when there is scores of evidence showing CSW to be a fraud. We cant assume Gavin is that stupid, so was he assisting CSW? Either he was conned, or he was complicit - either way, it disqualifies his credibility.

d2tt9le,elux,20,"BBC 'journalist' Rory Cellan-Jones: 

&gt;I have always stressed that it was his endorsement by Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen from the Bitcoin Foundation that we found compelling. 

...

&gt;On Monday evening, I suggested to Wright's PR firm that if he could send me a fraction of a coin from an early Bitcoin block - which of course I would return - that might show he had Satoshi's keys. But Wright's team came up with a different plan on Wednesday afternoon.

&gt;They sent me a draft blog in which he outlined a scheme that would see Matonis, Andresen and the BBC all send small amounts of Bitcoin to the address used in the first ever transaction. Then he would send it back, in what would be the first outgoing transactions from the block since January 2009.

&gt;We went ahead with our payments - I sent 0.017BTC (about £5), which you can still see in the online records. Matonis and Andresen sent similar amounts.

&gt;Then we waited. And waited. Then my phone rang - with the news that the whole operation was ""on hold"", with no reason given. Eighteen hours later we are still waiting for the payments to be made - and now Wright's new blog says that is not going to happen.

Last summer I saw a bitcoin documentary where Bernard von NotHaus was interviewed and he mentioned the conference was in 2005 in Europe (paraphrasing) so a quick Google returns the 'What the Hack' conference and this has been discussed on reddit quite recently.

Only thing is there is a YouTube of JVP appearing near CW on a panel. Great coincidence. I watched it closely some months ago and it doesn't appear as though there is any recognition there.

d2v5pyw,thieflar,50,"It's not a stupid question at all.

SegWit is a clever trick that was developed which achieves a number of benefits, but the two most interesting ones are this:

1) By allowing signature data to be treated separately from other transaction data in Bitcoin, it allows more transactions to fit in each Bitcoin block. This basically means that more people will be able to use Bitcoin (and that average fees-per-transaction should drop). It is a ""capacity increase"", and one awesome thing about it is that it doesn't require a ""hard fork"" which basically just means ""an upgrade that a supermajority of nodes and miners must agree on, because with significant disagreement a network split could occur where a lot of people could potentially lose money"". Hard forks are generally seen as more risky than soft forks (and SegWit is currently being implemented as a soft fork).

2) SegWit actually solves another known issue in Bitcoin called ""transaction malleability"", which is a little technical quirk in the protocol which is rather annoying. The great thing about this is that transaction malleability was preventing much much cooler technology (like the Lightning Network) from being viable. Lightning Network is basically a layer on top of Bitcoin that would allow thousands of times more transactions to take place through ""payment channels"" without needing all these transactions to take up block space. A working Lightning Network would be the Holy Grail of scaling, and would basically mean that Bitcoin transactions can be instant and virtually free, and that Bitcoin can support billions of people using it for everyday commerce.


So, basically, SegWit is seen as a relatively safe upgrade that lays the foundation for serious scaling and other improvements.",2016-05-06 23:35:00
d2uagyp,PMYourKits,41,"It's amusing to me that people bring out the fact that reddit disproved something in 50 minutes that wasn't caught at the time.  

Ignoring the times reddit has gotten it wrong (bomber, etc), you're comparing one person, who is in a real situation, vs what is essentially the interconnected but singular hive mind of the human race.   That's like comparing a single computer with a supercluster.
Even if most of the individual nodes in that cluster pale in comparison to the lone computer, you put enough of them at a problem and they'll solve it faster just through the monkeys on typewriters factor.

Especially when you consider when people say ""reddit"" solved it, they really mean that a few people with similar technical level to gavin made posts that were collected here and parroted.

Hindsight is easy to evaluate, especially when someone else gives you all the answers to the test.  

I would challenge how many of the people calling for gavin's head actually read the breakdown of the signature forging and why it maintained its properties, and understood it.   While it's not the most complicated, it's certainly something that would cure insomnia in most people.

What will really be interesting, is how the various people respond to this event in the coming week or two, and what they prioritize. Their reputations, the bitcoin community, bitcoin as a system irregardless of the community, or the search for actual truth.  If G or I came out right now and said he was wrong to save his reputation, i'd consider that a bit disgraceful, since without knowing how and why he was fooled or what methods, it's not helpful to the community.

Gavin? Really?

&gt; In the past he has stated that “Satoshi can have write access to the github repo any time he asks.”, so if he is absolutely convinced that this is Satoshi, there is a risk that he’d give away the repository to a scammer.

But Gavin did not have merge rights AFAIK, so there's not much damage that could be done.

And trust managers in the 21st century write using 19th century typewritters and treat clients with 500M USD of assets under management with cold contempt, refusing to make appointments. 

And the trustee will let you sign with private keys twice (for Gavin and Jon Matonis) but not a third time because this would affect the trust assets (it's well known that private keys are subject to wear and tear). And Wright being so honnest will of course have religiously shredded the keys after each demonstration and had to ask for a new copy to the trustee each time instead of simply keeping the keys of block 1 and 9 handy.

Not to mention the decision to handover control of the complete Satoshi holding to a centralized fiduciary institution when the whole point of Bitcoin was to avoid that.

I am noticing Bitcoin is acting more and more like a natural commodity when compared to the recent action going on in the world financial markets.  Nations are currently in a currency war most notably between China, Japan, and Europe.. each with its own intricacies.  However the US economy is currently the strongest of them all but still making excuses as why not to raise our interest rate (Real reason: because we will crush all other economies, including our own.. though we would weather the storm a lot better than everyone else).  A large part is due to the political turmoil as Obama ends his 8-year legacy.  Yellen and friends are under direction of everyone in office to prop the economy up.  This means not raising interest rates which inadvertently puts us front and center in the global currency war.  

Meanwhile gold, oil, and real estate continue to be safe havens for value.  To bring everything full circle, in just this past week alone the USD has devalued greatly and has caused all sorts of pain across the US economy while simultaneously easing the burden on foreign countries (see USD/YEN forex over the past 14 day period).  What we are seeing in bitcoin is the reflection of all this economic drama in the form of BTC going up in value.  Now realize that BTC at $460/per is the same value as BTC was at $440 last week.  The interesting overlap comes when you compare BTC over the last 14 day period to Oil (@CL.1), Gold Industrials ($GDX), USD futures (@DX), and the S&amp;P 500 ($SPY) and you see a similar trend.  Commodities go up to as a safe haven from volatility.  Bitcoin is following right along.*

What does this mean for the future of bitcoin?  The Wright/Nakamoto story ended with a fizzle instead of a bang.  The markets shrugged it off and continued to keep pace with other commodities.  Bitcoin is entering a mature stage with the upcoming halvening event.  The current slow bull trend is bitcoin being realized as a a reputable, albeit expensive, store of value.  Until the global market situation resolves and a clear leader is established, expect Bitcoin to gain value over the next 2-3 years.  This is why I am a permabull and just see these $25 movements as day trading exercises.  Buy in May and go Away.

d2vb51r,nullc,19,"Gavin ""steered"" the project for three months before most of the current committers were actively contributing, more than five years ago (E.g. Satoshi stopped in December, Pieter's first commit was in March). Is three months ""long""-- especially relative to the years of near inactivity during the time since?  I am not saying he wasn't a major contributor for a long time-- but your characterization that he was running things long before anyone else showed up is simply wrong. And the characterization of him as a major contributor the last couple years is also wrong: Gavin largely faded out from Bitcoin Core when he created the Bitcoin Foundation.

No one seems to care about the people who came before Gavin, who left along ago. It isn't like Gavin was the first person after Bitcoin's creator to work on the project-- the first commit on github is sirus-m.

It was Gavin that proposed forking the project to Mike Hearn, a fact we know because Mike emailed the satoshi gmx account, which then forwarded it on to other people. -- For Gavin to take access away from the major active participants in a project he'd been largely inactive in for _years_ and had officially resigned from as far as its other contributors were concerned would have been absurd.

Come on.  The contributors to core have tried to avoid airing drama about this stuff for a long time, but these responses make it look like a mistake.  People demanded that Wumpus explain what was going on and he did so, nothing more. He was much more polite about it than he could have been.

People are thankful for the work that was done in the past-- and there was a good amount of it-- and that gratitude is shown in the effort they take to preserve, protect, and move forward the project every day. But being thankful doesn't mean giving someone an unlimited remit to behave however they want forever towards the contributors or in the name of the project, and it doesn't mean that everyone else should take unbounded costs and risks forever.",2016-05-07 01:36:17

d2vse9c,Polycephal_Lee,18,"&gt;pretty significant ups and downs

When there's chop in bitcoin, it's enormous. It's not unusual to see swings of 100% in a year and 10% in a day. And it's rarer, but sometimes you get 30%+ in a day (Aug/Nov 2015).

To be perfectly honest though, I only trade for fun, with really small amounts. That market is shallow and unpredictable, a single deep pocketed player can make instant 10% movements due to the lack of liquidity on most exchanges. I learned my lesson the hard way.

A significant portion of my networth is in bitcoin as a long term gamble on early retirement, but that's different, a complete gamble I'm willing to take when I'm young and single.",2016-05-07 08:34:07

&gt;In the past he has stated that “Satoshi can have write access to the github repo any time he asks.”, so if he is absolutely convinced that this is Satoshi, there is a risk that he’d give away the repository to a scammer.

After Gavin has clearly demonstrated a lack of accountability, you want to give him his repo write access back? After all these lapses in judgement?

You are being as naive as Gavin. Core is *hardly* a bunch of children for taking responsible and appropriate steps to protect the github from scammers.

I suggest you read more and re-evaluate your opinion after you've got the full scoop. I've supported Gavin through thick and thin over the last 3-4 years, but *this* is where its clear that he has gone too far.

If we never grant those we trust that trust, then they never have a chance to betray us. 

Im not suggesting that Gavin betrayed us, but I am suggesting that he has failed in a way that is important to every single person in the community. There can be no doubt after all of this mayhem, CW is not Satoshi, Gavin got ""bamboozled"" and he has failed us with his trust.

I think this will be a wake up call for Gavin. I had a similar wake up call years ago, and I turned from a gullible optimists to a critical thinker. I realized that I was falling prey to to-good-to-be-true theories and living my life in a reality of false assumptions.

Maybe Gavin will become more resilient after this, question things more thoroughly, be more critical. 

His main failing is that he gives too much trust to humanity. This is a beautiful failing, so he should not be harshly criticized for it, but he *should not* have admin access to this project. He has proven conclusively that it would be irresponsible.

This is coming from a very very long time Gavin supporter. I still like the guy a lot, and really hope that he and garzik continue to contribute to bitcoin core. They are extremely talented developers who's input could be used in what is a very small team running a global experiment.

d2x9vyl,Borrillz,55,"Another cash cow on the DNMs is MDMA.  It's really easy to source cheap and good quality MDMA from Europe, principally from The Netherlands, but the continental shipping makes it really high-risk.  Not to mention legalized ganja (although I heard there was some reform) in NL makes governments especially suspicious when packages originate there.

So imagine, some low-level drug dealer hears about the darknet, buys some bitcoin, and decides to order 30g of high quality MDMA from NL without knowing any of the risks.  If they were smart enough to order to a P.O box without giving major info (CC#, real name) they'll bitch about how the vendor is a scammer on the DNM sub.  If they were stupid enough to order it to their address they'll post how they got busted as soon as mommy and daddy bail them out of jail.

This happens for many drugs like LSD, ketamine, truffles and shrooms, ect... but I think MDMA is the biggest culprit out of Europe.  And I guess I made it sound like this only happens with ""mid-level"" deals, but even getting a gram from Europe is very dangerous.  And in no way is getting busted inevitable, but it's way more likely to happen ordering from NL compared to domestic orders

Just as an aside, a consequence of the risks of intercontinental shipping has created a niche for domestic resellers.  They're basically people who know a way to get large amounts of product through or around customs and resell in their home country.  Many of them are even endorsed by the manufacturer, it's almost like a brand.  Someday people are going to be writing economics papers on the DNMs, it's really fascinating.",2016-05-08 18:32:09

d2wgsqr,BobAlison,43,"From the homepage:

&gt; Gitian is a secure source-control oriented software distribution method. This means you can download trusted binaries that are verified by multiple builders.
&gt;
&gt;Gitian uses a deterministic build process to allow multiple builders to create identical binaries. This allows multiple parties to sign the resulting binaries, guaranteeing that the binaries and tool chain were not tampered with and that the same source was used. It removes the build and distribution process as a single point of failure.

Interesting that the sample project is Bitcoin itself.

d2wew6u,Emocmo,36,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

The price broke through the $460 barrier yesterday.  This places our movement in a positive breakout, right at the most significant resistance point since last fall.

Over the past several months, since we broke out to $500 last year, Bitcoin has attempted to break through the $465-70 barrier no less than four times.  It failed on each attempt.

Because of the serious consolidation since the first of the year I am optimistic that we will finally succeed this time.

With the breakout there are changes in our target numbers:

The estimated success of this break out is tarted using the formation with count and amount of the last break out.  Using the column width we add five boxes on top of the break out.  That puts our price target at $485.

Using the last break out (12 boxes from bottom to top) we overall THAT column onto our existing column—bottom to top.  That places this ‘rally’ at the $500-505 box.

Keep in mind it PnF charts are not day trading charts, but rather swing trade charts.  These target prices are for the next two weeks to a month.  They have been very accurate on the way down.  The way up?  They have been good long term, but not as precise.  So keep that in mind.

I am optimistic about this time.  I know it is dangerous to suggest “this time is different” because more often than not…its not.

But the trend is up and we are moving away from that slope.  The more distance from the support line, the better in my mind.  So, this morning I would suggest my optimism is probably a 7.5 out of 10.  If we break through $470 my optimism will be about a 9.

I wrote up some thoughts on other charts that are included below.  If you do not want to read about them, stop reading here.

Happy Mother’s Day to all of the moms out there.  Even though they are sometimes a pain in the ass, they are your mothers.  At least call them and sound sincere.

**Other Charts**

**VXX**

The VXX is about to form a double bottom under $16.00.  This would be the third time its approached an low in the $15.50 box since last August.   It ties the lowest point on the VXX chart since 2013.  

Betting that the VIX is going to go up seems to be a pretty obvious bet.  Of course, if the market goes crazy the price could go way up.  The 52 week high is $31.48.  The 52 week low is $15.90.  We are kissing the lows right now, without much further to go down.

**SLV**

SLV had a triple top break out last week.  The price is now 3 boxes above the break out price.  If it reverses here, it would indicate a bull trap and the price would go even lower.  

Just as we are seeing with the VXX we are near multi year lows.  I think we might see a little consolidation near this area.  However, if the VXX shoots up, it would mean a flight to quality which has recently meant gold.  If gold shoots up, silver follows.

I am optimistic we will see $20 before we see $10.

**Dow 30**

The Dow broke a descending triple bottom this is week.  That is an exceptionally bearish formation.  It means that the it is cascading down.  Now, it might not “sound” like that on CNBC or Bloomberg, but the chart doesn’t lie.  The range for a bad breakdown is 17,400.  Thats only 300 points away.  It has to his 17950 to break out positively,.


**S&amp;P 500**

The S&amp;P is in a precarious spot.  It need only drop below 2030 to indicate a breakdown.  The trend line is way down at 1900.  There is not a ton of support between where we are, and the trend line.  Some support at 2000 and 1950.  Nice round numbers.

**Gold**
(GLD)
The Gold chart is looking quite bullish.  With the recent move into the $123 box, be broke the downward trend that has been resistance since 2013.  This could be very bullish.

A move up to 124 would be a break out, after a long pole break out.  That is a very bullish indicator.

**Summary**

It is not often that several asset classes on the precipice at the same time.

The S&amp;P and Dow are on the brink of break downs.  The Nasdaq is very close to a reversal.

The VXX and Silver are near recent all time lows.  There is pressure for them to go up.

Gold has broken a several year negative trend and poised for its first big breakout in years.

I remain bullish on the VIX (VXX) for the near term, as a “black swan” trade.  When it goes up, it will pop up like a cork.  And by “black swan” means that I have some out of the money options that are a month out.  I periodically roll those options out another week.  It is really chump change to gain if and when the VIX goes back up.

I am bullish long term on Silver.  My silver options have been pretty successful since the end of February.  My silver options are slightly out of the money and no closer than six months.  If it pulls back for a few weeks, I will survive without massive losses.

I am less optimistic, but still positive on BTC.  It HAS to make a break at the $465-70 range to finally break through that 3,000 CYN resistance.  If it can do that, it is pretty clear sailing to $500.

The thing that everyone should be considering is that if the Dow and S&amp;P fall quickly there will be margin calls galore.  Traders will have to unwind and find cash quickly.  In the past that has hurt bitcoin in the near term.  Bitcoin is not quite a “flight to safety” at this time.  It might change.

The “doom porn” folks are expecting silver and gold to explode.  I don’t think “explode” is the right term.  But I think we are going to see some downward pressure on the markets.  

The yield on the 10 year Treasury is 4 bp from triggering a negative break down.  That it not a stretch either.  Obviously the “price” on the $UST is rising.  And its been rising since April 2004.  Nothing goes up forever.  A 10 year yield of 1.79% is not exactly predicting robust growth.

d2wpjcn,SirEDCaLot,24,"To answer this question, we must ask another:  Is Bitcoin-Core an independent open source project, which can operate autonomously in whatever manner its maintainers decide?  Or is Bitcoin-Core a standards body, which exists to hash out competing interests and create a protocol that's useful for everyone?

If Core is a project, then it is welcome to merge or exclude any code it wants and conduct its discussions in whatever way it deems useful, and anyone who doesn't like this is welcome to fork the code and leave.  This has been the *NIX way for years, and for the most part it works pretty well.  
If this is the case, then Core should not attempt to exercise any control over the overall ecosystem, they should accept their place as just one among many, with nobody obliged to use their code or their protocol.  They should not try and dissuade users from switching to other projects, including projects that are incompatible with their own.  Should incompatibilities arise, users will have the final say by creating a de facto standard.  

If Core is a standards body, then it has a duty to those who rely on it to foster open communication among ALL stakeholders and developers.  All decisions should be made publicly and with much input, without unbalanced input or favor to any one particular entity or group.  The decisions need not be 100% supported by everyone, but the PROCESS for making those decisions should be 100% transparent.  
If this is the case, then there should be some clearly defined boundary between the standards work and the implementation work.  Perhaps standards work should be on a different list (edit- apparently it is) or perhaps it should be on another medium entirely.  This is vitally important because someone who might be an important stakeholder in writing the standard might NOT be interested in writing code.  And discussions which might be offtopic for coding might be vital to standards work.  The same is true of moderation- if someone comes up with a bunch of bad ideas on a dev list, then sure by all means dump the post and declutter everyone's mailbox.  But in a standards body, no legitimately-posed idea should be censored.  

Right now Core seems to me to be trying to wear both hats, wearing the 'standards body' hat when fighting against BIP109 or any hard fork and wearing the 'project' hat when governing their own communication channels.  Problem is they never publicly acknolwedged the right of anyone else to hardfork Bitcoin without their permission, they say there's a BIP process for that.  But when the BIP discussions take place on their own dev list, we have a conflict of interest that results in the worst of both worlds.

-----

The funny thing is, one of my friends (several years ago) told me this would happen.  Said friend asked about disagreements, I explained the process and how everyone involved was dedicated to the future of Bitcoin.  My friend said (in rough terms), ""Someday, there will be a disagreement.  Right now you're all on the same side, but something will happen that will cause a split, and that's what will kill Bitcoin"".  I of course dismissed this and informed said friend that I'd be saying ""I told you so!"" from lunar orbit.  But my friend was right.  

We as a whole need to decide how things should work, and that discussion should include the Core devs.  Do we have an official standards body, or do we have techno-anarchy / most popular implementation wins?  ",2016-05-08 05:40:48

d2wj7qf,PredSpread,17,"**Incoming wall of text** tl;dr is in bold below

My word there is so much misinformation being relayed to OP in this thread. First off, I've got [extensive cashrep](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CSGOREPorts/discussions/5/618459405721778474/) to show that I've done this myself. I enrolled at university last September so I've had to stop trading as much as I'd like.

I started with about £800 to trade which is roughly $1200 (600 keys) so about double what you had. Although this was a while back, theoretically the same still applies today. I bought keys at $1.85-$1.90 and sold them at $2 via PayPal in smaller transactions. This required me bulk buying around 500 - 600 keys at a time then offloading them as fast as possible.

Skin wise, I cashed out a few people. It's relatively easy and although OPSkins has filled in that role you still find people looking to sell their items on the cheap.

First off, though, you need to understand what BTC is. BTC is a cryptocurrency which is decentralised (meaning it does not operate under a financial institution such as a bank). Each transaction must be verified by miners who earn a small fee for each they verify. Now the important part. **The price of all cryptocurrencies is not stable.** If you look at the [price history](http://www.coindesk.com/price/) you can see that there are large peaks and troughs in the USD price of BTC. Because there is no central bank or government, it does not fluctuate in the normal ways that a currency does. For example (assuming that the inflation rate is not a factor) if the UK government increases interest rates, borrowing rates fall as it costs more to take out a loan and people save money. Foreign investors with large amounts of funds move their money into the UK because their money is now going to appreciate more in a UK bank and so the demand for the GBP (£) increases causing it to *rise in value*.

What I'm trying to say is that if you have dormant BTC that isn't touched, you could find that that BTC is worth 25% less than what it was at the start of the week. Therefore, it is important to select the right wallet for you.

You have a huge amount of options when it comes to wallets. You have all-in-one wallets such as Coinbase which allow you to freely buy and withdraw money between BTC and your local currencies at a small (3%) fee. I use Coinbase and personally I would recommend them to anyone who is new to Bitcoin. I linked my bank information to my account and submitted different ID which raised my instant buy limit (the amount you can buy and BTC hits your account that second) to £500. The main advantage of being able to freely trade between BTC and your local currency is that any price fluctuation in BTC will be very short so long as you are buying BTC on an as-and-when basis. The largest price fluctuation I've seen in a transaction was 0.0008, or about 30 cents, on a $370 transaction.

More complex options include blockchain.info, Counterparty and Mycelium, but I don't know enough about these services or non-AIO wallet options to explain or endorse them in any way.

**TL;DR**

As to your specific questions, yes it is possible to buy inventories with keys. People do it all the time. The keys are then cashed out if the person is quitting.

Where? On this subreddit. You see it everywhere.

Is it better than BTC? Yes and no. When you buy inventories with BTC, you are relying on the fact that the other person: a) is too lazy to sell their skins for keys and then sell the keys; b) is in need of money now and not in the next few days; c) trusts you. Some people simply don't/can't wait a few days for the money, so they'll take the lesser amount of money in exchange for fast cash.

When you buy inventories with BTC, you have your costs too. Any fees charged by your wallet (Coinbase, for example, charges me 3%) and then you have to remember if you trade for keys, those keys are not $2.50 but are $2-2.10 (because you're dealing with real cash).",2016-05-08 02:35:50

&gt;The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with hardly a fraction in reserve. - Satoshi Nakamoto

d2xbo6d,ronohara,15,"You know things are bad when you reply to yourself .... but

Over time, I have become depressed by the lack of clear thinking and the ability to research/drill down for facts that affect things.

This seems to affect every part of life - people range from seriously limited abilities (disabled), through to (very rarely) a broad ranging but still very deep understanding of many disciplines (polymath). There are more of the former than the latter - and most people are somewhere in between.

Where this applies to trading BTC is in trying to predict how people react - because that is how the market price will react.

Anecdotal - sad by true. A professional Forex trader I know, who retired whilst a success, and has since been lured back to his old firm on a part time basis, has been learning slowly about Bitcoin.

He notionally has the skills to exploit this market, he has an asset base to play with, he is bored and looking for interesting things - but he has yet to put in the work to understand even the basics.

Even though I have mentioned it a couple of times, the halving will probably be a surprise to him.

d2wtyw7,[deleted],15," I am very curious to hear from Roger, after that 4 hour dinner, if he feels Adam Back's approach to scaling Bitcoin is done selflessly, or if Roger feels the solution is not being done fully in Bitcoin's best interest and possibly with other motivations playing into it (such as profiting the company Blockstream or its investors with the layer 2 solution of LN).

I know Roger supports larger blocks and I trust his judgment.

My question stated another way: is Adam's approach blindsided by lacking economic wisdom and being approached purely on a technical basis? That would at least be excusable on the basis of economic ignorance. Or does Roger believe there are factors (however slight or great) of Blockstream company/investor profit playing in here which contribute to a less-than-optimal scaling solution being envisioned for Bitcoin? 

It would be somewhat more comforting to know that the current Bitcoin scaling decisions were being made based on ignorance as opposed to maliciousness or greed, because education can resolve ignorance.

 Education and discussion cannot necessarily resolve greed.

Yes cashila is great for paying bills, I have use it for more than 10 months with no problems, nice and easy services.  
There is also bitwa.la in EU to pay bills but I prefer more cashila.  
I pay the rent in BTC for a year and the rest of my expenses online and directly to the merchants that accept BTC.  
In Mar 2015 I closed ALL my bank accounts and never used fiat money.  
Overall you are on the right way to start with bitwage and cashila. Try to limit you usage of plastic cards associated with BTC. Try paying only in btc. I have also a XAPO card that actually is a visa card issued by a 3rd party (not xapo). That card NEVER have a fiat balance on it. When you make a visa payment is instantly making the exchange from your xapo btc account into fiat and making the payment. I use this card very few times, extremely cases and never withdraw from atm.  
To obtain fiat cash for a beer better use bit2me services. Send some btc to an address they give you a code and withdraw from many atms with no need of bank account or card, directly cash. But again, make posible to pay only on BTC.  
In this year living on BTC, I changed many of my purchasing habits and I convinced many merchants around me to accept BTC. Despite many people complaining that they don't have places where to spend their BTC, there are many places that accept BTC but are not very well known (for many reasons). In small communities BTC is very well used.  
Bitcoin revolution start from the bottom not from the top. Start from your local community the adoption, not from your government and big companies.  
Yes paying your rent in BTC is a big step, because in that moment, there are at least 2 persons in your local community, that use BTC. Next will be the bar in the corner, where both of you drink your beer. Then the grocery store from the other corner, then the bakery, then the rest of shops.  
Adoption start from your neighbors and friends not from big companies and govs.

d2xtmyr,seeingeyepyramid,16,"This statement is completely false. **We have no idea if the Lightning Network will actually scale as claimed**. Its performance depends on the topology of the emergent network, the credit relationships, and the channel capacities. 

LN works best when a user makes repeated back and forth transactions with the same merchant. Is that the relationship drug addicts have with their dealers? Or is it a one way flow? One way flows quickly exhaust channels, need to be settled, and new channels need to be established on the main chain.

So, Blockstream is NOT designing for 1B users. They are designing for Greg Maxwell's ego. Greg has a vision for a currency that is completely separate from Bitcoin, and he is implementing it on top of Bitcoin. 

Greg's last vision was something called ""sidechains."" Sidechains were also supposed to help us scale. And they were supposed to be ""trustless."" How many of us have seen a sidechain in action? How many have seen a trustless sidechain? 

Bottom line is that Greg has a history of coming up with half-baked solutions that never fully work. He also has a history of not giving credit where it's due, of trying to act like some kind of a knowledgable cryptographer even though he is at the level of a first-year masters student. 

In short, Greg is playing a zero-sum game. Bitcoin has some number of users. He is trying to shift them all to Lightning. That's it. There's no more to it. He's doing this to prove to himself that he is better than Satoshi, but frankly, the sidechains experience already shows that he's nowhere near.

This is despite Satoshi Nakamoto having emailed Adam Back personally wanting to talk about Bitcoin even before the Genesis block had been mined.

So Adam founded his company a year after the bubble in November 2014 because he claims that he now suddenly understands Bitcoin. But he *still* refuses to acknowledge that Bitcoin is able to scale adequately **on-chain** and he *still* refuses to raise the 1 MB blocksize limit.

Not only can it be argued that he *still* does not understand the basic fundamental economics of Bitcoin, but it can also be argued that letting him make decisions about how to properly scale Bitcoin is *actually directly dangerous* for Bitcoin. 

It is said that Adam's main technical advisor Gregory Maxwell initially not only misunderstood Bitcoin as well, but even claimed to have ""mathematically proven that Bitcoin can never work"". These are the kinds of people we have in charge of the economic parameters of the Bitcoin Core software whose rules everyone is currently running.

We need to change who is in charge or Adam and Gregory will be proven to be right. Bitcoin will die and they'll tell us ""We told you so. It could never have worked."". We need someone in charge that understands that the original idea of on-chain scaling worked perfectly fine, still works and will keep working just as originally intended. 

There was never any mention of ""eventually we'll need to move most of the transactions off-chain because on-chain scaling *will never work*"". That's something that Adam and Gregory has added later *because they never actually understood Bitcoin in the first place*.

Luckily Bitcoin comes with a built-in voting system. Miners voting for a change in governance and leadership is long overdue and adoption has stagnated because of the current leadership. 

Vote for a change and watch adoption rise just as the blocksize limit will be raised. Or keep voting for the people who still believe that Bitcoin won't work. Because that's what ""Bitcoin on-chain scaling will never work"" *actually* means. ",2016-05-10 23:53:03

The rest of the world knows that in real life the best way to keep it running is to have proper and regular maintenance and testing. The engineers are needed, not the ""security people"" to do that job.

What Bitcoin Core is dramatically missing is good software engineers that know about peer-to-peer networking, writing good software with automated tests and high quality requirements.

Saying that Bitcoin is security software is taking about 5% of the functionality of the software and making it sound like its the whole thing. The result is that you get poor software quality measures.

Did everyone notice that in the 0.12.1 release Core pushed out around 700 lines of untested and new code. That amount of new code should not be labelled to end users as 'stable' and pushed out in a bug-fix release.

d2yqv0l,_nightengale_,16,"Visa Europe Announces Collaboration with SatoshiPay:

http://www.visaeuropecollab.com/news/2016/5/5/micro-payments-and-the-internet-of-things

Relevant (&amp; bullish) excerpt:

""What would such a use-case require from a payments system?
First and foremost, it would require a new type of currency; one of tiny denominations. Imagine if the lightbulb was on for mere seconds (perhaps it is a lightbulb in a walk-in-wardrobe into which I’ve walked only to retrieve a specific item of clothing). The cost of the electricity consumed would be only a fraction of a penny.

This requirement disqualifies known fiat currencies as eligible candidates. Why? Because all fiat currencies are designed for an analogue world – for humans. The denominations are per hundred. There are one-hundred cents in a Euro or a Dollar; one hundred pennies in a Pound. These denominations are too large to facilitate a micropayment. (Although some would argue that these payments can be “rolled up” – aggregated to sufficient size before being executed.)
Secondly, the cost per transaction would need to be minute – almost free – and certainly a lot less than whatever amount is in question. Using the current rails – say the scheme rails or ACH – would be prohibitive. The cost of the transaction would significantly outweigh the values in question.

A much more eligible candidate currency would be a cryptocurrency – like Bitcoin or Ethereum’s Ether. Why? Firstly, because the denominations go down to the tiniest amount. The smallest denomination of Bitcoin, for example, is the so-called Satoshi (named after its mysterious alleged founder) which is one-hundred-millionth (that’s 0.000000001) of a Bitcoin. Secondly, because the cost of the transaction CAN become almost negligible, using smart contracts that enable an escrow without a trusted third party.

For this reason – and also because we here find two of our Collab themes (Smart Cities/IoT + Blockchain) collide and interlink – Visa Europe Collab is pleased to announce a Proof-of-Concept we are running with Berlin based start-up SatoshiPay, to demonstrate micropayments in a M2M context. What EXACTLY we are doing with SatoshiPay (what use case in IOT) we will leave for a future blog-post…suffice for the moment to say it involves porting the SatoshiPay client to an IoT device.""",2016-05-10 01:29:08
d2yria7,coinaday,16,"&gt; Wait. He spent $3500 on 6 BTC.

No, he says later:

&gt; The 5 bitcoins cost me about 2300USD

So he's telling us the total amount he pulled out of the bank for some irrelevant reason but I think he spent less than $3500 on the 6 bitcoins. I guess the rest was for the weaseldust that made this all seem like a good idea?

Edit:

&gt; Now i only have 100 dollars left in my bank,  i am basically broke,  my whole saving gone!
&gt;
&gt; Was this a bad idea?   after i buried it i was starting to feel like it was a bad idea,   

/me sigh

This is exactly why I've tried to make the argument that cryptocurrency enthusiasts ought to be acting as if they have fiduciary obligations when they talk about cryptocurrency to people. Someone fed this guy a bunch of over-enthusiastic crap to get him to do this. If they were giving him a balanced view, then at the very least, he should have started building a position much more slowly, and certainly, should not have put this much of his liquid reserves into something he's not planning to touch for a very long time.

Edit 2:

&gt; i did not put 1 bitcoin in each stick,   i put the 5 bitcoins together on 1 wallet, then just copied it to all the usb sticks,  
&gt;
&gt; i never thought about doing that, now that i think about it, it would've been a better idea of putting 1 bitcoin on each stick, just in case one fails,  

...what? They just convinced him to do something even stupider! With how he currently has it, it would take a failure of all 5 (which doesn't seem implausible to me after being stored outside, but let's ignore that). With the new suggestion, a failure of any of them would result in a loss of bitcoin!

Edit 3:

&gt; &gt; Can the USB stick last that long? I heard the electron will migrate and leak out. The information will be lost.
&gt;
&gt; Yup, if a USB has data stored onto it, and doesn't have room to breath, it'll slowly corrupt itself as it attempts to survive in such an environment.

...while I agree with their conclusions, and don't know how I'd describe the process accurately myself, I don't think these are particularly stellar descriptions. Hilarious though!

Edit 4:

&gt; i am very confident bitcoin is the future,  steam recently started accepting bitcoin, i was waiting for that 

...

&gt;  have been researching bitcoin for almost 1 year now, and i have come to the conclusion that as soon as it hits mainstream the price the skyrocket

Yeah, there's definitely going to be a lot of people pulling all their money out of banks, buying bitcoin, and burying it in their backyard any day now.

&gt; i don't see any problem with burying things,  my grandpa buried money and valuables in his backyard all the time,
&gt;
&gt; his advice was ""in the 97 years on this earth, i have never trusted the banks""

I'll bet grandpa wouldn't have put all his money into Bitcoin though.

Edit 5:

&gt; You still own the 5 BTC which will be worth a whole lot more, soon. Wink

Statements like this deserve criminal charges.

Edit 6:

&gt; Nah. Not good enough. Tattoo the private keys on the inside of your foreskin and become celibate. And never show it to a doctor either. 

I'm 75% confident this guy is joking. Presuming that, I'll add: make sure to kill the tattoo artist after. Or better, do the tattoo yourself!

Edit 7:

&gt; But what are the real odds of a usb stick wiping itself. It's like 1 to a 100billion? Especially if you have 2 sticks.

...yeah, those are definitely the odds after you've buried the USB sticks beneath a bird bath and wait for two decades.

The linked email basically states that he wants to create and maintain a miner monopoly helping the current set of big-miners.  Important to note is that home miners, even those that join pools, are hurt by this. In case they ever want to buy new hardware, they can't get equipment that is designed to use much less energy (electricity) because Todd wants to change Bitcoin to avoid that.

If Bitcoin fell under a jurisdiction, they would call this monopolistic behaviour and he'd be easily found guilty with evidence like this.

Defending Banks and criticizing one of their own without even knowing the facts.

As it turned out after facts came out it seemed that the case against Shrem was very shoddy and seemed like a regulator trying to gain publicity possibly for a political career.

The pro-regulation people, and that includes Gavin, ditched Shrem like he was poison, and he was one of them before.  

Mike Hearn
&gt;Shrem is accused of something entirely different - not just doing an insufficient amount of work, but knowingly co-operating with someone he knew was a Silk Road dealer explicitly to help him launder money. It's the ""knowingly"" part that makes the huge difference.
The US DoJ did not seem to have large piles of emails from the head of compliance at HSBC showing him buying drugs and helping known dealers to evade his own controls. With BitInstant they do.
It's really no wonder Bitcoin businesses can't get bank accounts, when guys like Shrem were putting on a respectable face and doing that kind of thing behind the scenes. Silk Road and those involved with it are by far the most damaging thing that could ever have happened to Bitcoin, especially so early on.

The comment was made a day after Shrems arrest. There were other similar comments by Mike.

As it turned out all Shrem done was email some guy where he can buy weed online. HSBC installed special deposit holes for drug cartels to drop in suitcases of money, but supposedly HSBC 'knows nuffin!'.",2016-05-11 10:43:03

I stress the hell out, and end up fucking up one small detail that diverts my course of life, kicking off a chain of events make predicting my future social relationships all but impossible.

""Fuck it,"" I tell myself, ""I'll just work on my financial future."" I try to invest but realise, oh shit, I actually knew nothing about which companies were winners in my home country when I was ten, plus I have absolutely no capital to invest, plus I'm goddamn ten years old so adults don't trust my advice about investments or start-ups.  'Google!' they chortle. 'Bitcoin!' they laugh. 'Apple, Tesla, Facebook!' they snigger. 'What a hoot!' I can't even remember any winning lottery ticket numbers.

""Okay,"" I say, stamping my feet in frustration. ""At least I can do something to prevent terrorist attacks and national disasters!"" I call up the police, the FBI, national seismic monitoring services. But I'm ten. No one believes me. Worse still, when these attacks happen, the FBI and national security services come to interview me and family, suspecting some link. My house is placed under surveillance. My family can't do anything without being followed or harassed by the police. 9/11 happens, and I can't stop it. Guilt, frustrating and a depressing feeling of impotence overwhelm me. I start self-harming and using drugs to cope. My parents split up. My sister stops speaking to me. 

I eventually come clean about being from the future. Everyone laughs and I'm ridiculed. I lose all my friends and have to drop out of school, ostracised as the weird kid who predicts the future only sometimes. However, foreign intelligence agencies think I'm some genius psychic posterchild who can foresee the future and help their national agendas. I'm kidnapped, experimented on, given a cocktail of hundreds of drugs, cut open, prodded and pocked by doctors and researchers.

As I sit deep in some underground, top-secret bunker, I think, ""oh well, I might as well make the most of it. They gave me a PS2! I can still enjoy the old games."" But the graphics are shitty, and they're all games I've finished a dozen times before.

Eventually I become listless, withdrawn - a shell of my former life. The research isn't going well, so I'm eventually thrown out (the scientists laugh, realising I must have been crazy or a conman - I'm not even worth killing because my story is so absurd).

I become homeless, wandering the streets. I find a society that helps out the desperate and needy. I clean my act up, become sober, and get a job. The pay isn't much, but it's a living. I move out of the shelter and find a small apartment in the outskirts. On Sundays I volunteer at the shelter that helped me. I meet a girl who also volunteers there. We become friends. We end up dating.

A year later, sitting on in the living room with a beer in my hand, and my girl next to me, I give thanks for all the little things that make life worth living, and think, ""hell, I wouldn't change a thing.""

Why would a government want to put backdoors in mining ASICs?  They may want backdoors in trezors, in the master nodes of mining pools, in the laptops of bitcoin users... (Are you sure that your computers have no backdoors?)

d33ngxk,toomim,65,"Thank you /u/taxed4ever! Here's my response:

&gt; one of their concerns is that Classic requires additional developers for regular maintenance of the code.

We really need to clear up this misconception! I think it stems from the reasoning that:

1. Bitcoin Classic is a different implementation than Core
2. Switching implementations makes you dependent on new developers for maintenance
3. Therefore, Classic needs a development team as large as Core's to make it safe to switch to.

But this is far from reality. Here are some talking points:

1. Bitcoin Classic is only a 951-line *patch* to Core, not an alternate implementation. The other 99% is still Bitcoin Core, maintained by Core's development team.
2. If anything goes wrong, miners can toggle back to Core in ~20 seconds with `bitcoin-classic/bitcoin-cli stop; sleep 5; bitcoin-core/bitcoind`, eliminating risk.
3. Miners can use Classic to increase the block size, without changing development teams. Once we reach 75%, Core will add 2MB block support, and miners can switch back to Core.

To make this concrete, let's look at the source code. The branch for v0.11 [consists](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-guided-tour-of-the-2mb-fork) of these 5 commits on top of Core (excluding the documentation and build process changes):

1. [Minimal consensus/miner changes for 2mb block size bump.](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/8b63a1c2d664a55e3c07d297c7bd2fbb452860cf) (+44 lines of code)
2. [Two megabyte fork after miner vote and grace period](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/d86ff54efa06a43464b9945fe7a32eb14408ae54) (+635 lines of code)
3. [Accurate sigop/sighash accounting and limits](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/842dc24b23ad9551c67672660c4cba882c4c840a) (+143 lines of code)
4. [Bug fixes and more tests for version bits-based deployment](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/commit/5e69cf6b99cdf812bc26128b0d61f0fd0ab51f63) (+116 lines of code)
5. [Do not relay or mine excessive sighash transactions](https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/pull/65/files) (+13 lines of code)

These 5 changes add up to 951 lines; from a total of 102,376 lines for the entire codebase:

    bitcoinclassic/src$ gfind . \( -name '*.[ch]' -o -name '*.cpp' \) -exec cat '{}' \; | wc -l
      102376

That's a change to &lt; 1% of the entire codebase! In other words, Classic is &gt; 99% the same implementation as Core. It's more accurately described as a ""patch"" than an ""alternative"" implementation. In contrast, here are some actual alternative implementations that fully rewrite a node:

* [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd)
* [toshi](https://toshi.io/)
* [bitcoin f#](http://bitcoinfs.github.io/bitcoinfs/)

If you use one of these, you depend on a new development team to maintain new code. If you use Classic, you depend on Gavin, Jeff, and Tom Zander et al. to maintain 951 lines of code, and Bitcoin Core to maintain 101,425 lines.

If Classic hypothetically did fall behind Core in maintenance (like being late to deploy a security patch), Miners could switch to Core at any time with `bitcoin-classic/bitcoin-cli stop; sleep 5; bitcoin-core/bitcoind`, because the binaries use the same data and config files and implement the same API.

Thinking that Classic needs an entirely new development team to compete with Core is a mistake. Classic collaborates with Core, and simply implements a blocksize increase, along with an escape hatch to fall back to Core if anything goes wrong. Please let us know how the miners respond.

Consistently I have pointed out this:  The BU work appeared inferior in terms of bandwidth savings compared to previously existing proposals (requiring on the order of 100% overhead for a filter), it also has a trivially exploited vulnerability (which its proponents seem unable to understand).  The BU work is also inferior in terms of _latency_ compared to the fast block relay protocol (requires 1.5 RTT minimum instead of 0.5 RTT). NOT THE RELAY NETWORK, as that is an apples to oranges comparison. (The fastblock relay protocol can and is used external to the relay network).

As such, it's kind of an odd duck, neither optimizing bandwidth or latency, while adding an large amount of implementation complexity (the patch submitted to bitcoin ""classic"" is 8149 lines -- more than 5 times larger than compact blocks), increasing bloom filter dos exposure, and introducing its own collision delay design flaw.  It also lacks a written specification (There is a ""BUIP"" document which doesn't tell you anything you need to know in order to implement it or even to review the protocol in detail).

But as a matter of fact, contrary to the claims up-thread it was never submitted to core and wasn't rejected. (In fact, its authors were invited to submit a BIP [and declined](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-March/012538.html)).",2016-05-13 06:14:46

Currently there are a a handful of classic devs which are dedicated and focussed on building out the tools and build infrastructure to make it easier for other devs to build on top, but any dev is free to contribute to the classic client just the same. 

The point here that you can give the miners is that if they are feeling uncertain about the present classic team (too small, etc) then they should remember that if classic becomes the popular client then there will be many more devs who may join the team.  Classic is more an alternative roadmap and feature priorities.

d34lfgi,throwierme,40,"My 2 cents.

I was early to bitcoin (2011) - I won’t rehash my full story (it’s in my comment history) but I am one of those people that literally held all the way through. I do not day trade and I can count the “moves” i’ve made with one hand. 

At the very beginning my stash was down by 90% but I never sold. That stash — which was only used for  crypto projects, went to Ethereum, Maidsafe, Storj (yes I made some bad bets too, but thankfully my big one was right) — has given me a very good return. These were all based on a specific thesis on what crypto actually is all about.

IMO you have to be “irrational” — but only in the sense that you do not look with eyes of the present. Ecommerce didn’t make sense in 1995 — rationally and logically. It is 2016 and we are looking at the DAO, Ethereum and Bitcoin with 2016 eyes. 

If you’re making a bet *at the edge* (like Bezos did with online commerce for example) you will need a thesis on where the world is going and then you have to make a leap — you will ignore present details that makes one “rational” (buying online is truly terrible UX, much better offline, can’t hold merchandise, nobody wants to use their credit card…)  in favor of looking at the broad trajectory of technology and the world itself.  

The 40,000 view is simpler and broader than what you write. It’s not price targets or little details. It’s about looking at the trajectory based on a few principles. From printing press, to broadcast, to internet… from single-purpose blockchain to general….from automation at the bottom, to automation at the top….

There are broad themes at play here and it becomes a bit more obvious where this is all going. 

That does not mean TheDAO will be successful. Of course not. Make no mistake — it is highly risky and has a significant chance of failure. All I’m saying is this: this is part of the trajectory. Just like Bitcoin was, just like the Internet was. If not today, someday, by someone.

Time is like a fog. You can see the rough shapes ahead, but as you move through you gain more clarity. Act accordingly. Peace.",2016-05-14 06:58:55

hahaha I hadn't heard that one, can you please fill me in.

Regarding the article, it's becoming more of the same at this point.  Sanders was a charming little underdog candidate fighting against ""The Establishment"" when he first arrived on the national scene, but the more you learn about him and his ""policies"" the less sense they make and the more the whole thing falls apart.

He really is reddit's political sense personified: lofty ideals, lots of anger, but no decent answers or even strategies.  The whole thing reminds me of bitcoin.  It started out with basically no regulation and no rules, because ""fuck big banks, we won't be like them.""  Slowly, scam after scam, it became apparent that these regulations needed to exist in one form or another, and they were there, imperfect as they may be, for a reason.

If the country did everything Sanders wanted (which of course would never happen with Congress anyway, but let's say it did) in four years everyone would look around and say, ""Shit, I guess some of those things Sanders was so against were actually there for a reason, they had a purpose, and burning them all down wasn't the smartest thing to do.  Things actually suck now much worse than we thought they did back in 2016.""

It's almost kind of sad- ALMOST!- that he won't win so his moronic fans won't actually see how bad his ""policies"" would be.  Instead, as things still fuck up from time to time and even under the best circumstances aren't as efficient as we'd like, they'll bitch and moan about how everything would be perfect if we got Bernie into office.

But really this could go to 3100 CNY and then sideways. 3300 CNY then sideways. Why take it right to 4000 CNY or $680 unless you get new money FOMO. But to have the range go from $220-$300 to $375 to $475 in 2 months and then price just dies at $460ish should be a good sign.

[Factor in localbitcoins.](https://coin.dance/volume) 

Then all of the other exchanges and ways to buy Bitcoin. I suppose there are always large holders liquidating the whole way up. Sell some high and have low buy orders and just bet on the price always going up and down. Which will make it harder to go up and down as there is always people ready to sell and buy back $25-$50 cheaper. But that's where the FOMO comes from. When those times you sell and price keeps jumping $25 so you buy back in sending the price higher. 

Enough rambling for now. Just remember we are in a bullish pennant that can't be more clear. Just a search of Google images turned this up. Looks just like the $220-$300 range with a pump and consolidation in the $400's http://i.imgur.com/Y51IAAt.jpg",2016-05-14 14:26:59

What mystical dark secrets do you think are out there?

Here's the ""darkest"" stuff you will find on Tor hidden services, if
you actively go looking for it (ignoring the very large amount of
non-dark material). ALL of this can be found by surfing around
on various Wikis, search engines, and directories.

- You will find a fair number people selling drugs.
- You will find some people selling stolen goods or doing carding.
- You will find a few people selling guns.
- You may find a few places where you can get malware frameworks, or
  rent botnet time.
- You will find Bitcoin laundries in service of the above.
- You will find many scam versions of all of the above.
- You will find services that are basically guaranteed to be total fakes
    - Hitmen
    - ""Hackers for hire"" who claim to be able to get into anything
    - People pretending to be connected to mystical shadowy
      underground syndicates, who will happily take your money to arrange
      just about anything.
- You will find people talking about random sexual fetishes, and maybe
  porn of those.
- You will find people talking about their sick violent fantasies.
- You will find a bit of revenge porn.
- There's one place that claims to sell/trade ""real"" rape and sexual
  blackmail stuff, and they've been around long enough and sound
  credible enough that they may be real. I'm not about to give
  them money to find out, and, no, I will not give you a link.
- You will find collections of gore pictures and videos from wherever.
- You will find links that claim to go to child porn. I assume
  many of them really do. Child porn will *not* pop up in your
  face when you're trying to read about petunias.
- You will find discussion and community sites for all of the above.
  If you ingratiate yourself enough and prove your ""trustworthiness"",
  I presume you may get invited to places where you can get more or
  ""better"" versions of any of them. Conceivably even invited
  to meet somehow in meatspace. But just like in real life, you
  would have to become a trusted member of their community, not
  just surf in over Tor.

Many of the links will be dead. Some of the same stuff is on the
clearnet.

You will not find the Terrorist Central Command (you may find one or
two propaganda sites). You will not find a slave auction where anyone
can bid. You will not find Jimmy Hoffa. You will not find the secret
to massive wealth. You will not find the nine billion names of
God. You will not find Cthulhu. You will not find the truth about the

The big checklist on your website claims that BigChainDB is immutable. I would love to hear your opinions on what gives Bitcoin its immutability and how you think your product delivers those. Blockchains on their own—aka hashed linked lists—are not immutable, even after being deployed in a distributed setting. Ideally, it'd be great if your engineers could sketch out a proof of immutability and what assumptions must hold to deliver on that claim to which you've convinced investors, users, and ultimately yourselves. My intuition says that the ""immutability"" claim is very weak and relies on some otherwise unrealistic assumptions.

EDIT: I read through the whitepaper, it seems that the authors confuse the definitions of tamper-resistance and immutability.  The paper essentially argues that immutability is provided by hashing everything and including the hash of the previous block.  Thus, changing any previous entry invalidates all forward blocks.  This does satisfy the definition of tamper resistance, but is not immutable. Bitcoin's strong, but in no way absolute, immutability is maintained by the laws of physics (Proof of Work), replication across mutually distrusting parties, and economic incentives to achieve correctness. All three of these work in concert to provide immutability, and removing any one (and possibly other features that aren't coming to mind) ultimately destroys the immutability property.

d34dgc2,8yo90,10,"&gt;I poured into the ecosystem a huge amount of savings that I had amassed before I had even heard of Bitcoin, and I've poured in millions of dollars since. I've spent nearly every waking moment for the last six plus years working on this, and all of this was due to the original vision that Satoshi laid out. Today that vision is being morphed into something that I didn't sign up for, or agree with when I got started six years ago. 

To me, this was the most important line of the piece. Satoshi launched Bitcoin with a vision - that Bitcoin itself is a P2P cash system. Perhaps millions of people have ""signed up"" to that vision. But now, a small number of people are imposing their different vision (settlement network) on us by obstruction. Far from really even trying to convince people of their new vision, instead they've used underhanded tactics like censorship to destroy the community.

Further, there is simply no need for all of this. Practically no one really thinks a 2mb blocksize limit would permanently destroy bitcoin. But small increases like that would give all possible scaling solutions - on-chain and off-chain - a chance to develop and for people to naturally gravitate to the best one. Instead, a small number of people have decided that only one method - the technology of which does not yet exist - will be the solution. It's not only wrong to the community, it's a terrible way to go about solving the scaling problem. Can they stop the central planning?

We're living in dangerous times. How far will central bankers and politicians go by trying to print money and trying to create a wealth effect and by doing so, damage the economy?

I'm a ""big-blocker"", but the fuss about transactions per second and conspiracies and economic ignorance surrounding peripheral bitcoin payment rails are so misguided.

Physical tokens have sneaker-net built in. A digital token, like bitcoin, was going to have to have its own payment network built in, to allow us meatbags to do anything with it at all.  The significance of this seems to escape most bitcoiners (or rather, the insignificance of the in-built payment network relative to the promise of a market-based money token, seems to elude their understanding).

The production of a monetary system is subject to public goods problems.  Without a central authority declaring it's use and value by fiat, getting a market-based currency to monetary status is a huge challenge.

The focus needs to be brought back to the network effect, closing transaction loops, the store of value, the anti-state/control properties of the token, the fomo and the love of the moon-shot (yes buttcoiners, we are indeed hyping and ""faking it 'til we make it"" quite intentionally as part of the strategy to overcome the public goods problems) and achieving (especially in internet dominance) unit of account status for the token.  

Even with the biggest blocks reasonably possible; the Bitcoin payment network is unlikely to serve as the payment network for most everyday btc transactions, nor will the core protocol ever serve everyone's needs and niches.

d3694fp,agreenbhm,13,"Really people, we're going to sit here and complain about how the banks are making all of this money off of doing nothing, but Bitcoin is so much better because banks don't get the fees? Someone calculated about $500 million was paid to miners in 2013, and that is based off of a mere fraction of the amount of money processed by the banks we're complaining about. Apples to apples, if Bitcoin processed the same dollar amount as the banks, what would be paid to miners? If the banks made $1.7 trillion on the equivalent of miner fees, that's about 3400 times what miners made in 2013 (according to the other poster). I would be surprised to find that the banks processed only 3400 times more transactions than Bitcoin that year; I'm guessing it's much greater than that. So yes, with Bitcoin it's decentralizing  those fees, but as it is now the banks are the ones doing the ""work"" of running the network, so they get all the fees. I don't see this in particular as being an issue. 

All in all, I love and support Bitcoin, but I think the fee argument is a non-issue, as it would appear Bitcoin is more expensive and disliking banks for keeping fees earned for a system they designed and run is just silly. 

Edit: This [article](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-market-share-statistics-1264.php) states that in the US there was about $4 trillion of transaction volume by credit cards in 2014. The article in the OP is talking about revenue from all banking transaction processing worldwide, not just credit cards. It doesn't mention what the transaction volume was to create that fee revenue, but I would imagine we're talking about 10s to 100s of trillions of dollars, at least. As I said below in another comment, it's difficult to predict what Bitcoin would look like at the equivalent volume, but I don't think the result would be nearly as impressive if we looked at a 1-to-1 comparison. 

Edit 2: I read another article a little while ago suggesting that the total transaction value of all transactions the OP is talking about was approximately $630 trillion in 2014. The numbers following are rough estimates, so take them with a grain of salt. $1.7T is 0.27% of $630T. According to [this](https://blockchain.info/charts/cost-per-transaction-percent) chart the mining percentage of the value of transactions processed is roughly 2.3% over the last year (I'm on mobile so I have limited access to specific historical data). This is approximately 850% greater than the fees charged by traditional payment processors. The equivalent would be $14.45T.

Like I said, none of these totals are concrete, but I am pretty sure that the banking industry is charging a lot less per-transaction than miners are making. ",2016-05-15 21:46:51

d37iywj,cryptonaut420,17,"ugh it's so frustrating how chinese miners can't seem to see through all the cheap political tactics and obvious bullshittery from BS-Core. Or maybe they do but are too afraid to do anything about it, or maybe something even more shady is going on... I don't get why the hell they want to stick with this ""agreement"", seeing how Adam Back-tracked on his signature and they kinda dropped the ball on SW release. What exactly were miners threatened with if they don't comply?

Luke, Peter etc. are still humming and hawing about what random things they want to stuff into their hardfork proposal (1.5 months left!), even openly thinking about messing with PoW which of course is a perfect way to further delay things and make it more contentious (/u/adam3us remember your comment about ""absolutely no ambiguity with hard forks, never!""? You still think Bitcoin is non-political? serious question). Meanwhile Luke seems to be putting off actually having to write the code for as long as he can, spending his days arguing with people on /r/debateachristian, and now apparantly being an evangelist for Core on Twitter. The irony in all this is disgustingly thick.

At this rate, pretty much guaranteed no July hard fork whatsoever, or more specifically probably will be some half written / half coded thing they will push up for ""review"" only to get shot down or pushed back another several months (and then probably pushed back again). Just like with Segwit, they all went on and on for months about ""oh just wait till April, you will totally have a 2-4X capacity increase! stop your silly Classic coupe!""... now April is come and gone and the story is ""uh   we only ever said the initial [unfinished] code would be submitted for review"". Although to be fair, HK ageement just has April/July as ""expected dates"", but still. 

And don't forget this line:

&gt; If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017

Which goes to show that they aren't serious at all about getting capacity increased in a timely manner. July 2016 hardfork proposal isn't going to happen, if anything probably not till Oct/Nov, which means if they get their way probably closer to sometime 2018 for real hard fork to occur. Too damn long. Also I bet they will turn around and say that by ""strong community support"" they actually meant ""strong *technical* community support"", which to them really means ""Greg and a couple others (all business partners) gave their thumbs-up"". 

Removing BS-Core's influence and authority appeal over protocol development is going to be a long and bloody battle, but is absolutely necessary. Don't forget guys that if BTC truly succeeds, it's going to be around for the rest of our lives, and we aren't even 10 years into it yet.

d37h2pt,coinjaf,17,"&gt; As far as I understand it, the blockchain ledger only stores the number of units associated with each address. 

You're in luck, as the above is not true. There are no balances in Bitcoin.

&gt; Right now, in the software, numbers are simply added and subtracted from the totals of the addresses that take part in a transaction.

I do wonder where you got that, as that's completely untrue.

&gt; If anyone knows, could you explain why the choice was made not to give each bitcoin a name, like a serial number, or an address of its own? 

And again you're in luck, as even that is not necessary. Although virtually it does come down to coins moving, splitting and re-combining, there is no need to name or serial number them.

Because the next secret of Bitcoin is that coins don't exist either.

When you create a new transaction, all you do is point to one or more output of previous transactions (not to ""coins"" and not to ""balances"") and then come up with new outputs that can be used as inputs of future transactions.

That being said, it's always great to build software which will help the bitcoin ecosystem, more people building responsible systems decreasing the need for trust will help all in the bitcoin ecosystem.

In the interest of full disclosure and the desire to encourage removing trusted custodians (there are several people building decentralized LN implementations, [including ourselves as the LN authors](https://github.com/lightningnetwork) , Rusty @ Blockstream's, Eclair, and more), I'm including the mail I sent to the article author below:

    Hi Romain,
      
    I'm the first author for the Lightning Network paper (
    http://lightning.network/ ). 
      
    I'd like to make a correction to your piece on Thunder Network.
      
    Blockchain.info's Thunder software at the current time is not a Lightning
    Network implementation. It relies upon trust upon a server due to the
    malleability problem, as mentioned in the article:
      
    &gt; Thunder can’t work with anyone with a bitcoin wallet just yet as the
    &gt; bitcoin core development team needs to release segregated witness and
    &gt; CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY features.
      
    In the future, Blockchain's Thunder software may become a LN 
    implementation, but it is not a Lightning Network implementation at the
    present time due to the need for trust upon a 3rd party to not lock up funds
    is an inherent aspect to the protocol itself (it's the material
    difference between giving funds to another party). The core aspect of LN 
    as defined in the paper (unlike Thunder in its current state) is that it 
    is decentralized, without custodial trust in 3rd parties with one's
    funds.
      
    We currently have an implementation on 
    https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd
      
    I'd be happy to answer any further questions you may have.

d386ki3,UniversalSnip,27,"Introducing ""Lockchain Mining"".

This revolutionary advance, which builds on newly discovered aspects of Satoshi's protocol, allows bitcoin users to mine already created coins through the creation of semi-negotiated non-consensual two party contracts. Under certain circumstances, one user, the ""miner"", agrees to safeguard the bitcoins of another user, the ""minee"". While thus protected the coins in the minee's wallet cannot be moved. At any time, once the minee feels secure, he may pay a fee to the miner (negotiable, with the miner having the final say) in order to release the protection.

The best part about Lockchain Mining is that it maximizes liquidity by not requiring the minee to verify that their coins should be protected. Further, Lockchain contracts can be automatically spread through a variety of means to more efficiently protect unsafe coins - while this will be primarily through email and torrent platforms at release, we are excited to announce contracts will also be able to propagate themselves through the Internet of Things. In the future, your bitcoins could end up being protected in order to guard against as small a vulnerability as a washing machine with an outdated driver.

Ditto, their magical increase in fees has not materialised since the blocks have been full for months now. I sincerely hope that when the halvening happens, fees continue to remain static. Even if the big miners remain viable, they will have to acknowledge that the fantasy of people paying more for the same level of service is bullshit, and that the only way they'll be able to remain viable and competitive is to include more fee paying transactions rather than expecting those same transactions to increase their fees.

Unfortunately thanks to the fuckheadery of Blockstream Core, the smaller less efficient miners are going to fall away, as they can't make bigger blocks to remain competitive to other more efficient bigger miners, and this will mean that mining is going to become even more centralised.

I'm sure morons like Greg, Adam et al. will simply continue to spout bullshit and fingerpoint, rather than admit they are wrong though, and the miners will continue to agree and nod like spineless zombies. Bitcoin really is becoming an embarrassment these days. So many squandered opportunities, so many lost years of bickering and childishness, so many corrupted, hubris driven a-holes being given all the power by the naïve and fearful.

Surely Bitcoin Core could get the same thing done in the past 2 years it has been an issue.

Blockstream motives are not aligned with Satoshi, and as such, they are introducing all sorts of risk into the Bitcoin eco-system. Here is a [serious possible threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NgFIj9dBkQ) albeit unlikely. Other threats are more readily accounted for, like the constantly increasing market cap moving to the alt-coins.

To me, the biggest threat is that the environment for a Bitcoin developer is extremely toxic, so the talent is moving to the alt-coins.

I also fear that Segwit and Lightning are far more complex than on-chain solutions, and that they are going to introduce bugs that hackers will exploit to further damage the Bitcoin eco-system.

I mean shit, the vast majority of people aren't even aware that other cryptocurrencies even *exist*. It doesn't matter how technologically superior any current or future currency is in comparison to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is so, so far ahead that realistically nothing is going to eclipse it. It's become so popular that it's much more likely that way before there was some kind of mass migration to a different virtual currency, the issues &amp; limitations of Bitcoin (in comparison) would be alleviated - that they'd make crucial changes to the online infrastructure before another cryptocurrency had the chance to replace Bitcoin as the dominant one, so now you see just how unlikely it is that Bitcoin will ever be threatened.

I'm going to try and keep this pointed but non-polemical because I'm well aware of the vitriol and mud-slinging that goes down about the blocksize debate. 

Yesterday, I wanted to use Expedia to reserve a hotel room and I decided to use Bitcoin. I make the reservation, I send the transaction using Mycelium and I use ""Average"" fees, which come out to 24 satoshi per byte. I think I'm doing everything right, and I'm familiar with using Bitcoin.

I wait for quite some time and there is no confirmation, even one hour later, [so I check TradeBlock.](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/) There are over 16 MB in the mempool. Shit, that's a huge backlog. I usually see it between 5 and 10 MB. I don't think I've ever seen it that high in the last few months. 

Now, Tradeblock is telling me that the average transaction fee is 20 satoshis a byte, so my transaction is above the average value, it should be confirmed relatively quickly right? I've been led to believe that most of the mempool backlog are spam transactions with little or no fees, so surely 24 satoshi per byte will allow mine to be prioritized right?

Nope. I finally get a single confirmation at 1:30 in the morning, which is more than three hours after broadcasting a transaction with above-average fees. I was, to be perfectly honest, shocked. It's the single worst experience I've ever had using Bitcoin.

My point here isn't to whinge about a negative experience; my point is only that if someone like me, who's not an expert by any means but actually knows to set a higher than average transaction fee, can't get a confirmation in less than three hours, how can a newbie deal with this situation? It makes the network look like it's failing a basic task. And this isn't a minor, ""coffee"" transaction either, it was substantial, and neither is this the only time I've had this experience with hours-long confirmation times. It's happened to me several times in the last few months.

Again, I'm not trying to be polemical here, I'm only trying to state what I think is a blindingly obvious and unavoidable conclusion: the blocks are full, transactions are slow, and we need a solution now if the protocol is going to evolve to its full potential.

Regardless of your position on the blocksize debate, isn't it clear that the end user experience and the merchant experience are both sub-optimal?

I'm concerned about the poor leadership I've seen lately and the toxic atmosphere in the community during a time when we need a clear direction and consensus. Would it really be the end of the world to simply raise the blocksize cap to something that actually accommodates the real transaction volume?

Surely companies like Circle and Coinbase are struggling with this problem as well. Is there an actual solution in sight to this fundamental issue?

To bring this full-circle back to /r/bitcoinmarkets territory -- I'm a long-term holder. I've been invested in BTC since 2012. I have some cold storage that I'll probably keep forever ""just in case,"" but the rest of my holdings I determined I would keep through the 2016 halving and then make a decision. Right now, I'm not feeling optimistic about the direction of Bitcoin -- not because the technology isn't capable of evolution, but because I think people may not be capable of it, particularly the leadership of the various bickering camps.

We'll see where we are in July, but I'd really like someone to reassure me that we can fix the end-user experience before the (unlikely but increasingly possible) event that an altcoin begins to steal substantive market share. 

Tell me, are we VHS or are we Betamax? Can we make this technology achieve it's potential or are we headed for a slide into irrelevance?

d3cca8u,Nooku,21,"Back in 2013, Bitcoin library developers were complaining to the Bitcoin devs that they had to upgrade Bitcoins scripting language that was still unfinished.

It was difficult to write certain libraries and some interesting uses cases could not be executed because of Bitcoins unfinished scripting language.

Bitcoin devs replied the scripting language wasn't important and wanted to concentrate on other stuff instead. Despite the enthousiastic talks and videos of famous Bitcoiners like [Mike Hearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA) and [James D'Angelo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nOfHpOFhN8), the community consistently disregarded Smart Contracts as ""not important for Bitcoin"".


The Bitcoin library devs were left behind with tons of ideas but a protocol that didn't want to grow into a programmable money protocol.

In light of this frustration, they grouped together and they decided to rebuild Bitcoin from the ground up, with a turing-complete scripting language. In an attempt to avoid attracting cryptocurrency fanatics with no interest in programmable money capabilities, they decided to not market it as a cryptocurrency but as a programmable money protocol. That way they could focus on the programming possibilities and attract developers. 

They named this protocol ""Ethereum"".


So what makes it different from Bitcoin? It's Bitcoin rebuild from the ground up, firstly learning from the mistakes of the past, and secondly providing a turing complete scripting language so all the cool stuff people like Mike Hearn and James D'Angelo were talking about, could actually be built. This is why many call it Bitcoin 2.0, something classic Bitcoiners don't really like to hear.

What makes it different from altcoins? Altcoins generally took Bitcoins source code and changed it. Ethereum has been built from the ground up, so it doesn't need to carry the burden of the imperfections in the bitcoin protocol, but can improve on the ideas itself instead.


How does it prevent another Blockstream-style hostile takeover? My answer would be: should it? I think the Bitcoin idea did survive lots of issues caused by unwilling Bitcoin developers. Thanks to the open source nature of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin community forked into the original Bitcoin community on one side, and the Ethereum community on the other side. 

So what happens if another blockstream-style hostile takeover takes place? The Ethereum community will split in a classic Ethereum community and a XXXXXX community.

As far as the problem with chinese miners is concerned: Later this year, Ethereum will change the way its mining works where it's no longer the computer power that gets to decide, but it'll be the amount of ethers that has been staked in a miner, that will count.

And finally, does it have a blocksize that will actually scale? I don't know the exact technicals on this but I do know that they are working on this and that the road map is planning unlimited transactions for the future.",2016-05-20 09:39:12

d3cu3qv,Emocmo,20,"Point and Figure Chart of the Day

Yesterday the momentum dried up and we fell into a double bottom breakdown.  The targets for this breakdown are as low as $405-$400.  The target bottom is calculated using the width of the formation (6 columns) or the length of the previous breakdown (7 boxes.)  This does not mean it WILL go down that far.  But rather based on the pent up downward pressure it COULD go down that much.

It seems that the price leveled out a bit overnight.  On the Bitcoin Averages price movement we are still in a positive trend.  So, we can be slightly optimistic.

In the Coinbase world the price broke down harder, and caused a “trend reversal.”  This makes the overall outlook for a longer period more negative than positive.

There have been a ton of theories written:  This is the drop before the halving.  This is the failure of bitcoin.  This is the rise of that other alt coin.  Blah, blah, blah.

What this is, is the failure to break through the ferocious resistance at $465/$470.  Its that 3000 CYN barrier that seems be holding us back.  After three previous attempts the price failed to break out again.  Four failures in as many months.  I think we may be in for drops down to the $420s before we try again.

d3cwqt7,nankerjphelge,17,"&gt;media attention is tremendous. Yet Bitcoin is still valued higher. Why?

Because your mindset currently exists in a vacuum. Media attention may seem tremendous to *you*, but that's because you're constantly on the lookout for stuff about Ethereum and already aware of it. 

In reality, the amount of general public awareness of Ethereum is practically zero compared to that of Bitcoin yet. I know, because I myself just heard about Ethereum for the very first time two days ago, and while I'm not a crypto-currency maven, I'm not some technological rube either. I knew about Bitcoin as early back as ~~2008~~ 2010, but Ethereum hadn't crossed my radar until a couple days ago. And for the average John Q Public? Forget it, they haven't a clue yet. Go ask most people if they've heard of Bitcoin, and while they may not know exactly what it is, they'll say yes. Ask most people right now if they're heard of Ethereum and they're more likely to ask if that's the name of a new band or something.

But that's good news, in the sense that the remaining upside for Ethereum could still be massive in the long run. Public awareness is in its infancy still, and that means lots of room to grow, since greater public awareness and money is what drove Bitcoin to insane heights, and if Ethereum is to do the same it need the same thing. 

You'll know the time to sell is upon you when you see Ethereum articles and segments on non-financial outlets like Time Magazine, USA Today, The Daily Show, etc. and your luddite neighbors and family are asking you about it.

Well, his posted positions are: 

* Make Mexico pay for a wall... The theory is if Trump threatens to stop wire transfers of money outside the US without the person sending the money proving they're a Citizen then Mexico (who's poor receive money from illegals here, who send it back to help their families) would suddenly pay 10 billion dollars to build a wall. 

* Repeal the current health care and then: Make insurance buyable across state lines, allow drugs to be sold to the US by other countries, and make insurance payments tax deductable. 

* VA reform - veterans administration sucks... the plan is to fire the current executives (has been done already), modernize it (they're trying already...) and ""empower doctors and nurses to make sure vets get the best care"" - which seems to translate if you read further to mean ""stop public health care and privatize it"" 

* Lower taxes hugely - four brackets, 0, 10, 20, and 25% covers everyone now - and no business will pay more than 15% ever. Holy crapola. It's a bold strategy Cotton.  The theory is - they'll also remove all the loop holes and companies currently not paying taxes will ""have to"", and that'll make up all the money they lose from everywhere else. But since they ""only have to pay 15%, the lowest in the world"" the companies won't like, leave to other countries, where they can continue to use loopholes and pay nothing. 

* Everyone keeps their guns. Enjoy. 

* Make it the law that you don't get citizenship just by being born here, that companies have to hire US citizens before anyone else, and set up much stricter requirements for getting a visa / immigrating here. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not making any of this up - read the positions yourself on his website: 
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions

&amp;nbsp;

So realistically I expect: 

Tax cuts for the rich, immigration to get really hard, some really stupid stuff to fail (stopping people from wiring money? seriously? In this day and age of paypal and bitcoin and everything? come on),  gun laws to change a little laxer, and the Veteran's Administration to continue to try to improve slowly - which I think is a given under anybody. 

&amp;nbsp;

***tl;dr:  Immigration to get harder, taxes to get better for the rich, not much else. ***

We told them that Bitcoin's block size *hard* limit can and should be bumped up in the fashion the *soft* limit has always been, while at the same time working on a sensible dynamic algorithm and Layer-2 scaling solutions. (This was called ""inane idiocy"".)

In response, they told that it should be avoided as much as possible. They created a contention out of the mere idea of having a hard fork and used it to label all hard-fork proposals ""contentious"". They labelled the act of creating forking software a democracy, banned the act itself and censored discussions of it, in the name of defending the anarchist nature of Bitcoin. They labelled advertising and defending such software propaganda and populism. They labelled seeking support in the ecosystem an attack, a con. They created a campaign of ostracism against anyone and anything that are marked in such ways. Then they proceeded to do everything they told was ""bad"", far more effectively, and with no qualms whatsoever.

d3d2zfr,pb1x,11,"&gt; Currently, blocks seem to be full (or they often are) and there is no solution to it deployed (right now).

Blocks being full is not a problem in and of itself. The fullness of blocks may present problems to users who want to do things like send zero fee transactions, but those type of problems could potentially be solved while leaving the blocks full forever.

&gt; Increasing fees isn't really helpful, as it just kicks someone else out of the block. 

Increasing fees is helpful, because it prioritizes high value transactions. A transaction is not an individual person, one person can easily spam the network with millions of low fee transactions. This is a very old problem on the network, and a big problem for any decentralized system.

Think about zero fee transactions. We learned early on that supporting infinite numbers of zero fee transactions was mathematically impossible. So, how to decide which transactions go through? Fees.

&gt; When the blocks become full and we don't have better solution, roll out bigger blocks

If someone wants blocks to become full, it's not hard to make that happen, just buy up all the cheap inventory at the bottom of the fee market. If we reward that bad behavior, we are hurting the network by increasing the cost on node operators.

&gt; When the fix is out, apply it and possibly set the blocksize limit back to it's original value. 

Plans like this don't work because in consensus decision making. It's impossible to make a forward looking plan like that, people could just not do that when the time came to do it.

&gt; I really hope I've missed something critical

This issue has been long long anticipated. Imagine a room where to talk to someone you have to tell everyone in the room what you are saying. When there is a small number of people in the room, no problem. As more people enter, it starts to get bad. Then you need to splinter into small groups or other forms of communication. This is what we have in Bitcoin today, a broadcast system where everyone shouts every transaction at everyone else. It works up to a point, but it's totally stupid to try and make it keep working forever. 

We can already see that there isn't much headroom for growth in the shouting model, as you say, maybe a small constant at most. So before we waste that safety margin on a dumb plan like just keep kicking the can down the road and procrastinating the real solutions that everyone knows we need eventually, we should first not be lazy and make sure we gave the near term smart compromise options like SegWit a real chance.

Note before you continue- I'm choosing my words carefully, please read this specifically as written and without 'reading into' anything.  

People in /r/BTC strongly believe in on-chain scaling, including larger blocks.  I think that's a valid viewpoint to have (although some may disagree on whether it's the correct strategy).  

There is a perception in /r/BTC and related circles that a small number of people (mainly Core devs and Chinese miners, but some others also) are preventing a hard fork which would help Bitcoin scale.  Some even believe that this vision comes from Blockchain's possible ability to profit from Lightning- clog the main chain so people will have to use Lightning, and Blockstream can profit from that.  
Either way, they feel that this group is imposing their vision of Bitcoin on the whole ecosystem, many of whom don't want it.  

Thus, /r/BTC users are no longer simply concerned about block size, they are concerned about developmental and directional governance, IE who gets the authority to decide where Bitcoin is going to go.  

Threads like [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ke0a1/a_pearl_from_some_months_ago_just_to_reiterate/) can be best explained by [that thread OP's comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ke0a1/a_pearl_from_some_months_ago_just_to_reiterate/d3e6aae):

**The point is they are not pumping an altcoin, they are simply unsatisfied with the decisionmaking process under which Core operates and how Core interacts with miners.**  They hold up Dash as an example of how things can be done more efficiently.  And while many of them feel that Dash and Ethereum (in some ways) more closely embody the ideals Satoshi valued than the current direction of Bitcoin, that should not be taken as advocating for the adoption of said altcoins unless it's specifically stated.  

To make an analogy of politics- I hope you can see the difference between ""This is how Canada's healthcare works better than the US system"" and ""Canada is better we should all move to Canada"".  

-----

//edit:  I should mention, there are a very few posts in there which do talk about adopting altcoins as a possible option.  This is due to desperation with the current state of Bitcoin.  Many of the BTCers feel that Bitcoin is going down the wrong path and there seems to be no stopping it, so out of desperation they start pondering the idea of an altcoin that more closely matches Satoshi's vision than they feel Bitcoin will.  

If anything, this should be an example of how harmful the rift between /r/bitcoin / small blockers / Core supporters and /r/BTC / big blockers / Classic supporters has become- that some people feel things have gone so wrong that it might be easier to give up and start over.

It's open source. The technology is free to be copied. If there are two very similar systems, and one of those systems isn't being led by a bunch of twats and surrounded by a community as tiring and mean as core and /r/bitcoin, I'm happy to make a move. ",2016-05-22 08:18:25

Kanishka Sukumar, a consultant who works in midtown Manhattan, says his parents often stash money in gold for safekeeping. But the 24-year-old thinks there is a better place for his savings.

""In times of financial turmoil, I would prefer to see a portfolio full of bitcoin,” said Mr. Sukumar, who holds about one-third of his wealth in the digital currency.

Bitcoin is gaining traction with modern-day gold bugs who question the stability of paper currencies or worry about protecting their savings during the next financial crisis.

A recent survey of 3,500 bitcoin users found that one in five hold the cryptocurrency because they don’t want banks or the government “controlling my money,” according to data provider CoinDesk. That was the second-biggest reason for holding bitcoin, behind owning it as an investment.

Since its inception seven years ago, bitcoin has shared an appeal similar to gold’s for those who want to hold their money outside of central authority. But as its dramatic price swings have eased, bitcoin has started to look like a more viable store of wealth to some of its fans.

“It’s an ‘I-don’t-trust-people’ purchase,” said Michael Novogratz, a bitcoin owner and hedge-fund manager who left Fortress Investment Group LP last fall.

He thinks bitcoin can attract some of those people who would otherwise turn to gold. While Mr. Novogratz said he has a “significant” holding in bitcoin, he owns only one ounce of gold, which, he added, was a gift.

 

In April, volatility in bitcoin’s price fell below that of gold for 28 consecutive days, the longest period in its history. Bitcoin volatility also briefly dropped below that of another flight-to-safety trade, the Japanese yen, according to data from FactSet and CoinDesk.

Bitcoin has become popular for fast, anonymous transactions. The number of bitcoin wallets, or electronic accounts used for paying with the cryptocurrency, doubled in 2015 to more than 12 million, according to data provider CoinDesk.

The cryptocurrency has also attracted traders looking to profit from its sometimes volatile price movements. The New York Stock Exchange tracks bitcoin’s price, and the derivatives marketplace CME Group said this month it is developing a bitcoin spot-price index.

Murat Akdeniz, a 25-year-old business student at Cornell University, said his daily bitcoin trading activity has declined with bitcoin’s volatility. Now it makes more sense to buy and hold the currency, of which he owns about 10 coins, he said.

Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance also reflects his generation’s growing trust of technology over governments, said Mr. Akdeniz. ""If China decides to sell their gold reserves, my bitcoin price won’t be affected negatively,” he added.

Some investors cited economic uncertainty as another reason to hold bitcoin, especially as recession fears have roiled markets and central banks around the world have cut interest rates into negative territory.

Bitcoin has become “a store of value for those concerned about other asset classes,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. “Gold used to be the only refuge for those who have grave concerns over the global economy and monetary system.”

Gold is often viewed as a haven, with many investors trusting it to hold its value better than paper currencies. During the Greek crisis last summer, investors looking for safety flooded into both gold and bitcoin, traders and bitcoin exchange firms said.

“I like [bitcoin] as a hedge against an economic collapse,” Brian Estes, a 48-year-old venture capitalist in St. Louis, said. Holding the digital currency, he added, is like having a “hedge against the ATMs and the banking systems not being functional for a while.”

Not everyone is convinced bitcoin’s future is bright. The cryptocurrency faces regulatory hurdles around the world and in the past suffered from wild price fluctuations. It was used on the former online black market, Silk Road, for illegal drug purchases, law-enforcement officials have said.

Some are more bullish on the technology that underpins bitcoin than the digital asset itself. Peter Grosskopf, chief executive of Sprott Inc., said the blockchain system—a data structure that makes it possible to create and share a digital ledger of transactions—behind cryptocurrencies has the potential to improve gold transactions. But he doesn’t see any tangible value in bitcoin.

“We will invest in the digitization of gold, but we’re going to stick with gold,” Mr. Grosskopf said.

The gold market dwarfs bitcoin. The amount of money in bitcoin is estimated at $6.8 billion by bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain. The over-the-counter gold market trades between $150 billion and $240 billion a day, according to the World Gold Council. Holdings in gold-backed ETFs are close to $80 billion.

Murray Stahl, chief investment officer of Horizon Kinetics, which manages $6 billion in assets, said as bitcoin becomes more established, he plans to buy more cryptocurrencies in place of gold.

Horizon Kinetics holds shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust , the first publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle. Mr. Stahl said his exposure to bitcoin comprises between 0.5% and 1% in several portfolios, compared with 3% to 4% holdings in gold-related securities.

“I’m not ready to give up entirely on gold,” Mr. Stahl said. But “in the next 10 years, there will be a cryptocurrency alternative.”",2016-05-23 10:16:39

The only things that can go wrong are very unluckily running into an exit scam by the vendor or the website hosting the market (they take all the money they can and leave the site), or your package gets intercepted which is also very unlikely if you're buying domestic from a reliable vendor.

1. Locate a nearby BTM (you get it? do you get it? It's B as in 'bitscoin'? Like they took the A in ATM and they replaced it with B, because it's for bitscoin)

2. When the slick touch screen interface prompts you, calmly and deliberately say the bitscoiners creed: ""There is no bitcoin but Bitcoin and Satoshi is its Profit"".

3. Almost there! Now all you have to do is verify your identity. In order,

4. Type your name into the easy to use user interface

5. Give your date of birth and the last four digits of your social security number

6. Enter your debit card number and CVV and expiration date

7. Enter your first 5 digits of your social security number

8. Take your copies of your dental records and get them notarized and insert them into the scanner and allow the scan to proceed

9. Spit into the saliva receptacle 

10. The BTM will now deposit a pill in the tray. Consume the pill. You will need to BYO soda for this part (I prefer a good ol' Surge!)

11. Wait 2 days for the pill to pass. Pick the pill out of your fecal material and put it in the Ass tray. The pill has been stumbling about your insides making a scan of your unique gizzards, which will be used to identify you later

12. A door will now open adjacent to the BTM. Take the torch and enter. The door will shut behind your rendering you alone in the darkness. This is perfectly normal and fine!!

 Take the torch deep into the catacombs before you. You are looking for an old wooden door with a smear of blood in a hand shape over the top. When you find it, draw your sword and prepare your body. 

 When you enter the room you will hear the dreaded cries of the Goxster, the legendary monster of bitscoin lore. You must slay the Goxster. Upon completion, sever the Goxster's head and return to the BTM. Insert the Goxster's head into the head receptacle. 

13. Whew! That was a work out! Lower your pants, but not before the BTM sprouts a waist high courtesy shroud. The BTM will now ask if you consent to create joinder. Say whatever you like here. The machine will now penetrate you regardless.

14. Clean yourself up using courtesy rags ($0.25 per) and you're almost there! As a Freeman on the Land you will undoubtedly have your Berth certificate (note: **berth** not birth). As a boat, you undoubtedly will have received this certificate when you first made landfall. Insert your berth certificate into the receptacle. 

15. Lastly, the machine will ask you acknowledge that the flag in the corner has golden tassels, and as everyone knows you must acknowledge the Law of the Sea (i.e. Maritime Law) is in effect and that the location you are in is now a boat. Regardless of what you say the machine will declare itself the Captain of the ship. You now have two options:

 a) If you declare your subordination to the Captain he will have you sign a contract of 404 years of servitude. You will receive your Bitscoins at the end of your tenure. 

 b) If you declare yourself Captain, the machine will declare that you are violating the non-aggression principle by trespassing on its boat. The BTM will defend itself vigorously, by shooting you in the left femoral artery. You will bleed out nearly instantaneously.

2. Zero confirmations are also logical when merchant can cancel the purchase once he discovers double-spend. For example, an online game might freeze user's account.
3. There are wallets which enable secure instant payments, for example, BitGo Instant and GreenAddress. They do that using multi-sig (co-signing transactions).
4. Low-value purchases like powerups might be better done using payment channels: in that case confirmations are instant and you don't need to pay a fee.

It sounds much less confrontational the way he actually said it. He wants unactiviated hard fork code included in the Core scalability roadmap. It sounds like he will run Segwit once the unactivated code is included.

&gt; Wu shared a question asked by HaoBTC CEO Wu Gang during the Hong Kong meeting in February. Wu paraphrased:

&gt; *“Lots of on-chain transactions pop up now. The demand for Bitcoin transactions is higher and higher. What if SegWit and the Lighting Network cannot be ready and adaptive to the demand soon enough? Will we just ask the users to wait until we have finished the SegWit soft fork and Lightning Network?”*

&gt; Wu added that Gang’s question was not answered.

Well said. But the article ends with this:

&gt; Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd to get an answer to Gang’s question:

&gt; *“Unfortunately Bitcoin simply doesn't scale well, so we don't have any easy way to respond to increased demand other than the fee market; block size can be bumped, but that increases centralization. The fee market does mean that the lowest valued transactions get priced out of the market, but now that fee estimation is widely supported, and wallets are beginning to add support for replace-by-fee fee bumping, we do have good mechanisms for users to outbid those lowest valued transactions and keep using Bitcoin. This isn't a great answer I agree, but there's not much more we can do without fundamental improvements to Bitcoin's scalability.”*

d3ha0tw,jratcliff63367,20,"&gt;SegWit is both a malleability fix, a blocksize doubling, enables the evil Lightning network you guys hate so much, and has lots of other improvements. 

I don't know of many people who are against SegWit; just many who are of the opinion that it would be safer and more prudent to do it as a HF rather than an ugly and very hacky SF.

&gt;SegWit is both a malleability fix,

Yes, it is.  That is why we need it, and have needed it for many, many years.

&gt;a blocksize doubling

It does not double the blocksize.  In fact, it has no affect at all until the developers and users all adopt new software, not yet written.  You see, even if SegWit is deployed, there will be no transactions to take advantage of it, because no wallet software, payment providers, bots, or exchanges support it.  For it to achieve even something approximating a doubling, nearly 100% of all bitcoin software has to be rewritten and every single user of that software having upgraded.

Hint.  That's gonna take a while.  A long while.  

Clearly, a 2mb HF, which could have been done safely months ago, would have been the less risky and more concrete solution.

&gt;enables the evil Lightning network you guys hate so much

Who are you talking about?  I've written several articles and done a podcast praising the LN, and why it is so important to remove the approximately 70% of low value transactions from the bitcoin network.

However, like SegWit, the LN will not be able to offload any transactions until every single piece of bitcoin software will have to be completely rewritten, all of the exchanges, payment providers, wallets, bots, scripts, you name it, it all has to be rewritten before it can route payment transactions through the LN.

And, of course, even if all of that software was written, you would have to convince the general bitcoin user to start using it.  This will take **years** to accomplish, even after version 1.0 of the LN is 'launched'.

And, of course, the LN can practically speaking only off-load about 70% of bitcoin transactions, and also will add additional transaction pressure as more members of the general public begin to use the LN and require their own on-chain bitcoin accounts.

&gt;How many people should be able to find love in this world, have plenty to eat, live in a nice house and have perfect medical care? All of them probably. Unfortunately reality don't play that way

d3hgax1,theymos,19,"IMO the required amount of consensus won't be possible unless/until miners actually execute some sort of attack. But it's good to have the conversation now. We should be ready to hardfork at a moment's notice, as soon as miners cross the line.

The problem with regularly hardforking to a different PoW whenever mining becomes too centralized (also suggested by Luke and others) is that it creates a period of time in which Bitcoin is more vulnerable to attack, and it creates a point of centralization in which *some* decision will have to be made about what the new PoW will be -- a decision which will very often choose winners and losers. In the case of an ongoing attack by miners, this can't be avoided: it's a choice between dealing with a PoW change, which is sub-optimal but survivable, and accepting miner tyranny, which is not survivable. But I don't think that it's good to *aim* for regular PoW changes. It'd be nice to find one PoW algorithm (or maybe a hybrid PoW1+PoW2+PoS, as I've suggested before) that will work indefinitely. [Cuckoo](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo) has been suggested as a PoW algorithm which might be ASIC-resistant.

Edit: Random thought: As long as the current PoW is maintained as a *component* of some future hybrid PoW, I think that it's possible to do the PoW change as a softfork. Though miners are unlikely to willingly adopt this, so it'd have to be done through the hardfork-like process, and probably the advantages of a hardfork-like-softfork vs a real hardfork are not worth the extra trouble in this case.",2016-05-24 16:17:46

d3h4v4g,conciergeonpatrol,16,"I will honestly say I dont know but I will try to guess:

Tattoine is controlled by the Hutts who work as a underworld gang type of operation. From what I can discern it was a headquarters specifically of Jabba the Hutt.

In order to maintain economic dominance over the planet it would not be a strange policy to disrupt the exchange status quo by making Galactic Credits worthless in favor of currency controlled by the Hutts so that they maintain autonomous power. 

Everyone wants to get closer to the teet of power and in Tattoine that is doing business with the Hutts, and since Galactic Credits are useless to them they become useless to everyone else. Most likely if there ever was a currency exchange they went out of business quite quickly, considering that the people on the planet make their money in illegal ways (according to the Republic's perspective).

Also take into account that the Hutts were akin to a terrorist organization. Traditionally official currency is the last type of currency that terrorists want to use, preferring commodities, (eg. Oil in exchange for weapons) or unrestricted currency (like Bitcoin).

The difference in the Star Wars world was that the Hutts controlled a significant amount of resources and planets that it was feasible for them to create their own economic system independent of Galactic Credits.

Last point is that if there were exchanges that converted for Galactic Credits an exchange big enough to buy a ship would have raised significant red flags - as the Hutts would be constantly  suspicious of the Republic attempting to spy or influence their systems. Qui-Gonn was transporting the Queen whom would have fetched a huge price for the Hutts from the Trade Federation (not including capturing two jedi giving them potential leverage over the upper echelons of the Republic). 

By offering Credits for the original purchase, by the time the Hutts found out they could have been long gone. Additionally I think qui-gonn was desperate to leave quickly because it was a matter of time before they got found out and so that made him more desperate.

**TLDR**: The Hutts on Tattoine created their own currency independent of (and most likely counter to) Galactic Credits for the sake of economic domination in their regions. Also exchanging that large sum of credits would have raise red flags and may have alerted the Hutts to Padme's presence. ",2016-05-24 09:59:37

d3ier4c,Peter__R,37,"I'm very happy to see you researching Bitcoin Unlimited, u/ydtm!  

I agree that this is the correct way to decide the maximum block size.  Waiting for the miners to decide on and activate a block size limit increase for the non-mining nodes is putting the cart before the horse. We are trying to get the miners to lead (be the horse), whereas in reality they should follow (they are the cart). 

What we need is for many of us users *and* businesses (such as Coinbase, Xapo, Bitpay, Blockchain.info, etc.) to take matters into our own hands and say ""our nodes accept blocks up to 8MB (or whatever) *today*!""  As you illustrated in the OP, one way to do this is by running Bitcoin Unlimited.  This would go along way towards making miners feel comfortable producing bigger blocks.  

With Bitcoin Unlimited, there is no need to even come to consensus on what each node's block size limit should be--an ""effective limit"" emerges organically from the product of our individual choices.  

Here are some more thoughts on the matter:

d3iliao,_maximian,33,"If I were an investor in Coinbase, I'd be a little bit worried right about now. Perhaps Fred and Brian are too easily distracted by shiny things, or maybe they're just really pissed off that they couldn't influence the core development process by making uneducated blog posts, and this is their sour grapes retaliation. The word ""pivoting"" also comes to mind, which is usually the end stage of a failing startup.

The fact is that Ethereum isn't a true cryptocurrency - it's a centrally controlled and highly experimental platform for running equally highly-experimental contracts that will likely prove to have limited utility due to the difficulty of writing useful and secure contracts. It doesn't even make a good form of money - ETH units release like crazy and will do so indefinitely. 

Maybe it will prove to be the bestest crypto system out there one day, but it's way too early for someone to make the kind of absurd and overconfident post that Fred made.

Bitcoin's full capabilities haven't even been fully explored or exploited yet. It's really irresponsible for Coinbase management to waste their investment capital on something even more risky than Bitcoin when there's still so much to do to secure Bitcoin's longevity and to open up its potential.

It's too bad that Coinbase didn't try harder to work within the distributed development consensus model. That have no right to bitch about a of a lack of leadership in Bitcoin development when they offered no resources of their own to the effort.

The change to the exchange rate could be more interesting. Assume miners immediately sell every bitcoin earned through subsidy. Also assume the percentage of bitcoin for sale each day due to mining is β%. The subsidy halving will then abruptly remove 0.5*β% of bitcoin from the market sell side.

Imagine that the default position of the bitcoin protocol was to automatically make a proposed change; but requires consensus to block it.  Should the threshold for that consensus be 5%?  Of course not, that is a ridiculously low threshold.  You will see of course that all I've done is reframe the vote -- this is 95% consensus just described differently.

Every binary vote has an opposite side.  95% consensus is actually 5% consensus of the opposing team.  Would you like a 5% consensus system?  No?  Then you wouldn't like a 95% consensus system.

That's why 50% is the only valid threshold -- because it's the only one that makes both sides equal.",2016-05-26 18:06:03

Bitcoin does not include the owner of the bitcoin in every transaction. It includes the the owners wallet address. As long as your bitcoin wallet adress is not tied to your real name then you should expect some level of privacy.

Network effect and expectations about actions of others reinforces this further.

Additionally Bitcoin has withstood the test of time against altcoins that copy its code.

This is not to say that Ethereum isn't progress or that investors have been fooled. I believe that many Ethereum investors were people with deep involvement in e-commerce, fin-tech, and cryptocurrency, that they had value stored in crypto-currency they wished to donate some to developers who might grow the e-commerce and fin-tech economy as a whole, and weren't chiefly concerned about appreciation of their tokens so much as crowd funding open source code.

Some people, under the view (and legal advice) that forcefully hardforking the rules of the system-- if successful-- would make them administrators of a virtual currency under regulatory rules (or just according to their personal ethics), will never have anything to do with one at least if there is any serious controversy around it.

I'm currently fond of a model where hardforks are used exclusively for structural cleanup. E.g. the system can make behavioral changes in fully compatible ways; then later optimize the formats and layouts to improve simplicity and efficiency in a big group. Doing so would potentially derisk the incompatible change both technically and politically.

The challenge there is accomplishing restructuring without the risk of effectively confiscating people's Bitcoins, as most non-compatible changes risks making presigned nlocktimed transactions invalid. E.g. the hardfork in Bitcoin Classic /might/ directly confiscate coins because instead of fixing the quadratic-in-size transaction validation hash computation as segwit does, it just imposes a new transaction size limit. If there are coins locked up with nlocktime beyond that limit, those coins would be lost by that kind of change. (It's unlikely that that particular one does, but there is no way to be sure it doesn't)

As I said, years ago-- [there be dragons](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=140233.msg1492986#msg1492986). Fortunately, there are many ways to move forward with technology and hardforks aren't even the most interesting of them just due to the high compatibility costs.

Leave it to Gregory to make handwaving statements with *""might""* as the leading word and at the same time get his facts wrong and making an illogical statement that makes him look smart to his supporters...  I have no words..

What I can do is explain what Classic does and how he's full of it.

What Classic fixes is a very very old attack vector (details [here](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078|CVE-2013-2292)) with newer code that Gavin [proposed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009667.html) back in July last year.

Knowing which transactions are Ok to include is not a trivial matter. In Classic, like in Core has been for years, the maximum size of a single transaction is 100KB. But the change in Classic is not about tx-size.  It is about amount how slow it would be to validate on different cores.

What Classic does is set a hard-limit to the amount of hashes (which is the most expensive operation in validation) can be checked. For an entire 2MB block this is set to 1.3GB. Consider that for a moment. Thats 650 times the amount of data in a single block. Or, if you manage to create transactions in a single block that in total manage to access a compete 650 more 2MB blocks, thats when you hit that limit.

In case you are wondering where that 1.3GB comes from, read the [email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009667.html) introducing it.

Franky, I wish people would ask nullc to back up his statements. He has a tendency to make statements showing others in a bad light, without any math to back it up. Iif the math should have to be shown, it would show that the case he's making is so improbable, or so silly or just so impossible in the current limited system that everyone would laugh at him. So, if there is no explanation. No logic.No math. And too many expensive sounding words. Be sure to take it with a whole sack of salt.

I would like the Bitcoin community to make it so that when people like nullc make statements that shows Classic or any other product to have a problem that he'd better back up his words with facts and details.  This is a strategy that scientific circles follow and one that we could benefit from.

d3likjy,Anenome5,33,"Silly. They'll have to find out the hard way why this won't fend off bitcoin.

Fedcoin by Russia is not better than fedcoin by the fed.

We use bitcoin to *escape* abuses of power by those who control the dollar. Thus, those same people trying to create a cryptocurrency won't attract users.

A cryptocurrency is a global currency, local fiat is no longer necessary.

In a situation where all currencies compete globally as cryptocurrencies, Thier's law takes effect and the good currency inevitably wins.

Bitcoin is that good currency, because of its cap on the number of coins issued, which NO fedcoin copycat will ever emulate, because the ability to inflate at will is the modern state's primary tool to exploit all the people who use that currency. They are unwilling to live without it.

Since a russian cryptocurrency cannot defeat bitcoin in the long run, they will try to survive in the short, try to make Russians use their local coin only.

But anyone will be able to buy bitcoin with russian-fedcoin, and to save in bitcoin and transact in fedcoin, etc., etc.

This is the beginning of the end for fiat. Once they legitimize bitcoin by trying to copy it, repudiation of fedcoin will follow closely behind.

Let's see, use a currency that continually *gains in value* over time, or one that continually *loses value* over time? It's not hard to imagine which one is in the interest of the citizens.

And the only people benefited by inflationary coins are the people who control those coins themselves.

If you're not going to make a decentralized currency, there's zero point in making a cryptocoin anyway, just use private servers and be done with it.

I see nothing positive about all this. The miners are building - as I said - another big-blocks-could- happen-soon-optimism cycle. @Jihan talks (but no action - as usual) and the price rises, clearly due to his talk.

The prices rises and Core cashes in the creds of the price rise with saying 'see everything's just working perfectly, price rise confirms our approach'.

Meanwhile, Jihan reacts, backpedals a bit and appeases Core (also due to the price action). After a short while, the price drops down again, as people are realizing that they have been played.

I think that's just something which seems odd in recent years - when everyone's on smartphones (which you can barely type on), or deluged with tweets and emails - so content is short (and so are attention spans).

But remember, there was a time when some guy like Marcel Proust wrote a 7-volume novel... it used to be considered not terribly remarkable to write long stuff.

So... let's just say I'm old-school like that.

And I am very, very motivated.

&gt; Adam, can you share with us where you stand with regards to the agreement you signed up to in February? 

&gt;&gt; On February 21st, 2016, in Hong Kong’s Cyberport, representatives from the bitcoin industry and members of the development community have agreed on the following points:

&gt; SNIP

&gt;&gt; We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.

&gt;&gt; This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.

&gt;&gt; We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core.

&gt; SNIP

&gt;&gt; The undersigned support this roadmap. 
&gt;&gt; Together, we are:

&gt; SNIP
&gt;&gt; Adam Back  
&gt;&gt; President  
&gt;&gt; Blockstream  

&gt; SNIP

&gt; Are you still committed to this agreement? If not, why not?

&gt; If you are still committed, are you encouraging the many developers you have under your wing at Blockstream to work towards making the code to support the hard fork available by July?

&gt; Greg Maxwell /u/nullc just drove the final nail into the coffin of his crumbling credibility - by arguing that Bitcoin Classic should adopt Luke-Jr's poison-pill pull-request to change the PoW (and bump all miners off the network).

Dude, you already said (a long time ago) that 2 MB blocks are fine:

&gt; ""Even a year ago I said I though we could probably survive 2MB"" - /u/nullc ... So why the fuck has Core/Blockstream done everything they can to obstruct this simple, safe scaling solution?

So... why don't you go ahead and:

- publicly re-adopt your prior position on this: re-affirming that 2 MB blocks would be fine?

- add support for 2 MB blocks to the Bitcoin repo you are in charge of?

---

We are asking this, because blocks are routinely almost full, and more capacity is needed - to avoid a ""congestion crisis"".

&gt; Just click on these historical blocksize graphs - all trending dangerously close to the 1 MB (1000KB) artificial limit. And then ask yourself: Would you hire a CTO / team whose Capacity Planning Roadmap from December 2015 officially stated: ""The current capacity situation is no emergency"" ?

You claim that you want Bitcoin to succeed?

So why are you willing to jeopardize the health of the Bitcoin network - now of all times, when we are heading into the halving, and it is quite likely that additional capacity will be needed - or we could head into a ""death spiral""?

Is your ego too big to say ""OK, gee, I was wrong for a while - let's go to 2 MB blocks like I once actually supported years ago""?

Is [AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) forcing you somehow to strangle the network with insufficiently large blocks?

What is going on?

Why are you obstructing this simple and critical capacity increase for Bitcoin?

By making the issue contentious when this could of been done overnight 2 years ago without any fuss like all the previous forks.

do you even actually use bitcoin? I know your in the code all day, and working on testnet. but when was the last time you had to send money into an exchange? or wait for a confirm on payment for something in real life?

You core devs are so detached from reality is hard to believe you even use bitcoin. When watching a tx waiting for blocks, seeing block after block go by 999mb,999mb,998mb while still missing your tx its infuriating. Inconvenient is an understatement. you get pissed and want something better. then you come on reddit and see core devs like you completely dismissing people. Pointing out statistics and averages and saying there not full. demeaning and when they fight back even a little you assume they have a counter agenda and are trolling and ban them.

Confirmation time matters. You can write all the code you want for segWitness but its not going to improve anything if miners dont enact it. And why would they do something for you when you refuse to write the code for the 2017 hard-fork for them/the community? the community doesn't want much, they don't need malleability fixed now, they don't need 90pct of what segwitness fix's. YOU need those things to advance your company. they just want to be able to use bitcoin again and expand the network.

d3kp09i,awemany,17,"&gt; That seems like an easy fix, if so. Just don't change the transaction size limit. 

Then they'll bitch that they might too long to validate. There is no way to make them happy. Except Greg's way of course.

[And Greg's perspective is myopic, to say the least.](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/reply?quote=20534)",2016-05-27 02:43:21
d3kk72t,nullc,17,"&gt; Under what scenario(s) would SegWit (itself, without Schnorr sigs) double transaction capacity?

It will double capacity assuming most of the current transaction volume uses it, or assuming the rate of large multi-sigs increases and uses it.  In a mixed environment segwit using transactions will pay lower transaction fees, creating an incentive to make use of it-- and as transactions use it they'll make room for ones that don't.   The deployment of schnorr aggregates, which depends on segwit, will further lower those thresholds.

&gt; What's a reasonable estimate for how long it might take to achieve those scenarios?

It's hard to say for sure because it's up to users to decide they want the extra capacity and lower fees. There is already a lot of segwit supporting software written, but if users don't care much it could take several months post activation to achieve a full effect. The demands for more block size are based on claims of urgency, if they're true then that suggests uptake will be rapid.  Unlike P2SH, segwit doesn't require a new address type, so there is much less software disruption.  Basically, with segwit active extra capacity is available to anyone who cares to use it.

&gt; In what way does SegWit provide a lower resource usage than a doubling of max_blocksize for full nodes (which still have to receive, transmit, and process all the witness data), and how much lower resource usage will it provide?

There are two primary ways:

Full nodes don't validate signatures in the far deep chain, if pruning is enabled the signature data is simply downloaded and then deleted. Because of the way transactions are structured the nodes can't skip downloading this data that they're simply going to delete. Segwit fixes this.  If Bitcoin had it all along a full node sync could be done while transferring roughly 20GB instead of 75GB. With it added later that same kind of improvement will be available going forward-- e.g. a year after segwit your full node might synchronize using only 140 GB transferred instead of 185 GB.

Prior to segwit each input in a transaction has its own signatures and each signature hashes the whole transaction because each masks out parts of it differently. This means the CPU time spent hashing a transaction to verify signatures is quadratic in the transaction's size (time = size * size/signatures_per_byte) and can result in transactions which are very slow to validate.  In segwit the hash is restructured so that the bulk of the transaction is input first, and this hash can be shared by the separate signatures.  For worst case transactions the speedup can be quite extreme (e.g. thousands of times faster). 

There are some more corner case improvements to scalablity too-- e.g. fixing malleability allows some cases where multiple transactions would be required to be done with one, and segwit also makes it much easier to deploy further scalability improvements (like MAST and aggregation).",2016-05-27 01:01:02

d3l9iwt,nullc,14,"TLS has a huge attack surface with a constant stream of vulnerabilities both in implementations and in the protocol itself. Even a small implementation is significantly larger than the whole Bitcoin P2P protocol (e.g. the smallest implementations I'm aware of are about 70,000 lines of code-- OpenSSL is something like 400k).  The authentication model in TLS is heavily oriented around centralized authorities. It's a poor fit, and a hazard. Of course, if you want to use it on your own nodes-- feel free, peers can speak whatever protocol they want between each other.

BIP 151 proposes a standardized authenticated encryption-- one from OpenSSH (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com). It's not a novel construct.

As an aside, I think your ""Rule #1"" is sometimes risky advice in the spirit people often receive it. I call that ""Absence only cryptographic education"", and it runs into many of the same problems as the parallel in sex-ed. If you're building an application that depends on cryptography for security you can't eliminate your responsibility by pretending that its neatly constrained behind a black box and magically isn't your concern-- it never is: the abstractions are leaky, and picking the wrong black box or not using it in precisely the right way will result in insecurity. The advice starts from good roots-- that you shouldn't be out inventing a pile of new things in a domain far more subtle than it seems where you don't need to (and we're not here, as mentioned), but this doesn't end the developer's responsibility for good cryptographic engineering, unfortunately. https://youtu.be/TYQ-3VvNCHE?t=2871",2016-05-27 10:58:20

I honestly don't care whether it's a success or not.

I'm laughing at bitcoin users, not trying to fight bitcoin. I don't see bitcoin as a threat, not because I think it will fail (although I do think that), but because the only way bitcoin will ever become a thing I have to actually use is if it somehow sheds it's crippling limitations, significantly improves it's user-friendliness, drops the politically unpopular techno-libertarian overtones and finds a way to solve any problems that I have better than debit cards and paypal.

They seek out or create combative situations to wrest some semblance of control into their lives, even if for a short-lived victory because they have nothing.  The need for affirmation is so strong that confirmation bias takes over.

The worst was when I was at a group dinner once with a friend-of-a-friend who was a bitcoin enthusiast, and when he repeatedly steered the conversation over to bitcoins when nobody wanted to discuss it, I told them that I thought bitcoins were too volatile to be taken seriously as a currency.  He literally created a scene, several times, and kept interrupting people (who were trying to talk to me, ignoring him) the entire dinner with petty, sardonic remarks.  I found out later that he was unemployed and lost a shit ton of money on asic miners, and that his high-powered corporate lawyer wife was carrying their family and treated him as useless baggage.

d3nxxi6,moronmonday526,29,"This is what a legitimized Bitcoin looks like. The verification process you're experiencing is designed to comply with anti money laundering and ""Know Your Customer"" (aka AML/KYC) regulations. Every business that exchanges more than $1,000 worth of goods (crypto in this case) are required to collect a significant amount of detail about their customers. Coinbase even has a history of not releasing BTC until the customer requesting the withdrawal explains where they first got the fiat that was used to buy the BTC they are now trying to withdraw. 

I use LibertyX myself. They have my driver's license details but not my social. Most importantly to me are two things: First, they only accept cash (in thousands of retail stores across the US) so transfers are instant. They don't sit on orders during volatile periods waiting for the best price for themselves. They also do NOT offer web wallets. They only deposit BTC into addresses that you specify. That means you get to use pure BTC wallets like Mycelium or Breadwallet (which aren't truly pure, but that's a different discussion). 

tl;dr What you are experiencing is normal in countries with financial crime prevention laws, but there is some flexibility in which exchange you choose to use. They're not all over the top like this. ",2016-05-29 20:55:44

It will never be stable, because (a) its supply is fixed while the demand fluctuates with the economy, and (b) as long as people believe that it is deflationary, they will hoard it and speculate with it.  If and when its price were to stabilize, no one would want to keep it.  Then everybody will rush to sell before other people do, and the price will crash.

There is a formula for the value of a currency in terms of the volume of payments that are made with it, the number of units in circulation, and the mean time between two payments using the same unit.  By that formula, the price of bitcoin now should be less than 10 USD/BTC.  

The current price is obviously due to speculation: some people decided to buy more bitcoin at 530 because they suddenly got the idea that it may be worth more tomorrow. But that will happen only if tomorrow people believe that it will be worth even more the day after, and so on.

d3njzal,nullc,16,"It's telling you that a majority of the hashpower is signaling an intent to enforce a new rule that your system doesn't know about: A soft-fork.

You have a couple options:

(1) You could do nothing; these changes mean your node will no longer correctly verify ScriptSigs on some transactions (ones using CSV). This will likely have little effect on you but you might want to increase the confirmation count you accept as final by one or two, to reduce the risk that a broken or malicious miner might intentionally mine an invalid block that you will incorrectly accept.

(2) You could change node software to software supporting these updates. (Unfortunately, the one you're running now appears under-maintained and has not caught up with these improvements, so you can't simply apply an update).

(3) You could leave your node alone and setup a CSV supporting node and put your node behind it by setting listen=0 and connect=&lt;that node&gt;. This will give you the same security properties as if you updated.

(4) You could take the CSV/MTP patches from Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 and attempt to apply them to your node... or beg/pay someone else to do the work. I believe doing so would not be completely trivial but only because Classic is using a somewhat incorrect implementation of BIP9 for its own signaling, unfortunately.

Whichever action you take, if any, you have at least 5480 blocks (about 38 days) to go from right now before the rule addition would become active on the network.

&gt;Communiqué de Presse de Marine Le Pen, Présidente du Front National

&gt;Nous vivons une époque qui a toute l’apparence de la fin du régime capitaliste. La BCE maintient des taux d’intérêts proches de zéro voire négatifs, qui affectent les rendements des placements financiers des Français, mais font peser aussi des risques élevés sur le secteur des banques et de l’assurance-vie.

&gt;Les taux durablement bas agissent comme un poison dans le système bancaire mondial, déjà très vulnérable depuis la crise de 2008. Les réactions de survie de l’oligarchie financière consistent à éviter toute fuite possible de l’argent des clients par des retraits massifs, hors du système bancaire. Les espèces, billets et pièces deviennent alors l’ennemi. Comment éliminer la monnaie sous forme sonnante et trébuchante?

&gt;Le puissant lobby des banques d’affaires de Wall Street (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs..) relayé par le forum économique mondial de Davos 2016, a vendu deux idées aux Etats et aux institutions comme l’UE : les monnaies virtuelles ou crypto -monnaies (dont la plus connue est le Bitcoin) et une société sans argent liquide.
Sous Nicolas Sarkozy puis François Hollande, la limite des paiements en espèces est passée de 7500 à 1000 €, depuis septembre 2015. Et Michel Sapin nous vante maintenant les avantages de la carte sans contact pour payer dès le 1er euro, en attendant la fin des chèques.

&gt;Plus la monnaie sera dématérialisée et numérisée, plus nous perdrons la propriété de notre argent qui est une de nos libertés fondamentales, et plus se restreint l’espace de notre vie privée. A terme, c’est une prise en otage des citoyens par les banques privées et par un contrôle de toutes les transactions.
Au nom du progrès numérique ou de la lutte contre le terrorisme, faire disparaître l’argent liquide au profit de monnaies virtuelles est une aliénation de l’homme, au profit du système bancaire mondial. D’ailleurs pourquoi l’élite dirigeante est-elle favorable aux monnaies virtuelles alors qu’elle renfloue en permanence l’euro, qui a pourtant seul cours légal ?

&gt;Le Front National, bien ancré dans l’économie réelle, rappelle qu’une monnaie est un bien public national, confié au peuple souverain. Par conséquent, dans le cadre de l’application de son modèle de patriotisme économique, il empêchera l’usage de crypto-monnaies, telles que le Bitcoin en France.

d3oar1j,Anenome5,21,"&gt; Winning elections has changed the course of history in democracies countless times.

True enough, but the means of making political decisions in fact constrains to a large degree the kinds of political decisions that can be made by that structure. Both in rules-terms, meaning what the constitution will allow, and in terms of political-hysteresis, meaning that the legal avenues the country has gone down previously color what legal paths are available to us in the future, a phenomena that could also be called 'path dependence.' 

Libertarian dis-focus on political action as a means to significant change is due to the recognition that the aforementioned factors in fact *rule out* the kind of change libertarians want to enact. Thus any libertarian chasing change within that system is inevitably forced to abandon the radical positions that simply cannot be effected within the political-organs of that system. In short, the politician becomes part of the system rather than changing the system himself. And those who refuse to change in this manner are rejected by the system and not allowed to gather any significant power.

As for the former phenomena, we can call it indelible-submersion within the statist-ideology. Someone like Dana Rohrbacher would be an excellent example--began as a radical libertarian, was promoted as one, gained congressional office and since then became a staunch republican--now an unquestioned part of the republican machine, his radicalism abandoned.

How do these people do this sort of thing, just abandon their own principles? Via the ['rationalization hamster'](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rationalization%20hamster) to borrow the term of the red-pillers, which is a mental mechanism both men and women engage in.

Rothbard tested political action to the umpteenth degree and was himself the one who noted how it subverts those who actually gain office via loss of radicalism.

It is because of not wanting to repeat Rothbard's experience in chasing the political-change dragon that I long ago rejected political action as a primary means of political change.

What political-action should be rightly used for is exactly how Ron Paul did it, to hack the political and election system in order to gain a wider audience for libertarian ideals, so as to make more libertarian converts.

This is not and never will be a strategy that converts the majority of society to our side. What it is designed to do rather is to attract enough adherents that we can self-propel and reinforce each other's activities. 

Those activities should be directed at the root of state power, which is undoubtedly *the belief that the use of a monopoly state is the only realistic way to order society*.

It is this root that must be attacked, and so the question becomes how do you attack an idea? With another idea. But the statist paradigm and worldview has immunized itself against non-state concepts, that is to say that built into the statist paradigm are many thought-terminating cliches which serve a dismissal function of the non-state idea.

Which means that it will be incredibly difficult to *only argue* against these people. The problem with argumentation about non-concrete things is that it devolves into a game of inductive expectations. A thinks a non-state society would be like X, and B thinks a non-state society would be like Y. Who is right? No one can say.

**What we really need is a non-state society to show whether the results in X or Y.*

We have on grand ally on our side, and it is those same thought-terminating cliches about a non-state society. If we build an actual, working, ancap society in the small scale and thus show exactly what kind of society that would result in, and if the result is extremely positive such as we expect it will be, then that lynchpin of statism, the belief that use of a monopoly state power is the only realistic way to organize society--that lynchpin gets pulled, the black swan disproves the theory that there can never exist a black swan, and **belief in the necessity of the state necessarily crumbles**. 

It will still take years for that conceptual earthquake to rumble through philosophical and political circles the world over. They will begin by denying that such a place can exist. And once it is built they will deny that it will last. And when it lasts, they will ignore it. And when they can no longer ignore it, they will adopt it.

This is the same arc that bitcoin has been going through and will continue to go through. Bitcoin has done this exact thing in its sphere of human action, in currency.

We can do it again in the sphere of political theory, but we have to build it. Everything hinges on actually building it.

And once that earthquake rolls the world, *only then will libertarian politics begin to make any real headway in the political world*, because it will no longer be a question of whether a libertarian society is like X or like Y, because they will have an actual place to point to and say, it's not longer just an idea, there it is, a libertarian society that functions just fine without a monopoly state, *you are wrong*.

And the opponents of liberty will have no response. They will be staring at the black swan that they claimed could not exist, and there it is existing. The resulting cognitive-dissonance will be similar to what the Soviet leaders felt when they visited the US in the 80's and realized that capitalism really was producing gigantic amounts of wealth, so much wealth that the average US citizen was living better than the richest and most powerful Soviet leaders in the USSR! In short, this will result in many *life-changing revelations for people all over the world*.

And the libertarian society itself will begin producing a new class of people, one that have never know what it means to live under a state, the world's first systematically and intellectually-principled libertarian society. (Default-stateless societies have existed variously in history, such as the American frontier period, but never has this existed as a systemic and principled location).

It is these people who will become the seeds of the future of the earth, they are the ones we are spending our lives to produce. They will never settle for being ruled by a state ever again, they will be free of the mental disease of statism. These children of liberty will spread the concept wherever they go, because they will have lived it from their earliest years, it will be natural to them. They will revulse in horror at societies that rely on something as barbaric as a monopoly state.

All in all, this is a restatement of my theory of the [Osmotic Strategy for Mass Change.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Polycentric_Law/comments/2bkfb2/the_osmotic_strategy_for_change/)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem, as I see is, it not that government institutions are anti-libertarian, it's that the voters are.

Because they believe that a non-state society cannot function. Thus they, quite rationally, immediately discount any statement from a libertarian point of view. Under that circumstance, we cannot make headway into the mainstream. We must first prove that our ideas work by founding a libertarian city and see what results. Only then do we have the ammo to destroy those dismissals of our idea.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If you can convince people to vote for less government, you're already 95% of the way there.

The repubs have been speaking that line to voters for 60 years, and yet the size of government keeps growing. Because to get elected you need money, and thus money from donors, and donors want quid pro quo, which requires government to spend money on projects that enrich donors. Not to mention all the causes and people with an interest in both continued and expanded government spending, all of whom will fight vigorously to stop their privilege from being taken away.

It can't be done. Something more radical must be employed than political action alone

d3ofhdu,here2askquestions,21,"For all you perma-bulls &amp; ETH moonkids... **just be patient.**

Bitcoin survived Silk Road, Mt. Gox &amp; Karpeles, etc. etc.
I have no doubts ETH can survive the DAO/Slock.it/Stephan Tool drama and will come out better because of it.

The ""Us versus Them"" mentality is stupid. Just ask the Litecoin crowd. As holders of a largely speculative asset (isn't all crypto?), you should be rooting for Bitcoin -- not antagonizing their community. We've witnessed some high school shit in this sub-reddit lately and it's pretty cringeworthy.

To me, it's very telling that ETH hasn't totally collapsed in fiat pairs, illiquid as those markets may be. As Bitcoin goes vertical (and it will), I predict we're going to see *major* inflows to the ETH market. The technical infrastructure is already in place to support it -- Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, even BTC-e... these are all huge exchanges. The traders are well-aware of this, and will utilize it to their advantage. Nobody doubts OKCoin will enable it as well, but it's pretty obvious why they deliberately haven't yet [hint: the fee revenue is trivial compared to the money they will make while participating in an ETH pump when the Bitcoin pump winds down]. Furthermore, if this truly is about Chinese capital flight as many believe it to be (IMHO, it only partially is), the availability of liquid ETH/fiat markets will be very attractive to those that need to move a large sum of money, much like Bitcoin.

In the meantime, don't fight the trend (Bitcoin). Don't talk shit. Sit on your hands and chill. Your time to shine will come very, very soon.

**Tl;dr** Bitcoin is gonna pump, a lot. ETH isn't going anywhere. It will pump soon -- just as Litecoin always does. In the end, everything ""dumps"" in relative terms, but if the past seven years is an indicator, cryptocurrency is going to do just fine.",2016-05-30 06:18:04

Copy paste of the article:

Chinese investors are pumping up bitcoin again, sending prices up nearly 16% in the past four days just two years after the country that was at the center of a boom and bust in the crypto-currency.

The four-day surge in bitcoin since Friday has added $1.2 billion in market capitalization for all bitcoin in circulation, according to data from blockchain.info. On Monday, prices moved up as high as $525.49 per bitcoin, though that’s still well below the all-time high of around $1,151 in November 2013.

ENLARGE
Chinese bitcoin exchanges have been operating despite past efforts by Beijing to curb trading in the currency, which is not subject to any central authority and which can be traded almost instantly across borders.

Huobi and OKCoin, two Chinese exchanges, now collectively account for some 92% of global trading in bitcoin.

The surge in bitcoin buying this weekend could be the latest sign of how Chinese investors are moving money between asset classes quickly in search of high returns. In the past year, equities, bond and commodities markets in China have in turn seen massive surges of new investing, often followed by a collapse in prices as funds have moved elsewhere.

“There’s a lot of hot money in China that has to go somewhere,” says Du Jin, chief marketing officer at Huobi. Huobi has seen a surge of new registrants in the past one month, he said.

Expectations that new supply of the virtual currency will decrease next month could also be behind the latest price surge. The creation of bitcoin via a complicated computing process called “mining” gets more challenging over time, thanks to a mechanism which cuts the number of bitcoin that can be created in half every four years in order to limit supply.

ENLARGE
But industry participants also say a number of China-specific factors are also in play.

Stories of scams in peer-to-peer financing have sent Chinese investors familiar with the most innovative forms of investing to bitcoin specifically, says Huobi’s Mr. Du.

The bitcoin network, composed of traders around the globe accessing virtual platforms via their computers and the Internet, also allows a discreet way for a Chinese to move money beyond the country’s tightly-controlled borders.

Bitcoin currently trades at a 7.2% premium when priced in Chinese yuan on mainland bitcoin exchanges compared to counterparts pricing the currency in U.S. dollars, according to industry tracker Bitcoinity.org.

ENLARGE
This premium in Chinese prices has persisted throughout the year, suggesting that demand from the country has accounted for much of bitcoin’s recent gains, says Zennon Kapron, founder of financial technology consultancy Kapronasia and author of a book on bitcoin.

Investors are worried about the decreasing value of the yuan and “it seems that China is leading a lot of the movement,” he adds. “People are protecting their investments [by converting yuan into bitcoin].”",2016-05-30 22:46:50

A real world application that is already running is a solar power exchange.    A [neighborhood in Brooklyn](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-plan-to-power-brooklyn-with-a-blockchain-based-microgrid-transactive-solar) has their solar panels connected to Ethereum, and they can instantly buy or sell tiny amounts of energy from or to each other with no middleman.  The power company is not involved at all.

[SlockIt](https://slock.it) is a company that is creating IoT devices, where you can lock or unlock anything via Ethereum.    This is one of those ideas whose full usefulness will be obvious in retrospect, but just seems like a cool idea right now.   An obvious use case is autonomous delivery vehicles that can only be unlocked by the intended recipient's smartphone.

Other likely early adopters include financial instruments.   By all accounts the current settlement systems are a disaster, it can take days to finalize large transactions, and many people say the stock market works on a lot of good will and hand-waving.   Ethereum could solve all that, with 15-second block times.   Look into the R3 Consortium, it is most of the major banks doing research into blockchain and Ethereum technology.

In the long-term, the Internet Of Things seems a likely path.   One idea I'm really excited about is the idea of self-owned, self-driving cars.   Think of it as Uber without owners.   The cars know when they need to be charged, when they need repairs and how much to charge in order to build up a fund to replace themselves when the time comes.    Riders pay just actual costs, no money to drivers, no money to corporate owners.

Other ideas being considered: proof of identity, property ownership, online voting.   I think Ethereum is one of those things that once it takes root we will wonder how we lived without it, like a garage door opener or TV remote. 

None of that is to say it is a good investment.   You have to decide that yourself.    It is possible it will succeed at all those things beyond the founders' wildest dreams, and the price could still drop, because who knows what a completely new thing with no historical pricing model is worth?

Buying into any of these for profit is not an investment, is a gamble at best, and a scam at worst. Bitcoin is by far the most trustful and stable, but has more than its fair share of scams and rip-offs and is notorious for its price swings.

There are a few points about Eth I don't trust: the valuation is based on holding price alone, as it's not a usable currency yet (so far, only BTC is even close to ""widely accepted""). An estimated 75% of the currency was pre-mined, which means that there is a large motivation for pump-n-dump scams (like almost every other pre-mined coin); the more the price goes up, the more the original holders get rich. (By contrast, btc was not pre-mined at all, and was left to succeed or fail based on usability, but the creator's personal greed.) There's technically no currency cap (depends on future implementation, I think?), so it's an inflationary currency, and if you want one of those, why not usd? Again, by contrast, btc is currently hard-capped at approx 21m coins. Finally, there's been a huge Eth spam campaign on forum posts, PMs, and email that makes the whole currency reek of a scam-coin, regardless of any possible merits.

d3pbn55,kordless,13,"I have a great deal of thoughts about Bitcoin, most of which involve dealing with the larger challenge of ensuring reliability for reality. When I say ""reliability"", I'm really talking about trusting that X amount of causality is stored in Y number of Bitcoins, and that if you look tomorrow, that ratio hasn't changed in relation to itself, the blockchain. Changes to other stores of value are another matter.

Humans occasionally use insecure forms of storage for causality.  While Bitcoin's market cap is &gt;$8B, that's really a drop in the bucket compared to the world's ~$300T of financial assets and ~$7T in gold assets. Gold is a good store of causality because the amount of gold is closely guarded, and the physical mass that makes up the gold is quite reliable. i.e. It's incredibly hard to make or destroy gold.

BTW, all these concerns around transaction size is simply a bunch unbounded productive paranoia making the rounds. Blocksize is a barrier to moving causality around in the system - it has ZERO to do with the reliability/trust of the system itself to maintain consistency in an immutable way.

In reality, Bitcoin is likely more reliable than gold because it was designed to resist DIGITAL change. As the world transitions into a digital economy/culture and people start dropping into their goggles for EVERYTHING, stores of causality that are highly immutable in those realities (like gold is here) will become more in demand. Bitquest springs to mind as an example: http://bitquest.co/

This may not happen overnight to the world's economies, but it will happen. The singularity is the human race's inevitable conclusion. Bitcoin, or more specifically the blockchain, can be useful as we move into and beyond the singularity because it will allow us to preserve the truth of what happened in an immutable data structure. Other solutions, like Ethereum, may also be useful.

That's not to say we won't make mistakes with these solutions - we are human after all.

All this rationalization around the price of Bitcoin is interesting to me, but I'm looking at it from a futurist's perspective.  It's inevitable the price of Bitcoin is going to go up because it is inevitable that the human race will continue to migrate stores of causality to existing immutable data structures, such as Bitcoin.",2016-05-31 02:08:48

Like, maybe I'm missing something about this whole piss-fight between Dan and Truck, but I just don't really understand where the actual criticism lies?

Truck wanted to test/implement ""Fastermelee"" as soon as possible, so wouldn't it just make sense to have a discord group dedicated to the people who wanted to hop onboard and test it? It's already a pain in the ass to get people to try netplay out as is, wouldn't it be even harder to try and organize large-scale testing of this new approach to online melee WITHOUT having a dedicated group for it?

Regarding the paypal/donation roasting... where is the validity in this? It just seems like a pretty baseless criticism where Dan is just playing on people's inherent dislike of money-grabbing to further stir up a negative view on Truck. Has Truck begged for donations, made implications of their necessity, or anything along those lines? I haven't seen it. I can start a website that theorycrafts the shape and look of Falco's genitals, does it suddenly invalidate my speculation when I include a paypal link at the bottom?

Dan's one genuine ""criticism"" of the custom dolphin build seemed to be the extra resource usage... but I've been monitoring it while playing and while yes, it exists... it's really not a problem. It just seems like he's trying to equate it to an ESEA-client type situation as if Truck is secretly using our video cards to mine bitcoin.

This just all feels like personal, petty bullshit to me. Truck hasn't handled the criticism well at all, but Dan's witch-hunt also feels personal and disingenuous. Maybe I'm just defensive (if you can call it that) of this new build because it has allowed me to play melee online with a good friend of mine that lives in Vancouver, BC (I'm in Chicago) almost freakishly lag-free, when before it was usually a laggy shitshow.


That is my fair, un-biased experience using this ""Faster melee"" build. It enables me to play with a friend across the continent with as close to zero lag as possible. That seems...pretty fucking amazing to me. So when I come onto reddit and see Dan presenting this argument against ""fastermelee"" acting like it's the impending melee apocalypse... how is that supposed to be taken as anything other than some personal shit-stirring between two people?",2016-05-31 04:59:10
d3pkcxy,chocolate-cake,12,"The guy is fully aware that bitcoin is money. He's just playing the part he's been hired to play. See what the article has to say about him:

&gt;Evans is an associate professor of economics and finance at Barry University in Miami who has been involved with digital currencies for more than two decades, stretching back to eGold, which was used as a micropayment system in the mid 1990s.

E-gold failed because it was centralized and when criminals started using it the US government was able to shut it down easily. If Evans was involved with E-gold then he's definitely rooting for bitcoin. It's the same vision - that of a digital currency - even if the execution is totally different. 

If there was any doubt which side he's on:
