fj3o5ca,PatrickBitmain,1,"Proof of work was supposed to have honest home miners using their home computer that could offset their power consumption by reducing their home heating, not mining farms that consume massive amounts of energy that can't be offset.

Because bitcoiners and mining farms have strayed far far far from the original concept in pursuit of their anarchist dreams and/or desire to get rich they have created an unsustainable paradigm.

They can't scale using mining farms as the power consumption they require becomes unavailable. They can't move to clean cheap renewable energy because the mining cost depends strongly on burning scarce fossil fuels.

They can't find enough liquidity because most people in the world aren't that stupid or don't have money even to buy one share in a company.

As for security, all Bitmain has to do is use more of their own miners and acquire a bigger percentate of the hash rate. They can then completely rob everyone. It's not in their interest to do that at the moment because they are making money selling mining machines to stupid greedy American miners. They don't need to sell 'all' their mining rewards either because they are subsidized from the Chinese government as are provincial Chinese mining farms. 

IF it was possible for bitcoin to 'moon' to many tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars then it would make sense for the Chinese government and Bitmain to grab more control of the blockchain. At these prices the stupid greedy American miners wouldn't be able to afford the mining machines. Bitmain would take over the chains (BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH) and all the hodlers worldwide would be begging on their knees and praying to their god the Chinese dictatorship and the puppets Jihan Wu and Changpeng Zhao.",2020-03-01 00:11:59

fj3pku1,Su85s,1,"im with you on this one to an extent.  if shes been bailing you out or youve been having difficulty keeping up with shared expenses like rent or bills then she may be right to need more information from you.  if you two have financial goals for the future or are considering marriage then she has a right at least to the information about your financial situation.
when it comes to gambling, its something that people see differently.  i used to work as a card dealer.  some people can be responsible with it and others will drop their rent, then go take out a loan trying to win it all back.  some people dont understand how it is a form of entertainment and that not everyone is a degenerate.  how has your history with gambling affected your relationship?  did you need to borrow money to cover losses?  did you make attempts to get back previous losses by risking more than you could afford?  if your relationship was exposed to this type of thing you may need to show to her that your not half an hour at a card table away from pissing out thousands of dollars.
i also think that your hesitation alludes to the fact that she may see activity she does not agree with or that you have more than she would expect and you do not trust her with.  ill spare you my opinion on the bitcoin investing but if she doesnt agree with it youre going to have problems when she sees more than she thinks is reasonable.  consider opening a few extra accounts if you think she has an unreasonable interest in your finances, but also be aware that money troubles break relationships more often than anything else.  hope this helps you understand things a little better.",2020-03-01 00:29:15

make sure you download from trusted source-

The only concern is that desktop wallets in osx and windows that lack a hardware wallet(electrum works with hardware wallets) are typically less secure than cell wallets (android/ios) so make sure you avoid malware /viruses  or just get a smartphone or hardware wallet

fj3sfvk,bitusher,1,"Bitcoin is far more than a store of value but also a smart contract ledger, timestamping ledger,. payment rail, and peer to peer currency . 

These are some of the benefits

1) **Save money** - I like to save 15-20% off amazon, and use other services like 5% off pizza, and 2% off gift cards and more with Bitcoin 

2) **Digital Gold** - Bitcoin is very desirable and scarce and since it is an uncorrelated asset class your portfolio is better hedged to be a safer way of finding alpha

3) **Timestamping** - Tweetstamp, and opentimestamps are useful timestamping tools 

4) **Insurance** - If my bank account or credit cards get lost or stolen or account is frozen Bitcoin is a great alternative to store value

5) **Censorship Resistance**- I can make donations to organizations like defense distributed or wikileaks even if their payment processors and banks are shutoff due to unethical political pressure

6) **Soverignty** - As a Business I can accept value even if I am deplatformed or banned from banking 

7) **Micro txs** microtxs are simply not possible with fiat , where I  can do so with my BTC lightning wallet

8) **Security** SSS and multisig with CLTV and other scripts allow for novel methods to secure ones wealth

9) **Privacy** with electronic fiat I have no privacy unlike with Bitcoin transactions where I am given a choice between privacy or transparency with each wallet

10) **Global** I can travel the world , rent hotels and buy plane tickets and withdraw local currency easily without fears of credit card fraud. I can send payments to employees in foreign countries easily",2020-03-01 01:02:10

Where we differ is by the time the fork war started (that ended up in the BSV split) I was already informed enough to know that CSW is no doubt Satoshi.

2. An outlier scenario to consider
Part i: What if the impact of the halving is more powerful than many might have believed? Such that even though bitcoin might - in the absence of the halving - tend to go down, that with the halving factored in it moves up. 
Part ii: If this upward movement happens in the middle of a global meltdown, we could see an opportunity for bitcoin to go on a bull run during a major macroeconomic downturn. 
I don't believe this is likely as I think bitcoin is very much a risk on asset. But if the halving can give us a 30-50% run _while_ the rest of the world is melting, it could be a beautiful thing for bitcoin.",2020-03-03 08:30:53

fjfblwa,BruceInc,12,"Every computer has a CPU (Central Processing Unit). This is a chip that is often referred to as the “brain” of the computer. It is responsible for doing all the calculations and running all the necessary bits and pieces that make a computer work. Some of the higher end PC and laptops have what’s also called a GPU (graphics processing unit) often referred to as a graphics card. These are specifically designed to handle large loads of graphical information and are typically used for playing high resolution video games, running very resource-heavy programs (like video or photo editing software). 

In very simple terms, crypto currency work like a very very very long math problem, when you solve that problem you are rewarded with a token sometimes called a “coin” (Bitcoin, etherium, litecoin, monero are all example of these coins). This whole process of solving the math problem for a reward is called “mining”. These math problems require a lot of computing power to solve, so some people like myself build specialty computers called “mining rigs” that have multiple GPU installed in them, we then use the computing power of these combined GPU in these rigs to run the math problems in order to collect the coin rewards. 

My question was if it was possible to use this computing power of my mining rigs to help with running the very complex models that are required for scientific research. This modeling process is called “Folding”

In that latter case, there are a growing number of people who are hoping to expose the dangers of these cultures to try to limit the damage that they cause.

The reality is, though, that between the true believers and the passionate detractors, the entire ecosystem is insignificant in the real world. Outside of a few news articles about the price of this ""Bitcoin thing"" and ""the Bundy standoff,"" most people are unaware and completely unaffected by what goes on in those cultures.

We do not need to _convince_ 100% of miners to run BCHN to prevent a split. The miners do not WANT a split! The chances of the IFP activation not leading to a split are zero - therefore miners are reacting, and the IFP is been dropped. This is actually good for chain security.

Bitcoin Cash, and most of crypto, is currently quite small. The amount of people you need to convince is small if you want to diverge from the path, to become something different than they bought it for. But, as time goes on there will be more and more people that need to be convinced to change and add something like the IFP.

The main way to combat the problem of splits is to get more economic activity on Bitcoin Cash. Not just miners, not just investors. Whole economies can work with only Bitcoin Cash as their means of exchange.

fjon1eq,tbenz9,6,"Yikes, I'm normally a Sia cheerleader but this article doesn't sit very well with me.  There is way, way too much speculation, corners cut, and assumptions written in this post to make it reputable or reliable (in my opinion).

I'm certainly no expert on the topic, but I've managed hundreds of petabytes of storage in enterprise environments and can tell you in my experience you missed the mark here.

It seems your post suggests host centralization (or at least datacenter centralization), I don't believe that's the goal of Sia and it goes against the decentralization ethos.  Having 24/7 staff, thousands of HDDs, megawatts of power, and millions of dollars to invest in storage is not something the average user will have.  Only a relatively small number of organizations will invest in something like that.  

No one running thousands of hard drives is going to keep them on a shelf.  When you've got thousands of HDDS running vibration becomes an issue, as does spin-up power consumption, heat management, etc.  Every petabyte scale filesystem I've managed has dozens or hundreds of HDDs attached to a controller via a SAS expander or equivalent system.  This enabled the relatively small number of controllers to stagger the spin-up of hard drives preventing power spikes, it also makes monitoring easy, management easier, etc.

You also don't cover the enterprise vs consumer supply chain.  It's physically impossible to buy thousands of consumer grade HDDs for a project, just ask Backblaze.  The HDD manufacturers force you into the enterprise class if you want to buy by the pallet.  Enterprise drives are MUCH more expensive than consumer drives, and if you're running thousands of drives you're going to want the enterprise version anyways.  In my experience it costs around $1000/TB for an enterprise class filesystem, which is the only way you're going to be able to scale to hundreds of petabytes in a single datacenter (again look at Backblaze's migration to enterprise HDDs and management hardware).

I believe you are drastically underestimating the cost of bandwidth and utilities this would require.  If you're running petabytes of Sia storage out of a single datacenter you're going to be consuming a lot of power and bandwidth, you'll need peering agreements with multiple ISPs, dedicated fiber, redundant ISPs, etc, again, this costs money, lots of it.

I have seen the Bitcoin datacenters and their extreme cost-cutting techniques, I don't believe that is a healthy direction to be going, and I hope Sia doesn't end up in facilities like that (centralized, poor infrastructure, dangerous, community nuisances).

I do believe Sia will maintain extremely affordable storage prices, but I don't believe it's for the reasons you mentioned.  I believe the **storage marketplace** will continue to drive prices down and keep them low.  Host **de**centralization causing competition among hosts, will keep rices low (this seems to be the opposite of what your blog post is suggesting).  A subset of Sia hosts will always be willing to sell storage at a loss to recoup their capital expenditures, and as the Sia storage utilization grows, so will the number of users selling their excess storage below market prices.

Either way Sia has a bright future and I'm excited to be a part of it.",2020-03-07 06:44:25

fjoxysv,Taek42,3,"I definitely believe that Sia datacenters will end up in the direction of mining farms. We can only enforce so many things at the protocol level, and everywhere that we can't enforce is a corner that cheap datacenters can cut.

As it were, I believe that the advantages to corner cutting are so significant that it should largely be encouraged. I disagree with you that Bitcoin mining went in a sorry direction, I think it's actually quite brilliant and ultimately the mining farms have been able to cut total waste by spending fewer resources on making things efficient. It doesn't make sense to pay $10,000 to make your home have $30 less per year in electricity bills, same applies at the datacenter level.

I do believe issues like vibration and spin-up power can be solved using shoestring techniques - it doesn't need to be pretty, it just needs to work. And it doesn't even need to work well, it just needs to maintain 95% uptime on a per-sector basis. Some of these things, like spin-up, should be solvable at a software level as well, which scales much better than custom physical controllers. Remember, we aren't talking about the Sia network in 2021, we're talking about what it might look like after 10 more years of growth and iteration.

Regardless, this certainly isn't a pitch telling people to go out and build shoestring datacenters right now.

fjojckk,haplo0,3,"Bitcoin works by blockchain consensus.  Essentially, the blockchain network presents a very hard math problem -- one where it's really really hard to figure out the answer, but if you have the answer it's trivial to verify that it's the correct answer.  The math problem has to do with factoring very large numbers.

When bitcoin started, you could use a normal computer processor (CPU) to do this math.  It might take you a few minutes to figure out the answer or it might take you days and days and days.  Whoever figures the answer out first ""wins"" the reward, which started at 50 bitcoins.

The network automatically adjusts the difficulty of the math problem according to how many people are trying to figure it out and how much computing power they are throwing at the problem.  The network is designed to try and keep it so that someone in the world will figure out the answer after 10 minutes, and then there is a new math problem that takes another 10 minutes, over and over every 10 minutes somebody ""wins"" by figuring out the solution to the math problems and gets the 50 bitcoins.  So if bitcoin gets more popular and more people are using more computers to try and solve the problem, such that the answer is figured out in less than 10 minutes, the difficult gets harder.  If it takes too long for people to figure out the answer, then the difficulty gets easier, to try and keep it at one ""winner"" every 10 minutes.

Because bitcoins has been around for a decade now and is very popular, such that millions of people are trying to win the prize, the difficulty has continued to go up over time.  After a couple years of bitcoin existing, people started using GPUs (graphical processing units, like on a video card) instead of CPUs.  That's because GPUs are better at solving the kind of math problem that bitcoin is based on.  CPUs are more generalized at doing all kinds of math, but GPUs are better at the kind of math that you need to solve the bitcoin puzzle and win the prize.  Then after a few more years, people started building custom hardware, called ASICs, that were even more efficient.  Now it is basically impossible to mine bitcoin with a CPU or a GPU, you need a custom ASIC in order to have a chance.  That's because there are people who have invested millions of dollars buying thousands of ASIC devices and running them in countries where electricity is extremely cheap, and it's very very difficult to compete with large scale farms like that.

They also came up with mining ""pools"", where a lot of people could join together and try to solve the puzzle together, and share the reward if they won.  This way, you don't have to win the entire 50 bitcoin prize by yourself, which could take months or even years, instead you and a hundred other friends could join together and maybe you solve it in a couple weeks instead, and then you split the reward.

By the way, the mining reward is cut in half every few years, that has already happened twice, so it went from 50 bitcoins to 25, to now where it is 12.5 bitcoins if you solve the puzzle.

So between the reward halving, and the mining pools, and the custom ASIC bitcoin farms, if you want to mine bitcoin by yourself now you can but you'll probably earn something like 0.000001 bitcoins per day -- something very very small.  The best way to get bitcoin now is to just buy some bitcoin fractions that already exist from someone else, not to mine it yourself.",2020-03-07 06:08:32

Well, two things.

First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.

But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.

That kind of manipulation costs a lot of fiat money to pull, but fiat is something the Fed has infinite amounts of so it could take a while before the USD has devalued badly enough and Bitcoin market cap and natural price support are strong enough to make it systematically too risky for the Fed to continue price suppression using futures.

I appreciate that, but Amaury went off the deep end with IFP.

&gt;Let’s point out that Amaury Séchet has been nothing short of exceptional in three areas:  
&gt;  
&gt;correctly *framing* the fundamental problems associated to a digital currency, both from an economic perspective and from a software perspective  
&gt;  
&gt;*not* playing political power games, which kills any rational discussion  
&gt;  
&gt;identifying toxic folks months, if not years, before these became obvious to the rest of us

But he IS playing political power games now, that's exactly what IFP is. And the community has reacted almost immediately. And now Amaury is losing those games, and he's too proud and/or arrogant to acknowledge it. ""Play stupid games, win stupid prizes"".

&gt;This IFP is the single most positive news in Bitcoin’s history,

This statement is downright Orwellian. If you really understood software development and Bitcoin Nash equilibrium I doubt you could say this with a straight face.

fk2ejj0,jahoooo,12,"Hello my friends. I'm back from my mods-sponsored vacations I've been sent to, presumably  for trolling bulls at $9k. Having time to rethink my ways in isolation I've come to realisation how wrong I was. To compensate I've put together some quality analysis based on recent developments, full of hopium that is guaranteed to make your bags^(\*) feel immediately lighter.

**Bitcoin is a safe haven**

These trying times have quite clearly shown that bitcoin is going to be a go to asset during the impending recession. As you can see on the [charts](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESolfqgXgAI2Px9?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096) the market hasn't quite caught up to it yet, which is excellent as we can all load up for the one last time before the generational wealth transfer takes place.

**This halving is just like the previous two**

I remember watching all the YouTube videos in 2016 predicting $20k bitcoin on a daily basis and thinking to myself ""no way this is going to happen"". I was in disbelief and missed out on all the gains, which made me then look for the ""next bitcoin"" and go all-in on Vechain in January 2018. Not going to be fooled again though! 

As you can see on this [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BLX/JIGlHgyf-BTC-pre-halving/) during both previous pre-halving periods the price would establish a moderate, but solid uptrend as confirmed by *higher highs* and consistently staying above 21w ema. The fact it's not behaving this way right now is clearly to shake out the weak hands and cool off the RSI.

**S2F as valid as ever**

S2F creator PlanB predicted the price [will not go under $8200 in 2020](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1226918629213499392) and recently reiterated it should be an absolute floor for the dip. The fact that we're lower than that proves the market is wrong. The model is intact as we can deviate from it by an arbitrary amount without invalidating it.

**CME gaps above**

In trading it's important to be able to tell apart the memes (like coronavirus) from real fundamentals which actually affect the market. 

One of the strongest fundamental drivers of bitcoin price is filling of CME gaps. Even if there was no halving and coronavirus were about to wipe out half of the population you can rest assured those gaps are guaranteed to get filled, and we now have two above us at 8.9k and 11.7k. The entire and only reason we dropped here was to fill the gap at 7.7k and none of that meme flu panic.

**Bearish exuberance**

The fact that some bears out there come up with unthinkable targets such as $6k or even $5k is a sure sign of exuberance and we all know how it ends. Everyone should be able to see that a modest and perfectly rational target of $100k is a foregone conclusion at this point and current prices are most likely a once-in-a-lifetime bargain.

**Bitmex traders provide reassurance**

While it's pretty clear that the market is wrong about current valuation of bitcoin, it is reassuring that Bitmex traders, known for their excellent track record, appear to have no doubts about where this is heading. The funding rate has not once gone into negative territory since the ~~top~~ higher high at $10.5k and future premiums are consistently positive which should fill you all with confidence that the bottom is in and a better buying opportunity may never present itself.

And finally, remember, in a risk off environment, when people seek safety in cash and volatility is high, it's best to stick to high leverage bets on new asset classes in illiquid markets.

Bitcoin is the hardest asset on earth, the only one you can truly own. Now, this fact alone isn't enough - people have to realize this. I think necessity will force more people in than out. Maybe a temporary flight but eventually bitcoin and necessity will meet. If bitcoin can just hold relatively steady while everything else is burning, that will be a powerful draw.

fk1lhf7,fan_of_hakiksexydays,5,"To the people who are using this rare chance to say Bitcoin follows the stock market and the rest of the world markets:

1- Bitcoin was already on a downward trend since mid February. Several days prior to the first Dow dip, Bitcoin had gone from 10,300 to 9,600.

2- Bitcoin started diving over the weekend before markets even opened. It was already significantly down before this second stock market drop.

So if you say there is any real correlation to the stock market, then it looks like world markets are following Bitcoin. Which we all know is unlikely.

Now there may be a correlation to the general worldwide Corona fear, as opposed to just following the stock market. That I can see as a more valid theory, and as something accelerating an already downward trend.

Bitcoin is very volatile, so sooner or later it will have a dip at roughly the same time as markets. It can't be always be doing the exact opposite either, otherwise that means there is a strong reverse correlation. Not being correlated means sometimes briefly synching.

fk4jb1i,SloppySynapses,3,"The main difference is that that production change information wasn't available until a few days ago. 

Now I'm not saying it's priced in, but...there's a very big difference there

There's also the possibility (at least, in my speculative opinion), that miners have been hoarding their coins for years in anticipation of the halving.

Why? Well, here's my personal, elaborate speculative theory on the past few years.

Bitcoin miners have always seemed to be extremely inverted when it comes to btc cycles. This is because they *form* the cycles. They hoarded at $6k+ all of 2018 until there was simply 0 demand left at $6k to support those prices anymore. Once the floor fell thru, all hell broke loose, and those same miners avoiding selling anything above $6k began literally *net shorting* their stashes below $4k.

Once miner stashes had been depleted, the market ripped upwards because of the complete lack of supply. 

The rip scared nearly everyone into panic holding (I used to use this term back in 2018) their supply again, and a $9k floor was created. History repeats, descending triangle, big dump, bada Bing bada boom, Sept 2019 happened. 

Fast forward a few months and go look at all futures premiums and options pricings for the past 6 months and notice people are extremely optimistic in general- nearly every bottom happens on a net neutral sentiment for futures (premium = $0) rather than negative sentiment. That is, very, very few market participants are actually betting on the price to go down (reflected in bfx longs/shorts as well).

The overarching sentiment the past 6 months has essentially been a big flashing sign that says **DO NOT SELL BEFORE THE HALVING** 

This kind of thinking leads to hoarding yet again. 

And thus it's possible that the halving will have the exact opposite effect people expect short term- miners who have hoarded won't be making the same money as they made at $6k in 2018 unless price is at $12k, so they must begin selling their stashes.

---

In essence, with BTC, it's a common occurrence that an artificial reduction in supply due to hoarding nearly always creates a false sense of demand that can fool people for long periods of time, when in reality there is loads of supply overhead waiting to be unloaded as soon as the underlying market belief that there is no supply left is threatened at all.

---

This is, essentially, why I continue to prefer shorting btc over longing it, with the sole exception of the $3-4k range. I looked for long term longs there not only because of price action (weakening sell pressure on second dip to $3.3k, negative funding for months) but because that price action mirrored my exact sentiments of what was happening: miners and large holders (crypto prop desks, hedge funds, large eth/alt holders, etc) were capitulating.",2020-03-11 02:32:51

He was a bitcoin millionaire. This was a libertarian crowd, anarchists with a strong capitalism theme to it all. Hippies of  a sort, definitely enjoyed Marijuana.

They have some kind of shindig annually called Anapulco or something for ancapitalists.

Scenario A: You think that the Coronavirus will cause a gigantic economic blip/market correction, and governments will step in with gigantic stimulus packages (pushing towards hyperinflation). Best option here would be to pull your money out into cash, wait for things to tank 40, 50, 60% or whatever, then buy 'safe haven assets', stock in old, gigantic stable companies, gold, silver, commodities, Bitcoin etc. 


Scenario B: You think we'll have a giant market correction, but governments will step back and allow this market correction to play out naturally in a 'free markets' style. Then the playbook is still pulling your money out into cash but *holding* said cash as countries experience stagflation a'la Japan in the past twenty years. Everything (food, housing, health insurance, cars) get 2-4% cheaper year over year, the stock market flatlines and anyone that pulled out into cash (I think Warren Buffett took this approach last year?) wins. 


Scenario C: You think the Coronavirus fears are unfounded, the media is overhyping things and this will blow over in a few months just like bird flu, swine flu, SARS, MERS, Zika etc. You can just ride this out. Continue to purchase stocks, bonds, crypto at regular intervals because this minor blip will recover in six months anyway, and we'll be back to business as usual.

I actually created this reddit account when I decided I wanted to separate my obsession with this cryptocurrency (at the time, mostly bitcoin) technology from debating politics or finding funny or interesting videos. I remember fondly back when we were thinking up as a community what the bitcoin logo could look like - and then using the thai baht ascii character to abbreviate it; that was cute. This community has been one that has been optimistic, pessimistic, supportive, and cruel, and it's been nice going through all of it with you and having something to experience and learn from during this wild ride. 

I bought in, once upon a time, during the pre-sale, and today, I was fully liquidated. I'm glad to be able to have taken the opportunities that were afforded to me by investing in this early on.  That additional personal risk probably wasn't the wisest thing to have taken on with my net worth tied up in a hyper volatile asset, but I'm still glad for the experience. Even though today has been a long, ongoing panic attack, I'm glad to be done. I don't really know what is next for me, but I don't have a dog in this fight anymore - I hope the technology succeeds, but I'm going to be taking a look at those developments through whatever news headlines if any come forth.

fkhgv68,diradder,1,"&gt; the 1st peer you connect to is legitimate and that they're giving you a legitimate copy of the ledger

That's not really how IBD works on Bitcoin though, the first block is hard-coded (verifiable across all the implementations that use the same one), work is then verified from the start and blocks that are fed to you by all the other nodes that help you with the IBD is verified completely... there's no trust in this once you have verified the rules of the software you run (open source and reproducible builds). Least you want to go into conspiratorial territories where both the software you verified/run and all the nodes who fed you data were all involved in lying to you with data that still matched those rules somehow (that would require multiple collision of nested hashing.... I think we don't have easy names for the number of probability of this ever happening). But when I've said nothing is completely trustless I meant within reason, I would never demand this from Nano either. I was only curious which was the trend in terms of trustlessness and how it was effectively organized currently and what was the plan when scaling up.

&gt; The Nano community is constantly creating new representatives and pushing more decentralization, but ultimately it's up to the users.

Yeah I've figured as much. Then I'll give it that, your developers/users seem aligned with the same goals as Bitcoin in terms of decentralization/trustlessness and you've just chosen another set of slightly different compromises in term of governance that seem better than just DPoS or worse just PoS... which make the coin at least interesting in terms of testing grounds.

Lastly, two things I've never looked into admittedly in Nano are the ability to build smart contracts/mutli-sigs scheme and the ability to transact anonymously. For the former Bitcoin has those abilities and they are put to good work in few scenarios (LN, securing funds for multiple parties, escrows, inheritances, etc.)... and the latter developers are hard at work for things like Schnorr and signature aggregations, Taproot/Tapscript. Is there any work done in those fields on Nano? Or any plan for them?

Obviously you don't owe me answers/research, I've just seen you actively participating on threads here and thought it would be nice to hear it from someone who seems to have experience with Nano. Thanks for the conversation/information, it's pretty interesting.",2020-03-15 00:08:36

fkhjphc,thekiyote,1,"Regarding bitcoin's miners, I think Satoshi originally thought that miners would come from the pool of natural stakeholders.  Not everyone would choose to mine, but those who did would essentially get a lottery ticket for the next block reward/transaction fee.  

I don't think that Satoshi anticipated either mining pools or the lengths people would go to to compete for the block reward, first by adapting graphics cards to mining and then specialized mining hardware, after which I think you have a pretty strong split between the natural and forced stakeholders.

The thing that has to be remembered is that the hash rate of bitcoin doesn't _need_ to be this high for the system to function (difficulty is a tool for btc distribution, not strength of cryptography), nor is a hash rate this high indicative of a strong mining ecosystem, which I think a lot of bitcoin people miss.  I would argue that the early days of bitcoin, when people were largely mining with their CPU or GPUs for a couple of kilohashes apiece, was more secure than the hundreds of quintillion hashes per second that are being mined now, the majority of which are from a smaller number of miners with specific resource advantage, like power plants or Chinese miners.

That doesn't mean the system now is _insecure_, just redonkulously inefficient.  But at the same time, you cannot guarantee that it will stay this way.  As /u/sjoelkatz said, it's a race to the bottom.  You need to be able to make a profit over the cost of what you're spending to win block rewards, so eventually the only people who are able to realistically win rewards are ones with natural advantages, like free/at cost power, and the higher the competition, the more stakeholders will be pushed out, until there's only a few real players left, and then you **do** run the risk of a double spend attack.

Newbies are welcome, and questions will get answered, but it may take some time, and you'll likely run into the asseholes you mention. This is not always due to hating... but let me explain.

As a community, we have become extremely edgy about social attacks, **especially** when it comes to discussing fees. This is a very long story, and I invite you to read and learn about it, but the short story is that eventually almost no individual will transact on-chain bitcoin because fees will bee too high. (Think $100 high...). People will be transacting mainly off-chain, like using Lightning Network. (Again, I invite you to learn about this.) But the key point is that this was used by many, many people to attack bitcoin. Opportunistic pieces of shit, who couldn't care less about what bitcoin is or what it stands for, were using fees as an excuse to attack bitcoin. Even going on US national TV to tout and push their shitcoins. So whenever you bring up fees, even if this with good intention, you'll most likely get lots of flak. It's impossible to distinguish a genuine question from concern trolls attacking bitcoin.

As I understand it: (correct me if I'm wrong)

* banks can borrow money for 0 interest and hypothetically offer much cheaper loans to incentivize more borrowing

* banks can invest the money borrowed directly into stocks

* increased amount of dollars in circulation devalues the dollar, but this is by design and used to spur economic growth through cheaper exports

If stocks continue finding more legs down non stop in a vertical straight line, then it's pricing in a depression. That does not necessarily have to come true either, markets are horribly inefficient.

fks4vpm,automaticblues,9,"Hey Slim,
Basically Nano is very much a currency whereas a lot of other crypto projects do various things, but are less usable as a currency.
Nano is fast and feeless, which means if you send someone 1 nano, they get the whole nano you send and neither of you pays for the privilege. A small ""proof of work"" calculation is required to avoid spam. This basically means your device has to do some processing to send the payment, so if you tried to spam the network with loads of trivial transactions, it would end up using a lot of processing power, but the processing power to send each transaction is minimal.
As the purpose of Nano is to use it, my recommendation would be to try to get some and then to spend it.
If you set up a wallet, I'll send you your first nano. All you have to do is send me the address.
In general telling someone your receiving address holds little risk. Your wallet will hold the corresponding private key which is what you need to send from that address. That basic mechanism of public-private key pair is common to lots of crypto currencies.
So, find a wallet. Follow the instructions to generate the addresses and I'll send you a small amount. Then I'd say set up another wallet on another device, and send from one to the other to see how fast Nano is. It's pretty remarkable and is a key feature, because Bitcoin especially is S..L..O..W..",2020-03-18 06:58:51

The market are sheeps, and sheeps go for the most famous ones. But I'm not telling you to invest in either of those two either, because it could equally likely just fail and die.

fkvpupl,Rhamni,42,"So, Nano's price development has been abysmal since the top. It is lower in dollars now than when BTC hit 3200 over a year ago.

That said, it's one of my favourite coins, and it makes me sad that the market does not share my sentiments. It is the fastest decentralized currency there is. It's as fast as the Lightning network at its best, and it's layer one and really easy to use. It works like people think Bitcoin works when they first start looking into crypto. You just send your coins and they arrive faster than you can tell the recipient that you have sent. It's also feeless. On a practical level the difference between feeless and really low fees (Like everything right now, even Bitcoin) is not that big, but aesthetically, if I send my buddy 1 coin so he can try it out, neither of us wants to look at his wallet and see he has 0.996732351 coins.

It also had no sale of any kind. No ICO, no IEO, no seed round or private sale with locked up coins raining down every few months. All coins were given away for free through a captcha faucet, and it traded for dirt cheap for most of a year before the sudden price explosion at the end of 2017. Surprisingly few coins managed to get anywhere without a sale, but Nano is one of them. It doesn't do smart contracts and its privacy is no better than Bitcoin's, so Nano could never become a lone king of the hill - there would always be room for smart contract platforms and privacy coins. But I think that tradeoff has had the added benefit of keeping most Nano fans more friendly than a lot of other communities. Every coin has moonbois, and I know a lot of people on CC have gotten annoyed from seeing Nano mentioned a lot, but considering how many people on here like it, I think the community is a lot less obnoxious per capita than a lot of other communities.

As to security without mining, I just want to say that to perform any kind of attack on Nano you would need to control a majority of the votes, and as a bad actor that means a majority of the actual tokens. You would need the cooperation of at least Binance + the second, third and fourth biggest holders... And honestly, the biggest exchanges are not likely to conspire to doublespend a coin that's trading on their platforms. Plus even if they did, the value of Nano would go to zero *and* all those exchanges would lose all community good will.

I hope in the long run Nano does well. It's one of very few coins with no token sale and strong, continuous development (Not being a traditional blockchain, it can't just copypaste from other projects).",2020-03-19 08:30:22

In 2 months only $5M will be sold every day. If new money continues to come in at $10M the effect is the price has to rise to compensate.

Logically the price only has to rise by 2x to balance, but as bitcoin double interest grows and more than $10M in new money now wants to come in, which rises the price, which increases interest. This proceeds a positive feedback loop and drives the next bubble.

Looking back to the previous cycle $5000 or even $3000 were crazy high prices.

The only difference in this cycle is the halving will happen *at the same time there will be the largest coordinated global central bank asset pumping in the history of mankind*.

Since then the number of COVID19 jobs have been sparser, as it appears the network is well stocked with processing power at the moment, still I encourage others to join the hunt for proteins. Text from a few days ago:

I tried this out last night, its fairly easy to setup, but you do have to allow for express install on windows. custom installing is too much of a headache. once it's installed, it opens up a Firefox (Brave browser doesn't work, go figure) GUI where you can set how much CPU/GPU power you want to have dedicated to helping solve/folding proteins. YOU CAN USE YOUR CPU. 

The COVID19 project is under the ""All"" category.

**In response to the nihilistic comments in this thread, I'll say this: I think if you have any spare computing power you should try this altruistic distributed computing experiment. Folding some proteins in virtual for the benefit of a COVID19 vaccine is very much in the spirit of early Bitcoin mining. And I feel it would make Satoshi proud to know that the little community he seeded grew into something that would be brave enough to take on the monsters of this world, in more ways than one.**

**And make no mistake, realistically, I don't believe our collective virtual protein folding will make a big difference, even if all 1000000 subscribers were to dedicate our resources to this (my best guess is that 21 of us will. maximum). But sometimes, it's not about what will likely happen, but what is good for the soul. Hope is a wonderful thing, and people need hope in any small way with today's stressful events.**

**So tonight I'll be letting this program run on my rig. Hope you all join me.**

PS: I've created a rbitcoin Team for protein folding, our team number is 238758. add this into the GUI by clicking ""change ID"" when you start mining/folding.",2020-03-20 10:46:53

Regretfully, I’ve found myself posting bearish comments the past few days. Yesterday i was on here writing comments about how one would be delusional to think that the recent rise would continue. There is not a correlation between bitcoin and equities, as history has proven, but when investors are dumping proven assets because they see the writing on the wall, you have to question what the real capitulation is going to be like for us in this space.

With people wondering how they’re going to pay the bills next month, there’s no reason for us to be excluded from the circumstantial bear market we currently face.

fl26e1s,isoiso1000,5,"Overview of Bitmex during the crash:

On Mar 12 the price of Bitcoin started to crash. After stopping briefly at 5600 the price fell below 3900 on all major fiat exchanges. The magnitude of this movement placed a huge stress on the ability of Bitmex to handle liquidations of losing traders. In theory BitMex will in this situation:

Liquidate a position when the account equity is not enough to cover the loss on the position. If the liquidation price is better than the bankruptcy price, the excess goes into the insurance fund. If the liquidation price is worse, the insurance fund covers the difference. If the insurance fund runs out, the winning trader is auto deleveraged.

This move was different, the move was so sharp that Bitmex chose to leave liquidations hanging. At one point there was 20m in bids and over 100m in pending long liquidations. Any move to fill these liquidations as designed would risk fully wiping out the insurance fund. Bitmex decides to gamble and protect the insurance fund and the site by not filling liquidations. At this point Bitmex needs the price to pump, yet it is held down by these liquidations. The most amazing possible thing to save the site would be a temporary pause to allow spot to pump and orderbooks to fill. Bitmex gets their miracle as an ‘unplanned cloud physical event’ (later re-classified as a 'DDOS attack on the chat box' occurs). It is impossible to know the exact details behind this action. What is known and that Bitmex agrees to: this event was enormously beneficial (possibly saving the entire site), and trivially within the ability of Bitmex to carry out.

Once the site was down the price was able to pump. When the site comes back online, traders who were short are now liquidated based on the mark price (5400) even though the actual orderbooks are trading at (4500). Bitmex is able to create a forced bid (short liquidation) and use this to fill a forced ask (long liquidation) while the insurance fund profits off this entire spread. As the market stabilizes Bitmex continues to send in long liquidations for several hours. The gamble paid off and the insurance fund increases after a catastrophic event, to over 36,000 coins.

What does this mean?

Bitmex will act to preserve itself when market stress arises. The insurance fund will switch from a theoretical backstop to a speculative trading instrument controlled by Bitmex trading in its own interest. I have always considered Bitmex one of the most trustworthy sites, I have never come across a credible report of them stealing or having weak security. This event however demonstrates that their advertised systems are at the whim of what they feel is needed for the site and their insurance fund will exploit traders as needed in extreme situations.


Example:

Short 10m

Entry Price 10k

Price falls to 100

Profit 9.9m

Coins needed to payout profit, 99,000

Actions during this event strongly suggest the insurance fund in practice is a trading vehicle purely at the discretion of Bitmex. If the price falls too far they have the option to simply shut the site down or pause liquidations to protect their fund, this is effectively what they chose to do. This also sets up a huge boost to the insurance fund when the site comes back and there are simultaneous active long/short liquidations, the engine simply confiscates the gap and puts it into the 'insurance fund'",2020-03-21 07:39:16

2. In Bitcoin, by design, network security is separate from fund security. Even if you had 51% hashrate, you still couldn't spend other people's coins. 

3. BCH has the same hash algorithm as BTC, so it's just a matter of time when the hashrate will come back home.

3. BCH is scriptable and open for customization. You can put any text in OP_RETURN field. You can use blockchain for tweets (memo.cash) or for notary uses (e.g. notary.bitcoin.com). Multi-signature schemes, timelocks, and other exotic use is possible with BCH.

4. There are multiple implementations of BCH full node software.

#What are the people like?

Super friendly. Everywhere has mean, toxic, and bitter people. But overall, the people in Houston love strangers and are friendly to talk to. They want to know about you and what you’re up to and are happy to have a conversation that isn’t just superficial. If you’ve only ever lived in New England, Chicago, or LA this will be a huge culture shock for you. 

A great example of the difference became apparent when I got back to New England and talked with one of the checkout ladies at the local grocery store. She, like almost all of the New Englanders I know, assumed that the mass hoarding of goods that I saw at HEB and other stores was because people were hoarding for themselves. The reality, though, is that largely those people were hoarding for their communities. See, in Texas, there’s a social contract to keep and eye out for those around you. If you see your neighbor doesn’t have power, you offer them food, or shelter, or heat, or water. Whatever they need. You help your neighbor because they are there. In New England and other liberal areas, people expect the government to provide for these needs, and in turn, they pay the government taxes. Texas has a totally different mindset: it’s the individual’s job to keep the people around them up and going, and the government's job to stay out of their lives.

I want to be clear, both systems have their merits and problems. I want the reader to understand that two very different systems exist. Which one the reader prefers to live under is up to them, but if you move to Texas, you WILL be living in the one that requires you, rather than the State, to provide for basic needs. This is why the taxes are so low. This is why everything is so cheap; so that you can afford to do that. People who have plenty hoard so they can provide to those who don’t have enough. The road to Hell is paved with just as many good intentions as assuming the government could solve the same problem any better.

#What about food?

BBQ is amazing here. Avoid chain restaurants of all sizes. The chains will still be good, but worse than what you could get elsewhere. Rendezvous, in Memphis, TN, remains the best BBQ I’ve ever had full stop. But the BBQ in Texas was at least as good as Rendezvous.

Blue Belle Ice Cream is also a native of Texas; get some. It’s better than Ben and Jerry’s and ½ the price.

#How about parking?

I didn’t need to pay to park anywhere. Now, when visiting the Museum of Natural History, I did choose to park around ½ a mile away so that I could avoid paying to park right at the museum, but that was my choice. In general, you’ll find free parking at/near wherever you want to be. The city is laid out for people to drive around within it, and almost every store or restaurant I saw had a parking lot of some form.

#Public Transit?

It exists, but...seriously, look at the size of Houston on Google Maps, and then compare it to the 4 public transit lines they have. For all indentured porpoises (sic) there is no public transit.

#Is there stuff to do?

Hell yea brother! There’s stuff to do all over. You don’t have to live in Houston to find things to do. There are plenty of dog parks scattered all over, and people are friendly enough that even if you don’t have a dog, you can show up and just talk to the people who are there, while also getting to pet the dogs as they come by. Do wear clothes that can get muddy, wet, and slobbery though. It’s a dog park. Dogs are rarely clean.

There are malls, shopping centers, bars, and other activities in most of the more well-off neighborhoods (indoor Skydiving near The Woodlands and a few others I saw, but don’t remember where). And, if you want to get into the city itself, Katy and The Woodlands are both a 30-40 minute drive or less. K1 racing has indoor electric go-karts that go like 40-50 MPH. It’s hella fun. A bit pricey, but fun. There are plenty of shooting ranges, and they don’t require you to buy your ammo at the range to shoot there.

Meetup.com is fairly useless in the city, but that is a problem with a lack of providers for content, rather than a lack of people who want to participate. Most of the meetup groups want to make money off being a meetup leader. If you just want to hang out with people, make a group, host some events, enjoy people’s company. Or, go to a church (once the Human Malware outbreak passes) and meet people there, if so inclined.

#How about dating?

The couples I saw were all about the same attractiveness. If you can look in the mirror and be honest with yourself, and are attracted to people about the same beauty level as you are, the odds are you’ll find someone without too many problems. If you want to punch above your weight class, regardless of gender, you are going to have a bad time. The city is mostly an app-based dating city though. There are no singles meetups or groups I could find. People tend to either meet ‘in the wild’, at church, or through apps. I see it as a blessing and a curse. It gives you a reason to improve yourself to the point that you are the peer of the person you seek to date, but it also means that if you wanted to trade (overweight, but a good provider) you’re SOL because there’s a good provider who is also attractive just around the corner.

#Closing thoughts

Overall, I like Houston. I’d visit it again, and if I ever win the Bitcoin Lottery, I might have a winter home there. Katy, TX is the exact ideal of the life I want once I find a wife. Whether we have kids or not, both the master-planned and organic subdivisions in and around Katy are the exact type of place I want to live. That said, the humidity is just too much for me to deal with year round. I’ll need to find somewhere more north to live until I’m rich. Thoughts on Indiana vs Utah? (Indy vs SLC?)",2020-03-22 11:23:19

We don't have to agree on when things will turn around, at some  point (barring extinction or a third term for Trump) the global econ _will_ turn around. 

And I'm still a huge believer that bitcoin will turn around too. and see a new ATH high once we do. 

If we're looking for positives, how about this: The halving could create a scenario where bitcoin becomes beautifully sensitive to any bull momentum, where the drop in supply magnifies upward movement. And provides a backstop against further drops. 

The halving will take some time to take effect, the drop in supply is obv effective immediately, but if miners (and other market participants) have been holding back supply, then any release/sales of that supply may mute bull momentum. 

At some point we'll be fully adjusted to the 6.25btc/blocks. And from that moment forward bitcoin will become a powder keg of bullish potential. Ready to explode at the first 20%+ jump. 

And, if we're already going down the wet dream path, let's go all the way: If the standard financial markets are still in the doldrums. If they're providing flaccid returns. Then bitcoin could be poised for its moment in the sun. When the world is finally ready to accept bitcoin as the one and only true savior of our financial world.

fl7x23q,GenghisKhanSpermShot,9,"I'm about to write something I would have laughed everyone out of the building just a week ago but I have to consider it. Two questions as traders you should always ask is where is the most pain and where is the liquidity and what are the extreme scenarios. 

In 2008 the house denied tarp and we had a massive selloff in stocks. Politics aside the house and senate are not agreeing on a package yet (Pelosi just said she's not agreeing to the current plan), that's going to spook the market until the giant bazooka stimulus gets passed. I think the market will selloff and so will precious metals and Bitcoin, there will be a race to USD as it goes for it's last insane bullish run.  Everyone will attribute this to Bitcoin being coupled to the stock market which isn't true at all, it's tied to USD. 

I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm eyeing [$1200.....................................................
](https://www.tradingview.com/x/rjU3O7jM/)
Add to that I noticed in 2015 Bitcoin had a massive selloff down to the last top at [$165](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tEDyknRL/), if that happens again that would put us at about $1200.

Add to that longs are still [way too many](https://blockchainwhispers.com/bitmex-position-calculator/) for a bottom I think. 

If this really happens this will be a massive shock to crypto and shake it to it's core, BUT it will be a life changing opportunity if you have the guts to buy. It would still be a giant bullflag and still in an uptrend overall and after a multiple trillion dollar stimulus that would cause inflation and a race to deflationary protection. 

I expect to get ridiculed and hope this doesn't happen but it's something we have to consider, I have cash ready if this plays out.

I feel like some people are paranoid when it comes to whale manipulation, of course it's a large element in market forces, but there's tens of thousands of private traders with smaller (and large) stacks that aren't all behaving in a cooperative manner, but instead are subject to the standard market principles that affect both conventional assets of the stock market and crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just because a price move happens in tandem doesn't inherently mean there's some overarching correlation that fundamentally invalidates cryptocurrency as a whole, it's utility, value, merit, or even price. 

There's a logical reason that BTC dropped given world events - and that has to deal with human psychology and economic behavior on a macro level. FUD in society is going to cause FUD in systemic financial appendages of society - which **both** bitcoin and stock are. 

But to be so confident that 'whales' conspired with the sole objective of running an ""anti-correlation bull trap,"" to me, is not following any of the top occam's razor explanations. 

Put another way, lets say futures weren't a thing for the stock market, and we didn't have hourly updates on coronavirus news, all variables were static this afternoon - contrary to the reality: that all those things actually playing a role in the collective awareness of economic and pandemic related matters...BTC was still at a fiercely matched resistance level between 6.4 ish and 5000's, I think some call this a gravity well. 

So if you hypothetically removed all those variables and looked at BTC in isolation, the odds were in my opinion fairly likely we would have seen 6 break this afternoon anyway, as price discovery and bull vs bear battles continued. 

Maybe I'm overlooking something, and I'm by **no means** an expert in TA, market analysis, or finance, beyond being blued to crypto charts since 2015 and having a diverse portfolio - but overall, this sub lately has been saturated with unsubstantiated quick comments without any substance beyond conjecture, or just enough substance to FUD someone who is less informed / newer to the space, into adopting the commenter's POV (often a POV they've adopted due to their fucking up a trade and are salty about it)

There's the group who believe some mix of the following: 

- we're on the verge of mooning
- everything is priced in
- coronavirus is overblown
- we'll be back to normal in 8 days - at the end of Trump's 15 plan. or mid-April at the latest
- We're already past peak panic
- the world about to wake up, en masse, to the genius of Satoshi and will be throwing every dollar they have into bitcoin

And the other group believing the polar opposite:

- bitcoin (and all risk-on assets) are going to be under continued pressure, re-visiting lows or making new lows
- Hardly anything is priced in bcs how can anything be priced in when we're in the middle of so many unknowns?  
- coronavirus is a very real threat - to health and economies
- Normal? This _is_ the new normal. Lockdown til May (or later) and then gradual return to public life with a few billion gallons of hand sanitizer and everyone staying six feet apart for at least 12-18mos.
- Peak panic? We probably haven't seen anything yet... 
- Bitcoin is squarely risk-on and as the world deteriorates and second order impacts pile on, panic will increase. 

I don't think I've ever seen such a stark contrast in here since the the buttcoiner days. This sub was flooded with nocoiners, claiming that bitcoin was trash and would soon be dead. And now this...

flbaz05,SloppySynapses,10,"I think what you just pointed out is the strangest part of being a maximalist for me that's always turned me off from fully endorsing it.  

I think BTC is a good bet as a hedge against inflation- buying it essentially means you're potentially protected in the small chance that global economies collapse and bitcoin moons against all major currencies.

Which means, unless you're some sort of sadistic doomer/prepper apocalypse type, you shouldn't even be hoping for bitcoin to moon, unless your plan is to rule the world one day because you bought earlier than everyone else who got fucked over in the economic collapse that allowed it to succeed. 

I understand *being prepared* for it and buying it *lest* the worst happens and you're unprepared- holding a zimbabwe-esque dollar, losing value rapidly to the brrr's of the government money printers. But hoping that it will happen seems to me to either be sadistic at worst, or pure, unadulterated greed veiled as belief in the technology at best

No judgment really, I understand being greedy and wanting to be one of the only people with any money in a doomsday type scenario- it's appealing in a sort of Will Smith ""I Am Legend"" way where you rule the post-apocalypse earth. But that's why pretending that it's some sort of belief in the technology has always seemed dishonest to me

Anyway. Just thinking out loud because I guess I never knew how to articulate that until now.

I will always watch bitcoin and pay attention to what it's doing because of the very small potential for that scenario to come true, particularly right now. I've never felt like BTC's price action the past few years has mattered much, because it's mainly just been a game of ""how to fuck over overleveraged traders"" but now that nearly *all* cryptotwitter-esque gamblers have gotten completely BTFO in the past 3 months, the next 3-6 months of price discovery will probably be legitimately enlightening as to what BTC's real use case is. Is it truly a store of value? A hedge against inflation? Or was it just a fun gambling token all along?

I will personally never hope for the situation where BTC holders get incredibly rich- because the quality of my life and others around me will probably rapidly descend to utter shit in the actual scenario that it comes true. If it does happen, I believe I have the skills to capitalize it and make myself a lot richer from it, but I generally hope that it never comes true.

flfc5xy,bitusher,4,"First of all , It is generally a bad Idea to be getting investment advice from strangers and on reddit or social media. I am giving you some information here just as a jumping off point for you to do your own research and verify things for yourself and learn a bit more. 

Past historical performance does not equal future expectations and you need to prepare for ""black swan"" events and disasters like we are currently experiencing. 

Also you should learn why day trading is so dangerous and why most retail day traders end up losing money -

https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/c4zpw9/what_are_the_steps_to_trading_bitcoin/erzkfmm/

You should investigate how money is created and the different asset classes and understand that if you are lucky enough to live in a stable economy the best you can typically hope for is your fiat currency like the euro or US dollar will slowly lose 2 % in purchasing power each year.  

&gt; if I bought bitcoin would that be a viable defense against inflation?

Historically, In the short term = 1 to 2 years Bitcoin is a horrible Store of Value due to how volatile it is. Do not invest in Bitcoin if you are planning on getting rich quick in less than 1 year , in fact , its probably wise to avoid any investment until you can learn why this is so dangerous and will reinforce risky and bad investment practices. 

Over the 1-2 year periods Bitcoin has been an excellent store of Value and a great (but also risky and experimental ) investment.

If you have a few more minutes read this article :

https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc11

------------------------------------------

Now is gold a good store of value against inflation? Go ahead and look at 100 year charts and 10 years charts and you will see many times that gold has consistently lost purchasing power against the US dollar year after year in certain time periods. gold has decreased in purchasing power for periods of 36+ years , year after year as an example, and in most recent history almost 4 years straight. Looking at the last 10 years you might see an average of ~2% returns on gold after inflation so gold could be considered a store of value in this sense , but overall a horrible investment compared to a stock index fund like the SPDR investing in the whole SP500 which can see as high as ~11% average returns over these last 10 years , even after the crash.

Thus gold might be a good store of value in the very longterm as long as you are willing to wait many years of downturn at times before it rebounds. 

------------------------

A very good store of value **short term** if you define store of value as a stable asset that keeps most of its value would be an interest bearing savings account of US dollars that returns 1.5% to 1.7% a year insuring you are only losing 0.3 to 0.7% a year in spending power after inflation. US Tbill used to be better but now have a yield of 0.7- 1% yields for a 10 year thus are less optimal for retail investors

-------------------------------

So what is the bottom line from all of this?

1) do not invest in Bitcoin until you do some basic research into what it is and how to secure it  

2) Do not invest in Bitcoin unless you paid off all high interest debt and have a fiat savings account of at least 3 months of living expenses  (you can buy it to use it and save money instead of investing however -https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/fmm8i2/best_place_to_sell_btc_uk/fl4yg50/ )

3) You should have a diversified and hedged portfolio of uncorrelated and negatively correlated asset classes

https://messari.io/c/research/research-bitcoin-as-an-uncorrelated-asset-class


4) There is no best solution as everyone is unique and should allocate their investments according to their specific needs and circumstances. I.E... since you are living at home you probably don't need to have so much fiat savings , but also might want to consider saving for education as well.",2020-03-25 11:21:46

I love that bitcoin is not just holding up but strongly holding/recovering value after those first few punches to the gut. 

BUT

I still think we've got a long way to go with this. And my reasoning isn't focused on covid projections. 

The current moment demands the following assumption: 2-4 weeks of closures. That's a shared foundation no matter what you believe about the curve that covid will follow. That particular piece of news is pretty much priced in. 

But here's what I don't believe is priced in: The economic fallout that we'll see bcs of the global lockdown. 

I have been following a lot of the early econ data, I'm not going to list it here bcs it's just too much. But I'm linking to a few twitter accounts below. 

Bottom line: The second/third order effects have the _potential_ to be quite large. Stuff I haven't seen since 2007-2009. These impacts take time to ripple through the economy. It's like a tsunami, the massive energy is there, but it's not really visible. On the open ocean it looks like a small swell. but as it approaches land... watch the fuck out. 

And we're getting early indications that this will be a global financial tsunami. 

I'm going to take an hour today to give my grade school aged daughter an education on supply/demand and how to place a short order to take advantage of hard earned belief in where a market is headed. And, if it's not obvious, I believe that virtually every market (stonks, bitcoin, etc...) are going to go down. And hard. Maybe not tomorrow. or even next week. but in a couple of months, we'll have seen new lows almost everywhere. 

Good luck gents!

flhsyyg,DCinvestor,9,"S&amp;P 500 just closed the second day in a row as green / up. It's not much, but it's something.

To be clear, it's nothing to get too excited about and definitely not a bottom signal, but it may be a sign of at least some interim consolidation on the way down, which otherwise has mostly looked liked it's been in incredible free fall over the past month.

My general hypothesis is that given the unique nature of this crisis and the expectation of damage from shutdowns, stocks went straight to ""vertical"" capitulation- a condition in stocks which often happens after a market tops, then starts to roll over, and bounces down a few times before the big vertical collapse (see S&amp;P 500 in September/October 2008 for an example). The recent volatility in some individual stocks looks more like crypto than what I'm used to from stocks.

*Best case* scenario for me is that we consolidate at around these levels, and then eventually stab down into 1800 to 2100 territory.  If we can't meaningfully consolidate here, then we *should* consolidate at 1800 to 2100 on the weekly, then putting a likely bottom somewhere closer to 1600 (which was the year 2007 top).

I know this isn't a stock trading sub, but the S&amp;P 500 is worth keeping an eye on these days. But it also seems anecdotally that Ethereum, Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are showing some signs of decoupling from stocks.

I remain fully in my long-term crypto positions (with larger recent adds from $90 to $125 on ETH, $5000 to $5500 on BTC), and still waiting for a bit more blood from stocks before picking up my DCA there in tax-deferred accounts. Otherwise, I'm stacking cash waiting for stock buys in my after-tax accounts. Aiming towards small ETH DCA buys around once every two weeks.

Hope y'all are doing well, given the circumstances. I'm starting to feel better here (though still a little fatigued) and hopefully staying on the mend.",2020-03-26 05:41:59

* USA government basically confirming that it'll do everything in its power to not let the economy go to shit.

&gt;Btw I can see you are in USA? You should look from here for all that stuff from Turkey. Gold is always on raise against TRY(Turkish lira)

No, I am a tico from CR. Turkey simply has higher inflation than the US, but this doesn't matter because I corrected for inflation. For the last 10 years Gold has averages 2% more spending power per year worldwide , even in turkey. A diversified stock portfolio like a SPDR has returned ~11% purchasing power (so 13% pre-inflation). bitcoin has appreciated far more than gold or stocks

&gt;But yeah maybe I can keep this trading weekly or monthly for less risky benefit.?

Professional day traders either do 2 things - 

1) Use bots and sophisticated algos where the trader is just there as a fail safe to make sure everything is running fine and large amounts of capital 

2) Swing trade with at least 2-3 week windows with sophisticated hedged investments and large amounts of capital

flkrlal,DarrenTapp,2,"I'm concerned about how this will effect BTC.  As the difficult dropped around 16% to adjust to the lower price.  Now, the hash rate is slated to increase 26% on the next adjustment.  If this continues then the blocks will come out slow maybe even very slow on the BTC chain.

Here's the difficulty history:

https://fork.lol/pow/difficulty

Here's the expected difficulty change:

https://fork.lol/pow/retarget


BCH has an adjusting difficulty algorithm.  This is more nimble and adjusts to a change in hash rate more quickly.  So BCH does not have the 2 week adjustment problem of BTC.  However BCH is a minority SHA256 chain.  Being a chain with minority hash power is not great.  In fact, it was a problem before and around the BSV BCH split.  


Dash has an adjusting difficulty algorithm called gravity wave.  This does allow for the difficulty to accommodate a change in hash power more quickly.  Also Dash is the majority X11 chain by far, so it doesn't have the minority chain problem that BCH has.  So that's great!!  But wait there's more.

Dash block time targets 2min 30sec.  So even if a block takes six times that target, that's only 15 min.  With bitcoin a slow block of similar variance would take an hour.",2020-03-27 03:12:49

fllpzl3,GoDM1N,2,"&gt; (not trying to say that this is some huge flaw, I’m genuinely interested because I don’t know much at all about far right ideology or anarchism)

Yea I get you. I'm not suggesting any of this stuff is a ""flaw"" or ""good"" either just trying to explain my understanding of it all. 

&gt; So as long as literally everything you get is from trading value, it’s far right?

Sure. Then the more government spending your society does the more left you go. AuthRight example in medieval times the king didn't supply the army. The knight had to buy their horse, weapons, armor, etc and the knight was required to serve when told. They even had to buy specific sets of armor so they couldn't just cheap out. LibRight basically the same during the US revolution only the militia chose to be there (or not to be there) and what to buy (or not to buy). Despite popular belief military spending is actually a pretty left thing to do. True right would require the individual to buy their kit because (if we're talking extremes) the government isn't spending anything on its people. Same for police, firefighters, border patrol, etc. Those are paid for by the government. So they're left. I think a lot of people don't realize that and claim some kind of arbitrary ""but culturally..."" but relative to the compass they're left. It doesn't mean all left society has to prioritize military, or a right society cant say ""Well okay we'll tax for the military"" but the nature of today's militaries in regards to funding is left. Nobody is expecting soldiers to show up with their own assault rifle. 

In short, far-right = everything you get is from some form of trade. Healthcare, clothing, transportation, etc. 

&gt; in an ancap society that didn’t have any currency, how would healthcare work? “I’ll only treat your heart attack if you mow my lawn later”. 

Sure or some other thing of value. Doesn't HAVE to be straight up labor. Maybe its a watch, gold bar, a pair of socks, commodities such as salt or just a thank you. Anything is basically ""fair game"" as long as the person providing the service agrees it has the right amount of value and the person buying agrees as well. At least for LibRight... AuthRight might say ""No you cant just take a thank you, it needs to be this"". 

This all said, I don't actually think we'd ever not have ""money"" even in extreme LibRight. Case in point bitcoin. Having a common currency is something people tend to all move towards naturally because it makes life easier.",2020-03-27 08:29:59

[This chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/6JRd7vC7/) shows correlation with the DJIA, while [this one](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pAPHt88b/) shows correlation with the VIX, which itself of course it typically negatively correlated with the DJIA. These charts essentially say the same thing, that bitcoin is a speculative asset just like any other, and that when there is a capital flight to safety and the VIX rises, most of the time bitcoin would fall. Sort of old news, I realize, but important nonetheless. 

In addition, take particular note that the two major bubbles as well as what is currently a minor one (2013/2017, and then 2019 respectively), show clear positive correlation with the Dow. Suffice it to say that, we will need to wait for COVID19 to be over and the world economy recovering until our next bubble. *However,* there is a substantial period of negative correlation with markets leading up to the big bubble of 2017.

flp738c,VictorCobra,3,"Your argument raises some really important points, and it may very well end up being the case. However, if crypto were eventually going to zero, I would expect a faster decline, rather than trading in a clear range over two years. If we break down from the range and Bitcoin ends up at $1K, then your theory becomes much more likely. But here’s why I think it’s taking a long time for crypto to “fizzle out,” as you say: 

Cryptocurrencies are unique in the sense that while they are certainly speculative assets, they offer alternatives to an essential economic system based on national fiat currencies and central banks. At the rate things are going with the current economic system, I think it’s easy to imagine a scenario where more people believe cryptocurrencies have value as a medium of exchange and a store of value. All you’d really need is for more of the world to believe a little less in the current financial system. Bitcoin hasn’t made a new low yet because the people who believe in crypto have imaginations. The power of human belief is very strong. Look at religion. Monetary systems are no different. 

Bitcoin hasn’t broken down and faded out (yet) because the narrative that gave birth to it remains intact. Crypto was meant for times like these, where the clear cracks in the system become obvious. Now is the first real test. While it may be scary to hold onto your coins during this time, it’s perhaps the most interesting time in the last 10 years to do so, as long as you can afford to lose it, of course :)

fls7a9o,BuildItMakeIt,1,"&gt; Just make sure you ride the wave to the upside again during the recovery, 

Yep, exactly. Only 37.5% of my assets are in ETF Index Funds right now, 2% in Bitcoin, and the rest is in Cash. So I'm in a good position to buy ETFs nearer to the bottom (guessing 2-6 months from now, based on how we see the next 6-weeks unfold).

fls7s2b,Buttoshi,1,"imagine two nano forks. which one is the real nano? 

this attack won't work on bitcoin. bitcoin cash isn't bitcoin because anyone can trustlessly verify.

two nano networks means it must be arbitrarily assigned by a person.",2020-03-29 07:56:15
fls4cs4,brianddk,1,"Agreed... The APY for bitcoin on the Coinbase wallet right now [0.05%](https://defirate.com/lend/).  Let that sink in.  If you agree to put up your BTC to custodialship for a year through the app, you get one tenth of your taker fee back.

fls5278,Ninjanoel,1,"I meet people today that have never heard the word ""bitcoin"", it's no surprise at all they are not using a better option that they don't know about. You're claiming no gold in China, and won't hear of anything else.",2020-03-29 07:28:34
fls4iqx,Leading_Zeros,1,"The game theory dictates that as soon as it leaks that one major government is buying up bitcoin, every country around the world will be compelled to grab a chuck of the supply. Bitcoin would go on the greatest bull run in history. No one wants to be caught with their pants down being that last country having to buy later at extreme prices. 

This also means most regular people will be left behind. The best thing for everyone is for governments to keep their head in the sand for as long as possible so the plebs can accumulate as much as possible before the inevitable paradigm shift occurs.",2020-03-29 07:23:07
fls7inh,Zander490,1,I dunno how bitcoin works and I'm not in too much of a rough spot to find out like this myself... How'd they even find our names?,2020-03-29 07:53:35
flrltqk,anon517,1,"Cash will be king, because people need to eat, pay rent, etc. which are all basic survival items many of which are harder or impossible to buy with Bitcoin right now. Particularly for the millions of people who have never used or don't understand Bitcoin yet.

Right now, I'm seeing a lot of positive scientific developments despite government floundering. Ventilators are being made. Hydroxychloroquine, vaccines, and even antibody blood transfusions are hopeful. Besides, the CFR looks to be around 1% which is very bad but would mean 99% of people will survive.

Kickstarting the economy again after the lockdown will take time. People will still be afraid to travel, go on cruises, particularly because a large number of cases will continue to be around for a long time, even into 2021.

A lot of businesses will collapse. This will mean a lot of people out of work (we've already seen 3 million filed for unemployment, a new record). On top of this, ""cheap money"" will be flooding in for SOME people (who have the credit), causing a rise in prices. This will be OK for people who have decent jobs, but will be horrible for people without jobs.

The situation becomes similar to Venezuela. We have a lot of poor people. So how do we solve the problem of people not having enough money? That's right, the government will print more of it. Causing even higher prices, and more poor people. Over, and over. And people will be wondering, ""why isn't it working?""

So, Bitcoin will not rise rapidly while the coronavirus is threatening people who need food and shelter.

But once that is over, and the economic engines are croaking, unable to get started, a desperate, hungry, angry population will DEMAND the government to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT which they will make it worse by providing more money, food, shelter to everyone until the country is bankrupt and the dollar is worthless.

And this is when Bitcoin's time will have come.",2020-03-29 04:14:23

flrmfxt,artischo,1,"ok, klingt plausibel. Also Kurse stürzen in den nächsten Monaten noch weiter in den Keller und kommen da auch so schnell nicht mehr raus. Arbeitslosigkeit steigt, Obdachlosigkeit auch. Wohnungen stehen leer, Neuinvestitionen bleiben aus, Kredite werden nicht bedient,  der Immobilienmarkt bricht ein. Die Banken folgen. Nationalstaaten taumelt. 

Was bleibt, wenn man etwas Geld übrig hat und nicht alles in der Inflation verlieren will? Bitcoin? Warum zur Hölle bricht denn jetzt auch noch der ganze Cryptokram zusammen? Es geht ja längst nicht mehr um Wertsteigerung sondern Werterhalt...

If you plan on making regular purchases of the same dollar amount (Dollar Cost Averaging, great way to accumulate) then check out [SwanBitcoin.com](https://SwanBitcoin.com). The fees are lower than CashApp, and they have automated recurring purchases and withdrawals.

My favorite exchange is Bisq ([bisq.network](https://bisq.network)) It's not as easy or pretty as centralized exchanges, but it's non-custodial (you always have control of your bitcoin and fiat) with no KYC (Know Your Customer) BS. The drawback here is that the volume is low and order books are thin compared to other exchanges. Once you have some bitcoin, experience, and understanding, be sure to give it a try.",2020-03-29 04:29:04

They already do. Bitcoin, promisary notes etc. 


&gt; How would we prevent the currency market from becoming very fractured?


You're gonna have to more specific?


&gt; Also what's to stop them from just printing more money for themselves?


The fact that no one would use the money and it would become worthless if they did.

So a lot more than is stopping the government from just printing more money for themselves.",2020-03-29 04:24:12
flu5w01,fresheneesz,1,"Honestly i don't think a fractional reserve system is bad for bitcoin in general, tho it does hold risks for people who have fractional reserve accounts. What's bad is inflation of the monetary base (and what that inflation funds). Even with fractional reserve (or no reserve), only the monetary base can actually be used (ie no one can spend more than they have). 

What would be really bad is if someone like coinbase counterfeited bitcoins. This could potentially be impossible to detect from the outside unless there's a run on coinbase. But at very least the counterfeit coins would be contained within their system and wouldn't leak out into the rest of the economy like dollars do.",2020-03-30 00:31:43

flu39du,Ichabodblack,1,"&gt;That is the classic 'Keynesian' response, but the assumption that people will stop spending is absurd to me, so the question begs the question that people will stop spending.

Really? If my bank has some value X in a deflationary asset and I want to buy something, it would usually be silly of me to spend that asset in it was worth Y in the future, where Y &gt; X. Depending on the delta of Y and X and the timeframe T, it may not be *economically sensible* for me to make the transaction. Instead I should trade something else. In this way a second currency is borne to actually ferry the transactions.

Let's make up some numbers, if my X was £1000 and Y was £2000 and the time delta T was one year. Let's assume a linear growth between the two, then each day my value grows by £2.74 per day. Therefore if I buy anything worth less than £2.74 I have *lost money* on it by the next day. It does not make sense for me to make that purchase. Extrapolate to larger values for the equation and you can see how spending begins to make little sense.

&gt;they are 'pushing spending', but what about 'encouraging saving'? 

Saving is encouraged now. You would just never save in cash. If you're saving in cash you're an idiot.

&gt;we're in a position where many people right now, out of work for more than a week, are going to have serious financial troubles. every defense or premise of that assumptions rings hollow to me.

So? How does that non-sequitur help your argument? You think if the world was Bitcoin based people would still be getting paid? Your argument is asinine. If people had all their money in Bitcoin now they would be *worse off* as the value of Bitcoin dropped by more than things like the value of stock.",2020-03-30 00:03:47

flu5q9d,prout_,1,"Hideout alone gets me close to a million a day (bitcoin, workbench, moonshine)",2020-03-30 00:30:04
flu5yo4,MarchewkaCzerwona,1,"&gt;These aren't stupid lies though. This is just plain reality, and I already told you, Bitcoin isn't crippled,.it works fine and sees far more demand than any fork of Bitcoin does.

Those are lies, as no batching, scratching and God knows what else can't mask the fact that btc is crippled chain by its small capacity limit. As I explained it to you, demand you are highlighting is stagnated for years now even though it is still higher than other forks and coins. It is stagnated and with signs of revere because it is self limiting chain. Once too many people use it, fees goes up and chain is unusable. How long you will try to pretend it is anything different. There is big elephant in the small btc room.





&gt;&gt;What is the point of securing in decentralised fashion something that failed already? If it can't function as cash it was created to be, it failed. No point of securing it now with decentralised miners.

&gt;It isn't failed already. That's your problem, I think you're under the impression that just merely saying something makes it so. It doesn't.

But it is failed chain. Look at it. What did it achieved in last two years since the event you highlighted? Absolutely nothing. Just stagnation and repurposing to useless speculation token. Even btc guys are recommending to use paypal or credit cards. WTF? It is failed chain. Failed, as it can't deliver what it was created for. 

It can't even compete with bch in what op is showing here. It can't work for vendors and users. That means it failed. That is not my opinion, that is a fact. Absorb it and then come back to tell me I am wrong. Please, do just that.



&gt;&gt;Bitcoin did scale the way I wanted. On bch chain.

&gt;bch isn't Bitcoin though. Even the bitcoin dot com wallet differentiates between the two.

Yes, between bitcoin core (btc) and bitcoin cash (bch).  Since fork it is important to highlight about which chain we are talking about as both are bitcoin and referring to one simply bitcoin is misleading.

Bitcoin core is bitcoin on btc chain, while bitcoin cash is bitcoin on bch chain.

Classic example of retronym.

My bitcoin cash coins have roots in 2009 genesis block.

&gt;&gt;On btc chain it didn't, but that is not my problem no more. I don't think you get it. I don't think you get how badly btc is derailed.

&gt;I don't think you get it. Bitcoin clearly won by all available metrics and data.

Which metric? What metric? Price? Irrelevant. You can have shit trading for more and it is still shit. Price is not measurement of success in delivering p2p electronic cash. 

Hash power? That would be closer, but even this is not measurement of success of delivering electronic p2p cash. It only proves btc is better in attracting hash power, and it is better at that indeed. Miners will get paid regardless bitcoins (on btc chain) success ad they are happy with current situation as they make a lot of money. They do keep bch afloat just in case too. Think about why.

What other metric? Users? Those speculators and investors that proudly call themselves users? They are irrelevant if all they want is to buy coin to sell it in some time for profit. Those are users of model bitcoin wasn't created for.

What other metric? Please, tell me.




&gt;&gt;No. Not really. LN is just a gadget that will never work and will never lead to adoption.

&gt;It already does work and is slowly seeing adoption and usage.

It doesn't work properly really. It has unsolvable problems and current workarounds are just that - a workarounds with trade offs. Slowly walking away from original purpose of p2p electronic cash with their watchtowers and custodial wallets. No, it is dead end with stupid assumptions. 



&gt;&gt;It is fundamentally stupid and with unsolvable problems.

&gt;No, you just can't comprehend it.

I think I actually know quite a lot of it and have spend way too much on this gadget. But ok, that is something for much deeper discussion so lets say I wish you well with this crap.




&gt;&gt;How can you settle on chain transaction to get chains security when fees might be higher than transaction? You can't.

&gt;You simply don't need to. 

If you don't need to, you gave up on chain security and safety. That is for a start.

&gt;Transactions within the LN clearly have their pros and cons along with a different security model.

Cons mostly, and pros are achievable without this quite complex model.

&gt;Strange that you're happy with the extra risk with 0 conf but not LN transactions.

Because simply LN will introduce same banking model we already have. Nobody will monitor constantly their channels to make sure funds are there. It will have to go to specialized entity that will on top of that afford chains security. No. mate. If somehow ever btc achieve success, LN would be its undoing.



&gt;&gt;It is the way for Blockstream to position themselves as a middlemen for a fee. Kind of IFP btc style.

&gt;This is your major downfall, the crazy conspiracy theories. Blockstream don't collect fees for LN transactions, unless they run a node, obviously. I really wish I could explain to how stupid those comments are.

But it is truth and Blockstream words. They were quite clear they want to profit from being positioned as experts of LN and were supposed to be funded for their expertise. This isn't any conspiracy theory, just history. You look very stupid because it looks like you didn't know that and you will be unable to explain anything with those gaps.




&gt;&gt;Not today. Maybe tomorrow morning. Maybe afternoon.

&gt;Not for the last 2 years and the ~9 years before late 2017.

For the last 2 years chain is limited and transaction volume is just below chains capacity. From time to time it does go up, and so are fees. That kind of proves my point that this chain is not going anywhere for at least 2 years. Job done, failed chain without future.




&gt;&gt;Is that what you are going to say to the customers before shopping? Look on charts and better come back tomorrow.

&gt;&gt;Seriously?

&gt;No. (What a truly stupid comment) They're free to spend immediately from the LN channel they'll have open - since hey actually want to spent their Bitcoin and this offers the best UX for regular, daily commerce.

LOL. It was satirical comment showing how stupid your logic is. Nobody is going to look on charts to make sure they can make shopping. They will simply not use such a stupid non functional currency.

Again, using Lightning notwork they will not be free to use channels as first they will have to check they liquidity (lol) and potentially open new channel or add funds paying on chain fees. Potentially bigger than price of bread. Stupid indeed. Or they can use help of liquidity provider, like , I don't know, ..bank? Stupid af. 

LN is utterly stupid idea and there is absolutely no chance for it to be successful. Unless it will become more convenient, most likely by sacrificing more bitcoins principles.




&gt;&gt;One that proved the 1mb limit is not enough and btc is derailed chain. One that clearly limited chains usage as since then all transactions volume is continuously just below capacity limit. Adoption stopped and btc became SOV, useless speculation token.

&gt;No. See the (more than) 2 years since then.

I see, two years of stagnation of self limiting chain that is unable to enable users to use it as a currency. Is that what you wanted to highlight?





&gt;&gt;Only for rich people or ...banks?

&gt;&gt;Come on.

&gt;No. (Again with the stupid projection, I'm not saying these things)

You are not saying those things, but you are implying situations where this is inevitable.

&gt;If the vast majority of mundane daily commerce occurs in other layers the base layer is likely to remain uncontested.

But you simply can't get a grip on model functioning within other model and what correlation it will most likely have. That is why you don't have a grip and you don't get it :)




&gt;&gt;No mate. I just see you don't get it and lost focus on what bitcoin was all about.

&gt;I think I clearly understand this tech, its capabilities and more importantly Bitcoin's monetary policy than you do from your responses.

I respectfully disagree. you seems to don't see that btcs limitation prevented btc to function as a currency and its main current use is speculation. What is worse, btc can't go beyond that. It is limited and LN is not a salvation.




&gt;&gt;Tricks to mask btc is not a functional cryptocurrency

&gt;No, just functionality.

Which is not there. Even tricks don't work. Actually, they do sometimes in the mornig. If you look on the charts and plan your shopping. :) Oh dear.




&gt;&gt;It is most well known and adopted also thanks to people that moved to bch and other coins. Since then adoption stopped (even in reverse) and btc became SOV. Something we don't need. Speculators love it though.

&gt;Bitcoin is used far more than any fork of it is. Almost all of crypto is speculation at this early stage.

It is 11 fucking years and I was buying btc in 2012 in Kings Cross. Where tha fuck is bitcoin now. Nowhere. It transition into useless speculation token and nothing more.

It may be a huge pain in the dick if your card number gets stolen and used (and it seems that's the primary worry), but this is expressly why there are such strict protections in place for credit cards in the first place. As long as you have a reputable bank or credit union, they will halt and reverse any unauthorized charges if you catch them. You have the ability to chargeback if you get bamboozled. I literally have a credit card I expressly use for watch transactions and nothing else. It's just nice to have an isolated system to purchase stuff; I've bought four or five watches on it so far and haven't gotten it stolen yet (fingers crossed), and it's already come in handy once when I needed to threaten a chargeback on one of the watches that wound up never shipping. They were quick to issue the refund.

Bitcoin is nice to have the discount but honestly, have you considered that you're getting essentially a 95% discount on the actual cost of the watch you're getting? If that price factor is considered, it doesn't seem worth it to me to get an extra 40 or 50 bucks off the cost in exchange for a total loss if you get screwed. I don't think PureTime is actively out to scam people, but when a transaction goes tits up they have little incentive to actually rectify the situation and continue to put effort into making it right, so the end result is essentially the same.",2020-03-30 00:43:02

Just because u were blissfully ignorant in January doesent mean everyone else was, its not a crime to keep up on world news. If theres something im missing about dumping stocks being illegal during a pandemic let me know plz cause i dont know laws regarding this stuff",2020-03-30 00:57:05

flzaic0,escobar_west,4,"The truth is, the world needs fiat and that will not change in our lifetime. We already had a scare decentralized unit of accounting (gold) and we abandoned it; a modern economy cannot function with a scarce unit of accounting so strongly influenced by supply and demand shocks. Regulated, manageable inflation helps to smoothen out shocks and greases the wheels of economy. Within the context of the pandemic, it's a good thing that world governments can print money and keep the economy alive.  


Printing money might be needed today, but that money stays in the economy long after the pandemic is over. If you print too much, irresponsible monetary policy leads to the erosion of trust/value in fiat, which leads to unmanageable inflation.  Imagine that you saved money your whole life, only to realize that your retirement nest is losing 10% of its purchasing power every year. This is why we need Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a hedge against irresponsible government monetary policy. If you feel that your government is printing money irresponsibly and that inflation is a risk (like in many parts of South America), then you can buy Bitcoin to protect yourself from that risk.",2020-03-31 10:46:00

flze0c1,JeremyLinForever,3,"To add to your post:

1. Gold is not divisible and fungible to the extent cryptocurrencies and BTC is.

2. We have been living in a world so long filled with inflation that this is the only rational and same thing that we know. However, what you do not know is technology is actually deflationary. See Apple, Google, Facebook, and Netflix? All these companies are arguably innovating ways to make the economy deflationary. See those barrels of oil in surplus that’s happening? It’s going to stay there because the old system is broken. Solar and electricity is going to dominate and sweep the world just like the Industrial Revolution came and swept the world in the 1900s.

3. The governments are on its last legs in keeping the economy alive. The US is printing money just to hand out to its citizens. The Democrats and Republicans are ever at odds with each other. Never have we been put in a position where a Democrat would ever propose an idea such as UBI because jobs are being replaced by robots.

This whole world pandemic is a restart for the world. A way for the world to free itself of the government and economical pressure that has been exerted on to countries for so long. This concept of fiat currency will change in our lifetime, except the whole prophecy of China having it’s own digital currency, US having it’s own digital currency, is real.

flyouvz,TheGrinninDjinn,3,"It’s optimism but not based on anything. I think there are multiple fail safes and measures taken before they do anything like that. I’m holding myself of course but I don’t know where it will lead. As far as I’m concerned that money is gone and that’s on me. Ripple is making sweeps and leaps and bounds. Xrp price wise is exactly where it needs to be for them to function. They don’t need it being bitcoin or light coin prices. It carries value just as well for what they need it to do. It will grow as they get more corridors and that will be ongoing. So stick around and find out- I don’t have a choice because I refuse to pull out at a loss but , fuck it might be 10 years until that day comes bro. 

My advice is to just chill. Leave it be. If you must play, expand into multiple alts and slowly build up and put away some cash to get at least one actual bitcoin and pull that out if it gets back to 20k XD",2020-03-31 07:10:10

The fairly big ripple effects from this simply haven't hit the big companies yet. This is new territory:

* unknown long-term effects, due to unknowable short-term causes (i.e. we don't know how long to a vaccine, how many will die and when, etc.)

* a bubble due to stock-market pumping to a huge degree from corporate buybacks, Gen Xers trying to catch up on retirement savings, etc. 

* increased volatility from robo-investing

* a wave of [newbie investors] (https://www.nzherald.co.nz/personal-finance/news/article.cfm?c_id=12&amp;objectid=12317116) eager to capitalize on the downturn

* bitcoin-type small buyers here and elsewhere convincing each other when to buy and hodl, like a bunch of penguins at the end of an iceberg

* a largely fabricated trade war with China that is still continuing to unwind

* an oil crisis

* incredible (and sometimes misguided) market meddling, er, support from multiple world governments, particularly the U.S. in an attempt to buy a re-election

* what will likely be permanent changes in how people commute, work and entertain themselves
