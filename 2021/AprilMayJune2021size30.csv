gsxr0ue,zluckdog,12,"Hey there. So you have this trading plan and it includes a liquidation level that could easily be hit. You might think bitcoin won't go below 50k again but all it takes is one wick and your loosing almost a quarter of a bitcoin. If you can afford that, it is your money, Do what you want. But first, consider the following:

Did you hear the story of [LowPro](https://www.tradingview.com/u/Low%20Pro/)? He felt pretty smart, built up an account valued over 100k trading bitcoin. When the market suddenly changed direction he kept longing and got liquidated back in 2014. 

He could have been a bitcoin millionaire if he didn't get greedy and gamble away his portfolio. Because that is what he really did. He gambled, rather then employ proper risk management. He kept revenge trading, instead of taking some time to cool off and re-evaluate his trading plan. 

So if you are posting here to get advice, listen to it. Be smart with your money because if you play recklessly, you will end up wrecked. Exchanges can spike down or up without warning. Changes happen faster then plans.",2021-04-01 02:37:08

I am not suggesting this is going to happen.  I think the jobs WILL come in hot—ADP showed that.  But don’t see there being a huge appetite for dollars in foreign central banks.  So, I’m not buying a “spike” in the dollar—which would cause Bitcoin to drop.

I didn't hodl a single sat. Multiple whole coins got smoked. Even my friend who bought 3 or 5 coins to sit on spent them on drugs eventually too. We aren't all that versed in financial literacy and have never said the word ""fiat"" or ""deflationary digit asset"". We wanted acid shrooms and weed and we got them.

Bitcoin really altered my whole life philosophy. I was super burnt out from work and was disgusted with Academia to the point where I just wanted to leave my country. Now I'm more inclined to invest in myself, build a nest egg and actually have a plan that extends beyond the 8 hrs in front of me.

A 5 year hodl plan is the first time in my life I've got a long term goal I can believe in. All I've gotta do is nothing and I succeed.

You can run the whole economy on 1 BCH if you need to.

It just means the value of a satoshi (or whatever is the smallest unit then) will increase.

However ... no-one is saying the fee-burning will last forever or anything.

Short term, increasing scarcity through such a mechanism might be a very good thing for BCH to secure more hashrate (increase scarcity, increase price, mining profitability goes up a little, hashrate follows profitability).

gt6fnaq,bitusher,2,"&gt;  cost of mining adjusts based on the amount to be gained in order to make sure mining is always profitable?

The protocol itself (without human intervention) automatically adjusts based upon the previous difficulty period 

New Difficulty = Old Difficulty * (Actual Time of Last 2015 Blocks / 20160 minutes or about every 2 weeks on average) 

If the Hashrate increases during the previous period than the difficulty increases to regulate the amount of Bitcoin mined. If the hashrate decreases during the previous period the difficulty also decreases (mining gets easier) to insure mining is profitable and the inflation schedule is relatively accurate.

You don't actually own any bitcoin, so if you walked into a Tesla dealership one day to buy a car you'd have to pay the old fashioned way and two you're going to get taxed on your capital gains.

The ETFs allow you to put it into a TFSA or RSP and purchasing/trading for BTC yourself (and ideally keeping in a secure wallet which you control) means you actually own the BTC itself. The option on WS is kind of the worst of both worlds IMO. Also most people who sell their BTC probably don't pay taxes (this is changing) where as WS will leave you a nice paper trail where you'll have no choice.

If you're going to trust a 3rd party to hold your coins just buy through Shakepay or some other insured Canadian 3rd Party and at least you actually own the crypto and can send it off platform if need be.

The idea being that any new large findings of veins like what happened in Africa would be curtailed by the ooh shiny aspect of gold. Like a niffler, you can bet someone will hoard it. And I think it ties inflation down to a more real number. Eventually we'll trade in gold dust but the economy will be solid AND honest. As is, the money presses were/are used for war. Something like less than ten percent at the federal level goes to public welfare.

gtcvo0m,Adrian-X,1,"&gt; What's your solution that gives privacy to the people but not to governments?

Bitcoin as in the protocol of the last 10 years is pseudo anonymous. I'm suggesting exploiting that to maximize privacy. 

Don't attache your name to an address unless it is necessary, we must fight to prevent governments mandating you do this. Coin mixers, I think could encourage governments to mandate such laws, that would erode privacy.   

If you manage your coins appropriately you can maintain your privacy. One way to think about it is like Digital Cash spending a $10,000.00 vs spending a $10.00. you get better privacy is you have 1,000 $10 bills than 1 $10,000 bill. Also don't mix your change if you spend 100 $10 bills on coffee and then consolidate the change to buy a gun then coin analysts of gun purchase can conclude all the coffee transactions were you. 

blockchair.com have codified this analysts technique and you can see your privacy score when you query an address. 

The government works in reverse, we all pay our tax into a single government address, we can then track how the government spends our money and hold them to account. any government spending that can't be accounted for is and should be illegal. 

&gt;And how do you currently know all the terrible things governments are doing?

I don't, I just see news reports of Donald Rumsfeld, on September 10th say ""we've lost $2,000,000,000,000 actually we spent it on weapons but we don't know where they went, and then on September 11th all the offices of the investigators are destroyed.  

I see that same government lie about weapons of mass destruction to justify an unprovoked invasion, 

I see the US military dropping bombs full of depleted uranium on Afghanistan, a country devastated by a war funded by the US and then accused of attacking the US without any evidence presented.  

I see the the financial system being abused by people in power, creating money out of thin air and accelerating wealth inequality as the money is invested in the wealthy at the expense of the poor. 

I see governments eroding people freedoms. 

&gt;Are you calling up the banks and asking where government-spent funds are going?

LOL, no Governments are not held to account. I don't want to call up anyone, I want natural law cause and effect to prevail. I just want the right to not be forced to consent.",2021-04-05 00:57:14

gti9o9g,CrabCommander,13,"Here's a quick BTC ***Bull Run Health Report*** (by Indicator) for those curious:

Keep in mind, all indicators are only accurate until they are not, and some are simply generated with back-dated values to find numbers that coincidentally seem to fit the markets.

Furthermore, keep in mind these are metrics for ***Bitcoin***, not alts, though they tend to follow BTC's movements.

**Bullish:**

- The [BTC Stock/Flow Model](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) suggests this bull run has a bit to even reach the new 'bear market floor' price point, with quite a bit beyond that to reach a bull market peak.

- The [BTC Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/) suggests we are quite some distance from a serious bubble, and only slightly overbought currently.

- The [BTC Net Unrealized Profit/Loss Indicator](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;m=indicators.NetUnrealizedProfitLoss) suggests there's a good bit of unrealized profit in the system, but not so much that a crash is imminent, with more room to grow before the 'danger zone'.

- The [BTC Reserve Risk Indicator](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;m=indicators.ReserveRisk) puts us about bang even in the middle of things.  The risk is neither particularly high nor low, and is notably far, far lower than periods where the market crashed.

**Bearish:**

- The [BTC Pi Cycle Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) suggests this is the top of the bull run (likely within the next 1-2 days, though it's been stuck at 'almost converging' for a week or more now.)

Sentiment definitely looks overall bullish, though it's a bit tied between 'set for another run', or if it'll be stagnant a bit/minor sell of first before going for another run.",2021-04-06 07:52:34

so now we can no longer be sure there are 21M BTCs that can ever be made - so there goes the gentleman's first point.

Since not everyone in the world can be on the same exchange and some exchanges legally cannot interact with others - there goes the idea that you can send BTC to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

Now the security of the held BTC is as secure as the competency of the security team at the exchange...that is to say absolute zero!!  All exchanges have and will be hacked at some point - sometimes its even an inside job.

From ~may-setp 2017 we were spiking in terms of search volume. The price then was surging past $100 and bouncing around between roughly $250-$350 with peaks and bottoms. Now notice the peak. Search volume was highest around dec 3rd - 23rd, but in that time, eth ""only"" climbed from $500-$700... it hit its all time high during the following month...    

Let's compare that to now. Where are we along the chart in comparison to 2017? Well, imo, we are moving faster. Of course the charts will not be identical, but my guess is that the 6 month long rush in search traffic from 2017 may-oct is similar to the search traffic we have seen in just the past 3 months. In 2017 you'll notice two dips, one bottom in early July and next early oct. Both 3 full months apart. In 2020 the bottoms are only 2 months apart. End of jan and another at the end of march.   

If my thesis is accurate at all, Aprils chart will match the one from November through December 2017. Talking spike in search traffic here... we will have a spike in price a week or so following.

I was in college and a friend of mine told me about these thing called Bitcoin (and how it was going to make us rich), and I ended up buying some. I lost 90% of my stack day trading alts in 2014 (back then they were pretty much all just Bitcoin clones, and Litecoin was still a pretty neat idea), but I held the rest. Back in 2013-14 people mostly thought I was an idiot for throwing so much money into Bitcoin (""it's a ponzi scheme; it has no value; what, are you going to buy drugs on the silk road with it?""), but I didn't listen to them.

I got involved in the space again in 2017. That year I traded all my Bitcoin for Ethereum, because I saw the writing on the wall that this was the future of crypto. Around this time I began to realize that this technology will literally change the world, and now it's clear that DeFi has the potential to bring the equity and transparency to the financial services sector that is sorely needed.

Four years after trading in my BTC for ETH, this investment has taken me to a point, not of being totally FIRE, but of being financially independent enough to really follow my dreams. I'm quitting my job at a fintech firm at the end of the month, bought a van to travel the country with, and I'll be joining a Buddhist center for a few months later this summer.

I say all this to express my deep gratitude for the amazing people driving this space forward. Crypto has attained a level of legitimacy that just wasn't there eight years ago, but it's clear that this is still to a degree a niche thing to be involved in.

But the thing is, Eth has an entire ecosystem built on top of it that offer many various use cases. In addition to this, Eth as an asset is hardening and with EIP-1559 &amp; POS. It's going to be harder and harder to justify the argument that BTC is superior to Eth.

Eth will have lower issuance (potential to be deflationary during times of high volume)

Eth will use drastically less energy with POS

Eth doesn't incentivise selling to offset mining costs from POW, rather the contrary with POS.

Quick disclaimer: I’m off work early today, had two drinks, and and feeling good so please excuse any typos. 

This post isn’t in regards to any coin, or token, but rather, the holders thereof. You the individual. 

Here’s to hoping each of you are well on your way to financial freedom. I don’t have a large amount of crypto, I actually probably have a pretty meager amount compared to most of you, but it’s growing, and one day I hope to retire from it. 

I know this message sounds like overly optimistic hyperbole, but I honestly feel like we are on the precipice of something great, and we are all party to it. 

At some point, every one of us has FOMO’d, invested more than we probably should have, chased pumps, and panic dumped. We are here now though, and the winds are shifting. Will Bitcoin replace the USD? Probably not, but will it become a legitimate store of wealth for corporate treasuries and wealthy individuals alike? I think yes. All we have to do is watch. The dominos have been set in motion, the fuse lit. The increase in value rapidly approaching. 

Our stumbles along the way should be of no concern, because we are all poised to watch crypto do something great. A decade from now, I for one hope every person currently on this sub looks back to now with nostalgia and just a twinge of longing. Make no mistake, we are in the “good old days” right now, and for this moment, now 3 drinks in, I’m going to cherish it.

gtmtwt3,1supercooldude,11,"Use Gemini. It's the cheapest for fees and withdrawals. (I've spent a lot of time researching this) 

If u want ur coins secured get a physical wallet such as ledger or trezor. I think most major exchanges are secure, but there is that always 1% chance. (I am in the cyber security field).

Gemini has lending on stablecoins such as DAI. DAI is practically backed 1:1 to USD. I converted much of what my bank has into DAI and have it earning interest. Gemini will give you 7.4% APY. I personally use Celcius which gives me 10.51%. MUCH BETTER than the 0.15% APY my savings account gives me. 

The rest I invested into crypto I trust. **Please read their whitepapers** before investing. Know what you're getting yourself into and if you can see a future of the crypto. I personally like projects such as ADA, BCH, ETC, BAT. 

I invest lum sums to get it over with. I check charts and will plan my entry and it might take a week or a month to get there. I'll DCA if I get more money. 

Only advice is to keep all ur secret keys and passwords on paper. Never share with anyone. Never upload to you Icloud with a screenshot. And never tell how people how much $ you have in crypto! These are basic rules in crypto. 

Also, have a plan. Do you need an exit plan in case things go down? How much are you willing to lose? Do you plan to hold for 5 years? (If you plan to hold it might be better to buy and delete the app or you will sell out of fear lol)

If you want to research more please do BEFORE investing. There are many apps that do the same, but the ones I mentioned I personally vetted to be safe and secure. You may have different tastes and needs though and prefer another exchange, wallet, etc...

* With 16.7k comments in the daily, nearing its 18k ath, the bull is clearly not at an end yet. Because the daily comments amount predicts it all!
* The market cap settles at 1.88t, which is a hefty 5% drop from the day before. Tears are found aplenty.
* Daddy bitcoin acts like a toddler again and throws a temper tantrum. But being all big and mighty, it actually causes damage.
* ETH crashes all the way down below 2k. Comments of ""when ETH 2k"" have appeared once more.
* BNB dives down to 375. CZ's tears double total of /r/cc tears.
* ADA falls below 1.20. ADA history says that they won't recover above 1.20 anytime soon.
* BCH lost all its momentum and crashed down to 616. Mourning period will start once it moves back up.
* FIL fell below 140 but actually recovered a lot of it and now trying to touch the 160 region again.
* VET held above 10 cents.
* BTT crashed down below 0.8 cents. Which is 0.7 cents above expectations.
* WIN moves down further as well, losing another 15%.
* Tron still sits at rank 5 in total volume.
* AAVE figured being below 350 feels better.
* ATOM lost 20+ area once more. You held on as strongly as you could, fella!
* On Coingecko we see a newcomer at rank 69. FEI. FEI is a new type of stablecoin that I, of course, do not understand. CMC decided not to allow it in the top 100.
* ENJ sees a large increase in mentions as it decided to get up and walk some miles. ENJ holders are very happy.
* Other than ENJ, coins like LTO, MOON, VET, ONE and FUD are mentioned a whole lot. FUD is a coin that always seems to spike hard when the market goes red. I know little about it.
* ENJ, WRX and CEL are the top 100 gainers of the day with 15-12% up. Which is pathetic... but since we're red I guess it's pretty solid. ETC with another 10% gain is one that deserves a mention. Making son ETH proud once more.
* On the loser side we see BTT with 19% as biggest loser. CRO and NEM with 18% follow up closely. Which is pretty solid considering the market is red.
* Looking into the top 500 we see a few huge gainers. At the top of these is Bitcoin Diamond with almost 90% up. NKN with 50% is second and at third spot we have KMD with 43%. Niche mention OGN also rises with 28%. N8V makes another appearance with 250% up and $28 volume.
* On the loser side we see META with 40% down, IGNIS with 36% down and RFR with 35% down.

gtpzmsc,Arghmybrain,17,"Info about dips.

While crypto is a new market, it's really not that different from stock markets. It behaves a little more eratically and at faster speeds, but it's largely the same. As it matures more, you see the lines move more in sync with the stock market as many of the same investors enter both and both are subject to random events happening in the world.

What you can see in the stock market history is that no line ever goes up perfectly straight. You'll find little dips often, a jagged line. This is absolutely 100% normal behavior. No line is smooth, and the more you zoom in, the more you'll see just how jagged it is.

People do largely invest with emotion. Fomo, fud are really big. Momentum is huge in investment. Momentum stops, you will see a dip. The stronger the upwards movement was before that, the stronger the dip will usually be. People take profits, whales sell, there's some fud going on and it goes down until the market stabilizes. The crypto market is currently strongly tied to bitcoin, so bitcoin moving down shakes trust in the market and triggers bot sales. Bitcoin will often be the catalyst for a dip.

Market stabilizes simply by enough people going ""Hey, let's buy some more, I feel it's low enough to increase my holdings!"" and then the market starts moving sideways for some time. 

With enough trust in the market and some newly started momentum, there will be another pump. And that pump too will be followed by some dipping.

Obviously we can't tell when a dip is just a dip or might turn into more, but dips by themselves aren't anything to be concerned about. It's just healthy market movement that is always going to happen. Nothing is ever going to change that. It's really just the market attempting to build support levels and balance itself out strongly.",2021-04-08 04:09:18

With the insane real world adoption VeChain is enjoying and with VeChain being 20+/- on marketcap lists, you can be sure that VeChain has been noticed, researched and is on the lists of some of these world class investment institutions.
5. Vechain is playing out in a similar manner as XRP did in 2017. However, VeChain is doing better. It not only has the attention of world class enterprises, it's also safe to assume they have the attention of world class investment institutions. We're talking about multiple multi-billion dollar behemoths who have a very strong interest in seeing the price grow as much as possible.

I'm not trying to write a book in a comment section, so these are just a few of the reasons that we'll not only see $1.00 this cycle, we will see somewhere around $3.00.

1. When we last saw Zola, he had become an artificial intelligence after uploading his consciousness into a computer network.  Although the computers were destroyed, he could have escaped online.
2. Selby in the comics was a mutant who could speak to computers.  The perfect henchman for a virtual being.
3. The bounty on the heroes for killing Selby was posted online in seconds, which an AI could easily accomplish.  The bounty was offered in Bitcoin - virtual currency, something an AI might easily manipulate and control.
4. The “Power Broker is Watching“ mural in Madripoor contains two sets of eyes.  I have seen Marvel concept art of Zola’s robot shell where it had two faces, the one in the torso and a robot head above it.  I think the big boss battle will be the heroes against Robot Zola.

#####Allow me to explain why.
* I have been following Litecoins decline on the ratio for sometime now, I think all of us ratio traders have. It is easy to look at the charts and see the ratio has been in a long downtrend. Looking at the weekly, you can see it has been on the way down [since Feb - 2018.](https://imgur.com/gallery/gk3ieMZ)

#####So when do we get to the good part?
* [Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga](https://imgur.com/gallery/YHHnZXX)

* USD value is great for people who rely on bitcoin to do all of the heavy lifting for Chikun. But we want to see Chikun spread it's wings and fly on its own. To do that, we need to look at the ratio for help. It feels like every other week we see a spike in the downtrend and that brings a little hope, but it always crashes back down and continues the downtrend. I think we are all asking ourselves the same question every week...

#####When will the ratio recover?! When moon?
* Every week you will see someone say the same thing... 2 weeks. It is almost a meme at this point that in 2 weeks we will see something big happen. Then it never does. 
* [Well....](https://imgur.com/gallery/zA4tqwr)

#####Alright, so why are the next few weeks so important?
* To answer this, we need to take a closer look at the LTC/BTC charts.
* Quick explanation of moving averages: I often use Moving Averages to help find patterns and determine when to buy/sell. A moving average is just what it sounds like, an average of the value over a set period of time (Most commonly 50, 100 and 200). These are based on whatever timeframe you are looking at. If it is the daily chart, then we can see a 50-day moving average line and so on. For the following pictures: Green = 50. Orange = 100. Blue = 200.
* Looking at the daily, it appears that Litecoin has been trying to get above the 200-day moving average (blue line) for quite a long time. [This is the past year of attempts and failures](https://imgur.com/gallery/a6dAjeh)

#####This is not helping, WHEN MOON?!
* What's that old saying? oh yeah, When in doubt ZOOM OUT.
* [Looking at the weekly for the past 2 years,](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mg4dVBi) you can see the downtrend has started to get closer to the 50 week moving average line (green line) but gets pushed back below the 20-week moving average (small white line) after every attempt to break through.
* The 20 week is not a big deal, but the 50 week moving average is a massive resistance line and will be extremely important for the next few weeks.
* While litecoin is still stuck under the 50 week moving average, it might not look bullish because spikes have happened in the past and were rejected. The only difference this week, is the fact that it is going up from the previous week. 

#####The devil is in the details
* Lets take away the moving averages for a moment and see if we can see a pattern/trend line!
* [Do you see it?](https://imgur.com/a/pcEGTG1)
* ...[How about now?](https://imgur.com/a/K7BPvxP)
* This is a weekly resistance line that stretches all the way back to April/June 2019.
* On Nov, 16th 2020, that line was broken and turned into support. 

#####Why this week was so massive
* A quick glance and you can see that litecoin has just had a 2nd green week in a row instead of falling back to the resistance line.
* Normally that isn't significant. But... if we turn off log scale, it makes sense why this week was so massive.
* [Without log scale turned on.](https://imgur.com/a/Av1fLpm)
* Whoa. So that means this week is the first week the resistance was broken.
* Lets turn on the moving averages again and[ see what that tells us.](https://imgur.com/a/tGBE5Ww)
* Now the decline doesn't look that bad, the resistance line has been flipped but not confirmed yet. 
* After confirmation, Litecoin will need to get above the 50 week moving average, this might happen over the next 2-4 weeks. If it does, my opinion is that it will be THE catalyst that brings EVERYONE in on the ratio trade, which will rocket the USD value into the solar system.

#####Conclusion
* Major long term resistance has been broken. The ratio appears to be in the beginning phase of going parabolic. 
* This can still turn upside down. I want to see this week finish strong but more importantly is what happens over the next few weeks.
* If Litecoin can swing low once again (i know it sucks to see, but it is a good thing) and confirm the new support. [Ideally something like this is what I am looking for.](https://imgur.com/a/398Bc4Y). A Break through resistance, swing low to confirm new support, then continue upward and repeat at the 50 week moving average (break, swing low, continue up). That's ideal, but not probable, crypto always surprises.
* IF it happens, it may completely ignore resistance and typical support discovery patterns. You can look at history to see how this could be possible.
* [One last picture](https://imgur.com/a/huISRQN) to demonstrate why this week was so important. A Major support line established way back in March 2017 was touched last week. If Litecoin continued down, it would have broken this support line. But it didn't! It hit the line and bounced really hard. 
* History is not a good indicator, but it sure does rhyme sometimes. The next few weeks will be extremely crucial for medium to long term time frames.

gtyi3wz,100acrewood,15,"I would not be surprised in the least to see Binance come under fire from the SEC for BNB one day. Three reasons ETH has not been seen as a security (so far) is that it was sufficiently decentralized, a non-profit organization created it rather than a for-profit corporation, and is positioned as a utility rather than a security. The first two of those do not apply to Binance. BNB is no different than any Bitcoin fork that was used to raise funding.

Just did a quick research; my inbox has a welcome email dated 13th of March 2013, received from the mother of all crypto train wrecks, a place called MtGox. Anyways, I like to think I've got a pretty good track record since then. Not the lambo kind, but I managed to shave a few life-improving profits off Bitcoin, OMG and others. And of course, in May 2017 I discovered my favorite - Ethereum.

The ETH I sold today I bought in summer 2017 and haven't let go of a single gwei since. It has been a wild ride. The 2018 roller coaster of lambos and gentlemen was fun. The years of depression that followed, when this sub (I mean the other sub) was like a warming campfire with a few desperate outcasts huddled around it, were something else. But I held on. Actually, in March 2019, I had a hunch and decided to double my stack. Naturally I haven't regretted my decision - the last months were awesome!

But now I am taking my profits. It got to a point where I couldn't honestly say ""I don't care if it's gone"" anymore. Also, if ETH goes to 10K now, I'll definitely have daydreams of what could have been, but I won't have regrets. Today, I withdrew 1220% of what I put in four years ago, and I will never be sad about that.

I still believe in ETH. I think it's awesome, and there's loads of catalysts ahead. But things can't only go up. I feel there will be a major correction sooner or later. Not 10%. I mean major. On the other hand I've been saying that about the stock market for years and it hasn't happened yet. So no advice here.

&gt;What's most interesting is how I felt it in my body how I was worried that this would be the start of a 2018-2020 bear-season again. I could really identity the worry and economic plans I had to make for the future, how I would have to start to look for a summer job instead of taking a vacation. My entire strategy towards the future changed as to prepare for the future

guj5v6u,Yodel_And_Hodl_Mode,31,"I've been thinking a lot lately about how the amount hodlers own seems to drop in each cycle - and I'm not talking about newcomers.  I'm talking about long term hodlers.

I posted this in a comment yesterday, but it's worth repeating:

In 2011 (a year before the halving), owning a thousand Bitcoin probably wasn't a big deal. How many 1,000 BTC hodlers from 2011 still had that much in 2013 (a after before the halving)? How many still did the next year?

In 2015 (a year before the halving), owning a hundred Bitcoin probably wasn't a big deal. How many 100 BTC hodlers from 2015 still had that much in 2017 (a after before the halving)? How many still did the next year?

In 2019 (a year before the halving), owning ten Bitcoin wasn't that big of a deal. How many 10 BTC hodlers from 2019 still have that much today? How many still will next year?

This brings me back to a question from a comment below on this page:

&gt; Who is willing to say that we just saw the top of this market?

NOT ME.

Every single day since last November, we've seen idiots calling the top of this rally.  They are the reason they won't own as much BTC during the next rally.  They are their own worst enemy.  The get scared and they sell.  They brag about taking profit, but in reality they're guaranteeing themselves a massive loss going forward.  When Bitcoin hits 100K, 200K, maybe 500K and beyond, they won't be here to celebrate.  Actually, I bet some of them will be here as angry trolls.  I also think some of the bears we see now are people who sold too low and are now bitter.

This is a once in a generation opportunity to be part of something big.  In some ways, it might be fair to say it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Don't eff it up.

Let's be honest, the reason why the bears and scares calling the top of the rally so early is fear.  Pure fear.

For anybody reading this who's scared to death, here's my advice: Move your coins to a hardware wallet, secure your seed phrase. and walk away for four years.  That'll put you one year after the next halving, which will be the next big bull run.  When you come back, your investment will be worth so much more than the top you're mistakenly calling today, and all of the old bears who sold back in the day will be wishing they were you, still sitting on your hodl as Bitcoin soared to new highs only dreamt of during the previous cycle.

No, we having had a new all time high in the last hour.  It does not mean the rally is over.

KEEP CALM    
AND    
HODL ON",2021-04-15 05:57:24

guhv5ul,Revanchist1,25,"Don't chastise anyone for selling. Don't be rude to other folks. Let's keep the community kind and welcoming. 

Today is a big day for crypto as a whole. It is now a trillion+ dollar asset class. And Coinbase is going to launch publicly today being valued at $100 billion. It will be one of the few companies going public that will launch already being profitable. And it will join the world of finance being a relatively big juggernaut. I feel today will mark another big turning point in crypto history. Coinbase going public will further entrench crypto into the world of finance. 

It's amazing how much has changed in ~10 years. To think that Bitcoin would turn from a niche community to a trillion dollar asset is mind boggling. It's honestly shocking to think this much time has passed.

gujwdys,NotInsane_Yet,21,"Yes and no.  

I have no problem investing in oil sands companies.  Our society needs oil to function and if we are not extracting it here we are going to buy more from far worse places like Saudi Arabia.  I also think people overestimate the environmental difference between oil sands and oil extraction in other countries.  We have a lot of environmental and safety regulations that many other countries don't.  

Natural gas is also required and is one of the best ways to reduce our emissions.  Green energy is nowhere near where it needs to be.  We need a solid stable baseline power generation and in most places that means natural gas will be the least carbon intensive option.  Replacing coal plants with natural gas would be a major reduction.  We also require it to heat our homes.  Electric heat is not a realistic option due to how expensive it is and our grid is not built with it in mind.  If we all switched from gas to electric we would have to build more power plants.  

Bitcoin is a 100% waste of resources though. It takes a massive amount of electricity and provides nothing of value.  I have been divesting my portfolio of most Bitcoin companies.  It's hard though due to how profitable they have been the past year.   

I tend to focus less on the environmental aspect of companies and focus more on the human aspect.  I would never invest in anything from China, Saudi Arabia, etc.  The human rights abuses drive me away.",2021-04-15 09:38:32

With its current market valuation of $12.54 Billion, GameStop Corp. 

is set to declare its quarterly results on March 23, 2021. GME 

Stock’s Forward Dividend of 0 and its yield of 0% are making 

investors’ thoughts stronger that it could fall further before the 

company announces its earnings for the current quarter. Analysts 

are in estimates of -$0.68 per share for company’s earnings in the 

current quarter and are expecting its annual EPS growth moving up 

to -$0.98 for 2021 with estimates of that growing to -$0.59 in next 

year. These estimates are suggesting current year growth of -0.54% 

for EPS and -0.4% growth next year.

Analysts watching the company’s growth closely have provided 

estimates for its revenue growth with an average revenue estimate 

of $1.15 Billion. They suggested that in the process company could 

generate revenue of as low as $1Billion which could climb up to 

$1.28 Billion to hit a high. The average estimate is representing 

an increase of 7.3% in sales growth from that of posted by the 

company in the same quarter of last year. In keeping analyst 

consensus estimate with, company is forecasted to be making an 

annual revenue of $5.37 Billion in 2021, which will be +5.5% more 

from revenue generated by the company last year.

In contrast, when we review GME stock’s current outlook then short 

term indicators are assigning it an average of 50% Buy, while 

medium term indicators are categorizing the stock at an average of 

100% Buy. Long term indicators are suggesting an average of 100% 

Buy for it.

According to ratings assigned by 7 analysts at the scale of 1 to 5 

with 1.00 representing a strong buy and 5.00 suggesting a strong 

sell; 2 of them are recommending GameStop Corp. (GME) as a Hold, 

while none are in view that stock is a Buy. Recommendation by None 

analysts for the stock is an Outperform while number of those 

analysts who rated the stock as Underperform is 1, whereas 4 of 

them are considering the stock as a Sell. When taken as whole, 

stock gets a rating of Underweight and that encourages the 

investors to exploit the opportunity and build their stake up in 

the company.

Digging deeper we become aware of the PEG ratio of the GME stock 

which is currently positioned at 0. It further provides that 

stock’s current price level is -13.37% away from its 20-day simple 

moving average and is 10.31% off its SMA50. Its relative strength 

index (RSI) for 14-periods is oscillating at 46.55 while volatility 

remained at 15.71% over the past week which changes to 18.27% when 

measuring it over the past month. Beta is valued at -1.9, while 

measure of average true range or ATR is currently at 34.15. In 

predicting price targets of as low as $3.5 and as high as $175, 

analysts are in agreement on assigning the stock over the next 12 

months average price target of $40.36. Stock’s current price level 

is -97.73% above from estimated low price target while it is 13.58% 

below the estimated high; and even if the GME’s share succeeded to 

reach the median price of $25, then the outlook of -83.77% could 

come to the excitement of the investors.

gur83ri,cascading_disruption,58," The first  time at a conference I got  a question about DOGE, I'll never forget, I  was on a panel with Dan  Larimer and David Johnston and it was being  moderated by Jason King and  it was a mastercoin versus bitshares versus  ethereum panel and at that  time I was still part of the ethereum  project. That was January of  2014. Very long time ago and there was a  joking comment about DOGE  getting smart contracts before us and  conquering the entire world.

**DOGE   has always been for our industry kind of a an inside joke, a pet rock,  a  fun mocking cryptocurrency light-hearted thing and it just always  seems  to be around but it something we, for the most part, have never  taken  seriously recently due to the efforts of Elon Musk principally  and  market manipulation by clever whales DOGE has become stratospheric  and  has become a haven for new entrants into the cryptocurrency space.  Let's  be very clear this is a bubble!** ***The   price of DOGE is not sustainable, it's going to collapse and a massive   amount of retail money is going to be lost very quickly. My belief is   that after that bubble bursts, it will be a catalyst for regulators and   lawmakers to get involved in our industry and hurt the entire  industry.***

It's not a good event and by no means is this sustainable. **You   know when you look at the third generation of cryptocurrencies the   ALGORANDs, the TEZOS, the AVALANCHEs, the CARDANOs, the ETH2... Each of   these projects have large teams, capital and accountability. People  wake  up every single day to try to get the software the protocols and  the  ecosystems to the next level.** They have the aspirations or   reality of use and utility. People use these systems to do interesting   things or promote new business models that we've never seen before.

**DOGE   does not have a stable development team, there is no original   technology in DOGE, it's a copy of bitcoin. If at two o'clock in the   morning a major flaw is discovered there will be no one who's up late at   night trying to find a way to fix it. Maybe a volunteer but no   guarantee. It is a pet rock, it's not real and if this is the gateway   for retail investors to enter our ecosystem at massive losses, at some   point it's going to hurt each and every one of us.** ***After   the bubble burst, because it will, there's going to be congressional   inquiries, there's going to be senate hearings, there's going to be SEC   running around, there's going to be all kinds of regulators running   around saying this is proof that crypto can't control itself.***

We   need to come in and save you and you're not going to like the outcome   and the people leading the third generation were the ones who are going   to have to clean up the mess and endure the consequences of the coming   regulation as a result of the bubble bursting. **It's   a mockery of my life's work, it's a mockery of the hard work and  effort  that so many people put into this industry. In space there is an   enormous difference between the TEZOS and the ALOGORANDs and the   AVALANCHEs and the CARDANOs and DOGE.**

The   science alone, the papers alone, the code alone, there's nothing  that's  a copy. It's all novel and original and people put so much  effort and  work into it and to have this surge be what defines our  industry and the  perception of our industry where does that lead? ***So,   I know a lot of people are celebrating on that side of the aisle and   they think this is just the best thing ever and Elon Musk continues to   post and post and post and really seems to enjoy doing this but what   goes up will come down and our industry is going to be worse for it.***

**So,   my warning to anybody who will listen is don't buy DOGE! Get out of   DOGE! If you've made money, great, get the hell out of it! It's a   bubble, it's not real, there's nothing sustainable there and to the   industry as a whole stand up to this behavior, this manipulation, we   have grown beyond this. If we continue doing these things we will be   regulated to a point where we no longer have freedom in autonomy and   we're no better than the banks!**

You'll   have to get a crypto charter just like you get a bank charter. It'll  be  an invitation only club and controlled by the top down and any  freedom  that we have managed to pull back from the legacy financial  system will  be lost because of our stupidity and avarice. It has to  stop and it's  getting too big!

**45   billion, 50 billion, what happens when it gets to 100 billion? To 200   billion? These numbers bring lawmakers in, these numbers bring   international regulation in, it has to stop and it's not!**

**No   one seems to be calling it out and saying hey let's slow this down,  hey  industry be careful, there's no substance behind what's happening  here,  it is what it is. I guess the caravan moves on** and the work continues and **I'll   be here tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after   even if there are hard days even if we get yelled at, even if we have  to  somehow deal with new regulations even, if we have to deal with bad   perceptions of the industry going into yet another crypto winter.**

**We   endured a few before, we'll endure another again. I'm just sad and   sorry for all people that are going to lose money and I'm sad and sorry   for all the people in our industry that are delighting from this event   knowing full well what it's going to do.** Until next time, talk to you guys later...",2021-04-17 03:51:41
gurrp7e,yomjoseki,56,"Market cap is simply the market price of a given currency multiplied by it's circulating supply.

Let's say there's one million theory coins in supply and they're each selling for $1,000. That's a market cap of $1 billion.

Now, apply the same to Bitcoin. There's 18,684,468 BTC in supply and they're going for $62,232 on the market at time of this post. That's how we get the current market cap for Bitcoin, which is $1.16 trillion.

Except, $1.16 trillion hasn't been spent on Bitcoin. First of all, every single one of those Bitcoins has been mined. They were created by processing power and electricity.

Now, of all the Bitcoins in existence, some never changed hands from the time they were mined. Some were bought a long time ago (when the market price was much, much cheaper) and have been held ever since.

In fact, hardly any of the Bitcoin in existence has been purchased at current market rates. Market cap is simply a semi-useful way to measure the gravity of a currency.",2021-04-17 06:20:13

 As a currency, Bitcoin is currently still immature - transactions are expensive. It's environmentally wasteful. Most of all, the value is insanely volatile. These are not tenants of a useful currency, generally. What if you sold your house for crypto and then it plummeted by 30% the next day?

gur39ap,tigerslices,31,"i'd start with supply/demand as the number 1 baseline rule of all economics.  


and how digital items for the longest time had a supply issue.  if you could make infinite copies of MP3s and AVIs and MOVs why would anyone EVER pay for a digital game, digital music, digital movies, etc...  


how only in-game purchases of character costume skins made sense as those couldn't be duplicated and shared.  so, restricted supply to match consumer demand.  


and then explaining that netflix blocking certain screen-capture technologies while also being cheap and easier to navigate than torrest and free-stream sites meant meant that they could continue to restrict supply while serving demand.  


that all of this restricted digital access means an ""always connected"" centralized digital network.  you don't Own this stuff you're simply renting access to it.  like how a photoshop license went from buying the software outright, to paying a cheaper monthly subscription.  


then i'd explain that bitcoin is a program that simply attempts to solve equations.  and that there are a finite amount of equations.  solving complex equations is called mining, and once you've solved the equation, THAT equation is assigned a hash that reflects it's code.  each hash, when checked can be verified by any computer running the bitcoin algorithm to double check the math.  


the finite amount of equations is where our fascination with the technology grows, because if this is like saying, ""catch all the pokemon, even the ugly and lame ones... there will never be any other pokemon... ever.""  the scarcity lowers supply.  and so any demand for it will be bottlenecked by the supply.  part of this is appealing, driving demand more.  and the reason for the rise in value is because on a long enough timeline - there will one day no longer be new bitcoin.  


then explain that doge was created as a joke - a much more simple algorithm.  enough to solve the equation but not any type of equation that actually has limits.  it's an infinite number of equations.  so ... on a long enough timeline, we'll have an infinite amount of doge mined... so unless demand stays at infinite levels, the value WILL collapse.",2021-04-17 03:15:30

guqpewr,palebluepixel313,24,"Answer: The short answer is no one knows why this is happening. There are some factors people can point to:

* Crypto in general has been on a huge upswing lately as more big companies and investment firms buy into it. Bitcoin is up 800% for the year and Etherium 1400%. Large firms may be buying into dogecoin and not disclosing it yet. 
* Elon tweeted about it recently. But he tweets about it all the time and it hasn’t spike liked this every time. 
* Dogecoin has risen enough that it’s gotten mainstream media attention. The subreddit r/dogecoin has lots of pictures of doge being talked about alongside established coins like bitcoin and etherium. Retail investors (people who are not part of a major firm, just have a little money and invest through a brokerage, such as people who use robinhood) can see that it’s spiking and might think they can get in on the action. That leads to more media attention which means more people see it which means more people but in which... 

We can say for sure is that it’s not the wallstreetbets crowd because they aren’t allowed to talk about crypto on that subreddit. There’s one quarantined thread where they can even mention doge and they only created that thread AFTER this spike started happening. 

Here’s some data point we do know:
* The volume of trades in dogecoin is massively up too. That means it’s a LOT of coin being moved around. Which in turn means it’s probably not just a few people trading at a high price while everyone else hodls. But this could in theory be a few large holders trading back and forth at higher prices (at a loss) to try to ladder up the price before they dump all their holdings. 
* There is a single dogecoin holder who owns 25% of all dogecoin. You can see that here, all transactions on a blockchain are public so you can see who owns what (though it’s all anonymous wallet addresses): https://clankapp.com/dogecoin (click Richlist). People suspect this is Robinhood storing all the doge their users have bought in one single giant wallet. If that’s true (robinhood hasn’t confirmed this, but the community is almost positive it’s true) then robinhood traders make up about a quarter of what’s going on here. So it’s bigger than just robinhood users, though they certainly are a substantial part. 
* There are a number of large dogecoin holders who are holding and moving hundreds of millions of dollars in dogecoin. That suggests large institutional investors to me - but I don’t have any hard evidence to back that up.",2021-04-17 01:35:15

&gt;Honestly out of everything in crypto I think Ethereum is the least bubblish.

&gt;Ethereum has actual utility: the network is basically a huge decentralized computer snd you pay in Eth for clock cycles when you interact with applications in it.

Even people who invest in the S&amp;P 500, which is extremely lower risk than investing in crypto, are in it for the long haul. 

We're in a bull run right now, and almost everything is trending upwards. People get over confident and start investing much more than they're willing to lose. If we keep going up and people are able to take out their investments and some more, then great. But sometimes that doesn't happen.

guxhh73,JayCeye,20,"Read this if you’re scared about the “unlimited supply” of Doge. Doge is in the best position to be the peer 2 peer and business payment system for the world.  Doge is fundamentally the same as Bitcoin and litecoin, with fast transfer speeds and very little fees compared to other cryptos and is already being used in so many businesses. Theres an annual cap of 5b mineable coins. If you think of crypto being used for world transactions - that’s over tens of trillions of dollars a day - billions of coins is not enough to handle that load. For a crypto to handle that much transactions, you would need over a trillion coins and based on Doge’s 5 billion supply cap per year, it would take 174 years for Doge to get to that amount. So Doge’s “unlimited supply” will never affect anyone and the claim that the supply amount hurts the value of the coin is FALSE. Dont believe these people who cry that it has unlimited supply and you’re buying a coin with no value.

gv0w1vi,100acrewood,31,"Well, I did it. I sold all of my BTC for ETH except a very small amount. It is bittersweet because Bitcoin started my crypto adventure in 2013 and I don't think I've had a rush like I did when I read the whitepaper and grasped the potential of it. It also lead me to ETH which changed my life. After the 2017 debacle with block sizes and stagnating BTC, moving to a ""store of value"" instead of currency, I lost a lot of faith in BTC. But it still had a special place in my heart.

Now that ETH has matured into the defi industry it is today I decided it is time to move on. The final icing on the cake was seeing the whole 40% hashrate drop when China shut down some of its power. That is horrifying to me for any one country to have that amount of hashrate. Also at first the whole ""BTC uses too much power and hurts the environment"" was a red herring to me but after more reflection I've come to realize that I agree that it isn't necessary when we have Proof of Stake available. So I had to confront my own cognitive dissonance of ""ETH is the one true coin"" and ""better hold BTC just in case"". Not that I'm a maxi by any means, but my personal ideology aligns with Ethereum and BTC doesn't have a place for me anymore.

The upcoming releases and scaling in ETH is probably the most excited I've been about the space since that first day I read the BTC whitepaper. It is really happening, and whether the irrational market aligns the price this cycle or not, I will wait as long as I have to in order to see ETH become the financial backbone of humanity.

This also means I may moan about the ratio in days to come. Sorry in advance.

In the case of Bitcoin, from what I understand, the blockchain was designed for the purpose of the cryptocurrency itself. However in the case of the VeChain Thor blockchain, it was designed as a service for logistics in supply chains. If that is the case what is the purpose of VET and VTHO. I understand that VTHO is used to fuel the blockchain from the perspective of people who actually want to use the blockchain. Like BMW for its supply chain logistics. So what is the purpose of VET. I guess I don’t understand that if VeChain Thor is for services and not strictly for Crypto. Why does it have its own duel coin system if businesses could pay FIAT currency for the services just like any other service that isn’t blockchain based?

Also. Etherium. VeChainThor. These all have coins with within their own ecosystems. Like VET VTHO OCE SHA etc. 

So what is the term of the ‘parent’ that gives life to all of these coins. Is it blockchain? Protocol? Platform? Architecture? Etc. 

Does Bitcoin have any other coins within its ecosystem?

With DLT, who exactly is doing the computations that’s fueling the blockchain? In the case of VeChain, who is it then? Is it the node holders, or the people ‘mining’? If not the node holders then what’s the purpose of holding nodes, if not to just gain rewards?

The question should be ""is Bitcoin likely to have a better ROI than other things I can invest in""?

gv83zg8,JayCeye,30,"Read this if you need to know why Doge is the most talked about investment in the ENTIRE world right now and why Elon Musk supports Doge and why Mark Cuban said he will never sell ANY Dogecoins. Doge is in the best position to be the peer 2 peer and business payment system for the world.  Doge is fundamentally the same as Bitcoin and litecoin, with fast transfer speeds and very little fees compared to other cryptos and is already being used in many businesses. Theres an annual supply cap of 5b mineable coins. If you think of crypto being used for world transactions - that’s over tens of trillions of dollars a day - billions of coins is not enough to handle that load. For a crypto to handle that much transactions, you would need over a trillion coins and based on Dogecoins 192b supply and 5 billion supply cap per year, it would take 174 years for Doge to get to that amount. Doge supply can’t increase fast enough to even get anywhere NEAR being over supplied. We’re talking nearly 900 years for Doge to be at a supply that equals what the US gets in taxes alone for only 1year!!! So Doge’s “unlimited supply” claim will never affect anyone and the claim that the supply amount hurts the value of the coin is FALSE.

gv994gs,DarkDrai,28,"Doge's increase in the supply of coins effectively slows over time, because the number of coins added is fixed, therefore adding a slightly lower percentage to the total number of coins each time more coins are added. This creates a soft cap on the supply of Doge, as opposed to the hard cap on Bitcoin, etc.

This is just my own personal speculation, but I think maybe hard-capped cryptos are easier for large financial institutions to monopolize because it's easier for them to buy more of the crypto early, and then abuse their larger supply to manipulate the price of it later. Doge, on the other hand, does not have this same drawback, and can always be mined for more coins. It is the coin of the people.

Again, this is my dumb, uneducated theory of how this works. I could be completely wrong about all of it. Hopefully someone else can provide better answers. :P",2021-04-21 07:14:26

gvg7r6n,StickyRedPostit,146,"1) Everyone who uses it agrees it has a value in ""real money"". This is the same of every currency - a dollar has value because we all agree that it does. Imagine you want to buy a chicken, but all you have is wool from the sheep you own. The person selling chickens doesn't want wool, but he does want his axe sharpened. The axe sharpener will accept wool for sharpening the chicken person's axe. 

Money just shortcuts the whole barter process, and because everyone agrees that $1 has a set value, we can buy and sell things without a huge chain of bartering.

Bitcoin (and other cryptos) have value because enough people say they do, but unlike other currency, there isn't a government-supported central bank messing with the value of it, allowing us to separate our money from governments.

2) Every transaction on a blockchain is recorded by every other user on the blockchain. Imagine you and your friends go to a bar, and buy each other rounds of drinks. If one friend records who bought what, they have the potential to lie in their record. But, if everyone records everything everyone else buys, then we can compare all the records and ensure they're all correct. Bitcoins are added to this global network of ""ledgers"" when they're created, and every time a transaction is made, all the other ledgers are updated to record this transaction - and if there's a discrepancy, the version of the ledger that's the greatest volume of all of them is the correct one and everyone gets updated.

3) You can't prove you're the owner of the wallet without the ""keys"" that come with it. The wallet contains a private encryption key used to access and edit the blockchain, and that can't be replicated. It's like losing your debit card, except there's no bank to verify that you own the wallet.

4) Yes, someone else is offering to buy a bitcoin for another currency - they give you money, you give them a bitcoin, and it moves to their wallet.

5) It's designed to be very complex so that nobody can cheat it, and one of the problems blockchain is going to face is the obscene energy requirements to keep it running properly - the whole system only works if it's fairly inefficient, and part of that inefficiency is complexity.",2021-04-22 23:52:32

[PNF Chart and Truck Picture](https://imgur.com/a/jcnt0Pk)

The price is obviously in a long column of Os.  We hit a low pole warning last night.  This formation is called a “Bearish Triangle Breakdown.”  It is not a common formation and it is not exactly “bullish” as the name denotes.

That said, the low pole warning should resolve with an eventual move back up the column at least 50%.  This would be an 8 box move from the bottom.  Wherever that is…

The lowest box right now is down at 47,955.

Local support, coming up from the January lows, is currently at 44,284.  I don’t expect a drop that that point today, but its there.  And there isn’t much between where we are now, and that point.  So, include this possibility in your plans.

It appears were are right back to where we were before /Elon started his bullshit.  I hope he keeps focused on Dogecoin, and leaves Bitcoin alone.  Keep in mind, that in the grand scheme of things the price fell back about 3 months.  That isn’t exactly the end of the world—or the bull market.

I watch the TV now and laugh at the commentators telling the stupid people how “Bitcoin is dead” again.  90% of these people have no idea what crypto is or how it works.   Even the newest of crypto buyers have a better sense of this than the broadcasters.

Keep in mind that during this “trend cycle” we are still up 196%—and the trend line is at $22,000.  We are far from ending this cycle.

gvkbgo3,bugz1234,49,"The writing has been written on the walls since 2017. The futures market is now the primary driver of the BTC price and soon to be the entire crypto market. In the early, early days we used to talk about whales. Individuals who could push the market with a literal million USD. Those days are loooong gone. We all wanted adoption. The issue was no one could define what that meant. We had 6-7 years of trying to decide if BTC was a currency. We now know it most certainly is not. We now know it is a store of value. The entire narrative of BTC being able to replace or at least disrupt the legacy financial system was the goal. The legacy financial system now owns Bitcoin. The party is over. Organic growth and adoption is impossible. The price of bitcoin has been controlled via the futures market since its inception in 2017. They said they'd do it, they did it and it is only getting more controlled as time goes on. Now that larger banks and investment firms have sunk their teeth into the asset, it is certain that they control and manipulate the price of BTC as they do the stock market. 

My hope is that people truly start to understand this now and maybe for the first time in history, retail will be able to drop something on the heads of wall street. Bitcoin only has value because regular folks brought it there. We wanted it because we wanted to fight the financial system with another financial system. Now that banks own it. Regular folks can unload on the banks and turn interest to something else. The truth is, the banks bought themselves out of obsolescence and it is due to the fact that we asked them to do it so we could get rich. In the same way that gold and silver prices are artificially manufactured, so is BTC and with the control the price and media (like the reg stock market) you control sentiment. Bitcoin once was an alternative. Now it is an alternative controlled by those we were trying to escape from. So it is no longer an alternative. Bitcoin is now a collectible with 21 million units.

Many existing tradespeople were grandfathered in (the term ‘grandfathered’ owes its etymology to voting rights, where a voter’s right to cast a ballot was tied to whether or not their grandfather had been able to vote, which disenfranchised poor non-blacks, but of course was a Jim Crow tool for disenfranchisement of blacks, which brings me back around to my favorite modern truth: that *the struggle* is truly along class lines and the disparate sets of historical suffrage groups, regardless of race, orientation, religion or gender, have more in common, and would do better to, UNITE against the masters, as of now we’re still being played via the oldest move in the play-book: divide and conquer).

Whereby, if a person already cut hair or even already sold insurance, for example, for a certain span of time, they were exempt from any further vetting requirements such as pre-requisite certifications or continuing education classes thrust upon anyone new trying to enter the space. -Always billed as quality control in pursuit of protecting ethical standards and health and safety and never as just plain old moat building and classism. This is not to suggest that racism was not also part and parcel to the scheme - - it was likely seen as a feature and not a bug - - but that instead, self interest and war against the lower class (in a two-class system nested in the US) was the primary goal. 

After all, black cosmetologists did not (and largely still do not) compete for customers with non-blacks; the cultural touch stone that is encompassed by black hair is such that black beauticians were never going to take a customer from, say, a white barber, but rather they might still enrich themselves from within their own communities. 

Famously (but perhaps not actually) the first US black woman millionaire, Madam C.J. Walker, Née Breedlove, made her fortune in the black hair care and beauty products space, including skin-bleaching kits - - added here to touch on how truly body dysmorphic our culture was/is - - capitalizing on a market heretofore occupied by white owned corporations.

All that to remind you that we’re all just patsies for the ruling class. One moment it’s blacks taking advantage of government assistance, the next it’s white nationalists taking the bait and blaming the scapegoat instead of the beneficiary of the system, both groups historically and presently disenfranchised, all just feed stock for the vampires - - figuratively, i hope - - of our debt and fiat currency system.

bitcoin is not a company. It's the name we astronomers gave to our ""star trading system"". there is no single astronomer behind it, and in the case of bitcoin, even the first astronomer that came up with the idea ""vanished"" (even if they came back now, they have no special privilege, besides whatever coins they might have, like anyone else, they don't have any sort of ""admin password"").

Crypto companies, are companies, websites, etc that mainly deal with crypto stuff. The same way Amazon was a books company. They don't need to be miners or have computational power at all.

Miners are the ones with the computational power. They spend it on looking for a solution to an equation, the same way astronomers use their telescopes to find stars.

Computational power from miners is not being sold, it's being spent. The way a power plant spends coal to make electricity. They don't sell coal, and no one is buying computational power. What you do buy is the end product, the security of the bitcoin system or the electricity the power plant produces.

If I misunderstood, and you where asking ""Are miners turning their computational power into money?"" then the answer is yes! But not by selling it as you would rent a supercomputer to calculate medical stuff to cure cancer, find UFOs or predict the weather.

So stop thinking about how many bitcoins you have, and stop thinking about how many dollars you could swap them for, because both are arbitrary meaningless numbers.

Think about how many loaves of bread you could swap your currency for. If your bitcoins buy you more loaves than they did yesterday, you got richer. If they buy less loaves of bread than they did yesterday, you got poorer.

Fact of the matter is, whether you like it or not, dollars are more stable when compared to bread than bitcoin is. If the dollar value of your bitcoin goes down, then so does the number of loaves you can buy with it.

In other words, all us hodlers have gotten poorer over the last week. To deny it and say ‘1BTC = 1BTC’ is to demonstrate that you don’t understand currency.

We continue to hodl not because we love having possession of cryptographic keys that give us ownership of UTXOs that we are fond of, but because we believe that in the long run, either our coins will buy more bread than they do now, OR because we believe in the other benefits of decentralised currency and are willing to become poorer in return for those benefits.",2021-04-23 17:47:51

gvoexcs,wanderingdatageeks,39,"**Analysis:**

Over $55mil in long liquidations over the last 4 hours. Most likely causing the dip down to $48k. Not as much as we've seen yesterday, but still a fairly significant amount of liquidations.

Funding Rates for longs still look high across exchanges on bybt, so I wouldn't be surprised if we saw some more liquidations if we get some sideways action or don't make a move up. But, on glassnode aggregated perpetual funding rates were actually negative. 

Exchange Balance actually ticked up yesterday. I'm seeing roughly 3k more bitcoin on exchanges which is signaling more downside.

Hash Rate and Mining Difficulty look unchanged from yesterday. 

On the bullish side of things, 2.37B USDT was deposited across the exchanges yesterday, second only to the Tesla announcement day... take that as you will. 

The daily looks very similar to the Feb 27/28th. Yesterday's doji star on the daily signals a reversal is in play (27th) and now seeing one last flush before a strong move to the upside (28th -2%)

I think we'll see some downside movement today as we continue to flush through overleveraged longs. But, couple days I just see a big breakout to upside

&amp;#x200B;

**My Soapbox:**

Price drops are really strongly correlated to longs getting liquidated, which happens en masse on the exchanges. 

Millions of Dollars worth of BTC will suddenly flood order books within minutes which forces the price down. As soon as liquidations subside price moves up. The biggest detriment to this market is liquidations on margin.",2021-04-24 20:38:09

gvkscn5,Shnatsel,36,"I'll speak from some experience with distributed systems, mostly DHT-based, and then following the blockchain in its early days. My perspective might be a bit dated.

Blockchain is all about removing trust in a central party. So if whatever central party you're currently relying on for money/bookkeeping/etc is doing its job well, you probably don't need it. It's relegated to uses where such institutions are dysfunctional (e.g. governmental money is hyperinflating) or it's impossible to have a trusted central party (anyone acting as one will be promptly banned by the Great Firewall).

In my city you can actually go and buy a burger for bitcoin, but the transaction fee will cost more than the burger, and the payment will take longer to come through than it takes to cook the burger. Using literally any other payment option is better. 

But Bitcoin sort of works for evading mass surveillance in a country that monitors all financial transactions, e.g. to buy a VPN, which is an important use case. You don't particularly care about fees or latency in this scenario.

Twister (the p2p Twitter alternative) uses a blockchain for user registrations, with the rest of the system being DHT-based. That's how it manages to consistently work in China despite numerous attempts to ban it. That's one of the very few actually useful application of blockchain that I'm aware of.

Namecoin is a great idea that could solve very real issues with DNS and certificate authorities, dramatically improving the security of HTTPS, but it's held back by the lack of support for subdomains and thin clients.

On the other hand, I have never seen an ""enterprise blockchain"" project with a reasonable value proposition, and the very premise sounds incongruous.

Personally I tend to avoid blockchain-related projects. I believe there's quite enough people working on that stuff already, and I'm better off investing my time in something that's currently understaffed.",2021-04-24 00:37:27

gvn5g3j,Nagosh,30,"Bold prediction time: never under 47k again.

This thread is easily the most bearish this sub has been in months, possibly years. Probably the covid crash would top this but that's about it. Almost 1 in every 3 posts I read is wondering if this bull run is over. And while I think a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted, I  think the current amount of bearishness isn't.

For one, it is completely normal for bitcoin to range for a long while. It took 3 months for bitcoin to break through 3k in 2017. It's only been 2 months from when we first broke 50k. We could still be in this range for another month before breaking out.

And even if that was the top, this should imply that the bear market would be equally as tame. I doubt we would ever go below 30k.

But some evidence to point toward our recent low of 47k being the bottom. Yesterday was one of the highest long liquidation events this year. You could argue that it doesn't indicate *the* bottom. Like in late Feb, it took 6 days after a big liquidation before finding a bottom. However, 5 days ago we did have that insane 4B+ liquidation event. IMO, that combined with today's purge has flushed out all high leveraged positions. 

Spot has also had a huge increase in volume. Yesterday had the 8th largest volume YTD on coinbase, and 5 days ago was the 6th. This shows there is massive bid support; combined with the info that bitcoin is still leaving exchange addresses implies that this bitcoin is being bought and removed from circulation. 

Funding is low or even negative on some exchanges. This will also help buoy the price, preventing another leg down. And OI has continued to decline throughout this push down. 

tl;dr - this move down was caused by panic selling and long liquidations. Spot markets have stepped up to the plate and bought the panic sellers. I don't think we make another low. We could consolidate for another month before making a new ATH, but I also wouldn't be surprised if we make a new ATH within 10 days.",2021-04-24 12:07:01

gvr8x17,-0-O-,43,"&gt;This is NOT discussed enough about the actual blockchain technology behind cardano.

Oh boy, here we go.

&gt;We all know Eth is a gen 2 that can't scale.

No, we don't all know that. Nobody knows whether or not that is the case, and Eth2 is moving towards the same features that are native in Cardano. 

&gt;Hence BSC binance has swooped in and basically copied their network and made some changes but it is Centralized. The whale wallets make up 88% of all BSC.

&gt;It's nothing revolutionary and basically is a centralized blockchain that is copying all ETH projects to provide lower fees.

Totally agree here. BSC is a copy of ETH, with more centralization. 

&gt;As for Cardano what is not talked about enough and simply not understood by 95% of crypto investors is that Cardano has a layered architecture! The CLS and CCL. Cardano Settlement Layer and Cardano Computational Layer. These 2x layers are Unique to Cardano which allows a full framework which is unlike the blockchains of Ethereum and BSC which use a single layer.

Ethereum also has two layers. Here's an [old article](https://cia.news/en/ethereum-founder-proposes-to-integrate-ethereum-and-bitcoin-cash/) where Buterin talks about how the current data layer is scalable, but the computational layer is not, and discusses what will be different in ETH2 to scale the computational layer.

&gt;Cardano is fully Decentralized and Has Full governance system built in, so literally govts, fortune 500s, can have full control or it can run as a DAO. It's so versatile and it's fully scaleable. With advent of Hydra we are talking over 1,000,000 tps. But that's another topic for another day.

Cardano governance does not mean that governments and fortune 500s can have full control. It means that the entirety of the network has full control. Any DAO governance is built into smart contracts, and is separate from Cardano governance. You're conflating the two things, unless you're talking about private chains that use Ouroboros, but are not the public ADA chain. In which case, that really has no bearing on ADA. 

&gt;What you and all investors need to understand about blockchain technology is that Cardano is built.from ground up with academic papers and it's built Securely using Haskell. Which is what banks use. So there not hacked. Plutus smart contracts is built with Haskell language.

Building with Haskell does not make something unhackable. It is a more secure language, and it will eliminate *some* of the dapp hacks we've seen on ETH, but a vast majority of exploits have not been due to unexpected code execution, but instead poorly developed dapps to begin with. This will still 100% be possible when coding in Plutus. It's still 100% possible that Cardano itself has exploits. Haskell is not a magic wand.

&gt;The layered architecture Cardano uses is Gen 3.0 blockchain technology. The settlement Layer is where p2p transactions happen. The CCL is where smart.contracts happen and where computations are done. This layered architecture is completely different than Ethereum which has a single layer which causes it to bottleneck and crazy high gas fees.

Already covered, and this isn't entirely correct.

&gt;Cardano architecture is built to allow regulatory compliance! But also can be used for privacy as while. The use of meta data and the 2x layer architecture is game changing. With the advent of Hydra and full scalability, Cardano has the versatility to do whatever is needed.

Misleading at best. These are things included in the roadmap, not things that are built into the core architecture at this time. From the wording on the roadmap, it appears this will be in the form of official smart-contract DAOs that can be tied into other smart contracts to enable compliance. The same thing can be done on any turing-complete smart-contract capable chain, and in fact you don't have to look hard to see other projects discussing this same sort of thing.

&gt;ZKP. Zero knowledge Proofs. Along with other methods can ensure data stays encrypted and private for fortune 500s but at same time Cardano architecture allows it versatility.

Zk is again, already in use on other chains.

&gt;Also it's interoperability with side chains, it's scalability with hydra, and it's dual layered architecture Cardano will make it a next level blockchain that can revolutionize many Industries and governments. The sky is truly the limit.

So, ""also the things that I've already listed, but never went into detail about, or offered a fair comparison to other chains with similar items on their roadmap""

------

Look, I'm bullish on Cardano, but you've written a whole lot of nothing here. You mention all of these things from the roadmap, and from Charles' speeches, but you titled your post ""The Truth Why Cardano Is Next Gen Compared To Others."", and then you fail to meaningfully compare any other blockchains. I would say the only fair comparison is that haskell is a more secure choice over other languages. The rest is misleading at best, and flat out wrong at worst.",2021-04-25 07:22:03

Exchange inflows in USDT and BTC indicate people buying the dip AND possibly posting more collateral to cover trapped long positions. Funding is staying neutral showing traders are hesitant and not quite ready to long this yet, and open interest is dropping sharply (possibly due to the high volume liquidations we've gotten the past few days).

Either this is the end of the bull run or it’s not.

And if it’s not then there is a very good chance our (and BTC and many crypto’s) trend is following Elliott Wave Theory.

And if that’s the case then we are in wave 4, a correction and consolidation wave.  And when wave 4 is over, wave 5 will likely be wild.

My comment yesterday:

This video was posted earlier of some TA on VET:

https://youtu.be/Zh9fuixMXeM


Obviously none of this is guaranteed, but he believes VET has been following Elliot Wave Theory over the past year.
And the charts show that it has been following this pattern for the first 3 waves and looks like we are now in wave 4.
Not to say that it will hold and continue into wave 5.

Article about the theory, if your interested:
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elliottwavetheory.asp

According to his TA, we are now entering wave 4, a downward correction wave (for the next few weeks or so), before it goes into wave 5 which is the final wave up.
He has wave 5 targeted to peak in July/August at around $1.50.

Again, obviously he could be wrong about timelines/prices or the whole thing, it is just his analysis and he can't predict the future he can only analyze what he thinks may happen.
It could do something totally different and not follow that wave pattern in the future.

But the thing that really piqued my interest after digesting the video was looking at the Bitcoin 1 year (and Log) chart.

It looks like Bitcoin is following the same wave pattern over the last year, but with VET gaining major sats on the wave 3 up.

It will be interesting to see if we consolidate and/or drop a bit over the next 2-4 weeks and then take a turn up.

If we do, and he is right, wave 5 might be a wild ride up.

[https://imgur.com/a/7OeMAfD](https://imgur.com/a/7OeMAfD)

The bitcoin price moved up overnight, reversing into a column of Xs, breaking out, AND creating a high pole warning.

I should remind folks that the high and low poles do not usually happen in consecutive days.  This type of volatility is unusual—even for bitcoin.

Yet, here we are.

The price targets for this break out are between $52,448 (based on width of the formation) and $57,361 based on the last breakout, which was 15 boxes.  These targets are to be expected in the next 10-14 days.  Although with the speed of price action these past few days it might be sooner.

A break down would occur if the price reversed today down to $48,919.  That does no seem likely. 

Our local resistance level is 55,122.  This resistance is coming down from the 4/21 high.

Our local support is $49,408.  This is coming up from 4/23.

The High Pole Reversal target is at $51,414.  That does not necessarily mean an end to this formation—it just means that a pull back after such an energetic move upwards should be expected.

The current trend line point is $22,964.  At this time I write this, we are about $30,700 above this price.  The trend seems to be very intact.",2021-04-26 23:54:14
gvvtl1u,SanityInAnarchy,29,"&gt; ...the money your praising...

Did I praise something?

&gt; ...faker than most cryptos. Once people stop believing...

...no, that part is true of *all* money. Congratulations, you've stumbled on the core concept of money: The value it has is very nearly entirely related to what it can be exchanged for.

But you're wrong about ""most cryptos"" being somehow ""more real"". In fact, the opposite is true: As you point out, everyone believes fiat money has value -- my landlord doesn't take Bitcoin, the grocery store doesn't take Monero, I can't pay my taxes with Etherium, no one will fill (or charge) my car for Dogecoin. 100% of the things I need money for accept US dollars, 0% of them accept crypto.

I guess *very* briefly I could buy video games with crypto... but [not anymore](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16743220/valve-steam-bitcoin-game-store-payment-method-crypto-volatility).

So, hilariously, the only value these crypto""currencies"" have is the fact that people like you will give me actual money in exchange for them. And I bet that's the very first thing these CI-abusing crypto-miners did: Exchange their ill-gotten crypto for fiat money, so they could go actually buy stuff.

&gt; Not to mention the insane amount of money being printed this past year...

[It's not really more than in previous years](https://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/productionannual.html). You're probably thinking of all those stimulus checks, but those didn't literally print money, they *borrowed* it. And it didn't have the effect you think it did:

&gt; ...really destroys the value...

Turns out inflation in 2020 really wasn't significantly worse than other recent years. Deficits aren't *good,* exactly, but this one didn't seem to destroy anything. On the contrary, being able to rapidly pump money into the economy in response to a global crisis like the pandemic is kind of a nice feature for a currency to have, even if we might wish that it wasn't such a centralized power structure.

&gt; ...your piece of paper with some numbers on it has.

Wait, you think this is about digital currency vs physical?

I carry cash for emergencies now, but almost all the money I use is digital. It's just handled by banks and credit card companies, who can do it infinitely more efficiently than blockchains, and can also provide things like fraud protection on top of that -- if my credit card gets stolen, I pay zero of the fraudulent transactions and I get a new credit card. If my cash gets stolen, it's only $20 or whatever.

What happens if your Bitcoin wallet gets stolen?

Of course, you could store all your money in an account with some crypto exchange, instead of in a personal wallet. That's kinda like a bank, only with zero oversight for the next time a Mt Gox happens.",2021-04-26 10:49:56

gvv47vq,Bomba_Claude,25,"There are so many people in this sub that don't seem to understand how incredibly important Bitcoin's simplicity and its first mover advantage are.

Having an ""old"" or very simple core protocol is actually a good thing. It reduces the attack surface of Bitcoin. The more complex the code is, the bigger the chance someone will find a way to manipulate it.

When building a decentralized system, that one day can replace the entire worldwide banking system, you actually want something simple as its base layer. In this case the most important task of the network is to just continue adding blocks to the blockchain. Just very boring: block after block after block. That is what we need. The database that stores all records, the blockchain, is at the very core of what we need: we need a simple robust database that can not be changed. We don't need any fancy stuff in the base layer.

And Bitcoin's first mover advantage has made it so that it's now the most used and tested crypto of them all. White hat hackers, black hat hackers, regular deverlopers, a lot of eyes have gone over the Bitcoin code to search for weaknesses. This is why first mover advantage makes Bitcoin the most tested blockchain available.

I think that there's many newcomers to this space that overlook how important it is to have a simple, robust, trusted and tested blockchain as the backbone of the network. Yes, things like transactions per second and fees and privacy and speed of transactions also matter. And if you're looking to transfer relatively small amounts of value across the world, then you can definitely use other coins. Especially if you are going to convert those coins again to something else like fiat.

But when you are just looking to store a lot of value in a blockchain, wouldn't you choose the most robust blockchain available? This is the reason why big companies are now converting fiat on their balance sheets to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most trustworthy blockchain out there to store value because it's a simple system that works and has the best proven track record.

I probably could have worded this all better, but I hope the message comes across especially to the newcomers. Also, Andreas Antonopoulos has some great talks about this subject as well. I would suggest to listen to what he has to say on this topic as well.",2021-04-26 07:00:39

Master of Coin (tsla CFO) mentioned they sold 10% of position. This means they bought $1.5 billion, then sold 10% when it was worth $2.73 billion or so. Bringing their total cash value at the original cost basis to $1.33 billion (maybe it’s not $1.35 because of fees/slippage/time in and out of market?). I think this explains the reported numbers but I’m not an accountant and public reporting of these assets is complicated. 

This means the current value of their holdings is at least $1.8 billion (probably more tbh) doing some ninja math/guesswork.

The important part is they are committed to using it as a liquid store of value, and keeping customer purchases in Bitcoin as Bitcoin, may accumulate more but are not making any announcements. CFO mentioned that liquidity is super important to them and they were pleased with their experience so far, proving our their original thesis that Bitcoin offers an attractive treasury asset that is still liquid while providing a return for holders.

I think this is pretty cool. Perhaps the 10% sell was the CFO demonstrating that liquidity to the board, and conveniently posting a profit to offset the missed targets this quarter due to “supply chain issues”. My personal view is Elon challenged the CFO on these points, and is trying to “shake the tree” to see if there’s flaws in the thesis. Elon is being potentially adversarial (“maybe Doge and speculation can rock Bitcoin too much”) if only to check it out. This is my blindly hopium interpretation. If Bitcoin continues to prove itself, I expect Tesla to increase their sizing and perhaps integrate it more tightly with their “distributed utility scale” energy generation business, which Elon was super passionate about on the call...

gw58egv,daymonhandz,52,"**This long text will teach newbies about bitcoin and it will also give long time bitcoin veterans many different protocols to look up and research.** This is exciting stuff if you ask me. And no I'm not just some kooky bitcoin maximalist. Some altcoins have merit and a future. Not many of them, but I'm not here to talk about that. Now get comfortable, because this is going to be long. **Just read the bold text if this is too long for you.** The bold text is the summarized version and it contains all of most important information within this long wall of this text.

**Any protocol rule change that doesn't make any previously invalid blocks now valid is called a soft fork.** This would be a miner upgrade and is easier to accomplish, we can give the mining nodes a chance to upgrade, bip9 can be used, or the nodes can just run compatible software.

**All protocol rule changes must be agreed upon by fully validating bitcoin nodes.** Even if the mining nodes don't agree, if the full nodes come to consensus and make a rule change, people will continue to mine as long as it's profitable to mine, so the miners have to deal with it or piss off and other people will mine. The mining difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks regardless. So when it comes down to it, only the users who run fully validating bitcoin nodes are in charge of bitcoin. 

**Fully validating bitcoin nodes must come to consensus on any rule change that makes any previously invalid blocks now valid, and that's called a hard fork.** This would be a pretty big upgrade, and it would be difficult to pull off with bitcoin because it's decentralized. And that's a good thing.

There is a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin**, and that will never change. Satoshi designed the protocol so that **miners solve a block every 10 minutes on average**. The block reward started at 50 BTC. **The block reward gets divided by 2 every 210,000 blocks** (4 years if the hashrate remained constant), which we call the block reward halving. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024. And then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin. **The mining difficulty adjustments every 2016 blocks** which is approximately 2 weeks. So if it's profitable for people to mine, then hardware gets turned on and the mining difficulty increases. But if the price of bitcoin lowers so that some hardware is unprofitable to run, then it gets turned off and the mining difficulty decreases. And as the block reward gets divided by 2 every 210 thousand blocks, the **miner fees will continue to incentivize miners to secure the network even when the block reward is minuscule. 

Many users here like to repeat that the last bitcoin wont be mined until 2140. And while it is true that the last satoshi will not be mined until around 2140. It is also true that **approximately 97% of bitcoins will be mined by 2032**, and the block reward will just be 0.78125 BTC at that time. But if bitcoin is worth, for example, a million dollars, then the block reward alone in 2032 would be worth more than the current block reward + miner fees at this time. That's not even accounting for all of the miner fees that they will also be collecting for the transactions that they include in blocks. 

**Bitcoin protocol rule changes are decentrlized and they require nodes to come to consensus.** Bitcoin development is decentralized and Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that bitcoin is open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, and the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out.

Bitcoin is constantly being developed.  **Bitcoin also has second layer protocols that are constantly being developed and they don't require any consensus.** So anyone can just create second layer protocols for bitcoin and nobody needs to agree on anything. It's up to the users of bitcoin if they want to use various second layer protocols that maximize the user experience. **One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees.** People can use the lightning network to send peer-to-peer bitcoin payments, they can [buy anything online where Visa debit cards are accepted](https://paywithmoon.com/) using the lightning network, or they can [buy gift cards](https://www.bitrefill.com/) for practicality any big store from [more than one reputable business](https://foldapp.com/) all while using the lightning network. [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), [okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/), and [strike app](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that people can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it and [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange will be integrating the lightning network later this year. For newbies wanting to try out the lightning network, I only recommend them to use [Muun](https://muun.com/) wallet. Muun wallet is very user friendly and it allows users to send and receive bitcoin on-chain and using the lightning network, from the same wallet. And Muun wallet has a good mempool-based miner fee estimator. 

**The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol.** Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

**Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency.** This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30%. The block size limit is also supposed to be raised sometime in the future which will increase the amount of on chain transactions per second that can be performed, but that may never actually happen because it requires the nodes to come to consensus. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. **There's also new discreet log contracts, RGB, musig2, coinswap, and various sidechains in development, including liquid network. RGB allows smart contracts to be done using bitcoin. We should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps available this year. Schnorr signatures also allows us to have point time lock contracts. Taproot and schnorr signatures make it so that nobody can tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has even happened by looking at transactions in the blockchain. They also allow massive multi-signature transactions to be scaled down to a much smaller size.  And much more!**

**Money (not fiat currency) always evolves in four stages** (this is from the *what is money?* section of *The Nature and Creation of Money* chapter of a college course on *Principles of Macroeconomics*). **Bitcoin is currently going through the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value.** The next stage is a widely used medium of exchange. Bitcoin may evolve into the third stage in 5 years, in 7 years, in 12 years, or **bitcoin may never evolve passed the second stage**. The final stage of the evolution of money is a unit of account. Bitcoin is also currently going through price discovery. **Bitcoin's true value needs to be found before it will ever be a widely used medium of exchange.** Bitcoin has a second layer payment protocol called the lightning network which also need to be adopted by the users, merchants, and exchanges before bitcoin can ever become a widely used medium of exchange.",2021-04-28 15:36:01

gw39xlw,SwagtimusPrime,46,"The triple Halvening aka the Cliffening is essentially Bitcoin's entire lifespan jam packed into one year.

If we take into account that people are layer 0 and public blockchains follow the will of the people:

Bitcoin's social contract: inflation until 21m coins, 0 experimentation on base layer

Ethereum's social contract: as little inflation (even deflation) as possible as long as the chain is secure, go ham and build cool shit

So after EIP-1559 and the merge, Ethereum and Bitcoin are essentially equal in terms of future supply issuance and Store-of-Value-ness.

Ethereum had a period of higher inflation, however this allowed us to catch so many devs and users by incentivizing them to build on the chain.

What I'm trying to say is: 9-12 months from now, ETH will be just as good a store of value as BTC, in fact it will be better because even under the most conservative assumptions the net issuance will be -0.1% at a minimum, aka deflationary.

However, Ethereum has an absolutely buzzing ecosystem of thousands of dapps and a myriad of usecases beyond just DeFi that we haven't even explored yet, all of them enabled by one fundamental property Bitcoin doesn't have: smart contracts + EVM.

The analogy that helped me understand it is an artist’s signature on a piece of their work. If an artist makes 50 prints of a piece, they’ll sign and number them, and any print that doesn’t have that signature is a copy of one of the 50 originals. Technically, these copies are functionally identical to the originals. If you buy one, you still get to enjoy the art in the exact same way as if you had an original. But the originals are more valuable purely because there’s a limited number of them.

In this analogy, an NFT is basically the artist’s signature, digitized. It’s a big unique mathematical thing that exists to be passed around, and anybody that sees it can look at its history of how it’s changed hands.

The reason that NFTs are kinda dumb is that anybody can see the media associated with them - that’s kinda the whole point of the internet, right? So the only thing that’s valuable about an NFT is scarcity, but since it’s backed by literally nothing, it’s only valuable if people want it, and people only want it if it’s valuable.

I love all of the hype in this thread but I see some people idealizing doge a bit and theorizing unrealistic values for it (if it ever hits 10k that would mean it’s market value would be more than the entire worlds GDP, I’d say we had a bigger problem on our hands if that happened).",2021-04-29 11:58:04

gw9kpp2,chuck_portis,45,"So long as the global crypto market cap keeps going up, it's just a matter of time.  People are just cycling through different alts.  Eventually it finds its way back to BTC and the cycle starts again.  

One noteworthy change each Supercycle is that the alts become more and more advanced each time.  In 2013, the alts were quite honestly pathetic.  LTC, Namecoin, Feathercoin, very early XRP.  Bitcoin Dominance went from near 95% down to the high 80's.

Then 2017 came along and was the real ""coming out"" party for alts.  ETH being the real breakthrough with smart contracts and ERC20 tokens, which led to the ICO Bubble.  This one really had that 1999 tech bubble feel.  People were making altcoins using copy paste technology, desperately trying to make up a use case.  A lot of words, a lot of ""ideas"", very little execution.  Tons of vaporcoins.

Now we have this Supercycle, where the alts are clearly seeing a lot more use cases, largely thanks to DeFi.  Yield farming, collateralized loans, on-chain insurance, synthetic assets, futures and options, NFT's.  All of this stuff is crowding the ETH network and opening doors for other projects to get real utility.  

We are seeing that the multiple blockchains act like multiple highways.  ETH is congested?  People will head over to Binance Smart Chain, MATIC, even Tron.  We are seeing why it's important to have multiple chains.  There are enough transactions to go around at the moment.  This could change if Ethereum really solves the scaling issue, but for the near future, it seems that other blockchains are going to capture increasing volume.

All that to say, it seems as time passes, more and more projects are solving real use cases, and thus we should expect Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD) to ebb and flow, but generally trend downwards.  The good news is, BTCD decreasing is often aligned with Global Crypto Cap increasing.",2021-04-29 14:46:11

gwdihsz,daymonhandz,82,"You're severely misunderstanding things. Bitcoin is just a protocol, much like TCP/IP are just protocols. The bitcoin protocol also has secondary layer protocols that run on top of it. One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees. The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

It's always possible that another cryptocurrency could replace bitcoin, but there's only one altcoin that currently exists that could possibly do that and I really don't see it happening. Another cryptocurrency could be invented and possibly overtake bitcoin one day, but bitcoin is currently the most secure, most decentralized, most valuable, most adopted, and most fairly launched cryptocurrency that is currently in existence, and it also has the biggest infrastructure and the most users. 

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their efereum stack if they [don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s) Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack.

The issuance schedule and maximum supply are both clearly defined and will never change. If you properly handle your private keys then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus. This is vastly different from many altcoins. Some other differences are that bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. Bitcoin is a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Put simply, bitcoin is the hardest money that's ever existed.

Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30%. The block size limit is also supposed to be raised sometime in the future which will increase the amount of on chain transactions per second that can be performed, but that may never actually happen because it requires the nodes to come to consensus. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also new discreet log contracts, RGB, musig2, coinswap, and various sidechains in development, including liquid network. RGB allows smart contracts to be done using bitcoin. We should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps available this year. Schnorr signatures also allows us to have point time lock contracts. Taproot and schnorr signatures make it so that nobody can tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has even happened by looking at transactions in the blockchain. They also allow massive multi-signature transactions to be scaled down to a much smaller size. And much more!",2021-04-30 10:57:34
gwe5p3c,C01n_sh1LL,78,"You said ""the bitcoin is real, I can exchange and purchase with it;"" does that mean it's already in a wallet in your possession?

If you're spending any time in that space, you need to be aware that people will be trying to scam you 24/7. Even if you do everything right on your end, from time to time you will get exit scammed, or otherwise defrauded, by pools and exchanges, even the largest most reputable ones. It's an incredibly hostile space.

Generally speaking if somebody is offering to give you more than a dollar or two worth of cryptocurrency, then it is some sort of scam. They might be trying to get your personal information for identity theft or for further targeting on a ""sucker list"" for scams, or they might be working some digital variation on the classic advance fee scam. But the bottom line is you will be spammed constantly with ""prize notifications"" and they are *pretty much* never real. If one *is* real by some chance, nobody needs any personal information or action on your part to send you currency. They need only a wallet address. This is *very important.*

I think it's great that a young person is interested in this technology and in finance in general. I don't want to discourage you from this. But cryptocurrency, for the foreseeable future, should be treated as gambling, not investing. When you log in to that Discord server, imagine you're walking into the seediest most disreputable casino in town, full of losing gambling addicts and the con artists who prey on them.

My advice would be to discuss your cryptocurrency operations with your parents, at least for anything involving sums of money over a few bucks. They would be correct to suspect this sort of thing as a scam. I think if you show good judgement in keeping them informed about these activities early on when very little money is involved, they will be more trusting and less likely to get mad, compared to, for example, if you were to suddenly need their assistance and a bank account to convert a large sum to USD. Parents tend get nervous at the thought of their children being involved with large sums of money from unknown sources sent for nebulous purposes, so the fewer surprises the better, I think.",2021-04-30 14:42:05

I am aware chess is one of your pass. Lets get directly to the point. Not a single person has compensated me to check about you. You may not know me and you are most likely thinking why are you getting this email?  
Well, i actually placed a malware on the adult videos (pornography) web-site and there's more, you visited this web site to have fun (you know what i mean). When you were watching video clips, your web browser started working as a Remote control Desktop with a key logger which provided me accessibility to your screen and also webcam. after that, my software collected every one of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, as well as e-mail. after that i created a video. 1st part displays the video you were viewing (you have a fine taste rofl), and second part shows the recording of your web cam, and it is u.  
  
You get two different options. Why dont we take a look at the options in details:  
1st alternative is to ignore this e-mail. in such a case, i will send out your very own video clip to all your contacts and then consider concerning the humiliation you will see. and definitely if you are in a romantic relationship, just how it will certainly affect?  
  
Second option would be to compensate me $2600. Let's refer to it as a donation. Then, i most certainly will straightaway erase your video. You could keep daily life like this never happened and you would certainly never hear back again from me.  
  
You will make the payment through Bitcoin (if you don't know this, search 'how to buy bitcoin' in Google search engine).

The AnCap, of course, praxes anyway because AnCaps don't care what Statists think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Mises! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Mises? - Rothbard? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your bowtie. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Mises, I told you, stop praxing in the house! - Hey, Rothbard. - Hey, Mises. - Is that bowtie gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Mises. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, violate the NAP against someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Rothbard, today we are men. - We are! - AnCap-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished AnCaps, please welcome Dean praxwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Bitcoin Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Bitcoin, a division of Austria and a part of the Schiff Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as an AnCap, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Gold begins when our valiant purposeful behavior Jocks bring the Mountain Dew to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... gold! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Bitcoin, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of AnCap existence. These AnCaps are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the smelter. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of gold that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the smelter? Of course. Most AnCap jobs are small ones. But AnCaps know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that AnCaps, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Rothbard, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're AnCaps. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Mountain Dew Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are purposeful behavior Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, praxing who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a purposeful behavior Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more purposeful behavior than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. AnCaps make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a purposeful behavior Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a Statist tear patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Mises! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, praxy-boy? Are you AnCap enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Bitcoin! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the gold field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with an Anime stash. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into gold! - Mises, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into gold. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some gold and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

Yeah, right. purposeful behavior counting, stunt AnCap, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Couple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the smelter? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the smelter just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The smelter opened up again. What happened? An AnCap died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt AnCap, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Mises, what do you think I should... Mises? Mises! All right, we've got the Statist tear patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their price bubbles today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, AnCaps cannot prax in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, AnCap law number one, absolutely no talking to Statists! All right, launch positions! prax, prax, prax, prax! prax, prax, prax, prax! prax, prax, prax, prax! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those Statist tears! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Statist tears! This is Blue Leader. We have price bubbles visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. price bubbles! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one Mountain Dew collector! - Ever see praxeology up close? - No, sir. I pick up some purposeful behavior here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's purposeful behavior power. More purposeful behavior, more Statist tears, more Mountain Dew, more gold for us. Cool.

gwmgvqb,MBCnerdcore,142,"**Dogecoin by design, is positioned as a blockchain version of a fiat currency.  What does that mean?**
________________________________________
Fiat currencies typically do not have intrinsic or use value. 

They have value firstly **through government regulation**.  Since this is a decentralized cryptocurrency, we can replace *""the government""* with *""the underlying tech/algorithms, being updated by developers with 'Litecoin' as a starting line, and 'a great fiat cryptocurrency with secure and fast transactions' as a finish line""*. 

**The only other way that fiat currencies have value, is because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.**  AKA 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE.  AKA how your local country's CountryBucks works.

Right now the disadvantages to these, the ""problems"" are:

**1) Slow Development** This is currently and ACTIVELY being addressed by the fine folks over at /r/dogecoindev, the Doge development Twitter/Discord, and the Doge GitHub.  The devs are working on implimenting new features to catch Doge up with other mainstream crypto, and if you are a talented dev that wants to help, it's an open-source project and they would love you to lend a hand.

**2) Reputation as a Joke/Meme.**  I'll get to this later, but the TL;DR is that this reputation would be a disadvantage to ""investment"" type coins like Bitcoin but can actually be an advantage to a fiat currency because it creates demand and adoption. 

**3) Dogecoin's lack of ""usefulness"" compared to other crypto.**   ""Usefulness"" is subjective and really depends on the goals of the coin and its dev team.  The bottom line is that, **if Doge is succeeding at its own goals, then it's useful**.  Don't let people move the goalposts for you, each coin is focused on something different, and very few cryptocoins have 'actually using it as an inflationary fiat currency alternative' as a goal, which puts Doge up in the market leaderboard in this regard.
____________________________________
OK I said a magic word:   **Inflationary.**      And I kind of misrepresented DOGE.  DOGE is inflationary in the short term, and deflationary in the long term.

**Inflation is a market force that encourages spending**, rather than 'investing' (AKA hoarding AKA HODL).  The goal of Dogecoin isn't to sell it to get back into Local CountryBucks, **the goal is to spend them directly** on goods and services **as a currency** to avoid being locked into your CountryBucks at the whims of your governments.

All the people talking about ""*Doge can't be $10 because the market cap would be X*"" are actually arguing a strawman fallacy:  Doge as a CURRENCY shouldn't be compared to ""market cap"" like a STOCK.

**For instance:** What's the ""Market cap"" of the Canadian Dollar? Is it higher than Tesla? The GDP of Canada? The GDP of France? Apple shares? The answer is ""Who cares, that's not how regular people measure the value of the Canadian Dollar.""

The only thing that matters, just like with CountryBucks, is 'how much does an ape need to pay for a banana?""

**At an inflation rate of ~4% and shrinking, the supply matters less and less the farther in the future you look.**  There will be Billions and Trillions of Dogecoins out in the world, but that doesn't change the value of DOGE.  Just like with CountryBucks, the side-effect of printing a lot of coins is inflation.  Inflation is actually good for CountryBucks, because it encourages trade.  Money moving around is what gives currency value.

Just like with fiat CountryBucks, more can be printed all the time, but unlike with CountryBucks, Doge inflation is predictable and stable.  The inflation rate of DOGE is pre-calculated into the algorithm. It will never be higher inflation than it is right now. It will take 25 years for the current amount of coins to double.  **People saying Doge has ""infinite"" supply, must be planning on living forever.**  On a realworld practical level, it doesn't make a difference.
__________________________________
Doge is given value not from the flashy underlying tech or the scarcity of coins, but by **retailers accepting Doge as currency**. The more doge is adopted, the more stable the price. When some small companies started accepting Doge, the value went up.  When Crunchyroll, porn sites, and Newegg started accepting Doge, the value goes up even more.  When the biggest retailers (Walmart, Amazon, Netflix, etc) take the leap into accepting it, then suddenly the coin's value will go to the MOON.  And then it will stabilize at some value, and hover there ""un-Tethered"" to any nation's CountryBucks. 

**You can't ""pump and dump"" the EURO.** So that's why adoption is the goal, and DOGE isn't an ""investment"", it's a currency. The goal being - the more adoption, the more stable the value of the coin.  

**""Investing"" in DOGE is as silly as ""investing"" in EURO or Canadian Dollars.**  ^(Unless you know what you are doing -&gt;  See:  Forex trading) 
 The point is to spend them, not to hold them for X years and then sell them just to get back into CountryBucks.  ""Easy to spend at a wide variety of retailers"" is what will make DOGE useful.  Not to support DeFi or smart contracts, not to create NFTs or blockchain videogames, other coins will always be more useful for those things.  So yes, Doge isn't ""useful"" the way something like ETH or BTC is.  But those coins aren't as ""useful"" as an easy, cheap way to spend on goods and services.  
______________________________________________
And **yes, Doge is a meme joke coin.**  But the more people spread it and talk about it, the more valuable it is.  Eventually it becomes Kleenex or Band-Aid but without the IP and copyright problems - **people will be so used to it that the name is synonymous with 'cheap cryptocoin used for online shopping'**.  And in that regard, being a meme is a strength rather than a weakness.  This is the reason VHS beat Betamax, despite the tech disadvantage.  This is the reason Blu-Ray beat HD-DVD.  It's the reason the Nintendo DS beat the Sony PSP.  Sometimes the marketing, the brand name, a few high-profile supporters, is what it takes to be that household name, even against more powerful or useful tech.  In terms of mainstream branding, Dogecoin is probably only second to Bitcoin itself.  This is EXTREMELY powerful and useful, from a certain point of view.
_________________________________
So this is exactly the argument for Doge.  To be used as a fiat currency as an alternative to country-based fiat.  Yes it has downsides and the coin isn't perfect, and the devs have a lot of work to do, but **the constant FUD about Doge having ""infinite"" supply and therefore no value is missing the point**:   Doge and crypto like it should be compared to currencies, not stocks in the stock market and ""market cap"" of Apple or Tesla or the GDP of France.  **The success of Doge is measured by adoption**, not Doge's value to sell off for $CountryBucks.

I hope this clears up some of the 'talking past each other' arguments between shibes and those who can't wrap their heads around 'our goals are different, market cap doesn't matter'.",2021-05-02 13:18:45

No blockchain is valuable without use or adoption. The more people use the chain to hold value, the higher the price (bitcoin). The more DAOs and traditional businesses utilize the chain, the higher the price (etherum). The more active a community is at promoting a chain, the higher the price (doge) The greater the integration into other chains, the higher the price (polkadot, chainlink, etc). However, all of these blockchains have every attribute just mentioned that plays into its price value, most just have a single main focus and grow the rest of the attributes with time and community consultation. Harmony is the leading protocol of efficiency and groundbreaking technology in which other large chains such as BNB and ETH struggle to mimic/model-after. Think of Harmony as a credit union on steroids; as a community, you can store value, earn interest (staking), and even take out loans (albeit through integrated 3rd parties), but you can also grow a new business, integrate into existing businesses to increase transparency and efficiency, base a sustainable economics model from it (look up their balance of issuance and transaction fees), and use as a global currency (yes, with more adoption).

A decade ago, the bankrupt owner of the Greenidge power plant in Dresden, New York, sold the uncompetitive coal-fired relic for scrap and surrendered its operating permits.

For the next seven years, the plant sat idle on the western shore of Seneca Lake, a monument to the apparent dead end reached by the state’s fossil fuel infrastructure.

But today, Greenidge is back up and running as a Bitcoin mining operation. The facility hums with energy-hungry computers that confirm and record Bitcoin transactions, drawing power from the plant’s 106-megawatt generator now fueled by natural gas.

The mining activity is exceptionally profitable, thanks to an 800 percent rise in Bitcoin’s price since last April. Seeking to ride the boom, the plant’s new owners plan to quadruple the power used to process Bitcoin transactions by late next year.

Environmental advocates view Greenidge’s ambitions, if left unchecked, as an air emissions nightmare.

And they fear that dozens of other retired or retiring fossil-fueled power plants across New York could follow Greenidge’s example, gaining new life by repurposing as Bitcoin miners or other types of energy-intense data centers.",2021-05-06 21:36:55

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/how-to-decide-whether-to-invest-in-bitcoin-or-ether?srnd=premium-europe

&gt;The Case for Ether

&gt;Ether is the token used on the world’s most actively used blockchain -- the technology used for verifying and recording transactions -- Ethereum.

&gt;Ethereum is used by the likes of Microsoft Corp. for its blockchain offering and has powered the explosive growth in non-fungible tokens, the latest digital art craze.

&gt;“Ether is a blockchain platform that functions like the Apple store or Android app store,” said Pat LaVecchia, chief executive officer of Oasis Pro Markets, a U.S. digital securities trading platform. “Bitcoin is a commodity like gold, or a store of value.”

&gt;Unlike Bitcoin, where many of its core features like its supply cap are baked into the design, the Ethereum platform is evolving. It’s currently going through upgrades that should improve the network, with even a change that will reduce supply. That could boost the price by offering greater appeal while at the same time putting more limits on how many Ether are available.



&gt;“Investors often look at Ethereum as a growth-type investment, making a bet on the continued development of the decentralized ecosystem built on Ethereum,” Phil Bonello, director of research at Grayscale Investments, which oversees trusts that serve vehicles for both cryptocurrencies, said. They “sometimes consider Ether as a way to get index exposure to all the development occurring on Ethereum.”",2021-05-06 18:59:01

gx826wj,Content_Structure118,89,"Crypto is in no way a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes use uplines and downlines to tranfer money from one person to another, with the high person in the pyramid getting a cut of everything and quite rich. Pyramis schemes generally don't sell anything.  There is no product. 

Cryptocurrency are tokens/ coins that actually do something. They can serve as a store of Value (Bitcoin), a currency( Monero), a platform for other Apps ( ETH), with many use cases. They are based on Blockchain,  which decentralizes finance and records,  and stores the info on computers around the world. 

For example you can invest in a project designed to record, validate, and privatize  Medical records. Hospitals and insurance companies may use these in the future. Your records will be private and never lost.  

Your can lose money with crypto by investing in a poor coin or project. But it is no pyramid scheme.  You can also lose in stocks or mutual funds.",2021-05-07 10:32:43

gxdl5ez,HobbyNihilist,382,"I'm mainly here for the memes and because I think Bitcoin is stupid. But for those wondering about Doge inflation, have a peek at the market caps of Fiat currencies (measured in BTC and total supply): https://fiatmarketcap.com/

If Crypto is actually going to become a thing, the endless supply of Doge is actually something that could establish it as a stable currency (something that seems far more difficult for Bitcoin) thus making it a legitimately better currency.

Also, you cannot just throw endless data power on Doge to create infinite amounts. You can only make an amount per day which someone else did the math on yesterday, to show makes up less inflation than pre-covid US Dollar (post covid us dollar inflation would of course, be considerably worse than max Doge inflation).

A currency is a collective belief, only two currencies have the PR pull at the moment to be used as true global currencies, Bitcoin and Doge and while Doge was made as a joke, the technology it was made on wasn't a joke and just might be legitimately better than Bitcoin's.

Doge will not likely ever reach 1.000.000 USD per coin. Probably not even 500.000 USD per coin. But it can certainly hit 10.000 USD per coin and still be considered at a sensible market cap if one considers it a true currency.

What it needs for this is mainstream publicity and ease of use as payment...and I'm seeing people buy coffee with Doge without any hassles these days so when you guys talk about holding past 1 dollar or 10 dollars I honestly just laugh.

You guys think that with the FOMO and Stimulus checks existent in the u.s market this train is going to stop at 1 or 10 dollars?

Once the U.S mainstream realizes they might have found a ""new"" bitcoin at 1~ dollar value the frenzy is going to be shocking. It'll be a bumpy ride getting there, for sure.

gxdfkdp,BadAssPleb,126,"Ok to begin with I wanna make it clear this is not written by me so all credit should be given to the OP of this article. Very interesting reading but it is 2yrs outdated, it shows however vechain has been opened about what they are and what they hope to achieve from the beginning. I have chosen not to invest in vechain even tho I believe in the technology, I own LTO instead. 

Anyway here’s the link to his article, https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8i66ug/is_vechain_centralised_or_decentralised_does_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf I will repost it here however as to do so that you don’t have to open another window if you’re browsing in mobile. I don’t want any credit for this comment I simply thought this would add to the conversation.


Is VeChain centralised or decentralised? Does it affect their goal to be the leading global enterprise level public blockchain platform?

### TL:DR VeChain is neither fully centralised or decentralised. It is more politically centralised compared to popular cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, however there may be reasons for why the ecosystem has been designed this way. Like all blockchain projects, it lies on a spectrum/matrix of centralisation/decentralisation. 

Since the latest [Medium article: Defining the VeChainThor Blockchain Consensus — Proof of Authority] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/defining-the-vechainthor-blockchain-consensus-proof-of-authority-8cf3f51a5fa0), I have seen some members of this sub declare that VeChain is centralised, without further discussion on what this means or the pros/cons. From a governance perspective VeChain certainly appears more centralised compared to Bitcoin. However it is worth noting, the decentralised political system/governance model in Bitcoin is the reason behind multiple BTC forks, the scaling debate, BTC/BCH drama and the difficulty associated with making changes to the Bitcoin protocol. It is myopic to make wide generalised statements about an ecosystem like VeChain without understanding the nuances behind decentralisation vs centralisation and the reasons for one or the other in the first place.

[Vitalik Buterin writes a thoughtful article about decentralisation, I highly recommend it.] (https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274) In his article, he argues that there are three types of decentralisation which run independent of each other. Architectural (de)centralization , Political (de)centralization and Logical (de)centralization.

From VeChain's own description, the ecosystem is meant to be a balance between centralisation and decentralisation. The VeChain [organisation chart](https://www.vechain.org/about#organization) shows the governance structure. ""The Board of Steering Committee oversees the various functional committees within a decentralized foundation. The board members, through a governing agency, ultimately guide units towards cohesive goals and enables collaboration, efficiency, and output across channels. The Board of Steering Committee is the governing body of VeChain Foundation. It represents the balanced interests of the VeChain blockchains stakeholders.""

The VeChainThor network would be 

- architecturally decentralised: authority nodes run on multiple unrelated physical computers, no infrastructural central point of failure
- politically mixed centralisation/decentralisation: authority nodes are made up of different individuals and organisations vetted by the foundation to support the ecosystem, ecosystem development and decisions will be influenced by a central steering committee controlled by 7 members of the board, at the same time this steering committee is guided by many various stakeholders with voting authority, in a sense it is similar to a company structure with shareholders in a company and board members, the relative power of each party is still unclear at this stage
 - This is the key area where VeChain is more centralised and differs from other projects. I believe this decision was made to ensure VeChain would be able to quickly adapt to fluctuating regulatory conditions in the real world. With large-scale mainstream enterprise adoption as the goal, VeChain will happily make necessary changes to their blockchain to foster faster adoption. VeChain are looking ahead and plan to adapt their ecosystem to become whatever the rest of the world requires them to be.
- logically centralised: like most blockchain projects, has one commonly agreed state (the blockchain), the ecosystem behaves like a single entity",2021-05-08 18:56:57

gxac40i,KokoroMain1475485695,106,"For a currency to be viable it need to be easily divisible, easily accessible and have a stable and recognize value.

I cannot buy food with bitcoin or any crypto. 

Cryptocurrency are volatile as hell.

USD is backed by taxpayers. I can buy grocery food with it and it's value even with inflation is more stable across time than the value of any cryptocurrency.

I can have access to USD for fairly small transaction cost. Bitcoin transaction are slow and costly.

The idea that cryptocurrency will overtake state currency is bollocks.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain as a technology might be use by states on state currency, but a currency not backed by any state will never be able to rivalize state currency.

At best, cryptocurrency is similar to gold to due scarcity. At worst, cryptocurrency isn't scarce because there's an infinite amount of cryptocurrency clones.

At best cryptocurrency have value through its security, but the retail investors don't need crypto security, they need need standard credit card security. At worst the security of crypto doesn't add any value and the value is only based on offer and demand and right now, people are buying crypto not for the technology, but for the get rich quick scheme so there's ''gamblers'' are going to sell to earn a profit. Same for those mining coins. When more people will sell than the liquidity available, the price will tank. It can take 2 weeks, 4 years, 10 years. This make the bitcoin unstable.

If you need to pay wage or if you need to buy anything, the USD will be more useful and convenient and stable than any cryptocurrency ever will.

The most likely outcome is not crypto overtaking USD. It's USD bank acount using crypto technology for transaction.",2021-05-08 00:59:15

gxc3585,spiderbob27,98,"So, we are gauging this by _today's_ dollars and _today's_ market cap, and what's possible _today_.  The internet and crypto create value that is outside of tangibility.  Nothing necessarily needs to be physically made, in the sense that, there must be an object created for it to have value.  (NFT for example.  But there are many others.)  This ""market cap"" dilemma and a handful of individuals on tv that get to say what something is allowed to be worth will cease as people start to see this.  Think about it this way; there are some that are saying bitcoin will be worth $1 million a coin someday and they don't even bat an eye.  What would the market cap for that have to be?  Who gets to say that's okay?

Doge is bigger than that.  Doge will  be monetarily valuable beyond _current_ conception- regardless of what these ""experts"" want you to think.

gxcgs93,virus88888888,81,"🔥🔥🔥 Virus POTD 🔥🔥🔥 Record 30-17-0. Units = +47.43 (WWLWL)

Australian Football 🏉 - Melbourne Demons v Sydney Swans

**Melbourne 1-39 -** ($2.00/+100) - 3 Units

Match starts \~ 7hrs from post

* I'm part **virus,** part human so losses do occur and results could change in an instant. Manage your bets and avoid all-ins. Take note of my unit sizes. Feel free to use my breakdown to your advantage.

KISS:

* Melbourne (WWWWW) are currently top of the ladder 4 points clear and undefeated this season.
* Their last match seemed abit shaky against the weak Kangaroos but still ended strong to defeat them by 30 points. They haven't had much trouble keeping opponents scores low.
* Melbourne's Petracca is having a superb season and is a favourite to win this years Brownlow (MVP).
* Sydney (WLLWW) are 5th on the ladder and expecting Franklin and Rampe to come back from injury.
* Despite their huge loss to Gold Coast, most of the Swans game have been close results.
* H2H: Swans are 9/10 against Melbourne but we can ignore this stat this year since Melbourne have been absolutely trash last few years.
* Prediction: Melbourne by 13 points. Sydney have covered 7/8 of their last matches as an underdog. So expect them to hang in their against a dominating Melbourne side. If you don't have 1-39 margin I recommend going **Melbourne ML** but for lower odds.
* If you like a gamble, I also like total points **Over 151.5**.

gxhffng,daymonhandz,83,"You're misunderstanding several things and you have a lot of research to do if you really want to understand bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a protocol, much like TCP/IP are just protocols. The bitcoin protocol also has secondary layer protocols that run on top of it. One of bitcoin's second layer payment protocols is called the lightning network. It's still in beta but it already allows an unlimited amount of users to send and receive bitcoin transactions in milliseconds for extremely minuscule fees. The lightning network isn't bitcoin's only second layer protocol. Bitcoin also has a second layer protocol called statechains that allow non-custodial off chain transfers which bypass paying miner fees and waiting for confirmations. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. And there will be even more second layer protocols developed over time.

It's always possible that another cryptocurrency could replace bitcoin, but there's only one altcoin that currently exists that could possibly do that and I really don't see it happening. Another cryptocurrency could be invented and possibly overtake bitcoin one day, but bitcoin is currently the most secure, most decentralized, most valuable, most adopted, and most fairly launched cryptocurrency that is currently in existence, and it also has the biggest infrastructure and the most users. 

Satoshi didn't create bitcoin to get rich. He created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their efereum stack if they [don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;t=47m24s) Gambling on altcoins can be very profitable during a bull run because the altcoin market is basically a short term casino where you actually have a good chance of winning. It's a relatively easy way to increase your bitcoin stack.

The issuance schedule and maximum supply of bitcoin are both clearly defined and will never change. If you properly handle your private keys then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else. Bitcoin development is decentralized and anyone can contribute because Satoshi published bitcoin under the MIT license so that it's open source and anyone is free to do anything with the source code. Bitcoin protocol rule changes are also decentralized because they require nodes to come to consensus. This is vastly different from many altcoins. Some other differences are that bitcoin has the most users, largest infrastructure, no premine, no developer fund/tax, no leader, longest track record, is the most secure, is the most decentralized, and bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before ever having any monetary value which can never even be replicated by an altcoin because the genie is out of the bottle now. And unlike the founders of every altcoin, Satoshi never cashed out. Bitcoin is a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Put simply, bitcoin is the hardest money that's ever existed.

Bitcoin is also switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year which will improve privacy, security, and efficiency. This will also lower the operating costs of running a node and the miner fees for exchanges by an expected 30% and it will also allow us to use many more second layer protocols that have been developed. This will also allow us to create massive multi-signature transactions that are substantially smaller in size, and will even allow users to aggregate all the multiple signatures of a transaction into one (multiple signers can produce a joint public key and then jointly sign with a single signature). Shnorr signatures and taproot will also allow us to use the coinswap protocol which is pretty self explanatory, the musig2 protocol which will allow aggregating public keys and signatures, new discreet log contracts which increases privacy and scalability minimizes the trust required in the oracle which provides external data for the contract, and point time locked contracts which will improve the privacy of bitcoin payments using the lightning network. Trustless cross chain atomic swaps should also be available towards the end of this year. Schnorr signatures also makes multi-signature and single-signature transactions indistinguishable on the blockchain so an observer will not even be able to tell if a multi-signature transaction or a trustless cross chain atomic swap has happened by viewing the blockchain. NFTs can also be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also various sidechains in development, including liquid network. There's the RGB protocol which will allow smart contracts to be done using bitcoin on the lightning network. And much more!",2021-05-09 19:14:31

Nobody wants to just say that this is cryptocurrency.  Ransomware is a huge criminal enterprise that only exists because crypto can be used to anonymously collect ransoms.

They just shotgun backdoors out there, figure out who they've managed to dupe, and demand a ransome commensurate with that company's financials.

gxidwq7,Ossified_Squirrel,91,"Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a “bank robber” (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you’re out of luck.

Now usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there’s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.

A non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You’re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure “keys” saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.

As long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: “Not your keys? Not your coin.”

For small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it’s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.

Here’s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it’s gonna suck, but it’s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn’t carry that in your wallet.

So if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html

If this is a ""medium"" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.

If it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.

Once you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.

If you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test

Be sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",2021-05-10 01:19:56

There doesn't seem to be any foreseeable solutions to making proof of stake secure either besides obscuring the flaws. Bitcoin is deliberately made inefficient with proof of work as using provable work that is external to the blockchain is the only means to create real costs where the game theory supports a model where it is both profitable to secure BTC and extremely costly to attack it.
With PoW (proof of work) you would need to be a tremendous amount of effort in order to censor 1-2 blocks with building many asic mining farms, and than burning the electricity continuously in order to attack bitcoin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUd8ZGgm6Qo

With Proof of stake all I need to do is be an early adopter(s) , hack/kidnap an early adopter(s) , or convince many users to join a interest bearing bank account by staking their coins with my company(done many times before) to attack the network. Since Proof of work involves outside resources one can always objectively see and measure the hashrate and sources in realtime and one can cutoff such an attack because it involves outside resources.

There are many different variations of proof of stake but the simplest way to understand this is by looking at those blockchain's as a democratic consensus mechanism where everyone's vote is weighted based upon how many coins or stake they control. Their staked coins than have an opportunity to create a block without proof of work and a dev controlling 51% of the coins gets to virtually mint ~51% on average of all the blocks . This presents another concern as the coins typically need to be in ""hot wallets"" to do so instead of cold storage leading to a more insecure environment.

Since most PoS coins have massive premines where only a small number of devs control most of the coins this also presents another concern as those devs can be targeted by states , hackers, or attackers or as we often see with altcoin devs they pump and dump a project and than move onto a competing project to repeat this cycle over and over again thus have an incentive to attack their old project.

With Proof of work , seizing the coins or stake of any individual or group of people doesn't effect the process of mining or securing the network directly at all . They can only try and spook the market by dumping coins at a discount while individuals like myself will happily buy up all the discounted coins.
 
PoS is being sought because it is a clever marketing ploy to attract environmentalists who are concerned about the electricity used in PoW mining. They may have valid concerns that I also share but they fail to see all the external costs in PoS.

http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pos-still-pointless/

Fiat currency and PoS coins cost at least the same amount of resources to  create , regulate and secure as Bitcoin.

There is an inescapable reality for any asset or currency that as it increases in value the production costs and costs to secure increase as well . This is demonstrated in the economic axiom: MC=MR

“Rent” always forces production costs (MC) to always equal sale prices (MR)

PoS currencies and fiat are simply more abstract and complex forms or Proof of Work that use more human involvement (which uses tremendous amounts of resources and has a tremendous environmental impact) as a PoW coin like Bitcoin. Humans instead of ASICs are shouldering more of the work to create, regulate , and secure each of those currencies; This is ""work"" whether it involves burning electricity directly or food and electricity that humans consume  to perform their work. This is an inescapable economic reality. The more valuable something is the more it will cost to secure it because the more effort will be made to steal and or control it. This applies to any currency or asset.

This is also better understood with the dollar auction dilemma. In a hypothetical auction where a bidding war is fighting over the right to mint a 1 dollar bill how much do you think people will be willing to spend for this power ?




1) ASIC's are actually extremely efficient at converting electricity to heat. +99% efficient. This heat can be recycled.

2) Almost all mining is being done with renewable energy right now. Most principally unused hydroelectric in china that would simply go to waste without those ASIC farms capturing the energy

3) When comparing the energy used in mining to traditional fiat you must analyze all the energy consumed in regulation, auditing, accounting, building infrastructure, security, ect to fairly compare the 2 




-------------------------------

100% pure proof of work coins are completely different.

1) They do not legally fit the Howey test as a security. This is not merely an opinion but tested case law in the USA. 

2) A similar amount of effort in securing the coin must be invested to be rewarded the coin creating long term incentives in the project and making it very costly to attack it. Miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo, especially with ASICs

3)  Fair Coin Distribution.  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.

4) Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. 

5) Objective Security- Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security.\
 

6) There is no company that controls a pure PoW coin in many cases thus the project will win or fail on its own merit and doesn't have a long burn rate created by speculators",2021-05-10 02:04:57

[https://imgur.com/a/UtEnNi1](https://imgur.com/a/UtEnNi1)

The past couple of weeks have been boring in Bitcoin land.

But…we are maintaining the price in the $50k’s.  That is nothing to sneeze at.  Unless you bought in the $60ks.

We continue to trade in a decent range.  And the formations are creeping towards decent widths again.  This suggests that breakouts/downs might have some power behind them.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

This is a short, boring update.  Sorry…

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is currently 6 columns wide.  A move up the column one more box makes it 9 columns wide.  That is getting interesting.

2. Support is at $54,036—which is also the breakdown price.

3. The break out price is up at $59,691.  Resistance is at $58,514.

We have been bouncing around the $50-$60k range since February.  This is one hell of a consolidation.  A we grind through these days consider that we continue to increase the average entry point for the asset.  That makes the base stronger.

1.	We are likely at the same point in Ethereum’s growth that Bitcoin was at last cycle. It’s a different product that does different things, and it has potential to grow to 5-digit value in the next two years. 
2.	Even if you only invest in Bitcoin, you are likely to get results in the next 5 years that will put any financial product to shame. Unless you’re in real estate, VC for startups, or a small number of other areas that a general retail investor might explore, you are unlikely to find the potential for 2x growth anywhere. Even modest Bitcoin predictions would put it at 5-20x what you would get with most stocks or funds. And you have a very liquid asset that you can use as collateral, transfer quickly, etc.
3.	We are at a point in the curve where there are a lot of coins/tokens with the potential for exponential growth. These are, of course, riskier, but we are only just seeing the beginning of blockchain compute. It has a very high utility and also many act as a solid store of value. If you diversify properly (percentage of investment in crypto, percentages of that based on risk) you will have a tool in your portfolio that has the potential to give you rewards well beyond the typical retail products.

gy2u72h,Nachf,194,"I know this won’t get much visibility. Hell, you may not even see it, but I’ll write it anyways.

We started out bartering. Trade me some bear meat and I’ll give you a bunch of arrowheads. A wolf pelt? I’ll give you these berries.

But there were issues with that. You couldn’t always get what you wanted. If my berries went bad before wolf pelt season was in, I’d miss out on a wolf pelt, and you’d miss out on my berries. So, we started trading gold. It couldn’t go bad, so you could pay me gold for my berries, then I’d pay you gold for your wolf pelts later on.

But eventually, gold became a problem. It was heavy, loud, not as easy to morph and mass-produce coins as we’d like. So we moved on to the bank note. Lightweight, mostly durable, easy to fit in your pocket, easy to make lots of.

Unfortunately, we can’t transfer the bank note at the speed of light, so we started making digital money. Paypal can transfer your money across the world in a fraction of a second.

But now, there’s the issue of security, scalability, and loads of other problems that come with FIAT money. (\*ahem\* inflation during crises)  So, we created DeFi. Nobody owns bitcoin itself. There’s no government to print out more when the going gets tough. No surprise inflation.

But crypto has its issues. The wide array of different cryptocurrencies has turned crypto into a highly-volatile, glorified stock market. And it’s easily subject to manipulation.

It’s time for an improvement. The next step. It will still be crypto, but different. How could we solve this problem, the problem of manipulation from stronger people? I haven’t the faintest clue.

The problems are getting harder. It started out as “Grug need pelt but berry go bad. Grug use intermediate wealth storage to avoid asset depreciation.”  With crypto, it was, “How can I create a decentralized currency, capable of evading the problems caused by the handling of a government? Where the value belongs to the individual, not a higher power.”

This last hurdle is huge. How will we stop a wannabe-Tony Stark from pumping an asset’s value? We can’t just program rules in place or try to take control when the market gets wonky. That’s wholly against what crypto stands for.

Always be on the lookout for new technology. You need to be ahead of the market. Be those people on the bitcoin forums, the people who jumped on bitcoin when it got listed.

gy0xzxa,bitusher,165,"Lets discuss some of the properties of what makes a good currency and where Bitcoin fits now 


**1) Durability** = Gold is best here due to its history and physical nature. Bitcoin and fiat  being digital in nature means we must compare the  durability of the institution/network that issues and secures them. I would suggest that Bitcoin will slightly excel responsible nation states here and does far better than  unreliable forms of fiat when looking at the history of fiat compared the the history and properties of Bitcoin(2017 gave a lot of credibility to Bitcoin in it thwarting a powerful attack and nation states have repeatedly attacked Bitcoin to one degree or another)

**2) Portability** = Gold is horrible in this category being physical, heavy and unable to be sent digitally(custodians don't count as you lose most the benefits of gold and it switched categories from a bearer asset to registered value). Bitcoin beats fiat here too as its peer to peer , global and lacks regulatory friction. 

**3) Fungibility** Gold wins here. When comparing fiat to Bitcoin it is more complicated but Bitcoin beats fiat here overall and is significantly getting better each year (see link above) . Physical fiat has some advantages over Bitcoin in the sense that its easier to have strong privacy locally as long as the whole ""anonymity set"" (group of users) avoid depositing the fiat in ATMs and banks(physical cash has serial numbers that are tracked with OCR + bill readers everywhere). Bitcoin can be very private if you use the right wallet and you take precautions but if you make a mistake you can also have problems. Digital fiat isn't very fungible or private at all. Thus Bitcoin comes in second here vs gold , although gold isn't as fungible as many people suggest either due to different grading, certifying prices, forms which all fetch different prices.

**4) Scarcity** -- Bitcoin wins this hands down with a fixed and limited supply. ~2-4 million BTc have been permanently lost/destroyed and many people also a long term investors leading to more scarcity. Gold is a distant 2nd with concerns in asteroid mining - (Psyche 16 as an example) and not knowing if any other large deposit can be found but far superior to fiat. 

**5) Divisibility** Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places onchain and 1/1000 of a satoshi on other layers like lightning. Thus micro txs are possible with bitcoin and too impractical with gold and not as easily done with fiat due to regulatory friction  and costs. The idea is that machines and software can tip other software, machines, and services by the minute or second to allow for more granularity and thus more efficiency with lower prices.

**6) Acceptability** - Fiat wins this category for the time being due to its acceptance worldwide , especially US dollars. Bitcoin being a global currency without regulatory friction can one day overtake even the most accepted fiat however. Almost no one accepts gold for payment so its last and this is unlikely to change. 

**7) Verifiability** - Bitcoin wins here slightly over gold and fiat. Gold can be verified but takes more effort and there are concerns with tungsten filled bars and fake gold. Bitcoin being swept from a private key(coin or paper) or accepting an open dime is better than fiat physical cash, and digital fiat has very large concerns and delays in verification (chargebacks, fraud, etc...)

**8) stability as a unit of account** - While Bitcoin is better than certain forms of fiat in this category, most are more stable than bitcoin and so Bitcoin remains 3rd compared to fiat and gold. We hope that Bitcoin in time will become less volatile with a much larger market cap . This trend is already occurring ,and much economic theory supports this happening but its still an experiment as to how long it will take and what size market cap / liquidity is needed

So you can see bitcoin is already better than fiat in 6 of the 8 categories above and the 2 remaining categories just take time.",2021-05-14 06:11:20

- ETH - Slightly better than Bitcoin in these regards with dubious PoS coming in over the horizon. Development is glacial and fees are through the roof. Creator of tons of crypto waste coins used by scammers around the globe.

- BNB - Fake Defi with a splash of shitcoin, BNB pretends to be leading the space forward while filling CZ's pocketbook instead. Creates mounds of garbage which attract scammers and gamblers.

- ADA - Ghost chain doing less transactions a day than DOGEcoin that develops slower than a snail's pace (ETH) - All promise and no activity. Face of the coin can't even submit a post to /r/cryptocurrency properly.

-  DOGE - Once a lighthearted litecoin fork, now used as a vehicle for scammers and con artists wordwide. Infinite supply and heavy centralization makes investment dubious, even though it was never meant as an investment in the first place.

- VET - Centralized PoS system with spoOoKy authority nodes that operate under the shadows. Terrible gas return for node operators and quirky governance proposals. Under the iron fist of China itself.

- THETA - 10 billion dollar evaluation for a decentralized streaming company whose top streamer has 60 viewers, nothing else needed.

- IOTA - More delays in development than ethereum coupled with more blog posts than a teenager stuck at home during coronavirus. Still haven't found a way to remove the coordinator after over 4 years.

- NANO - You can't even use this network, and exchanges don't accept deposits or withdrawals of it. Everyone was told to remove their NANO from exchanges to decentralize it, but now they can't even sell or trade it when it's going up or down.  Network went down with a stiff breeze and left the community stranded for months.

- BAT - Brave is a great browser, but BAT is worthless. Advertisers don't get bang for their buck because no one has to click on the ads in order to earn BAT, and users don't get any rewards anyways since the amount of BAT given out these days is miniscule. You have to use Uphold to claim it anyways and no one wants to do that.

- MANA - Let's be real here. Has anyone ever actually used decentraland? It looks like a decentralized playstation 1 game in 2021. Graphics 20 years behind the times.

- DOT - This network does less transactions than Monero daily, which is already barely any, and has an evaluation of 40 billion dollars. Even Quantumscape is valued better than this, and they won't have a product until 2025. Come to think of it, that's probably when DOT will have theirs too.

This smaller number is called a “hash”. What is cool is if you put that same big number into the function again and again, it will always output the same smaller number. Another cool property is that there is no way to get from the smaller number (the hash) back to the original huge number, it’s a one way function. 

Another thing to note is that all data on a computer is essentially just a number. That 10 MB PDF that displays text and images? Yeah that’s actually just a gigantic number which can be hashed extremely easily. 

That Bitcoin transaction or block? A number that can be hashed.

The principle behind hashing is P vs NP. The idea is that it is possible to find the original big number from just its small number hash, but the only way we know of to do this is to run through every single big number, throw it into the hash function and check if it’s hash is equal to the target hash. There is an infinite number of numbers, it can take a trillion trillion trillion years to crack some hashes using modern computers.

Take that with a grain of salt, because the people who are more fiercely defending that position are the ones that are also hired by a company that is pushing for a solution called Lighting Network, which depends on the fees for the main chain to be high and would introduce a LOT of centralization (because basically it only works with big centralized nodes as intermediaries).

gy84uy9,UpperOrdinary,88,"I have to disagree about one point: People are not willing to pay a lot for Bitcoin because of the cost put into it. This is a direct derivarion from the *objectivist pricing theory* that the Scottish Classics (David Ricardo and Adam Smith) believed in and that Karl Marx used to define his explotation theory of labour. It is not true that work/effort put into something defines its value. The scholastics were close to define a *subjectivist pricing theory* that the Austrian School of economic thought uses as well beginning with Carl Menger. It is the subjective view on something that gives value; diamonds are not valuable because a lot of work and effort (unfortunately also blood) is put into mining it. All the work and effort is put into it because some individuals are willing to pay high prices for them - more than enough to mine it profitably.

The same logic applies to Bitcoin. It is the sum of all market participants' subjective evaluation which defines the price for Bitcoin, not the value, as value is subjective. The work put into the Bitcoin network definitely is part of Bitcoin, as it secures the network. This security is without doubt part of why people see value in it. But again: This alone is not the reason for Bitcoin's value. If it were so (with anything else), you end up in a circular reasoning: Work (computing power) defines Bitcoin's value, but what gives that work value? The work and thoughts of people working for power plants? What gives value to that? The amount of energy (= food) needed to sustain them? What gives value to that? Again the work put into producing the energy (= food)? But where is that value derived from? The energy (= food) to sustain them? Here we go, a circular reasoning.",2021-05-16 00:52:19

gyis949,bjman22,153,"Depends on how many bitcoins you have. Let's say you have 5. So the bitcoins are worth $5 million. You can sell one for $1 million but then you have to pay capital gain taxes. If you bought that 1 bitcoin at $50,000 you have to pay 20-40% of the gains--ie. tax on the $950,000 profit. So to buy a $1 million home you will have to sell more than 1 bitcoin. And once you sell those bitcoins then they are gone--no longer yours. If the price of bitcoin keeps rising you will feel bad that you had to sell your bitcoins to buy a house.

Another option is you go to a company that loans out money for bitcoins (BlockFi, Unchained Capital, others). You deposit all 5 bitcoins and they give you a loan of $1 million. In reality you should take out a loan for more than $1 million--you want to be able to make at least 1-2 years of loan payments from the amount they give you. Notice that $1 million out of $5 million (the value of the bitcoins) is 20% so this is a very 'safe' loan. The price of bitcoin would have to fall about 80% before you are at risk of liquidation. With $5 million in bitcoins the loan companies will give you a loan of up to $2.5 million (50%) easily but that's less safe for you. There are even 75% loans but again these loans are not so safe because you can be liquidated if the price of bitcoin drops 25%. Notice how this week it dropped about 30% !! Yikes !! So, I would only take a 25% loan.

You don't have to pay any capital gain taxes on the loan because it's a loan--you haven't sold your bitcoins. You now use the loan money to purchase the house in cash. Now you must make payments on the loan. The interest rate for these loans is kind of high (6-10%) so what you want to do now is take a mortgage on the home. Since it has no debt a bank will give you an 80% loan--say $800,000 at about 3% interest. You can now use this mortgage money to pay off some of the high interest bitcoin loan. 

If the value of bitcoin keeps increasing--let's say in 2-3 years your 5 bitcoin are worth $10 million then the loan you took out for $1 million is only now 10% of the total amount you have. So now you can take out a $2 million loan and pay off the old bitcoin loan and now you have a lot of cash to continue making payments on the new loan and the mortgage loan. 

The idea is that you are forever in debt and you are paying interest but it doesn't matter because you avoid paying capital gain taxes and you get to have a house without having made the mistake of selling bitcoin for $1 million when now it is worth $2 million.",2021-05-18 11:12:33

Then Tesla accepts Bitcoin- elon loves all crypto- the banks and hedge funds take advantage and start buying bitcoin and bundling with mutual funds Very risky- The banks and fund managers drive the price of bit up to record levels. Even though bundling any crypto is a huge risk- but hey it was our retirements not theirs  
  
Tesla stock still not going down, Then the media starts beating on the story about fossil fuels and bitcoin some 4 - five weeks ago. Tesla is a green brand- Tesla investigates and finds out its true- Tesla has not choice but to suspend bitcoin until Bitcoin fixes it.  
  
Then walks in Barry from coindesk, the juvenile fanboy war starts between the communities and he will short doge and wants everyone to buy bitcoin- Banks and fund managers are loving it, anything to affect tesla stock,  
  
Then you have Petey also from coindesk, picking a fanboy war complete with name calling- While Elon who has also pointed out deficiencies in Doge (however doge welcomed the input and the doge devs went to work on solutions) , pointed out some of Bitcoins issues. Instead of welcoming the input and working towards solutions, Petey, gets the BIt community to wage war.  
  
Petey then tells his community how to short tesla.... Seems interesting- Who are coindesk advertiser's? Banks, fund managers? Petey also doesn't explain the risk to his followers and acts like, name your price and its a lock, these people can lose their homes! How f-ing irresponsible of this guy!  
  
Next Burry announces his short position, left out of the story is that he has been short on tesla since December and maybe longer- What is not reported is that he did not use millions of dollars to short, he put up 8000. If he fails, and tesla doesn't go down he could lose millions of dollars  
  
This whole crypto community is being used all because a bunch of fund managers and experts decided to take a company down long before Elon said one peep about DOGE or Bitcoin.  
  
Both Bitcoin and DOGE are being used! SO called experts and the Media use Social Engineering - fear and tribalism - to get you emotional and to act in the direction they and their advertisers want you to act. They do this with stocks, they do this with crypto. Be aware.

Then you have this, which a lot of people will latch onto to prove that ETH is better than BTC because of how much more green it is and how much of a giant it already was in the crypto space. 

Don’t get me wrong, ETH will almost certainly dump a little when 2.0 is released because of buy the rumor, sell the news on top of people being able to sell their ETH staked in Coinbase. Then you also have all the people who want to sell but don’t want to pay the gas fees, so they’re holding until those are better.

Basically herd mentality driving a lot of movement in prices.                        So as to what happens if crypto crashes?  Well that depends on a few things.  

1) What is a crash?  Recently bitcoin last 50% of its value, sounds bad right?  But it bottomed out at $30K, still miles above its bottom of $4K from a few years ago. I don't texpect these types of fluctuations to impact mtg items.  On the other hand, what if it really really crashes?  Well I don't expect a firesale on mtg items, but I do think that demand will drop because there is less disposable income to burn.  This will cost prices to gently drift downward for a few years until the next major spike pattern occurs.

2) What would drive investors to sell their assets?  Just because crypto is down doesn't mean that you all of a sudden flip your tangible assets.

They wouldn't listen when I tried to explain that any business that accepts it is only accepting it because they think they can hold it and make more money off of it than the worth of whatever you paid it for, because they're banking (apparently correctly) on the fact that people are stupid enough to pay for things using a currency that they're literally betting real US dollars (which hold actual, useable value) will be worth more tomorrow than it's worth today.

This is my last comment, which got no reply:

&gt; The only reason Visa accepts it as a form of payment is because the bean counters told them that the potential profit as a result of market volatility was worth the risk of losing some some money if it tanks. Worst case scenario for them is that a tiny fraction of account holders get off paying the full balance, best case scenario is that they make a significant fraction on top of what they already will.

&gt; If you choose to pay your CC bill with a currency that you're adamant will only increase in value (which you would be if you bought into it rather than simply sticking the money in a savings account), you're a fucking idiot. Think of the logic at play there-""I'm going to pay a debt with a currency that I'm literally betting money will be worth more tomorrow than it's worth today."" They're playing you for a sucker and you're falling for it hook, line, and sinker.

&gt; There is no reason for any company to accept cryptocurrency as a payment option except for profit potential. None. Zero.

gyu6aar,WarrenPuff_It,106,"Careful looking into things like this. That video implies that everything happening here is nefarious, when really this is normal human psychology in a volatile asset market. Wyckoff was writing and publishing his work during a period of large-scale distrust of the ""Robber Baron"" generation of American capitalism (1865–1914), and his work represents that distrust and dismay.

We have spent a lot of time and money studying human behaviour over the last few centuries. Since the earliest days of stock markets and hyper-connected global economies, people have looked to everything from math to medicine to help explain human behaviour within markets, in order to gain an edge over other investors. Consider for a moment that almost all of the charts and graphs that we use today to measure markets and prices and trade flows were literally created in the body of literature that was produced to explain the 18th century market crashes, most of which were formulated by William Playfair in 1786 with \*The Commercial and Political Atlas\*. A few key events happened in the world of global finance, and for the most part people only had ledgers and tallies to keep track of these things, whose accounts were spread over various treasury offices and primordial archives so it made comparison very difficult. Playfair gathered data on trade flows and compiled them together to make graphical representations using the first instances of pie charts, line, and bar graphs to visualize these phenomena.

The 19th century saw an explosion of inquiry into the thought processes of humans within markets, as psychology and sociology became growing fields that sought to study and understand human behaviour. Science was rapidly displacing religion and the chief authority for explaining the human condition and experience, and as a result universities began expanding their faculty to include many new fields of inquiry that could help explain why humans do what humans do. One work of particular note comes from Charles Mackay, who wrote and published \*Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions\* in 1841, which was one of the first comprehensive studies of the effects of mob mentality of human behaviour. His work was meant to analysis and interpret the actions of large groups of people through European history, ranging from studies into human grooming habits or the rise of religious persecutions. In the first volume of his series is a chapter that dealt with three important economic bubbles in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The birth of capitalism not only brought new markets and commodities to European cities, it also created cheap information industries and communication networks through newspapers and lowbrow literature, as well as a rising tide of middling classes with money to burn. Mackay argued that unsavvy and greedy investors flooded these markets, which drove up prices and created feedback loops of more investors who wanted to capitalize off new found fortunes, eventually reaching a bursting point and reversal as panic selling rapidly crashed commodity prices when investors fled in crisis. Mackay's arguments were wrong, in hindsight, but his efforts to try and study the affects of human behaviour in markets was incredibly influential for later researchers and economic historians alike. Most interesting was the thought that people didn't act as informed and rational actors within a market, making sound economic decisions based off current market conditions, but rather that people moved as amalgamating masses following people in droves and blindly investing in things that their peers had thrown money into.

The 20th century is when economic thought became highly specialized and sterile in its methods. Economics was increasingly important to growing nations whose trade flows were directly responsible for the health and longevity of the state that administered the markets, and a wealthy public affords a wealthy state, so institutions across the western hemisphere poured a lot of money into studying economics and related fields that could help explain how and why markets behaved as they did. The late-19th and early-20th century was a period of turbulent market conditions and increasing wealth disparity, which gave rise to the popular moniker of the ""Robber Baron"" generation for American capitalists who cornered every avenue of Anglo-American industry and commerce. This period also saw the rapid formulation for new methods of increasing efficiency and output in our economies through the implementation of rigid control methods and statistical observations.

Wyckoff represents the bitterness of that period, as his writings from the end of his life present the riches of that period as nefarious and illicit gains at the expense of the commoner, but his own personal wealth and prosperity was gained through his friendships with and financial relationships with the same robber barons he later despised. The author of the video you linked claims that he devised his methods from studying the trading methods of capitalist elites, and presents that information in a way that paints his as an outsider looking in, when in reality he garnered that information from rubbing elbows with the J.P. Morgan's and Carnegie's of that era, as friends and peers of the elites of Wall Street. He also wrote and sold books about his strategies in \*How I Trade and Invest in Stocks and Bonds\* in 1922 and 1926, similar to how modern day stock traders naturally transition to selling stock pick lists after they have aged out of the stock trading game, Wyckoff's methodology was very much a ""get rich quick"" scheme in itself, as he presented the concept as the optimal time to buy an asset or security based off predictable market behaviour.

There are other metrics that help explain similar behaviour without relying on conspiratorial beliefs.  Just as Taylor's scientific management theory was created to make industries efficient by breaking down segmental parts for any complex system, accountant Ralph Elliott realized that market behaviour could be broken down into constituent parts of the larger whole. He noticed that price action was a byproduct of different groups within the market, buyers and sellers, who were engaged in a constant dispute over optimistic and pessimistic outlooks over the future value of an asset. Buyers drove up prices when optimism was high, and sellers dropped it down when pessimism was high. Elliott first published as ""The Wave Principle"" in 1939, but wrote a more comprehensive thesis on the subject in 1946 in \*Nature's Laws: The Secret of the Universe\*. Elliott Wave Principle breaks down market behaviour and price action into fractals over different increments of time, long term market action moves in waves up and down based off changing market sentiment between bullish and bearish periods, which when viewed from smaller time frames are the same up and down movements in a smaller increment. This is the natural ebb and flow of human behaviour within a free-market, where buying and selling pressure act in a dialectic with each other. The Elliott Wave Principle has been replicated and copied by many people over the years, and can be seen in many macro models that try to explain why price action tends to interact with certain support and resistance numbers.

Despite some of the more popular opinions that circulate social media these days, market behaviour is not the byproduct of manipulation by a select few insiders. That is a rather conspiratorial belief that some people hold, because it makes it easier to explain why things are the way that they are, instead of trying to study the nuanced elements of any complex system. Instead of investing the time and resources to make informed investment decisions, its far easier for someone to retweet ""Elon Musk crashed the Bitcoin market"" and far easier for others to follow in suit. It takes away blame from ourselves and places it on an easily identifiable strawman, so our minds can accept that explanation far easier and quicker than we can accept blame for our own mistakes. People want to believe that the market moved against them because of some malicious actor who controls all the cards, when in reality they were just poor judges of market condition and did not properly analyze all of the facts available to them at a given time. You didn't need to find the special YouTube video or read the right Twitter comment in order to see it coming, anyone who is remotely aware of technical analysis could have told you that markets were overbought and riding on exponential price increases that aren't sustainable over prolonged periods of time, and so a sell-off was right around the corner. We just had a massive cash injection into the economy that people have been talking about for over a year now, during a period of high unemployment and with historically-low barriers of entry for entering financial markets with new technologies and services that lets anyone with a smartphone buy and trade stocks/derivatives/crypto within minutes, on cheap credit, around the clock. That is a recipe for disaster, and when people are circlejerking over a dog-themed dilution machine being the next big currency, maybe it's a safe bet to assume we have entered into ""shoeshine boy"" territory and the markets will experience a downtrend at some point.",2021-05-21 01:15:01

gyxub62,Bob-Rossi,103,"Ya'll didn't ask for it, but I'm posting anyway --- Brutally honest things that need to be said if this community actually wants to flip Bitcoin in the next 6 months post. Time for some unexpected and uncomfortable self-reflection:

* **Ethereum doesn't need Bitcoin to survive.** Stop with the whole narrative that a healthy Bitcoin creates a healthy Ethereum. - This isn't 2017 anymore and at this point it is only a thing because people let it be one. Once Ethereum flips Bitcoin it won't matter beyond daily trading trends. And from a non-price perspective Bitcoin is basically noise. This is something that is true at this moment but is absolutely not true long term.
* **Stop acting like Bitcoin isn't our competitor.** This one baffles me to no end. Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can. ETH can be sent wallet to wallet, BTC can be sent wallet to wallet. Just because Bitcoin made up some ""Store of Value"" narrative and just because Ethereum does more beyond BTC's capabilities doesn't exclude it from being compared. It's such an easy way for Bitcoin to squeak out of critique that I almost think its some secret type of Bitcoin narrative they push. And frankly it's a disservice to what the devs have accomplished. This is just giving BTC a cop-out for not continually progressing.
* **Bitcoin isn't diversification.** Tons of Ethereum investors feel the need to keep 20% of the stack in BTC just in case, yet not many Bitcoiners do so. That seems to be shifting (and see what happens to the Ratio when it does, *hint hint*). But owning some of each for 'diversification' is just pointless. Both move relatively in tandem and as we saw 3 days ago this whole market can tank together. Diversification is moving into property, traditional investments, mutual funds, so on... not splitting your money between two assets that both went up 1000% in a year. There is no investment reason to think you need to keep some token split of the two if you believe in Ethereum long term. Mental reasons, truly believing in both projects... sure, but if you have a token amount of BTC because you feel obligated its pointless.
* **Don't defend BTC for the environmental FUD (and other** ***truthful*** **FUD) slung at it.** Just stop, please. The narrative that Bitcoin is bad for the environment is an absolute godsend for Ethereum. Take politics out of it and just appreciate there is a large consumer base that values this type of stuff ready for the taking. Particularly companies. Elon's statement should be praised in this sub because other companies are surely doing the same (and will conclude to buy ETH). Your 'job' isn't to defend Bitcoin. Let it wallow in the mess it created because Bitcoin sure as shit doesn't defend us.
* **Marketing isn't a dirty word.** No, I'm not talking Twitter bots and FUD campaigns, but getting the word out and education. This whole concept that ""Ethereum isn't ready"" is baffling. Predictable fees are coming in less then 2 months. PoS is coming by EoY. Scaling solutions are months away and the big one, sharding, is going to be top billing come 2022. Stop being afraid of bring in new people. I know of no other community that tries to keep people out of it like this. Ethereum does so many things right now and keeping it a secret is such a waste. Stop being afraid to pound the metaphorical chest.

Take it or leave it. We are set up so good to flip right now its not even funny. Feel free to argue away, but I feel pretty strongly about all this. Don't underestimate the power of what a community can accomplish.",2021-05-21 22:13:14

gyxrir8,PoopingPontificator,100,"There is something special about early wipes that I wish they could capture and keep through the progression.  I hate to be a flea market basher but the flea has some influence on longevity of a wipe.  The game is a race to lvl 10 and then it is a race to earn fk tons of money and then it's dead.  You can boil that down to saying end game is opening the flea and maxing out your bitcoin farm.  Once you open the flea and have money flow, you can buy top tier everything and the game progression is done.  

I want to try a wipe with no flea but traders and loot would need a tweak to fill in the gaps.  Truly dynamic loot would be needed so people aren't jam packing to the same 5% of maps and racing the hatchet bois to be first there.

gytvqmo,AmericanScream,94,"&gt; Crypto is worth so much because the liquidity is tiny - fact check me on this but the liquidity is probably in the single digit percent mark?

What crypto is ""worth"" is totally speculative.  It's based on popularity more than anything else.

For example, Bitcoin is the most expensive crypto right now, but there are a thousand other cryptos that are built on Bitcoin's code that are functionally identical.   So why is bitcoin worth so much and the others, nothing?   Popularity.     That's not necessarily a metric you want to depend on for long term solvency.

Liquidity is only a problem if you want to cash out.   People are convinced they need to ""HODL"", presumably because the price will go to the moon, but in reality, holding is the only way to keep the market from crashing because there isn't enough liquidity to pay everybody off.  There isn't even enough liquidity to pay 2% of the holders out.",2021-05-21 00:00:53

How delusional are we all really? Like what the actual fuck?

We do all the research, each coin is different, each coin solves a different problem, each coin has its own value...but does it really? No it fucking doesn’t! 

A $2 trillion market can lose half its value because some anonymous assholes are pissed off about some other guy that manipulated and bought the dip. And as always, we get reminded that our researched, independent, problem solving, world saving, made up digital shitcoin “currency” / “blockchain solution” doesn’t actually have the value we calculated it had, it just goes to shit because Bitcoin got sold. 

How is crypto ever gonna take over if we’re so reliant on bitcoin? How is crypto ever gonna replace anything when someone can just orchestrate a big sell and half our net worth is gone in an hour? How can this replace the dollar? 

Let’s say it did replace the dollar and all currency in 2008. What the fuck happens then when you have your house deposit sitting in your wallet because that’s where your wages were paid into and that’s where you saved and these guys decide to have a dick swinging contest and devalue bitcoin by 50%?? How do you buy/put down your deposit for the house that stays the same price? It’s fucking bullshit. No problems are really being solved by the etheriums, vechains, xrps, if they can became 10% of their value after a certain 4 year “cycle”. If they’re really worth that much, they should always be that much. You can’t just know the value is this but it’s only priced at 10% because of fucking bears in the wild (😅🤣)

I’m not upset and ranting because my investment went down by 50%, I’m still up over 200%. I’m upset because I’m slowly realising that crypto will never really take over. I’m starting not to believe in the technology because it can’t just lose its value over night like that and only be valuable once every 4 years because some guy read a chart that went up because some whales decided to move their money into this asset once every 4 years.

I personally cannot wait to have enough from crypto to start my own side gig and then eventually quit my job. I will still hold my vechain and xrp because of the potential that they could reach “once every 4 years”, but my goodness am I sick and tired of this bullshit whale action controlling and manipulating for fun. Crypto will never take over because of this (not financial advice, I’m not an expert in anything). 

Stocks are no better either. I’m very happy how so many of us have these asshole hedgefunds by the balls with GME and they get a taste of their own medicine. Unfortunately we can’t do that with crypto whales, we bow down to them and panic sell like little bitches. 

Anyway, rant over. 

TLDR - crypto is not going to take over if all cryptos are dependant on bitcoin, which in turn can be easily manipulated by a few anonymous whales for fun and lose 50% in a week! It’s just not right for something that was perceived to be worth $1.2 trillion becomes $700 billion because one guy placed a big sell order because some guy that created Tron pissed in the other guy’s cereal.

gzar161,Rydersilver,358,"And here’s just the text of the original article:  


Elon Musk has said the founder of ethereum – the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency – is fearful of its “joke” rival, dogecoin.
The SpaceX and Tesla CEO was responding to a blog post on Sunday written by Vitalik Buterin, who founded ethereum in 2015. In the post, Mr Buterin countered Mr Musk’s previous claims that dogecoin could be scaled to a level that it could function as a mainstream form of currency.
“As it turns out, there are important and quite subtle technical factors that limit blockchain scaling,” Mr Buterin wrote. “In many cases there are solutions, but even with the solutions there are limits.”
&gt;&gt; Follow all the latest updates with The Independent’s live coverage of the crypto market
Mr Musk responded to the comments via Twitter, claiming that Mr Buterin “fears the Doge”, together with a meme of a Shiba Inu dog mocked up in the style of the poster for the 1975 classic movie Jaws.  

The technology billionaire also reiterated his support for cryptocurrencies in general over traditional fiat currencies.
“The true battle is between fiat and crypto,” he tweeted. “On balance, I support the latter.”

It is difficult to attribute market movements to specific events or comments but Mr Musk’s influence in the space has been notable ever since he announced a $1.5 billion bitcoin investment through Tesla’ earlier this year.
After falling below $32,000 on Sunday, bitcoin has since bounced back above $37,000, prompting a market-wide recovery.
The latest dogecoin endorsement on Monday resulted in an immediate price spurt of around $0.01, though this was relatively modest considering its value has swung between $0.25 and $0.34 over the last 24 hours.
Mr Buterin’s criticism of dogecoin’s ambitions come less than a week after fellow ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson posted a video offering advice to Mr Musk on how to radically upgrade the cryptocurrency.
“If Elon is actually serious about rebuilding Doge with his elite ninja engineers over at Tesla, which I have no doubt he has great programmers there, here’s how you do it,” Mr Hoskinson said, before outlining a not-so-simple 11-step program that would take years to implement.
“Thank you truly for entering our space and thank you truly for telling everybody that you’re going to take custody of that cryptocurrency and make sure it gets where it needs to go, and I look forward to the great innovations you guys come out with in a year or two.”",2021-05-25 03:02:18

Or a bank calling to collect on 300k debtors and some of them call on loans that they may have out on others and enough default and it cascades. Maybe that bank fails and that causes liquidity issues in other companies and things spiral. Credit crunch. Spending drops and an unemployment spiral that bailouts and stimulus try to prevent

In practice most of them are built by the digital equivalent of gold bugs.

They hate inflation, they hate fractional lending, they hate banks in general.

So they build systems with single ownership of currency, fixed supply limits and a bunch of other things that make actually having a functional currency really difficult.

And, surprise, surprise these systems don't work as currencies, but because they're massively deflationary and because the system is basically designed to cause massive loss of currency, they are extremely good at having hype fuelled dramatic increases in price.

An actual usable crypto currency would have a relatively stable conversion rate to and from real money. 

It would have transaction fees lower than current banks rather than higher than their wildest fantasies.

It would be possible to trace money when it's stolen or used to commit crimes (this is actually possible with bitcoin, but only with enough of the network known) . 

It would be possible to perform all the kinds of transactions we use every day, escrot, credit, lending and borrowing.

I have friends in Venezuela and El Salvador that use Bitcoin as a way to store their economic value for the long-run, without their money inflating away because of questionable government decisions. Of course, it remains highly volatile but for them its worth it over holding their own shit currency. 

It also solves remittances, where they can receive money from their family halfway around the world without driving to some Western Union 2 hours away that ends up pocketing 30% of the money.

Bitcoin also incentivizes the use of renewable energy and has the potential to stimulate it, I can send you an article explaining this point of view if you like.

If you believe in the traditional financial system and the way our monetary system operates now then maybe Bitcoin and crypto in general adds no value for you, in which case energy used on it is always ""wasted"".

In other words a Bitcoin video that gets 100k views makes about the same amount of money as a comedy/music video with 500k views, the benefits are that comedy/music channels typically have much larger audiences, since it's easier to find the average person on the street into music and funny shareable prank videos, than videos talking about something as mature as investing.

* Over draft is something you can opt out of at Chase. Just like you can't spend coins you don't have
* If you overdraft you have until 11pm that day to get positive before you're charged the fee - most other banks charge it instantly , per occurrence and don't give you the grace period. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
* If you read other articles you would know that anyone requesting a covid hardship had the fees reversed. this total was down 10-25% from previous years reported.

Yes, it's a big bank and no one likes a big bank but I don't see anyone handing out free money, except the US Government. Anyone have some bitcoin to lend me? Didn't think so.

With US debt now above 100% of GDP, such interest rates would devastate the budget and economy. Moreover, state and local governments do not have the same money creation powers as a national government.

&gt;*""I think they're a scam and I can explain them with a simple comparison. They're like a Letter of Authenticity for a Rolex watch. A Rolex is worth significantly less without the letter to prove it's the genuine article, but the paper is just that, a paper that is not easily ""fungible"" aka it cannot be replicated, replaced, or forged without considerable effort. A fungible item is something like precious metals where any lump of gold is like any other and pretty much interchangeable. An NFT is non-fungible meaning that it cannot be replicated unless you have the original key that produced it in the first place (which you have to possess in order to decode effectively rendering it impossible to guess).*  
*So buying an NFT is like buying the Letter of Authenticity without purchasing the corresponding Rolex watch. You certainly can.... but why in God's name would you want to? The technology certainly has potential for verifying an owner of a work of art, which is why many artists are flocking to it, but as a store of value in and of itself you'd have to be fucking stupid to invest your money in this with the intent to turn a profit. The idiots buying into this will find out soon enough when they realize they've been left holding the bag.""*

NFT wasn't inherently created to BE a scam, it is just one branching evolution of blockchain technology, but like THE VAST MAJORITY of the crypto market, it is the PERFECT platform with which to scam idiots who have never bothered to learn the tech or read the fine print and pumped money in thinking ""surely this will be the next Bitcoin and make me a billion dollars!""

h0ltizh,Quote99,100,"Finally, aspettavo un post così da tanto tempo.

Premetto che di trading ed investimenti ci capisco poco o niente, ma anche dalle mie parti sono schizzate, da inizio pandemia, i profili di conoscenti che anch'essi si spacciano per lupi di Wall street e cazzate simili.

Il tratto comune che ho notato, tra essi, è che solitamente sono persone con una istruzione bassa, solitamente la terza media oppure gente che ha fatto le superiori in istituti poco seri e professionali, che non hanno voglia di lavorare, in sintesi.

Tempo fa, infatti, su WhatsApp mi ha contattato un mio conoscente. Essendo che deve fare fra un anno il mio stesso corso universitario che ho quasi concluso, pensavo che volesse qualche delucidazione, quindi all'inizio gli ho dato corda.

Dopo pochi  minuti dall'inizio della chat mi invia un messaggio del tipo ""Senti, vorresti trovare un modo semplice e veloce per guadagnare passivamente senza fare nulla?"" e, alla visione di quel messaggio, ho fatto una faccia alla Germano Mosconi, con annesso porcone.

Essendo che, quando si tratta di persone che conosco, non mi piace mandare a fanculo direttamente la gente (al contrario dei call center), ho fatto finta di essere vagamente interessato, dicendo che almeno avrei ascoltato ciò che aveva da dire.

Ebbene, la sua grande strategia sta nell'investire tutto in Bitcoin. Wow!

Durante il mio corso di laurea ho fatto un esame a scelta di economia (che non c'entra un cazzo con quello che sto studiando) che spiegava grossolanamente le basi della finanza. Ebbene, con la conoscenza infima che avevo (e che ho tutt'ora) sui mercati sembravo Dio a confronto di questo mio conoscente. Non ha saputo spiegare nulla a riguardo.

Però, ehi, ha il profilo Instagram pieno di foto belle, con orologi di lusso, smoking e macchinoni della madonna. Sarà solo un caso che i suoi genitori cagano soldi dal culo già di base, mica altro!

Se c'è una cosa che sto notando, soprattutto con l'avvento dei social, è che la gente sembra voler impressionare a tutti i costi gli altri, a discapito di andare in malora finanziariamente. Anche quelli che conosco che adesso sono ""trader"", ho sentito da conoscenze che escono saltuariamente con loro che i loro soldi provengono quasi esclusivamente dallo spaccio o attività illecite, e il poco che guadagnano col loro stipendio regolare da cassiere della Bennet lo sperperano nel giro di venti minuti, per comprare cosa?

Esatto, smoking, affittare orologi giganteschi e comprare cellulari. Seriamente, uno di questi soggetti aveva cinque cellulari così, tanto per, perché doveva mostrarli in giro.

E quello che mi fa più pena è il fatto che poi, a soffrirne, sarà sempre la gente con una istruzione più bassa. Perché lo schema sarà sempre così:

Non ho voglia di lavorare e non voglio studiare --&gt; inizio ad entrare in questi giri e/o a diventare anch'io un guru che sponsorizza tutto ciò --&gt; abbandono il lavoro perché sembra prospettare bene questa carriera --&gt; rimango inculato (perché, si, queste cose c'erano anche parecchi anni fa per chi come me aveva già Telegram, l'unica cosa che è cambiata è il fatto che hanno fatto una migrazione di massa su Instagram) --&gt; resto disoccupato perché già di base non mi assumeva nessuno, figurati dopo che ho perso tutto questo tempo a sponsorizzare merda quando avrei potuto veramente investirlo in me stesso imparando qualcosa di nuovo ed apprendendo qualche skill richiesta dalle aziende.

Un po' lì compatisco, dall'altra parte un po' meno. Mi piacciono questi fenomeni perché ti vengono a parlare dei miliardari che hanno abbandonato l'università perché era inutile e sono diventati imprenditori.... Dimenticandosi però che Zuckerberg e Bill Gates sono stati rifiutati da Harvard, e non sono stati pluribocciati alle medie/superiori del paesino di provincia dove se non minacci di accoltellare il prof ti fanno passare...


Perché, in fondo, diciamocelo, se qualcuno avesse improvvisamente scoperto il metodo per diventare ricco non credo che lo vada a sbandierare in giro ai quattro venti aggratis, anzi, penso proprio che se lo tenga stretto per sé, senza farne parola con nessuno.

2. Store of value. Bitcoin is proving itself to be a good store of value, and has the potential to take over gold in the distant future. Ethereum has no limit on its cap, and with going PoS, we won’t be sure of any unit limits for a bit of time to come. 

3. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Ethereum is technology based on the blockchain (this is why I said apples and oranges, above).

4. No one owns Bitcoin. Ethereum is still controlled by a select few that can alter the blockchain, if they were one day to develop some sort of evil overlord complex.

USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea are the only countries to impose world wide taxation on its citizens. Americans will have no benefit to the taxation policy in El Salvador.  


For example, if I wanted to live full time in El Salvador because they have 0% capital gains on bitcoin… As an American living in El Salvador, I would still owe the same capital gains to the USA regardless that I don’t live in the USA.

  
If I were anything aside from a USA, Myanmar, or Eritrean citizen… let’s say for example, a Canadian living in El Salvador, I would owe 0% capital gains across the board, because Canada does not impose world wide taxation on its citizens like how the USA does, and El Salvador again has 0% capital gains on bitcoin.

  
It doesn’t matter that Canada has high capital gains taxes on bitcoin for its domestic citizens in Canada. Since there is no world wide taxation imposed by Canada, Canadians have the freedom to avoid Canada’s taxes by choosing to live in another country with more favorable taxes.

  
Only USA, Myanmar, and Eritrea impose world wide taxation on its citizens, and we have zero ability to avoid those taxes, which is pretty fucked up and authoritarian.

h0yixjw,Dzugavili,229,"Because all currency is fiat currency and the only real value is in the products exchanged. As long as we'll exchange currency, it really doesn't matter and when that relationship breaks down, it doesn't matter if your currency is fiat or hard, because you're going to have a hard time exchanging it anyway. Today, fiat currency is just as good as gold, if not better, since most stores won't take gold.

Sure, I can back a dollar with gold, but that doesn't really give it value. Even gold has a floating value based on economic factors such as productivity, supply and demand, and so my non-fiat currency is still subject to the whims of exchange: writing that I back one dollar with one dollar worth of gold doesn't actually tell you how much gold you're going to get for that dollar. As such, it doesn't really matter what backs a currency as long as we can agree it has a value in an exchange, and even gold is no different. When Rome fell, no amount of gold stopped the collapse of the Empire. When the shit hits the fan, currency theoretically backed by gold is still pretty useless if there's no one around to give you gold for it, and no one who wants to trade your useless gold chunks for their useful products. 

Simply, backing currency with metal made sense when the metal was rare and had few or no industrial uses, but that backing still relies on someone desiring it; in a utility-based economy like we operate today, desire is not a property of the large rational actors, and so there is no value in hoarding gold unless you can hedge that against a utility value. In the circumstances where fiat currencies fail, gold doesn't hold its value either: you can't feed a family with gold nuggets.

What most people who whine about fiat currencies don't realize is that our economic productivity today exceeds the value of all the gold we have; and we're pulling about 2% more gold out of the ground year-on-year, further diluting its value. The US would have to obtain all the gold in the world to back the current monetary supply and they would still fall dramatically short. There's also the issue that you could find yourself with a lot of paper and no gold if you misvalued your currency and someone makes a run at the bank. Plus, being able to ""create"" money to inject into the economy is a great way to take out the peaks and valleys of economic cycles.

tl;dr: if the world ended tomorrow, I'd rather have a bag of rice and a box of bullets than a briefcase of cash, a bar of gold and a thumbdrive of bitcoin; and if the world hasn't ended, then my fiat currency is fine as long as the monetary policy running it is adequately controlled; and central banking is simply fiscal insulin for the diabetic apes that run our economic systems into cyclical ruin.",2021-06-08 06:36:23

Almost all of the economic forces in a recession are deflationary.  People lose their jobs.  They stop spending.  The things they were spending money on cause more jobs to be lost.  They start spending less too.  Demand falls.  Price falls in response, and deflation is achieved.

Except that makes it worse, because if your money is going to be worth more in a month, you want to hang on to it rather than spend it, so you spend even less.

This is the deflationary spiral that caused the great depression.

This is why the first thing the fed does in any recession is lower interest rates.  They want to increase M2 (money supply) in order to counteract the deflationary pressures of recession.  They do this by loaning money to banks cheaply, who then lend to people that want to buy houses or cars or whatever, and then those people spend money on those things and jobs are created.  Then the people working those jobs spend money on other things etc.  That is how to combat recession 101.

You want a nice stable amount of inflation sitting at around 2-3%.  Too much inflation is bad and deflation is really bad.

As a side note, this is why bitcoin is more akin to digital gold than a currency.  It will never be used as a currency by any nation state because it is, by its fundamental nature, deflationary.",2021-06-08 03:17:56

h1adca4,Bomba_Claude,161,"Very dishonest analysis of how Bitcoin works.....

Calculating energy per transaction is nonsensical - blockchain tech is not just about transacting, the energy keeps your value safe!

When calculating the energy needed per transaction, people pretend that blockchain technology is only about TRANSFERRING value. What people still often miss, is that a blockchain is also meant to STORE value.

When you're only interested in transferring small to medium amounts of value quickly around the world, then you can use a lot of different coins. Especially when you are going to convert that coin again to dollars or euro's for instance.

But this decentralized blockchain thing is not just about transferring value quickly! Being able to store value is an even more important feature.

Many reading this might not have experienced the 2008 financial crisis from up close or don't really know what it's about. In 2008 the worldwide financial system was on the verge of collapse. If it would have collapsed, this would have meant that we wouldn't have been able to do payments anymore, causing a very serious unprecedented crash of the world economy.

How many people realize how important the flow of money really is in a modern world? It basically has a utility function just as gas, electricity and water. We need to be able to do payments to keep our modern world running. The worldwide financial system almost collapsing was a HUGE happening.

And just so people know, there was a time when people understood that payments had a utility function. I believe the Glass-Steagall act made it so that consumer banks (the ones facilitating everyday payments) had to be separated from business banks (these would do the more risky financial stuff).

But then Bill Clinton rescinded Glass-Steagall and consumer banks and business banks could become one and the same basically. In the end this resulted in huge problems in 2008 and the worldwide banking system almost collapsed. And in some countries there were actually bail-ins where the banks would take people's money and confiscate it. There was actually talk by some politicians to sign this type of policy into law. Just imagine working hard all of your life and storing your value with a bank and then the bank taking that value to safe itself because it mismanaged itself.

Decentralized blockchain networks are meant to counteract this whole entire problem that came to light in the 2008 crisis. These new decentralized systems are not meant to just be a solution to banks being very slow with doing payments and charging large fees. We want to move away from the old centralized banking system and therefore we also need to be able to STORE value in a blockchain.

The point of this thread is to show people that the large amount of energy needed to run POW blockchains is to keep the value stored in the blockchain safe from attackers. The energy is not only used to perform transactions and just transfer value. The value stored in the blockchain needs to be very very safe so that people can actually have trust and know that their value can't be stolen by the network being attacked.

When you want to attack the Bitcoin network you will need such a large amount of energy, it's become impossible these days to attack the network from this angle. That's quite comforting isn't it? It's quite comforting to know that if you store your value in the Bitcoin blockchain, that value is safe and you don't have to worry about someone using a bunch of ASIC miners to attack it, as has happened with less secure coins in the past. And you don't have to worry anymore that mismanagement by greedy banks or stupid laws written by politicians will cause you to lose your stored value either.

So in other words, things are supposed to be this way. Don't be misdirected by people that don't fully understand this space yet or by the ones that purposely spread FUD.",2021-06-11 00:07:29

About 70% of the 10% who stayed would be gone before we actually loaded in.

h1gw90t,MascotRay,89,"This may not be popular to say, but since you’re asking for thoughts, here is what I would say:

Bitcoin is king of the market. Whether you choose to invest in it or not, this is the current truth. Right now BTC is so oversold that it puts all alts in a weird spot. If BTC does well, alts bleed. If BTC continues to struggle for a while, alts bleed. Imo, the best thing you can do currently is DCA into BTC because it IS oversold and wait for alts like ATOM to dip further because the chances of them doing so is high. OR, if you have zero interest in BTC, just be patient and hang back for a bit and let things play out. You’re likely to get a better bang for your buck in the next month or so.

As for the investment itself: Please understand that I’m a fan of Cosmos. It’s why I’m here. I’m invested. But also understand that Cosmos is very young. Very promising, but very young. Full of amazing potential, yes. It is also far from a bulletproof investment. Very far. That doesn’t mean I don’t believe in its potential, because I do. It’s just important to be clear what you are investing into and what the risk is. The top five safest plays you can make in crypto right now do not come anywhere near including ATOM. Again, I’m a fan, but understand what you’re getting into. Just my friendly advice since you asked. Good luck 👍🏽",2021-06-12 10:08:26

That last point is rather crazy. Consider this for a second... stocks have been the best investment mankind has seen, and have averaged around 10% annual return. Ethereum, off staking returns alone, will beat that, and potentially 2.5x that (not sure for how long). Of course, there is some risk involved, mainly the price exposure to ETH, but that can be offset with a short as [Professor Chaos so eloquently explained in his report](https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?s=20).

* She gets a **radar-less vehicle** even though the one she ordered clearly said it had radar
* She's told her pickup date of June 30th is now June 3rd. Worried they'll give hers to someone else, she buys a $350 flight to go get it. Car is **not fully charged** upon pickup.
* **computer crashes** in the middle of manhattan traffic (still driveable)
* The car dies at supercharger the day after pickup. You must use the Tesla app to call roadside assistance. The **car won't charge her phone (10% left)** when this error comes up.
* The **next available service appointment was 12 days later**
* Roadside assistance suggests towing the car. Owner decides to let the car cool down for an hour and then it's able to drive again.
* Tesla **cancels her mobile service appointment** and tells her to make a service center one. She sets one in the app for **5 days after her original appointment**, June 21
* Car dies again
* Roadside assistance tells her it's a mobile tech issue (replace 12v battery). This is the **opposite of what the other rep told her**. She shows screenshots of previous errors and the rep agrees to tow.
* **Rep says she needs to wait for the tow**. She doesn't want to because they can remote unlock the car. Rep insists she must be present or tow company may reject the pickup. Ends up towing it the next day instead.
* Car won't go into ""tow mode""

Open question: how would she communicate with Tesla had her phone died?

h1ml0z2,kuzkokronk,62,"Well, the first thing to determine is how much in US dollars would you need to retire, right?

$50K per year adds up to $1 million over 20 years. So, unless you plan on dying in your mid-50s, you'll need a bit more than $1M. I'd probably aim for $2M or $3M to retire comfortably. 

So, how much bitcoin translates to $3 million? Right now that's 83.65 bitcoin (at $35862 per bitcoin).

The question is how much will one bitcoin cost 5 years from now. If the popular [stock to flow model](https://stats.buybitcoinworldwide.com/s2fx/#) is correct (that's a big ""if"") then bitcoin should be somewhere in the million dollar range sometime between 2025 and 2026.

This means you should probably acquire around 3 bitcoin before then.

In part, because is just trying to do more faster. But there are definitely very interesting things that come out of IOHK Research…

“I’m actually the sort of person who thinks deep rigor is overrated. The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated is because I think like in terms of like why protocols fail. I think the number of failures that are outside the model is bigger and more important than the failures that are inside the model…”

I pretty much read that as the best laid plans often go awry, so get it out there and battle test it.

h281ohm,Stock-Lawfulness-332,241,"I'm an old man compared to most of you here, over 60. I have degrees in computer science and know how to program in multiple languages. I am also a financial analyst and have a master's degree in finance. Let me tell you all a true story that happened to me and give a word of advice for the future. When bitcoin first came out, I laughed it off. Then more and more coins were released.

 I like to keep up with computer technology, even though I'm older. So, I decided to start researching crypto in 2012. I decided to mine dodgecoin with 15 scrypt miners in 2014. By 2017, I had mined 5 million dogecoin. The price of dodge coin had not grown over the previous 3 years so I sold it all for other coins. Had I held the dogecoin, I could have sold for over 2.5 million dollars. The coins I bought with the dogecoin are now worth only about 40000 dollars. I was a writer for dogecoin a big part of the reddit community there. Don't make that mistake with Safemoon. I have been buying 200 to 500 million SM every time it dips under .000004,

 The roadmap for safemoon blows away anything we had envisioned in Dogecoin. The idea of reflections to create a deflationary token is genius. As a professional computer guy and financial guy, this is my advice. If you believe in the roadmap for SM, keep buying if you can afford to. Buy at every dip. If you can accumulate enough SM when it reaches certain levels you can sell half or a quarter of your bag and wait for the next bump up in price. Then sell half or a quarter again. After that, if there is another spike in the price, you could literally live off the reflections.

Let me give you an example:

Right now you can buy 2 billion SM for about 8,000 dollars

If we get just to dogecoins daily volume of 1.5 billion, watch what happens to SM as the price increases.

At .0005 you have 1 million dollars, sell half your coins: you still have a billion SM and have $450,000 in your bank account

At .005 you will have 5 million dollars, sell half your coins: you still have 500 million SM and have 2.25 million dollars in your bank account.

During this time frame, whenever it may be, you will earn more and more reflections as the volume increases. Let's say you have accumulated another 500 million SM through reflections.

At .01 you will have 10 million dollars, but you will earn $3700 dollars a week in reflections. You could literally live off the reflections. 

Make a game plan. Keep buying while the price is still low. Cost average down if you can. Then have a sound strategy for selling later. Diamond hands are hard to keep, I know from experience. I hope this helps some of you. Peace....",2021-06-19 01:04:20

This was a true testament to the community-orientated approach of the project, and resonates highly with the hacker spirit that populated much of the early experimentation across Bitcoin and Ethereum. When released on the blockchain, the collection not only became the Ethereum network’s genesis NFTs, but it also inspired the ERC-721 standard that has come to power much of today’s digital art and collectibles. There are a total of 10,000 Punks, each with their own distinct characteristics – no two are exactly alike. The 24 x 24 pixel, 8-bit-style Punks embody an aesthetic mirroring the nostalgic punk spirit, reflecting the Crypto Anarchist philosophy that brought together many of the weird and wonderful misfits that came to build the early crypto infrastructure.",2021-06-19 12:15:38

h2ob7hl,ptoki,115,"There is a few but they are rare and you usually dont get them.

BUT!

in linux world instead of viruses you can have malware/worms which are kind of close to viruses minus the ability to self spread.

While windows is an environment which is repeated the same way on many computers and its possible to write a program which will be spreading through some windows mechanisms and will be able to run because the configs are very similar across many windows machines its a lot harder to write virus which will take over sanely configured linux machine and be able to attack another one.

The reason is rather simple: 
In windows there are some mechanisms which are automatic, required by system and always available (MS is removing some of them and securing some others but its still possible to spread some code over windows shares, rdp, rpc, explorer behavior, email, word documents etc...)

In linux those vectors are limited, some people use thunberbird email client, some use evolution, others kmail etc.

Some use libreoffice others open office.

Linux file managers tend to not launch any code with no clear permission from users.

The vnc, ssh, X11, rdp clients also tend to not run alien code.

Linux browsers dont support activex which on windows has hefty access to the system (and may be buggy).

Linux will not let the user install and run stuff easily (and that is inconvienient for many) therefore protecting the OS and user.

So as you can see its possible to write linux virus but it will have hard time to spread and its size will be rather big so it will be relatively easy to spot it.

However there is also dark side of this.
If someone will be able to gain access to a webserver (usually through some security hole in website scripts (wordpress had/has? bas press on this) then its possible to spread some malicious data to clients. Like injecting bitcoin mining scripts to user's browsers.

So its not as rainbow and ponies as some people think.

The upside of this dark side is the fact that people collaborate and fix issues plus they help with cleanup if possible.",2021-06-23 02:45:26

Sentiment seemed far worse than the first visit down to 1700 as the fear and bear memes had more time to seep in.

I'm not intimately familiar with what is going on but from the looks of it the ""China ban"" is real this time and miners are fleeing out of the country. Bitcoin hash rate is dropping and there is plenty of footage floating around of facilities boxing up their ASICs. Miners are some of the largest holders in the space, not to mention other Chinese firms, and they've been liquidating simultaneously. Meanwhile on-chain data shows plenty of whale accumulation during the sell off. The fact that we're still over 2k after all the panic and forced liquidation in China is pretty impressive, especially considering how overheated retail speculation has been.

You can talk about how the charts are ""broken"" all you want, and maybe so, but at the end of the day that has very little bearing on the adoption trajectory of this technology.

h2qxrmy,Tricky_Troll,63,"I think people are seriously sleeping on the dramatic effect of a change to the supply side of the supply/demand = price equation. The whole 4 year crypto cycles have historically revolved around Bitcoin's halvenings since they dictate the constant selling pressure from miners who have to sell to cover their operating expenses. The merge and EIP-1559 will literally dwarf a halvening. After the merge there will be no more constant miner selling at all. So if we are within 6-12 months of this being implemented, and the Bitcoin bull run usually starts shortly after the halving, continuing for about 1.5 years after the fact, then the proposition that we are about to enter another 3 year bear market just sound silly now, doesn't it?

Therefore, I can see one of two things happening from here:

1. This is just a mid 2017-esque crash exacerbated by Chinese miners shutting down operations and we still break $10K by the end of January 2022.

2. The 4 year cycles are a thing of the past and/or there is a flippening and BTC doesn't take part in this post-merge ETH bull run. Independent of which of the above happens, the supply shock post-merge leads us to a bull-run peaking in late 2022 to early 2024.",2021-06-23 17:35:05

h2tul0j,livedbaron12,159,"I didn't how to creat post correct so then I'll post it here:

&amp;#x200B;

Today was russian Twitch podcast on Shina4 channel with Nikita and female EFT streamers.  
  
My summary can be not correct because I'm not english native speaker and I did some mistakes.  
  
I try to add all main things on my opinion.  
  
If some summary already created, plz delete this.  
  
I apologize for my english:  
  
In the beginning they talked a lot about female part of Tarkov community. Nikita talked about his wife for example.  
  
As Nikita told before, the game will be more hardcore and this their global goal. And they want to create Tarkov as intellectual game and because of that they want to add a lot specific things .  
  
Nikita know exactly how many people playing in Tarkov. 13% - female players in Tarkov. But they didn't know this is real 13% female or just males who choose female in menu. Nikita want smth (event or any activity) to praise part of Female community  
  
Entrance in labs will be from Streets, factory and another map(mb more). Price of Lab-cards will be lower in the future. Labs (maybe) will be like Dungeon, you should enter and exit from it. They didn't how to regulate number of people in Labs. MB they create instance like 10 players enter from one entrance, and 10 from another entrance.  
  
Nikita dont want empty Streets. Nikita said raid time streets will be hour thirty minimum. Some of entrance will be easy to camp.  
  
Nikita want to improve insurance part. He want connect insurance with scavs(scav carma) and cars. Insurance=scavs. Scav reputation will control unsurance( price ). One of two new traders will give some insurance services(like take your gear from labs).  
  
Scav will be able to raid Labs after Streets release and they can do it as a group. Raiders will able to exit from Labs to Streets. And He reminded abot dynamic boss spawns.  
  
They didn't know will be Boss events regular or not. They know how we liked it. They still think how to realise it correct.  
  
Arena will have team dm, team vs team e.t.c player vs team, team vs pve 1v1 etc. Players will achive honor points(ranked points) and that will be player main goal. Achive points will give lvls. The player's level will give access to different modes like mode with bets, ranked mods etc. If u have main game u can use your in game(EFT) loadout if u don't have main game u can choose preset loadout. You will loose your gear if you use you own loadout. They will try to separate players with EFT and players without it. They still didn't how to monetize Arena. He said Arena need different servers and a lot of money to buy it. Nikita know about butthurt EODowners and arena MOST LIKELY will be in EOD. BUT again they still didn't know but if arena will be in EOD it will be fair enough on Nikita opinion. Arena-Players can earn money like in EFT raids. Nikita want add bets to the Arena, like you team and enemy team can bet on their own victories. Nikita thinks they should rework network system for Arena. He want to see CS mechanics in EFT.  
  
EFT support will be long like EVEonline or WoW. He didnt like COD style support.  
  
Nikita loves dedicated fans who are into the game and the development of the game. And They look to them more than others(talked about new ideas or opinion).  
  
First offline map will be tutorial map.  
  
He want to add new events like Bitcoin event and Fuel crisis. Nikita didn't like situation when players farm bitcoin for 3-4 month. He said it was like utiopia, like communism. And they will try price balance like this events (tarcoin for example).  
  
They thinking about increasing cycle of leveling(more grind perhaps). They want to add new secure container - Amicron. It will be 4x4 container and u can put items only before the raid(that mean u can't put items in container in raid). He want to add global fraction quest. He want to unite players with this global quest. He want add in dailychallenges collective quest(for example players can complete quests together, I think it will looks like in classic MMO). They want add all plot-quest before release.  
  
They planning to add mechanic when players can heal other players.  
  
They finnaly understand how to create unconsciousness and players can imitate this condition(like fake death)  
  
12.11 12.12 etc will change a lot of things with mechanic weapon breakage. Maybe they will add weapon explosion.  
  
no date for unity2019.  
  
Wall destruction can be added on other maps(like factory and dorms in customs)  
  
Lighthouse will be before Streets. 2 bosses, hard USEC base, one exit with train. Size will be between Shoreline and new Woods map and will be looks like Shoreline and Woods. Now a lot of people working on lighthouse.  
  
no information about patch-date and wipe-date.",2021-06-24 09:02:23
h2vgwhq,BurnerAcc987654321,151,"Hey all,

Still here. Happy to give an update:

My numbers look worse than 2 months ago, but I'm still up about 4x on the original amount I saved up, and I'm willing to wait it out, as I did in 2018. I believe bitcoin will still work its way up to $100-250k within the next 3-5 years, and I'll start taking profits again at the start of that range.

Right now my allocation is as follows:

* 46% cash (Yes, it did help that I took a little more profit when you guys suggested,  thanks)
* 21% Bitcoin
* 21% Ethereum
* 12% stocks (The cash is slowly moving over here over the next few months).

Life-wise: 

We're now in Aberdeen as planned. We've bought some camping gear to go wild camping in the Cairngorms soon, it's gorgeous up here... Can't see myself living in Manchester again any time soon. 

That cash position covers us for about 10 years with our current expenses, so my focuses right now are learning to invest in stocks properly, learning to code and running (when I'm not too lazy).

I still want to get some cash coming in though, and also, too be honest, I feel like a bit of a loser not working, so I'm looking for a part-time job that's a good fit and isn't very stressful. Trying out one on Monday actually, not sure it's right but it'll be a couple of hundred quid even if I just do the week. There seems to be plenty of jobs in Aberdeen, I've had 4 offers so far for part-time jobs, but unfortunately, 2 of them were customer-facing and I'd rather stay hidden in the back. I'm also trying to get some admin work on UpWork,  I got the 'Rising Star' status, but I need to apply for a few more jobs before I can say whether it's any good or not. My girlfriend already has a part-time waitressing job which could cover half the bills.

Think that about covers me. Look forward to hearing any comments or suggestions.",2021-06-24 20:29:08

Bitcoin fails as a means of exchange (for many reason, but critically) because it’s own value is dictated by the value of *actual money*. When you can use Bitcoin to broker a deal between corn and chickens, then you might have something, but that requires it be backed up properly by a significant force, and a *legal authority*; that’s what the dollar provides.

h2x49hk,roryshoereddits,77,"It’s incentive for a blockchain network. In blockchain, many computers/nodes/people simultaneously run the network by using their computer or hardware to constantly run the blockchain algorithm. This helps to either mine the coin into existence or to facilitate a transaction on the network. No one will willingly give up their computer, hardware, capital, or energy for “the greater good”. Gas fees are what is paid to the miners, people who run the nodes, or stake pool operators as incentive for them to run the network and continue to process and monitor transactions (buys, sells, transfers, etc) on the blockchain network.

Safemoon will make this process a bit more inverse as the gas fee will be taken and burned from the supply so the incentive is then passed onto the holders to keep holding as they receive that gas fee from every transaction. I believe this is where the mesh network comes in as each individual phone or device that runs the wallet/network will probably be running the algorithm akin to how Bitcoin uses mining rigs and gpus. Hence, big things at play here.

Edit: for contrast and potential clarity: our current fiat financial system also has “gas fees” in incentives to run the network which translates into bank fees and payment processing fees and alike.",2021-06-25 04:27:57

Kudos to the org for branching out and doing something different, but I know that I personally wouldn't be too excited about this. If I'm supposed to be paid $300, I want to receive $300. Not something whose value fluctuates, and will only sometimes be worth $300.

I wish I had recorded it because what I told him was completely different from what he said.

That's also false.  I said I got into Bitcoin in the early days and even set up my own mining rigs.  I told him I actually have bitcoin wallets sitting around on old hard drives that I have no interest in cashing in, mainly because I don't want to have to cough up my SSN to some shady exchange, or deal with the mess.  Not worth it.  Don't need money that much.  Don't want to take anybody else's money either.

The core of my discussion with the author of that piece was pretty serious about how concerned many of us are that the whole thing is going to implode - that as technologists, the real offense is crypto and blockchain pretending to be some innovative technology.

In the process of explaining why I would take this up as a cause, I said, ""Have you ever heard of Richard Dawkins?""  He said ""No"" which I thought was interesting.  ""He is an evolutionary biologist that may be best known for being anti-religion.  The thing is, he wasn't always anti-religion. He couldn't care less what religious people did, UNTIL evangelicals started attacking his field of work and suggesting evolution was phony and the earth was 6000 years old.  This is the way I feel.  I'm a technologist.  When a bunch of shysters come along and tell me their goofy ideas are factual about 'blockchain being the future' I can't in good conscience not react.

* $550,000 BTC coming! (uploaded 6 days ago)
* How to get a Bitcoin for $0
* Top 5 coins for big gains in June - This one is so funny I'm going to list the coins and the percentage they're down in the last month, now that June is about to finish:

There is a point to all this though, its for security. If any one person managed to have the same computer power as more than half the network, they could destroy it by issuing fake transactions.

h3es39k,eburnside,184,"Thank you, it was a pretty tough time. When I started in early 2012 BTC/LTC was pretty much still funny money to most people, I think the majority had mined their own vs buying it. I was running the exchange as a ""evenings and weekends"" side hobby and had a full time job working as a VP for a publicly traded company.

When the SEC reached out in mid-2013, Bitcoin was brand new to them and they had 4-5 other crypto frauds on their plate, so I think we immediately got lumped in with those and the initial conversations were pretty tense. I was worried they'd seize the servers, and I knew if that happened everyone's crypto would be gone, so we had to work pretty rapidly to educate the SEC on crypto, and that Bitcoin doesn't automatically mean a scam, and especially that my platform wasn't a scam.  Part of that, as you guessed, was also teaching the lawyers.  We started with securities lawyers and I spent many hours at a whiteboard in their offices explaining Litecoin/Bitcoin.

Once that was settled, we next worked to determine if the platform could operate legally. When I started with LTC in early 2012 it was essentially virtual video game money, but very rapidly (eg, with the big BTC run up in May 2013) crypto had turned into something far more substantial. The regulations weren't there yet for us to register (If I remember right, the fine was for ""operating an unregistered national securities exchange"", IE, on par with the NASDAQ kind of thing) or to get an exemption to operate, so we had to shut down.

I spent the next couple years winding it down.  We allowed traders a month or two to close out their positions, then spent another several months working to get everyone their withdrawals. Not everyone was paying attention, so the withdrawals dragged halfway into 2014. Then for much of 2014 and 2015 I fielded requests for tax records. During that time I'd even added new features to the exchange to download [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) compatible CSV's so that everyone could do their taxes.  We always had good reports in the platform and good records downloads, but the [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) format made it really easy to just take the CSV and go plug it in on [bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax).  Final shutdown for the servers was mid-2015.

The whole thing was a pet project that entire time. I was doing all the dev work, the operational security, the sysadmin work, the customer service, etc.  Had I lived anywhere but the USA, there's a good chance it would have been Binance before there was Binance. We were already doing more volume than Mt. Gox some days.  Fun times.  :)",2021-06-29 14:41:31

h3dr0ux,AutoModerator,83,"Hi Lapinot, AutoModerator has been summoned to explain fake job scams. Fake job scams come in many different varieties, though most share common characteristics that you can use to spot the scam before becoming a victim. The scammers will usually conduct interviews over Google Hangouts or a similar online service. Their English will be awkward, and they may be re-using a script, so Googling unique sounding parts of the email may yield useful results. They will offer high wages for the work being done, and they will ""hire"" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country. If they mention anything about a check or about receiving and sending out transactions, it is a [fake check scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/anatomy-fake-check-scam). If they mention anything about receiving, processing, or inspecting packages, it is a [parcel mule scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parcel_mule_scam). If they ask you to purchase items up-front, ask you to pay a fee in order to be hired, or ask you to purchase gift cards, it is an [advance-fee scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance-fee_scam). If the job involves posting advertisements on Craigslist or eBay, they are using you and your account to scam people. If the job invovles Bitcoin ATMs, it's a [scam](https://coinatmradar.com/blog/avoid-scams-dont-use-bitcoin-atm-when-someone-asked-you/). Thanks to redditor AceyAceyAcey for this script.

It's a very common scam, you don't invest in Bitcoin by depositing it in a ""trading platform"". You buy it and you keep it and you see how the value changes over time. Trading platforms are scams. 

It's also VERY common that scams allow victims to do some initial withdrawals (which is really just the scammer sending back the money from his Bitcoin wallet to yours). Because then they will take the opportunity to convince you to make an even larger deposit. Many victims always start off with a careful approach of ""depositing a small amount and testing the legitimacy by testing the withdrawal application"". And the scammers know this.

h3g54be,Karatekan,145,"I don’t think either of his points are very accurate.

Bitcoin isn’t anonymous, it’s publicly recorded on a ledger. The people making and receiving payments can be anonymous, but both researchers and law enforcement have proved perfectly capable of figuring out who those people are. If anything, cash is more anonymous, and most crime is domestic. In the next 10 years they are going to start going after people on back taxes, and it REALLY won’t feel anonymous anymore

And Bitcoin is 12 years old at this point, and it has already crashed and exceeded those previous highs. It may be volatile, but that doesn’t mean it is a novelty. It could still crash to zero tomorrow, but people are buying it based on a perception of future value and can extrapolate based on past performance, which makes me think it probably won’t.

I think Bitcoin is eventually going be subsumed, not as a cryptocurrency, but as an asset. Developed countries are probably going to take some of the features of crypto to make their own currencies easier to use and transfer, and companies are going to start ICO’s instead of going public to raise money",2021-06-30 00:22:26
