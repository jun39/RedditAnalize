h3osc2q,Pickinanameainteasy,161,"I like both XLM and XMR, i know these are both pretty big, but i think their potential is slept on.

Before I got into crypto i was already into digital privacy, in fact it is one of the things that attracted me to bitcoin in the first place.

I believe we are headed to a digital privacy crisis, in many ways we are already there but things can still get worse. As authoritarian privacy practices continue to develop on the web, i predict a big surge in privacy coins and I believe monero has the best tech among the options. If major exchanges ban them it will only drive the price by making it more scarce and there will always be ways to exchange it.

As for XLM, I think it will take off in the developing world. Due to its extremely fast network and extremely low fees it can accomplish the borderless payment system that BTC was supposed to be. While I don't think the currency is perfect, i think it could also start to break into the smart contract game. Its very developer friendly because it does not require devs to learn a new coding language, instead its uses a series of sdks to allow devs to write stellar contracts and transactions in their favorite languages like python and javascript. It has the name recognition, so while i don't see it as an ethereum killer i still think it has a chance to get a nice chunk of smart contract market share. bullish",2021-07-01 23:47:05

But that makes it problematic, because the illegal acitvity is very high with this coin. But that's not an issue for me. If you want to make such things, there will always be a way ![gif](emote|xmr2_emote|xmr2)",2021-07-01 20:40:38

https://news.yahoo.com/china-bitcoin-crackdown-trillion-dollar-103308054.html
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Saylor, CEO and founder of MicroStrategy has criticized China’s ongoing action against Bitcoin (BTC), saying it will prove to be “a trillion-dollar mistake.”
&gt; 
&gt; Appearing on Bloomberg Technology, the entrepreneur told Emily Chang, “China had 50% market share of bitcoin and they were generating $10 billion a year, in a business that was growing 100% a year, year-over-year.”
&gt; 
&gt; He went on to opine that the Chinese government’s crackdown has “squeezed the [bitcoin] industry out of China.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Saylor also said that this action is a tragedy for Chinese miners. Over the last few weeks, the crackdown forced miners to move their operations overseas, with the United States proving a popular destination. More specifically Texas, due to their cheap energy prices and pro-crypto government. Reports indicate that Bitmain, Blockcap, Argo Blockchain, and Great American Mining are rumored to have moved their operations there.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami, said earlier in the month that his city would welcome the displaced miners. 
&gt; 
&gt; MicroStrategy increases BTC holdings
&gt; Emily Chang also dedicated part of her interview with Saylor to discuss the current BTC dip. On June 21, MicroStrategy added a further 13,005 BTC to its already considerable holding, which now totals at over 100,000 BTC. Valued in excess of $3 billion. 
&gt; 
&gt; Asserting that the CEO had “bought the dip”, Ms Chang then asked if he had considered the possibility that the dip was actually “part of a prolonged slide.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Saylor answered that China’s “rushed exodus of capital and mining” is currently driving the crypto market dynamic.
&gt; 
&gt; He went on to refer to his company’s own strategy as “long-term” and assessed that BTC is for property what the iPhone is for music. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Bitcoin is the dematerialization of property,” he explained. “We’re sucking the value out of gold and real estate and other property assets and collectibles and art. We’re putting it on a blockchain, we’re giving it to the people. It’s a long-term trend; it’s a million times more efficient than hauling your property around on your back.”
&gt; 
&gt; The CEO later took to Twitter to reiterate some main points from his interview. In one tweet, he said “If you want to give joy to 5 billion people, you need digital music. If you want to give knowledge to 5 billion people, you need digital books. If you want to give wealth to 5 billion people, you need digital property.”",2021-07-01 02:59:36

h3nqim5,cryptoripto123,97,"Would you invest an additional $100k into ETF funds today for long term savings? If so, then ask yourself if you are willing to spend $100k on a riskier asset like Bitcoin.

As others have said, only invest what you can afford to lose. And if you're going into this with the mentality that you're going to get rich, which it seems like your post is suggesting. Converting your savings into BTC is a huge change. What I prefer people focus on is look at future investments. If you're going to invest $20k in the next year or so, what if you split that up $15k traditional investments and $5k crypto?

h3ksmrz,Longjumping-Crow6550,79,"As the mom of teenagers I have a few things to say. (NFA)

 #1 - Currently Crypto is straight up gambling, but with decent odds. 
#2 - Learn early in life to diversify, that is super important. 
#3 - Don't stress about it too much, if you lose it all $200 is not much and you have decades to re-earn it.
 #4 - The old rules of investing still apply, put your age worth (in percentage) in safe investments and the rest up to 100 in risky investments. (So at 16 years old 84% can be moderate to high risk)
#5 - Good for you for looking at something with potential to change your life. (Instead of the usual teenage expenditures of energy drinks and junk food)

Yes, these are fantastic news for Bitcoin:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin mining gets more decentralized.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin mining gets more clean (renewable energy sources).
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin miners in other countries become more profitable.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Bitcoin miners all around the world get cheap mining rigs from China.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * Mining difficulty automatically adjusts as per protocol, neutralizing the effects of less (or more) mining rigs coming on/off line.
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the FUD about: “China controls Bitcoin!” (China will have no miners, no exchanges, no nothing to ‘control’)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the FUD about: “Bitcoin uses dirty energy!” (Bitcoin mining uses mainly clean energy but in China part of the mining was being done with coal).
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * This kills the recurrent FUD: “China bans Bitcoin!” (there’s nothing left to ‘ban’ for them in the future).",2021-07-01 03:01:57

h3miqci,CoopTrading,70,"Hey buddy I’ll be honest with you it could go either way my reason for this is - it is very oversold and that could indicate most traders expect the price to continue depreciating - however it also indicates (in that number range right there lol without looking through a few more indicators for confirmation) that the security is oversold and a price rebound could be coming. However with the recent turn of events most people are predicting the price of mains to fall a bit more (trust me I know none of us want it) and many events could trigger that. For instance a Bitcoin billionaire passed away yesterday. Meaning his family has inherited one billion dollars. What reason do they have to hold? They’ve got more than enough either way right? A sale like that would drop us to below 30k which would no doubt trigger stop losses and bring our price down to close to 20k (or fretfully even worse) 

HOWEVER if they do hold - and or sell bit by bit - then we may be able to continue with our accumulation phase which is what leads us back into a bull run. That being said all I’ve referenced was the price of mains - WE also have allot of great big things going on - however if BTC price falls you can bet BNB will also which makes our liquidity worth less, and tokens worth less, and people sell. 

It is really difficult to say what move to make and when exactly without learning - market psychology- human psychology - emotional intelligence- Japanese candlesticks, and whichever indicators you end up finding work best for you. (Best to learn a good assortment) believe me I know it’s a TOOOON!! But you’ll be able to make incredible choices in the future - behaviorally you will act and feel more intelligent and you will start to see the bigger picture of the overall world. 

I’m sorry that person is an asshole - remember me - if you ever have any questions - even about what I just said please feel free to reach out. I’ll do my best to help explain it in a way anyone can apply and also a more quantitative look at things!! Best of luck!!!",2021-07-01 09:24:01

Hardforks are much more common in Ethereum than in Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is still a WIP, they need to use hardforks to incorporate new upgrades. In almost all of the hardforks 100% of the ETH community agrees to switch over to the new forked chain.

There was a hardfork back in April 2021, and another one is planned for later this month. The pre-April Ethereum chain was totally abandoned after that fork, since it wasn't controversial. 

The DAO fork was unique in the sense that it was extremely controversial and some people decided to keep that original chain going. 

Ethereum classic is still functioning, but there are very few projects built on it -- the NFTs and DeFi projects are built on Ethereum.

Most developers, most development tools, most widely known...

This means you have a larger pool of people you can hire from and more tools readily available that those potential hires have experience with. The ethereum community has done a lot of trial and error already, which means the company using the platform won't have to make these mistakes themselves (and suffer the costly consequences...) .
Just imagine them releasing NFTs and get hacked in their contracts, resulting in financial damage for their customers! 


TLDR:
To my knowledge, no other smart contract platform has so many developers, tools and experiences under their belt. Also, it's the most well known ""brand"" other than Bitcoin.

h3ynexb,Ossified_Squirrel,261,"Bitcoin wallets can be sorted into two categories. Custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are like unsecured bank accounts. Kind of like banks in the old west. When you put your money in a custodial wallet, the company that runs that wallet has your actual money, but you have access to it. If a “bank robber” (aka hacker) robs the old West Bank (custodian) you’re out of luck.

Now usually banks have better security than you normally do, so it might be ok, but there’s nobody to complain to if the custodian gets hacked. Your money is gone. Most exchanges' wallet (coinbase, kraken, etc.) is this kind of wallet.

A non-custodial wallet puts you in full control. You’re responsible for security, and if you lose the wallet no biggie, as long as you have your secure “keys” saved somewhere. Keys to a bitcoin wallet are represented by a series of random words that you can write down or memorize.

As long as you never digitize these words (no pics, no email, etc) just in your head or on paper, you cannot lose your money, and nobody can take it from you by hacking. There is a saying in bitcoin circles: “Not your keys? Not your coin.”

For small amounts of bitcoin, a custodial wallet is no problem. I keep a little bitcoin in a custodial wallet like cash app or coinbase because it’s convenient. For larger amounts of bitcoin, I would highly recommend using a non-custodial wallet.

Here’s a good rule of thumb. Only keep an amount of bitcoin in a custodial wallet that you would feel comfortable with in your real wallet. So if you carry around $100 in your wallet, no biggie. If you lose your wallet, it’s gonna suck, but it’s not the end of the world. Now if you had $5k , you probably wouldn’t carry that in your wallet.

So if you ever get to the point that the bitcoin you have is worth more than you would carry in your wallet, you should move it to a non-custodial wallet where you control the keys. https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/recommended-wallets.html

If this is a ""medium"" amount of money like a month or two of salary, a non-custodial wallet on your phone is fine.

If it starts climbing into a 6-12 month salary or more, I'd recommend a hardware wallet. I really like the Trezor.

Once you get a non-custodial wallet, be sure to protect those seed words they give you for backup. That is your bitcoin, not the hardware device or your phone. If you have those seed words safely stored somewhere, you can recover from any hardware loss.

If you want to go really secure, stamp those words in metal. I like these cause they aren't expensive: https://crypto-keys.com/pages/jameson-lopp-test

Be sure to never digitize those words. Don't take a pic, dont put them on a computer, etc.. Write them on paper (The trezor comes with cards for this) at a minimum, and put them somewhere secure. If you do use paper, make sure they are in waterproof and fireproof envelopes. If you do decide to go with a hardware wallet, buy it directly from the manufacturer. If its tamper evident seals are broken, don't use it.",2021-07-04 06:53:13

h3zqdi6,ChispaCS,180,"Lo traduzco para quien no entienda. Bitcoin tiene un sistema automático por el cual cada cierta cantidad de bloques auto ajusta la dificultad para resolver nuevos bloques. Esto hace que si entra muchísima gente a minar, la siguiente época se aumenta la dificultad. Esto está hecho así para que se resuelva en promedio 1 bloque cada 10 minutos.

En China prohibieron la minería, así que los que están allá se están mudando a diversas partes del mundo. Esto hizo caer la cantidad de mineros en la red e hizo bajar la dificultad. Cuando se terminen de asentar va a volver todo a la normalidad. Un 15% de los mineros abandonaron completamente, según estiman. 

En qué afecta esto al resto de los mineros? Existe una mayor probabilidad para ellos de resolver los bloques. Es como jugar una carrera sin la mitad de los mejores corredores.

En qué afecta esto a nosotros mortales? Nada. Es temporal. La gente que compra placas de video no son los que tienen operaciones de minería a gran escala. Y los mineros en gran escala no minan por el valor del dolar, minan criptos. Ellos ven el mundo en BTC y ETH. Los chinos van a volver a funcionar desde USA y Europa principalmente.

Ahora, si esto no nos afecta, por qué está bajando el precio de las placas de video? Por que por un lado el precio del BTC cayó 50% desde su punto mas alto. Muchos ya no ven incentivo en minar y venden sus placas de video, y ya no hay tanta gente comprándolas para minar por que creen que no vale la pena la inversión. Y por otro lado se está recuperando el stock. Hay tiendas en USA donde ya hay placas de video en estantes. Esto es el principio del fin. Solo es cuestión de tiempo hasta que los que vendan se cansen de esperar que no se las compren. Va a tardar mucho tiempo en que vuelvan a precio de lista.

Y con respecto al mundo cripto, si bien el precio del BTC cayó muchísimo, todo indica que estamos a mitad del ""bull run"" desde un punto de vista técnico. Va a haber una segunda ola de euforia. Esto ya lo tienen en cuenta muchos mineros aficionados, que no se van a ver tentados en dejar de minar ahora y van a seguir para poder vender lo que minaron en unos meses.

Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 


There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties

You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 

You are exposed to exit theft 

You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

You place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence

You potentially reduce the probability that your investment will appreciate in value because no exchanges are doing provable audits and they might be fractional. The more Bitcoin you personally control the more likely it will appreciate in value.

A year or two after its release it was praised for anonymity, and low fees in comparison to central banks, which both proved to be incorrect after what i believe to be the fall of the silk road, and I know, it had to get the bugs sorted out. Then the advantages were directed fully to it being decentralized, running on the blockchain which is to this day its soul purpose ( and to essentially ""stick it"" to the big banks ). The new developments in the crypto world in the last couple years have made incredible advancements. There are certain coins that do not impact the environment, they're fees are nearly non existent, transfer times are sub 1 minute and some even contribute to health care, mineral extraction and other real world applications. I understand the true value per single bitcoin stems from its limit of coins, but where I am lost is how the difference in market caps have managed to stay relatively similar over these recent months, and still, bitcoin leads the majority of coins for price fluctuations. It seems as tho a big part of its price is also related to its nostalgia in the market, seeing as there are many coins in which the advantages and benifits greatly outweigh that of bitcoins. Personally I think there will be a switch in top market caps somewhere down the road once the crypto world starts taking notice to some of these other coins, or im completely out to lunch here. I'm not saying bitcoin is a bad investment, because its not. I'm just saying that there are better options out there, which could end up flipping the narrative.

First, to avoid being put in an asylum or kidnapped to a secret government lab, your 30-year-old ass has to put on a convincing 5-year-old act. That means going to preschool with other kids, suffering through playdates, pretending you can't read, not being able to enjoy the media you like, for years and years. 

You can be smart, but not too smart as to be suspicious. So that's years of grinding through grade school math and reading, dealing with other kids who all know there's something off about you even if the teachers can't tell, and exercising eternal vigilance to avoid being witnessed doing adult things or having adult thoughts. You have no financial resources and no agency. You love your parents, but it's a terrible burden having to play-act the happy child when in reality you don't want to run around on the playground with a bunch of kids. 

You're consigned to at least 10 years of celibacy, and then after that you have to decide between waiting another 15 years for an age-appropriate relationship or basically becoming a pedophile and obtaining sexual gratification from other, actual teenagers, who with your superior life experience are laughably easy to manipulate into giving you that gratification. 

Then, finally, after an entire fake childhood of living a lie and probably becoming an amoral piece of shit, you're finally in a position to start cashing in on your future knowledge (which by now is foggy and 15 years old) and start reaping gains from bitcoin and Tesla. Now you are a 22-year-old multimillionaire with the mind of a 40-year-old, wealthy but completely alone in the world because anyone who spends enough time around you can sense the terrible *wrongness* lurking behind your youthful exterior. Your family is so weirded out by you that they've effectively disowned you. Not a single other person on the planet shares your experience.

- buy our fake money with real money
- create a fake synthetic asset with that fake money at the value of the real asset in the real world.
- speculate with the fake asset.
- get any gains back in fake money
- where did the real money go? I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE ENGINES OF MY NEW LEARJET!

There is literally no reason given to not buy, say, the real $AAPL with real money, and realise gains (or losses) in real money.

I based the above on the following from the article.

""Using Synthetix or Mirror to trade stocks like $AAPL $TSLA $TWTR $AMZN is easier than you might imagine. The way it works is simple.

Users mint (create) synthetic assets by depositing collateral (SNX for Synthetix, UST for Mirror). The collateral is used to back the minted synthetic asset with real value.

Oracles feed the target asset’s price to the platform in real-time, enabling the synthetic to track value accurately.

Traders use Synthetix or Mirror to trade assets like mBTC (mirrored Bitcoin), sUSD (synthetic USD), or popular equities like mGME (mirrored Gamestop).

Minters retain a reward for minting and creating liquidity for exchange-traded assets paid in the protocol's native asset (SNX or MIR).""",2021-07-08 21:05:38

h4fl6ij,applextrent,68,"Right there with you.

People don’t understand what’s coming. 

The supply chain is fucked. I was finally able to get my hands on more guns and ammo again, but food costs are insane, my rent keeps increasing, theres no rentals available in my area, I’ve never seen so many homes for sale in my area, but yet the price of homes is increasing despite a massive spike in supply. Homes are selling kind of, but to who I have no idea. Some of them seem to be sitting empty after being bought and they’re not being rented out. It makes no sense. 

Meanwhile I still can’t find all-terrain tires for my Jeep due to nation wide supply shortages.

The housing market is about to crash while we’re about to hit hyper inflation, so both the value of property could drop but the dollar could weaken just as much if not more so home prices might actually increase despite the market crashing. It’s going to be weird. Buy Bitcoin I guess?

Meanwhile the vaccinated are starting to realize they’ve been had. The boomers seem to be losing their minds from the vaccines. I swear most of the boomers I know who are vaccinated aged considerably in the past few months post vaccines, and several of them are showing dementia like signs when previously they were fine. Several of my Dad’s friends have had to have pace makers installed post vaccination. Many of the younger people I know are having vaccine regret now and they’re finally starting to wake up.

It turns out many people who said “the side effects are just the vaccine working” are still having said side effects indefinitely and now they’re starting to get “breakthrough” cases and they’re slowly starting to realize they’ve been had. Both in the sense that the vaccines don’t work, cause more harm than good, and that Covid is not as big as a deal as they said it was.

More and more people are coming to terms with the fact that Biden has dementia, and probably didn’t win the election. Everyone universally seems to agree that Kamala Harris is awful.

There’s basically a Cold War brewing with China and Russia, and possibly even a civil war.

The everything bubble is at bursting point but they need something to blame that crash on, such as a cyber attack taking out power/internet for just long enough to blame.

To truly ""Get it"" requires a lot more than I can explain in a reddit comment, so all of this is simplifying to some degree, but I'll give the next step up from that comment.

Effectively you use your computer, usually the Graphics Processing Unit(because it is more optimized for the type of calculations/throughput needed with this) to verify sections of the Bitcoin blockchain. 

The Bitcoin blockchain is basically a massive linked collection of all records of Bitcoin transactions, which have a hash(unique fingerprint kinda) of the previous record.

In return for running this verification, you are given a tiny tiny tiny fraction of 1 BTC. Which is what people mean by ""mining""

There is complicated math behind the fact that as more Bitcoin is ""mined"" you get less and less for each verification.

And once you get Bitcoin, there is a whole grey/black market for exchanging BTC for other currencies, storing, etc.

This is a huge oversimplification of Bitcoin, and almost everything I just said can be ""Well actually'd"". So...

So she got mad and essentially called them thieves and said they were just leeching off of her work. FitGirl and a bunch of repackers didn’t appreciate that, so they made a statement saying they will never repack another game of hers again. And they said that they aren’t stealing anything from her especially money because they leave her requests for donations message in tact (EMPRESS has a message in her cracks where she asks for donations and gives you a Bitcoin address so you can donate money to her the first time you launch the game)

It actually started so much drama that even crackwatch intervened and had a vote as to whether she was crossing the line (because on top of all that EMPRESS was also doing philosophy posts on crackwatch that people didn’t like and apparently she offended some people because of one of those posts). Anyways they voted that she could only post her nfo’s from now on.

EMPRESS apologized to everyone in a post, especially FitGirl, and acknowledged that crackwatch wasn’t the right place for her philosophy posts (thus her own subreddit was created).

Most people don’t realize how complicated major payment settlement networks are, how many layers are involved going from credit card company to the central bank, and how long it actually takes to settle payments using the legacy system.

Given that, most people don’t realize how valuable a payment network like Bitcoin really is.

Your premise is flawed. You treat this like a get rich scheme. I've been in crypto for over a decade. This is what these do. They have these remarkable Bulls and Bubbles then they pop and settle down. They normally settle down to higher when they started their Bull Run. Couple years later, they boom and increase in price again. It is what has been the cycle, bitcoin has done it 4-5 times already. You just came late this round. Pay your dues and wait it out like everybody else. Right now, the getting is good right now on RVN. Look at how much you can mine.Eventually you will not be able to mine like this. Fill your bag up during the Bear and when the Bull comes back make a profit if you want.   


I remember mining bitcoin in 2014/2015 and it had a huge spike and then came crashing down. I was making 1 bitcoin every couple of days. My house was hot, my electric bill was about $600-$800 a month. I was paying for electricity out of pocket. I admit, I had to stop, I even tried to sell my miners. But it was a bear market and nobody wanted to buy my miners. So I delisted them and waited for awhile. I eventually decided I could pay an extra $200 a month in electric. Then I mined and I mined, and I eventually was able to bring the other miners back on line. I would forget about my miners. Became just another thing I would have to check on every once in awhile to bring it back online or whatever. Days became weeks, became months, became years. Then 2018 hit, and Bitcoin went up to $20,000 each. I was handsomely reward for staying the course. I retired and I just study science and Physics now. I do what I want.

Give it some time, things will happen on RVN coin. Specially because Ethereum is effectively slicing GPU miners out of the network. That will push miners to look for the most profitable coin, and that will more than likely be RVN. EIP-1559 will make Ethereum and RVN pretty equal in monthly profits with bitcoin at 5 cents. If it ticks up even one penny it will be more profitable than Ethereum to mine. This will increase interest and use, will create a loud buzz and then the halving comes in January.   


Stop Mining or Keep Mining, either way I'll be here mining and getting a Kawzillion RVN. Right now it is 0.05 cents each. If it goes to 10 cents a coin, then right now, I am making more mining RAVEN today than ethereum. I'm very long on RVN Coin. I just make it and forget about it. Time will age it like a fine wine. That has been my experience. Not financial advice or whatever, I'm a moron, I only know math and physics. Don't listen to me about money. I eat paste.",2021-07-11 01:35:01

Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

Meanwhile...  

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

a bitcoin cannot be used at a grocery store, it cannot be used to buy an average house on the market, etc. unless you find a specific person or organization looking to invest into bitcoin most people do not accept it as tender.

I fully believe there will be a Crypto-USD in the future, a crypto-euro, etc soon. but that is a death knell for current crypto coins. why would you buy a coin no one uses as currency when you can get a real currency coin? and as people go to pull out their money they will see how quickly and how badly the price of an asset with no inherent value can be.

h4ykex6,MDCCCLV,90,"""	Conventional wisdom has it that the lower a central bank sets interest rates, the faster the economy grows. But the longer rates stay ultra-low, it’s not the economy that grows — it’s inequality. 
	There are signs of worsening inequality across the U.S. economy. But recent surges trace back to a major change after 2008, which transformed how America fights economic recessions. 

Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

	The Fed, which controls America’s monetary policy, is mired in conventional thinking, even though its policy since 2008 has been unconventional in scale, scope and omnipotence. Adhering to its “lower rates are better” axiom, the Fed has kept “real” U.S. short-term interest rates at — or even below — zero, after taking inflation into account. The Fed now plans to keep rates ultra, ultra low until about 2023, even if inflation ticks up. 
	This results in even wider wealth inequalities as the gap between rich and everyone else grows. 
	Is the stunning growth in U.S. inequality all the Fed’s fault? Of course not. Tax policy has favored the wealthy and corporations for decades, to name one other cause. But income and wealth inequality result from who gets the money. And the Fed has unrivaled power over who gets the money across markets, communities and even families. 

	The Fed controls the flow of money, and it flows to the wealthy 

	The Fed’s main tools for fighting recessions are twofold: those ultra-low interest rates and a policy known as quantitative easing, or Q.E. Q.E is what happens when the Fed buys up assets, like bonds, which keeps money flowing and gives banks lots of liquidity that is supposed to make lending easier. 
	To get an idea of the magnitude of the Fed’s role, take a look at its portfolio. Assets the Fed has taken out of the economy as part of Q.E. now stand at $8.1 trillion, or about one-third of gross domestic product. 

A growing portfolio

To stimulate the economy after 2008, the Federal Reserve increased its balance sheet and slashed interest rates. The current coronavirus pandemic sent that strategy into overdrive, creating the largest balance sheet on record and the lowest interest rates in modern U.S. history.

Source: FRED 

	No one else could own that much, meaning no one but the Fed has so much power over the economy’s winners and losers. 
	The Fed’s approach is premised on trickle-down expectations, adopted in the early 2000s. U.S. central bankers believe the higher that markets fly and the more that the wealthy spend, the better that everyone else will be. 
	In truth, this policy works only for the wealthy. 
	Although the Fed’s huge Q.E.-based portfolio initially prevented still worse economic mayhem when the 2008 and 2020 financial crises struck, its benefits over time were 10 times greater for stock-market prices than for overall economic prosperity. 

Who’s helped by stimulus?

Using a model, researchers estimated the impact of an increase in quantitative easing on the economy. They found stocks saw 10 times the growth of G.D.P.

Source: Bank for International Settlements 

	Ultra-low interest rates are meant to spur growth. But they stop having a beneficial effect when they dip so low that they distort savings incentives and instead drive speculative investing, like in Bitcoin or GameStop, to cite two current examples. 

	Savings, home values and stocks are up — but these also favor the rich 

	Many Americans own stock, but most stocks – 54 percent – are owned by the 1 percent and much of the rest by the next 9 percent. 
	The same can be said of real estate. Low interest rates set by the Fed spur lending, creating more demand to purchase homes and forcing prices higher. Rising equity is great for existing homeowners, but richer Americans who own property are the ones who benefit most. 

Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (wealth and equities); Zillow (home value index); Capital I.Q. (stock price). 

	What about Americans who are trying to get ahead not through assets, but through saving? Even low-income households are doing their best to save a surprising amount of money. But the Fed’s interest-rate policy robs savers of any interest they might see. 
	The inequality impact of the invest-you-gain, save-you-lose conundrum is clear. To understand why, imagine two people trying to grow $10,000 through investing or saving. 

Low rates hurt savers

The Fed’s low interest rate environment causes stocks to surge, but everyday savers struggle to keep up with inflation.

	The calculations above show that even if average Americans could save $10,000, they would be falling far behind investors. After inflation, their thrift would net only $9,529 – a flat-out loss. 

	What is the Fed for? 

	The Fed’s role is spelled out under its statutory charter, which establishes the road map for unraveling the inequality it helped create. 
	The charter’s first goal is “full employment,” meaning pretty much everyone who wants a job has one. This would get a meaningful, immediate boost if the Fed reversed its cheap-debt policies that lead companies to take out debt to fund investor profits, instead of funding new plants or products. 
	Another goal is “price stability,” best measured by what it costs for a middle-class household to make ends meet. The measure the Fed uses misses the cost increases obscuring a household-to-debt build-up for all but the wealthiest. The Fed thus misses the long-term risks this debt poses to financial security, home ownership, and a secure retirement. 
	The law has a third Fed goal: “moderate” interest rates. Rates below zero after taking inflation into account are anything but moderate, so they must be gradually raised, starting now. 
	The current recovery is being driven not by the Fed but by the stimulus bills passed by Congress. After that spending fades, we will be a nation in which at least a quarter of middle-class households still can’t even afford the medical treatment they require, lower-income millennials have student debt equal to at least 372 percent of income, and still more won’t be able to handle even a $400 unexpected expense. 
	This is wealth without prosperity, a violation of every tenet in the Fed’s statutory mandate. Instead of regretting inequality even as it makes inequality worse, the Fed can and must quickly rewrite policy with a new goal in mind: shared prosperity, measured by how most of us do, not by how high the market flies.

Uni v3 just went live on Optimism. Which means the full Optimism launch isn't far off - with countless more dapps available. If BSC is any indication, we'll get a shit load of speculative new dapps. Most of them trash, but it's the activity and liquidity that counts - and in the end, it all settles on L1 and pays gas to Ethereum.

Then we have Arbitrum which will release in the same time frame, with its own share of dapps. Looking forward to Bancor on Arbitrum.

These two will be in fierce competition as they will be the only two general purpose rollups in town. Competition is perfect as they'll be looking to incentivize people to use their rollup.

Next, we have EIP-1559 launching on Aug 4th, forever burning a big part of the gas fees and thus forever accruing value to ETH. Yes, gas fees are low right now, but I expect them to take off again as soon as rollups take over the entire DeFi and NFT markets. Once everyone is on L2, nobody cares about high L1 fees anymore - the high fees narrative will die and it will instead be encouraged as it accrues value to ETH holders.

Beyond all this, it looks like a Bitcoin ETF is in the cards for later this year, which of course implies that an ETH ETF will not be far off, likely in 2022.

And of course, we get the merge either late 2021 or early 2022, which has incredible impact on the supply side of Ethereum - the Cliffening. 

I'm a firm believer that, if we take all of this into account, the bear will be a small one, as the supply of ETH is getting scarce as hell in early 2022. Two to three times the impact of a Bitcoin halving.

There's a real possibility that ETH will rise from the ashes of the bear in Q2 2022 and flips Bitcoin in the process. In the end, it's just logical. If ETH has been outperforming BTC for extended periods of time despite having much higher inflation, and we reduce that inflation to be significantly below Bitcoin's,

then ETH becomes a higher risk higher return asset that basically eliminates the ""higher risk"" part and just becomes the better returns asset.

Call this hopium, but I sincerely belive this is how it's gonna play out.

Just take a look at crypto twitter, projects releasing new versions of their protocols left and right, building DAOs, governance systems, collaborations, NFTs imbuing the entire space, teams for the first time deploying on rollups and experiencing instant settlement and low fees.

To anyone glued to the charts in worry and fear, I say: it doesn't matter. At all. ETH is in a period of rapid transformation and change. Come back 1-2 years from now and I think it will surpass all of our expectations.

Time in the market beats timing the market. While we wait for the markets to grok what we grok, use your ETH and other assets to generate passive income, or stake your ETH if your tax jurisdiction isn't shit, and stack gwei.

This is the wei.",2021-07-14 17:56:50

&gt;**TYLER NIKNAM WAS** getting out of Texas. Niknam, 30, is a top streamer on Twitch, where he’s better known as Trainwrecks to his 1.5 million followers. For hours on end, Niknam was hitting the slots on Stake.com, an online cryptocurrency casino and his most prominent Twitch sponsor, to live audiences of 25,000. He’d been winning big, sometimes as much as $400,000 in crypto in one fell swoop, and he never seemed to go broke. The problem? It wasn’t allowed.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you visit Stake on a US-based browser, a message will quickly pop up on the site: “Due to our gaming license, we cannot accept players from the United States.” Though Stake doesn't possess a gambling license in any state, Nikam and other US gamblers easily circumvent this by using VPNs. Promoting gambling sites that cannot operate in the US and making money by referring US residents to them may constitute promoting illegal gambling, legal experts told WIRED.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Canada needs to happen asap,” Niknam wrote in a private Discord DM to Felix “xQc” Lengyel, 25, Twitch’s number-two streamer. Lengyel briefly streamed slots but stopped in June. “You cannot show you’re on Stake at all.” A few days later, Niknam arrived in Canada, where he settled into a routine gambling in a mostly empty apartment, sometimes for over a dozen hours a day. (Niknam did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch is in the middle of a gambling boom, fueled by the rise of so-called “crypto casinos”: websites where gamblers can purchase cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum for use in digital games of chance like slots, blackjack, and baccarat. Sites like Stake and Roobet are paying popular streamers to play the casino games on their channels, sometimes offering tens of thousands of dollars an hour according to streamers and experts interviewed by WIRED. One gambling website, Duelbits, apparently offered top gambling streamer, Adin Ross, between $1.4 and $1.6 million a month to stream slots on Twitch, according to a Discord DM between himself and Duelbits. (Ross, who was recently suspended from Twitch for using his phone while driving, did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment. Neither did Stake, Roobet, or Duelbits.)  
&gt;  
&gt;A WIRED review found that 64 of the top 1,000 most-trafficked Twitch streamers have streamed crypto slots or advertised sponsorship deals from crypto gambling websites, although the trend gained real traction in April and May of 2021. Some streams attract over 100,000 live viewers. Many of these streamers are members of Twitch’s Partner Program, which gives top creators access to additional support and features like increased revenue sharing. It’s Twitch’s highest tier of streamers, and the company says it looks for people “who can act as role models to the community”—a community where 21 percent of users are between 13 and 17 years old.  
&gt;  
&gt;One thing it might not be good to take these role models’ advice on? The perils of losing money gambling. Some streamers may be playing with house money. Keeping up the appearance of painless fun, crypto casinos sponsoring these streamers refresh their digital wallets with money, according to videos, leaked chats, and interviews with individuals knowledgeable about crypto gambling on Twitch.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It wasn’t my money,” Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo said on his Twitch channel in June. Rinaudo, 26, says he was getting offers to do gambling streams for $35,000 an hour—double the price tag of his typical sponsorships—for 10 hour-long streams over the course of a month. (One individual who works with multiple Twitch streamers says that tens of thousands of dollars per hour is normal for these streams.) He had streamed gambling earlier this year, just five times in April, and says sponsors were fleshing out his crypto casino account, once with $5,000. Plus, he’d advertise affiliate links with attractive discounts. Despite the lucrative business opportunity, Rinaudo decided to stop working with online crypto casinos in June.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Morality came into play. It did. I felt shitty doing any type of gambling sponsorship,” he later said on stream. “And I know people are like, Mizkif, but you do sponsors all fucking day. If you download Dungeons and Dragons, what’s the worst that happens? You lose $40 and a couple of hours of your life. Gambling is different.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Online gambling is regulated by a combination of federal and state laws in the US. Gambling websites need a license to operate in individual states—doesn’t matter whether they’re operating with hard USD or digital currency. Many crypto casinos, like Stake and Duelbits, are based offshore in countries like Curaçao, and do not have those licenses. Yet they are easy to access from the US through a VPN. (More reputable online gambling sites ask users for more data points to confirm their location.) “While \[these sites\] block the US, they do not prevent access from people within the US,” says Jeff Ifrah, an attorney who specializes in online gambling law. Ifrah says he recently has been fielding lots of questions from US-based Twitch streamers and their representatives. While legal experts say it can be tough to prosecute these websites, their US-based promoters may be open to scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;Taking sponsorships from and encouraging illegal gambling can land streamers in sticky legal territory, Ifrah says. He warns streamers against advertising these crypto gambling sites while streaming from the US. “My advice to them is that, basically, the underlying activity is illegal.” It still happens, though. “There’s a lot of money in it,” he says. “Streamers have told me, ‘Hey, I don't want to just give this up. This is a big opportunity for me because these sites pay a lot of money.’”  
&gt;  
&gt;There may be big opportunities, but they can come with big risks. “A lot of the gambling promoted on Twitch is illegal or unregulated and poses definite risks for consumers, vulnerable adults and adolescents or underage children,” says Keith Whyte, the executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, an organization that promotes comprehensive policies to support healthy, legal gambling. Because these sites often aren’t as vetted as sites that are legal in the US, experts question whether their odds are fair and what their backends look like, says Whyte. “It’s a fairly common tactic in the unregulated gambling industry to inflate win rates.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Gambling experts interviewed by WIRED say that right now, it’s on Twitch to act. “The health of their users is something to be concerned about,” says Whyte. “They have enormous incentive to police content that is either illegal, unregulated or potentially harmful.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch’s terms of service prohibit illegal activity on its website and ask users to comply with the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines around advertising. With that said, it does not specifically ban gambling streams. Crypto gambling is flourishing on Twitch, frankly, because it is allowed to. By contrast, livestreaming competitors YouTube and Facebook Gaming prohibit streaming online gambling sites that have not been previously reviewed. Twitch also has gambling-related categories, such as slots, which have no age limit to prevent younger viewers from watching (some stream titles say “18+”).  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch tells WIRED, “We strictly prohibit illegal content and activity on the service, and take action in all verified incidents of illegal gambling that are reported to us. Our Community Guidelines make clear that ‘\[Streamers\] must respect all applicable local, national, and international laws while using our services. Any content or activity featuring, encouraging, offering, or soliciting illegal activity is prohibited.’” The company adds that its goal is to foster “a safe, positive experience for all users of our service” and that it is “closely monitoring gambling content.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Twitch has had to deal with gambling-related controversies on its platform before. Years ago, top streamers gambled with cosmetics from the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Skins gambling was an unregulated frontier that soon became massively popular—and filled with allegations of foul play. The first Twitch streamer to reach one million, and later two million, followers was Tom “Syndicate” Cassell. Cassell drew in huge audiences gambling and winning big on the site CSGOLotto.com, but he also reached a settlement with the FTC in late 2017 for failing to disclose his status as vice president of CSGOLotto.com while promoting it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Streamer Moe ""m0E"" Assad, who was sponsored by skin gambling site CSGO Diamonds, played with house money without disclosing it to viewers. CSGODiamonds also later admitted that it told Assad the outcome of games in advance so he could fix the results. Gaming celebrity Richard “FaZe Banks” Bengston, co-owner of esports team FaZe Clan, recently said he made $200,000 a day running his own skin-gambling site, which was incorporated on the Caribbean island of Antigua. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive publisher Valve cracked down on skin gambling sites, in 2016 sending cease-and-desist notices to 20 websites.

h550co0,mark_able_jones_,87,"\&gt;Too bad for Elon Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56

Says the Bitcoin mining council, which is filled with Bitcoin miners and not climate scientists. The mining council also claimed a huge jump in renewables just after China kicked out miners from Sichuan, which is where 50% of bitcoin mining was taking place and which used 90% renewable energy (hydro). 

The reality is that Bitcoin mining does require a shit ton of power. Most of it is not from renewables, and when it is from renewables, we must also consider whether that energy is diverting renewable energy from a community and forcing that community to use more fossil fuels.

You are making up a strawman here: Elon's alleged desire for Tesla to get into the business of selling mining credits for bitcoin in the USA.

h52jg31,sahildeONE,64,"you're absolutely right. There's a lot of new blockchains, protocols, dapps and it's yet to be seen which ones succeed on the basis of clear utility or adoption. I think this is an outcome of where we are in the technology cycle for blockchain. In 2018, when Harmony started, the most difficult and crucial problem to solve was scalability. Over the next two years, we saw several scalability solutions coming live.  But going live doesn't mean much if we don't attract developers, applications and users.  


Harmony has a scalable architecture due to sharding. So we're not concerned about scalability anymore, or as much. Rather, we're heavily focussed on a)bringing existing blockchain developers (from Ethereum) to deploy applications without any friction. b) Connecting with other important and growing blockchains through Bridges. c) Ensuring secure and on-chain wallets with seamless UX to bring the next 100M users.  


We've been working hard on each of the above initiatives. We have full Ethereum compatibility, it takes a few minutes to deploy Ethereum apps on Harmony, eg: Sushiswap was deployed 7 days ago and already has great traction. We have bridged with Ethereum, BSC, Terra and coming up with Bitcoin, Polkadot bridges. We're believe in a multi-chain world and therefore we're building the pipes and tunnels to make the future Dapps frictionless for end-users. Finally, you'll see some more developments on the keyless, on-chain wallet primitives.

We are working towards open-development and open-governance, which will be the backbone of our growing ecosystem. 

Each blockchain has their own strengths and approaches, but the above is what we believe in and are confident that this will be our long-term differentiator.",2021-07-14 04:18:52

&gt;Prominent figures from the skins gambling scene are now getting involved in crypto casinos. Assad has been gambling on Twitch since last year; now that gambling has blown up on Twitch, he is making bank with his Roobet sponsorship between games of the first-person shooter Valorant. Bengston, 29, is also sponsored by Roobet. A native on YouTube, Bengston made his Twitch debut early last month alongside crypto gambling streamer Adin Ross. He played slots on Roobet, and spoke highly of his sponsor: “They treat us so well, fly us out to Mexico for these things. Full compliance, by the fucking books baby.” (Speaking on Bengston’s behalf, FaZe Clan declined to comment.)On his stream, from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Bengston’s account starts with $15,000 in Bitcoin. He’s playing “Mines” (think Minesweeper, but with cryptocurrency stakes). 40,000 people are watching. His first bet is $2,000. He blows through the $15,000 in 40 seconds. “I need to ask them for more bread,” says Bengston. “We’re gonna pretend that just didn’t happen.” In his next round, $7,000 becomes $0 immediately. Dismissing Mines, Bengston switches to Slots. There’s $15,000 in his account. The Roobet window is not on screen between when he loses all his money and money enters the account. At the end of the stream, he is up $203,000. He gives thousands in Roobet funds to his viewers.

h581mqo,MoBitcoinMoProblems,67,"I can give you my personal experience on this. I cashed out about $5 million a few months ago. I didn't use OTC, just a regular reputable exchange, where I made a bunch of limit orders and waiting for them to be hit, a checking account at a large bank where I wired the proceeds, and a brokerage account where the proceeds ended up.

I could have figured out if my costs basis was $0.40 or $1.50 for each bitcoin sold, but I just didn't bother. I've reported and will continue to report all ancient bitcoin as having a cost basis of zero. The IRS doesn't seem to mind.

I did contact my bank a few years prior to get a read on whether they would give me a hard time for shuffling a few million dollars through them, and whether funds coming from bitcoin proceeds would be an issue with them. While they stopped well short from giving me any guarantees, they indicated they had no fundamental issue with any of it, and as it turned out, they didn't mind when I actually did it.

It's probably a good idea track all the addresses you've used on a spreadsheet, walk back each of your transactions on the blockchain, figure out which addresses were yours, which weren't, and what each transaction from the latter to the former meant exactly. It's useful when an exchange asks you questions, it's useful when you prepare your taxes, and it would be useful if the IRS ever decided to audit you. My CPA has seen my little spreadsheet with those details, but so far nobody else has needed to. 

A couple of months after selling, my exchange contacted me to ask me for paper documentation on the origin of my coins. Alas Slush's pool wasn't really into paperwork back then, and even if they were, they would have had no idea who I was. So I handwaved that as best as I could, using a few details from my little spreadsheet, and somehow it has been enough to satisfy the exchange. YMMV.

This is a simple, and perhaps naive approach. There are other ways to go about this. For example, /u/nullc wrote about [a more sophisticated approach to cashing out](/r/fatFIRE/comments/lz2kzs/how_to_sell_bitcoin_in_the_usa/gq1zrfj/?context=3), which involves options.

The last piece I'd mention is that you're going to be on the hook for 25% of your profits as federal taxes, plus whatever your state wants on top of it. If you're interested in charitable giving, it could be a good time to look into Donor Advised Funds, and the ability to deposit appreciated assets into them as a way to both get a large tax deduction upfront and maximize your donated value. The DAF will typically sell the bitcoins you deposit right away, after which you'll be able to (direct the DAF to) invest them into conventional instruments as you see fit. Oh, and start thinking about quarterly estimated taxes, they might start becoming suddenly relevant to you. Do you have a CPA? You probably should have a CPA.",2021-07-15 10:24:49

Text moves too fast to read.  The changing of the font sizes is confusing and hard to read.

The flashing makes it uncomfortable - you want people to ENJOY watching an ad, not worry they're going to have a seizure.

Starting the ad with the text ""Bitcoin"", then ""Ethereum"", makes the first impression feel that it's a Bitcoin or Ethereum ad.  If this was \*really\* an ad, most people would have switched off before you got to anything about Nano - you would have promoted two competitors instead of Nano.

Also, by comparing it to two other cryptocurrencies, rather than something in it's own right, you're only really going to be understood by \*existing\* crypto-nerds.  Surely that's not what we want, right?  It'd be better for an ad to resonate with people who \*aren't\* currently crypto-fans.

You need to work out how to communicate / demonstrate what makes Nano special, without comparing it to other cryptos, and using language your mum would understand.

What do you actually want people to do after watching this?  There's no ""call to action""... a good ad should call on people to DO something.

I won't go in on the design-side of things because that's subjective and not my day job :)

BTC = +241.48%
ETH = +691.62%
ADA = +841.27%

Bitcoin is important because it is the ""spokeperson"" of crypto driving awareness and adoption in the legacy financial ecosystem. 

Ethereum is important because it is the first project to demonstrate that blockchain isn't just a technology to build speculative assets. Developers can build amazing dApps that can be used by anyone. 

Cardano is important because it is the next evolution of blockchain tech with a well-designed governance protocol, clean proof-of-stake, and a strong and thoughtful academic community backing it. 

Rising tides lift all ships.",2021-07-19 10:29:58
h5n3mkj,MentalUsurpation,93,"**1. Ethereum ETFs are here.**

Exchange-Traded Funds for Ethereum are finally here and will gain popularity really quickly. First Canada, and now Brazil, have approved ETH ETFs. At the same time, multiple ETH ETF applications are waiting in line at the SEC in the USA which, once approved, will result in major money pouring into Ethereum.

**2. Ethereum takes the throne for innovation.**

There is no doubt. When it comes to innovating, Ethereum is king. It has the biggest developmental lead, and its recent releases of multiple layer two features really stresses this. Uniswap, which is the biggest DEX on ETH, has just announced its integration of Optimism for scaling.

**3. The triple halving is on its way.**

As of now, ETH annual inflation is around 4.5%. When ETH upgrades to 2.0, it will drop to around 0.5% only. This equals 3 Bitcoin halvings! This is surely a bullish sign.

**4. EIP 1559 to be implemented next month.**

The London Hard Fork EIP 1559 will burn the fees paid for some transactions. This will eventually turn ETH into a deflationary currency.

**5. Proof-of-Stake coming VERY SOON.**

The most-awaited update might just make its way here this year. The shift to PoS will change the economics of ETH from a mine-and-dump economy to a stake-and-hodl economy.  One of its most important contributions will be removing the environmental impact critique.

**6. Demand for Ethereum is promising.**

For one, the amount of ETH locked in the 2.0 staking contract continues to grow. In fact, more than 6.2 million ETH is locked in 2.0. Along with this, on-exchange supplies keep hitting new lows.

**7. Ethereum is overtaking Bitcoin on most important metrics.**

For instance, Ethereum is settling 3X more than Bitcoin every day on-chain. Other than that, Ethereum is also recording higher fee earnings than Bitcoin. Moreso, while Bitcoin may be the future of money, Ethereum is seen as the future of technology. That sort of thinking globally, might lead to a shift in preference between the top two coins.",2021-07-19 00:41:11

He used the purchase of GEICO (Government Employee Insurance Company) as a piggy bank for risk free cash to fund over 40 acquisitions.  He really doesn't like technology and his has admitted as much over the decades.

The only reason he purchased Apple stock over the last few years was not because he liked the company..it was the massive buybacks the board at Apple decided to embark on (with cheap money from the Federal Reserve).

Warren is a simple man. Read his past 30 Chairman's letters which he writes each year for his shareholders.  They are online. Just fucking brilliant.

You will get an education how to sandblast away all the hubris you hear everyday from all the financial news shows (and get a chance to see how the richest man in the investing world thinks). Just amazing.

h61ea1s,Actnaou,101,"Good post op. Im adding also some potentially educational info from one of my previous posts. 

1 Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.  
  
2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.  
  
3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.  
  
4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.  
  
5 - Entries are important, but risk &amp; money management is where you make or lose money.  
  
6 - Beware of get-rich-quick gurus hopping on the crypto bandwagon over the past year.  
  
7 - Decide which types of trade setups or investments you’ll take and ignore everything else.  
  
8 - Don’t assume just because you’ve made a lot of money in crypto that you can just as easily make money in other financial markets. 95%+ of stock market traders LOSE money. The game is rigged. Stick to what you know works for you.  
  
9 - The best way to day trade cryptocurrencies is – DON’T!  
  
10 - The best way to profit in any market is to find something you think has big potential early (before the general public catches on), and invest assuming you’re going to lose 100% of your capital. It’s the “angel investor” approach.  
  
11 - You can’t control the market. The only thing you can control is your entries, trade size, and exits.  
  
12 - One market participant can completely destroy “good technical analysis”.  
  
13 - Don’t blindly follow trade alerts from ANYONE, especially random people on social media or chat rooms.  
  
14 - All financial networking marketing projects are ponzi schemes, period.  
  
15 - If you make a life-changing amount of money, do NOTHING for at least 30 days.  
  
16 - Trading isn’t about picking exact tops and bottoms in a market – it’s about catching the meat of a move.  
  
17 - Don’t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.  
  
18 - Don’t set daily profit target goals – set long-term performance goals.  
  
19 - Learn to survive, then thrive.  
  
20 - The best charting indicators are price action and volume. You can use others, but it won’t necessarily make you a more profitable trader.  
  
21 - Trends can go way past what seems rational.  
  
22 - Don’t try to pick tops in a market. Wait for the market to tell you when the trend is over.  
  
23 - Don’t trade in front of big news events – it’s impossible to predict how markets will react.  
  
24 - The biggest challenge for most traders is their ego, or the need to be right.  
  
25 - You can lose 50% of your trades and still be profitable if you manage risk properly.  
  
26 - The best entrepreneurs and CEO’s typically make the worst traders and investors.  
  
27 - People with the best mindset for investing typically have a career in high-risk situations like firefighters, pilots, police.  
  
28 - Avoid pump and dump groups like the plague they are.  
  
29 - You WILL make every mistake in the book. Don’t beat yourself up when you make mistakes, just learn and try not to make the same mistake twice.  
  
30 - Don’t treat crypto exchanges like bank accounts. You don’t own the coins unless you control the private keys.  
  
31 - Crypto is a 24/7/365 market. You can’t catch every trade. If you miss one, don’t worry – there’s ALWAYS another trade.  
  
32 - Don’t invest in a coin unless you understand it inside out.  
  
33 - You can make money trading the momentum and hype in shitcoins, just don’t invest long-term.  
  
34 - Stay away from coins with low trading volume and low market caps. They are easily manipulated and you can get stuck in a position.  
  
35 - Don’t trade with money you need for living expenses. It’s called “risk capital” for a reason.  
  
36 - Think of yourself as a hunter – save your ammo for the big game.  
  
37 - Crypocurrency exchanges go down when there’s high volatility. If price hits a major target or buy zone, it might make sense to place some orders BEFORE everyone else.  
  
38 - Trading and investing brings all your emotions to the forefront – fear, greed, hesitation.  
  
39 - The hardest thing to do in trading is… NOTHING. This can also be the most profitable thing to do.  
  
40 - Just because a market is in a “bubble” doesn’t mean it’s going to die. Bitcoin has been through over half a dozen big bubbles and increased in price after each one.  
  
41 - Manage your trades in a way that would leave you with no regrets no matter what the market does.  
  
42 - Learn to think like a contrarian. If you’re someone who needs to have your opinion validated by everyone around you, then trading and investing isn’t for you.  
  
43 - The shorter the chart time frame, the less reliable the chart patterns are. The longer the time frame, the more variables affect price action and the harder it becomes to predict price. My sweet spot in the daily chart for trade setups and 60-minute chart for entries.  
  
44 - Some market conditions are great for pushing the gas on every trade setup you can find, where other market conditions call for you to slam on the brakes and step away from the markets altogether.  
  
45 - 90%+ of cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero. Invest accordingly.  
  
46 - The mental side of trading is the hardest to master, the most under-appreciated skill, and will cause you to make or lose the biggest amounts of money.  
  
47 - The 3 biggest problems for traders are over-trading, hesitating on entries, and closing positions prior to profit targets when the trade is still intact.  
  
48 - You can make a career’s worth of profit in one year or one trade – don’t feel like every day has to be a home run. Play the long game. Be patient and wait for the best plays.  
  
49 - Don’t trust anyone else to trade for you. Manage your own high-risk investments (like crypto trading) or don’t participate at all.  
  
50 - Take the news for what it is – they’re trying to get views and clicks. They’re NOT looking out for your best interests or trying to help you make money.

And that just the part of their measly 4.5m Bitcoin transactions alone, didn't even account for all the other 29.9955b cryptocurrency transactions per year.

h64vqd2,simplelifestyle,62,"&gt; JPMorgan gave its financial advisors the green light to give all its wealth-management clients access to cryptocurrency funds, making it the first major US bank to do so, Insider has learned.
&gt; 
&gt; The bank, which has been making a significant push to grow its $630 billion wealth-management business, told advisors in a memo earlier this week that they can now take orders to buy and sell five cryptocurrency products, four from Grayscale Investments and one from Osprey Funds, effective July 19.
&gt; 
&gt; A person directly familiar with the move said it applies to all JPMorgan clients seeking investment advice, including its bank's self-directed clients using its commission-free Chase trading app, mass affluent clients whose assets are managed by financial advisors under JPMorgan Advisors, and ultrarich clients serviced by the private bank.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's advisors can execute only ""unsolicited"" crypto trades, meaning advisors cannot recommend the products but are allowed to buy or sell on the behalf of a client's request. The funds JPMorgan has approved include Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, and Ethereum Classic vehicles, as well as Osprey Funds' Bitcoin Trust, the person said.
&gt; 
&gt; In April JPMorgan said it was preparing to offer an actively managed bitcoin fund to private wealth clients to be rolled out this summer, CoinDesk first reported.
&gt; 
&gt; The move marks a milestone in the bank's digital asset offerings, after its CEO, Jamie Dimon, threatened in 2017 to fire employees who traded bitcoin. While Dimon has since softened his sentiment toward crypto, he said in May that he was still not a supporter of the asset class despite growing client interest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; JPMorgan's asset and wealth-management chief, Mary Callahan Erdoes, told Bloomberg that many of the bank's clients view crypto as an asset class and want to invest in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Rival banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have not given retail wealth clients direct access to crypto products. Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to begin offering wealthy clients — those with at least $2 million in invested assets — access to bitcoin funds, through a partnership with Galaxy Digital in April, CNBC reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Goldman Sachs started offering crypto futures trading to institutional clients and hedge funds last month. It told CNBC in March it was close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealthiest clients.",2021-07-23 00:16:27

Ethereum enthusiasts are waiting for the delayed release of the London hard fork while trading with caution. The most notable Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) in the upgrade is EIP 1559. This, combined with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is considered equivalent to a “Triple Halving”. 

The upcoming London hard fork is a critical milestone in the Ethereum roadmap leading up to the release of ETH 2.0. It will change the protocol’s consensus algorithm from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake and restructure the monetary policy. 

Currently, transaction fees are calculated by the concept of the ""first-price auction.” Market participants bid a set price for miners to process their transactions and the highest bidder wins. However, this is set to change with EIP 1559. 

The network update will introduce a “base fee” for transactions to be included in a block. Users who wish to prioritize their transactions will have the option to add a “tip” or “priority fee” to incentivize miners for including their transactions in the next block. The higher the tip the bigger the chances for the transaction to be processed. 

EIP 1559 does not directly intend to make gas cheaper. The base fee will fluctuate by up to 12.5% after blocks are more than 50% full, which makes transaction fees predictable and transparent to prevent users from overpaying for gas. 

Among other changes that result from the EIP 1559 upgrade, the most notable one is that 70% of transaction fees on the Ethereum network will be burned, meaning that this supply will be deleted from circulation. The remaining 30% will be delivered to stakers as an additional staking reward, in addition to their regular issuance. 

The significant drop in Ether supply is key to drive Ethereum’s price since it makes it a deflationary asset. 

Popular Ethereum Researcher Nikhil Shamapant, mentioned in his research on EIP 1559  that

Given the significance of the upcoming protocol upgrade, the concept of “Ethereum Triple Halving” that started as an analogy on Crypto Twitter has evolved into an analysis of financial flows to predict what will happen to the price of Ethereum by January 2023. 

Ethereum’s Triple Halving has its roots in the reduction in supply, Following a successful upgrade to EIP 1559, a drop in sell pressure is expected. Analysts believe that  a 30% reduction of circulating Ether could take place, which is about half of the effect of a single Bitcoin halving. Meanwhile, the transition to PoS might result in a supply shock equivalent to two halvings. 

The much-awaited London hard fork was expected to go live this month, but after a delay, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko proposed August 4 as the potential launch date. Other key developers will make a final decision on July 9. 

While the exact date of the network update remains to be decided, US multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs is bullish on Ethereum.

Of course it will. Bitcoin doesn't change human nature. The 80/20 rule has always, and will always apply (80% of the wealth owned by 20% of the population). The wealthy will still acquire the hardest asset in the universe, and why wouldn't they? It's not the wealthy that will lose power and control with the new era of Bitcoin, it's governments.

First, we had FREEDOM fries and FREEDOM toast... because French people can suck it. They know what they did.

But now BIG TECH is censoring EVERYTHING. You can't say a damn thing if you are a conservative in the US. At this point, why even bother posting on social media?

We need...

###THE FREEDOM PHONE!

A hat is falling behind Trump, who is holding onto the T-rex by the reins and sitting on a saddle, with a US flag saddle blanket. A caption reads, “FREEEEEEEDOOOOOMMM!!!!!!”*]

The Freedom Phone is a new business venture started by Eric Finmen—the world's ""Youngest Bitcoin Millionaire.""

[*A boy wearing glasses and a button-up shirt, his hair combed to his right side. He has his arms folded and is staring wide-eyed into the camera. He is raising one eyebrow but not smiling, making him look awkwardly startled.*]

Wasn't he adorkable?

You see, his folks gave him $1000 to invest when he was 12.

He bought a bunch of Bitcoin.

Naturally.

And when he turned 18, it was worth over a million bucks.

By 21 he had 2.3 million dollars and was the pride of capitalism.

So obviously that makes him a $BUSINESS GENIUS$

And not \*INCREDIBLY LUCKY\*

And because he is a business genius, he has decided to start a new chapter of his life as an entrepreneur. Because we definitely don't have enough of those.

His first entrepreneurial BIG BOY IDEA is selling the FREEDOM PHONE.

Let's check out the on this bad from the [*Start link*] actual website. [*End link*]

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;[*Image of a bright red-orange rock formation. The phone is in the middle of the image, displaying the rest of it in its screen.*]
&gt;
&gt;####Large Storage. 6inch Screen. Great Camera.
&gt;
&gt;Affordable, yet fast.

[*End screenshot*]

Large storage, you say?
6 inches of screen???
GREAT CAMERA!!!

Well, with specificity like that, I'm sold.

People get way caught up in the gigahertz and megapixels anyway. You don't need to know that stuff He says It is ""affordable, yet fast' and I choose to believe him.

I'm sure it is on par with every other $500 phone on the market—all while being made in the old U.S. of A.

Because you wouldn't call it a \*FREEDOM PHONE\* if it weren't American-made.

That would be dumb.

&gt;***""In fact, Freedom Phone appears to be a simple rebranding of a budget phone called the 'Umidigi A9 Pro, ' made by the Chinese tech company Umdigi. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Finman confirmed that the Freedom Phone was manufactured by Umdigi, but couldn’t say immediately which Umdigi phone it was based on.***
&gt;
&gt;***The Freedom Phone's $500 price tag would represent a substantial markup on the A9 Pro. The phone is available on Chinese retail giant AliExpress for $120—less than one-quarter of the price of a Freedom Phone.""***

###— The Daily Beast 

Oh.

Ummmmmmmmmm...

Is there anyone out there who can put a positive spin on this? Because I'm failing to think of anything at the moment.

[*Screenshot of Tweet*]

&gt;**Free 99**, @free99etx
&gt;
&gt;Replying to @Barnacules @erikfinman and @coffeebreak_YT You are not just paying for the phone. You are also paying for the OS. It is just like the IPhone. Part of the cost goes into the phone, but the same can be said for the OS. Also, while the phone is produced in China, FreedomOS is made in the USA. That is what I care about.

[*End screenshot*]

EXACTLY! The OS is chockfull of FREEDOM and that's what really matters.

Real AMERICAN developers toiled over the FreedomOS to make sure it was as free as humanly possible. I'm sure this OS is built from the ground up and that extra $400 expense is due to the extensive R&amp;D needed to create this marvel of digital liberty.

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;[*FreedomOS logo: a gray outline of a rectangle with a light blue shield in it.*]
&gt;
&gt;Improved
&gt;
&gt;####A Free-Speech First Operating System
&gt;
&gt;We've developed the first mass-marketable mobile phone operating system based on free speech.

[*End screenshot*]

SEE! IT'S **BASED** ON FREE SPEECH!

Annnnd... it is **BASED** on something called GrapheneOS, apparently.

[*Screenshot of Wikipedia article titled “GrapheneOS”*]

&gt;GrapheneOS is an Android-based, security-hardened, privacy focused, free and open-source, mobile operating system for selected smartphones. It was known as Android Hardening until March 2019, and is focused on privacy and security. GrapheneOS is compatible with several Google Pixel smartphones.

[*End screenshot*]

Okay, so full disclosure.

The FreedomOS developers may have used an already Android fork and skinned it to mk more... Freedom-y. You saw the flag wallpaper, right?

[*Close-up of phone stock photo from the sales listing. Its wallpaper has nine airplanes flying in formation over the US flag, waving in the breeze on a clear sky.*]

Truthfully, licensing that wallpaper was the bulk of the development cost. They may not have done much beyond aesthetic tweaks.

That is... except for the **UNCENSORABLE APP STORE!!**

[*Screenshot of product page*]

&gt;Ban Free
&gt;
&gt;####Uncensorable App Store
&gt;
&gt;Our own app store. Read what you like. Watch what you like. Think what you like. Nothing is censored.

[*End screenshot*]

**\*patriotic fanfare***

**\*eagle caws in the distance***

**\*someone is shot in a hunting accident***

This is where that extra $400 of value comes in. No apps will censored. EVER. You can get your Gab and your Parler and your Gettr. And you never have to worry those apps being unavailable because Zuckerdumb sad NO

Okay, full disclosure again.

99% of the apps banned in the iPhone and Play stores are due to things like malware, viruses, and illegal activity. So for every Parler that goes uncensored—so does the app that looks just like Parler but is titled ""Parler Totally the Real One"" and IS full of viruses ready to steal your banking information. And an app store without restrictions could also end up being a haven for child pornography and illegal drug sales.

But hey... PARLER, AMIRITE?

Soooo... what if you don't like this incredible $500 phone worth $120?

Good news! There is a \*stellar\* return policy.

[*Screenshot of FAQ page*]

&gt;Q: What is the return policy if you don't like it?
&gt;
&gt;A: Customers may return their Freedom Phone **unopened** within 30 days of purchase. If the device is already opened, we do not offer returns at this time.

[*End screenshot*]

You get the box.

You stare at the box.

You DO NOT open the box.

And if that experience is unsatisfying, you can return that box within 30 days.

If you get the box.

Cut a hole in that box.

Stick your freedom in that box.

Well... hopefully you like it.

In conclusion, it's hard to put a price on freedom.

Sure, this is probably a giant grift.

And this conservative Bitcoin douche doesn't seem to mind grifting his own political brethren.

Because capitalism is his mistress and loyalty is fleeting in the ~~whitest~~ rightest of wings.

But if you want FREEDOM in your smartphone, you should definitely pay this clearly trustworthy bleach blonde, scruffy chinned lottery winner $500 for a cheap Chinese Android phone that will fill up with viruses faster than you can boot up the phone (because it is made with inferior hardware and booting probably takes a while).

h6mgsbk,greenmachine822,69,"Long story, but I’ll break it down. I’ve never really done so, so will be a good moment of reflection for myself! Posting anonymously as I don’t want my main account to have this attached to it. Happy to answer any questions, though.

Age 12/13: Started to learn to code, Visual Basic to start with (I know…!). Was lucky, fell in love with it and slowly progressed through various languages before sticking with C++ and becoming an expert by around age 18, I’d say.

Age 14-16: Started to earn some income from writing game hacks/cheats, around $1-1.5k/month. Kinda knew that I didn’t need school anymore and grew an attitude. I was blowing all of the money on paying for game servers, my own lunch, clothes and stuff - childhood was rough and my parents weren’t around, so got away with it all.

Age 16-18: Left school with no education, was a naughty kid and was kicked out of a couple of schools - it was never for me. Stuck with the game cheats, kinda hit a bottleneck, various anti-cheat software started to hit the ‘business’ on and off. Started to get into things like botnets and so forth, but I never felt great about it, became concerned about legal issues too.

Age 18-22: Joined the military, felt like I needed to do something different with life. Eating cookies, drinking coke and fucking around with various code-related projects wasn’t doing it for me at the time. I wanted to move away for a while too, perhaps to escape. Completed two tours of Afghanistan, saw another side to people and the world, but decided this wasn’t for me and the money sucked.

Age 22-27: These were the crazy years and the most intense years of my life, I’d say. I co-created a game cheats business again, was making bank from that. Co-created a file host website, was making bank from that. Both businesses were with people I had met online playing games over the years.

Then started buying/selling domain names, made a lot of money from that venture.

Started to buy into Bitcoin around $2, just loved the whole scene. I had 30,000 BTC at one point (Yes, 30k!). Traded a lot, ended up about breakeven from that - was super stressful. Overall with BTC, made a hell load of money from holding, but wish I had kept hold of the BTC for way longer, hindsight is always 20/20 though, hey?

Started to invest in property, which now provides me with a passive income every month, probably like $5-6k/month profit.

Age 28-30: Travelled the world like crazy, first-class everywhere. Had the time of my life in Vegas and went back countless times, that’s a story for another day. Drunk far too much and did plenty of other stuff.

Age 30+: (Where I’m at now). I have multiple businesses, an Amazon FBA/eCommerce business, a SaaS statistics website, various Facebook affiliate marketing successes and the properties. Take home around $40k-50k/month now, net. Net worth is circa $5mil. 

My income does have its ups and downs. I’ve had plenty of bad runs in business too, but I’m up by far, overall. I don't really have to do anything with the businesses now as I have staff that can handle it all, but I love being involved, so I do.

Takeaways from it all?

Don’t write off anyone at first, you’ll be shocked what you can learn from people. Having said that, surround yourself with the right people and don’t stick around with those who you know aren’t going to help your situation.

Keep an open mind, don’t close doors too quickly on things, there’s money in nearly everything.

Nothing gets my blood rushing more than starting a new business, especially with the right people.

Still, BTC remains solidly above 37K, a critical resistance point for months, now turning in to support. 

Dogecoin is happily sitting above 20 cents at the moment, with support beneaath it at 18 and resistance at 22.

Overall sentiment is still slowly dialing in to positive sentiment, though there are many more obstacles for a true bull run. Namely that Bitcoin must break low 40's resistance in order to truly break away from this accumulation phase. 

Bitcoin could just as easily end up back to the low 30's as it could testing 41K again. Shorts haven't given up just yet and fear still plagues the market. The set-up for the continuation of a bull market is there, but it may not be ready to run just yet.

This is often the cryptocurrency alternative to relying on vast amounts of venture capital, as it doesn't cost the company out of pocket to dole out a token.  If it were ETH, they'd have to buy hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of ETH every day to pay participants off, which drastically increases the potential of the project folding.

From the participant's perspective, payment in a coin or token intrinsically linked to the project means that the initial value of the payments will be very low but very plentiful, but if the project flourishes, their value retroactively may become many, many times what it was when you started.  So if you were an early adopter of a project, then your loyalty in the days when the token was worth a penny and you were receiving ten bucks' worth a day would be rewarded greatly if the project succeeded in the end and the token moved to a value of a dollar, retroactively making those initial daily payments worth a thousand dollars each.  If they used an established coin like ETH, then there's no incentive to do the project in particular from a speculative standpoint, as ETH will do whatever it does whether or not the people running the project are skilled enough to ensure its success.

&gt;The ETH 2.0 merge is on its way. Even if it doesn’t launch as expected in Q1 2022, at some point before the end of next year, it is extremely likely that Ethereum will experience a 90% drop in its inflation and a 100% drop in ETH going to miners. Now for those of you who don’t know, miners create constant selling pressure because they have to sell their crypto to pay for their electricity bills. It’s a business with surprisingly slim profit margins for most. So what happens when Ethereum goes from $20-$50 million dollars of daily selling pressure from miners to $0? (the 0.5% inflation going to stakers will still be locked up until a later ETH 2 upgrade). Well based on Bitcoin’s history, ETH price will rise like crazy.

\- They need to introduce more utility in form of features that cost skill (long and shortterm investments)  
\- They need to increase character cost. For the amount you can earn ,the character cost is too low.  
\- They need to implement some type of character destruction to get rid of the ever increasing supply of characters  
\- They need to increase the value of reforging or present it differently in order to get people to reforge.  
\- They need to get rid of ingame skill or lower it significantly (why should I spent real skill if I can just use my ingame skill)  


Since Skill is more like gold/bitcoin in the scarcitiy aspect and won't increase, they can't do fractional reserve banking like the real world. They have to make sure more money flows into the economy and less gets out.  


There was a good reason why the US got rid of the gold standard.  You can't issue more gold backed fiat, than you have gold. And in this case its like if the US was selling their gold reserves to other countries and needed to figure out a way for foreign investors to invest back into the US (with gold)   


One thing they could do is to offer land, shares of companies, rights to produce or anything else that is valuable and feeds back huge amounts of (gold/skill) back into the economy.

h706dvp,nocendi,4,"&gt;Firmaet skatter på inntekt og div avgifter (om man tenker på en avgift som en skatt)

De hadde et overskudd på 2,2 milliarder i 2020, og betalte 0 i skatt. Faktisk fikk de tilbake 57 000,- på skatten. 

Til deres forsvar så betalte de 560 millioner i skatt på konsernbasis, så det er i alle fall *noe*, selv om det kom ut av operasjonelt selskap og ikke holdingselskapet. 

&gt;Aksjonærene skatter på utbytte.

Det er ikke sant. Nesten alle aksjonærene (inkludert familien Witzøe) er selskaper. De betaler ikke skatt på utbytte. Det er det bare ~~nissene~~ personlige aksjonærer som gjør. Og de har SalMar ganske få av. 

&gt;Både han og sønnen skatter når de tar penger ut av selskapet, eller selger aksjer.

Helt klart. Men med en slik formue så er det ikke så ofte du har bruk for det. Privatøkonomien kan fint finansieres via en ELOC. 

&gt;De ansatte skatter av inntekten.

De har 38 ansatte. Resten er innleid fra Polen. Jeg mener det er prinsipielt idiotisk å gi et firma ""æren"" for skatten deres ansatte betaler, men i SalMar sitt tilfele er det irrelevant, siden de nesten ikke har ansatte. 

&gt;Det finnes bedre og mer samfunnsnyttige løsninger enn formue skatt. 

Det kan vi være enige om, men vi vet nok begge to at familien Witzøe kommer til å skrike like høyt uansett *hvordan* de blir skattelagt.

Det er mange selskap i Norge som har oppriktige problemer på grunn av formueskatten. SalMar er ikke en av de. Dette er et selskap som bokstavelig talt driter penger. 

&gt;Man kan f.eks øke beskatning på uttak på aksje kapital.

Siden ingen av de tar ut særlig mye i personlig utbytte tror jeg ikke det ville ha noen betydning.

Den åpenbare løsningen er et avgiftssystem i likhet med oljebransjen. Men dette ville fort blitt 30-40% av overskuddet, og jeg kan love deg at Witzøe hadde blitt lynende forbannet om noen foreslo *det*. 

&gt;Jeg sier ikke at de ikke har råd til å betale formueskatten, men jeg forstår også godt at det er økonomisk gunstig å flytte driften ut av landet når du ender med å betale skatt for å ta ut penger til å betale skatt med

Selvsagt. Det er økonomisk ugunstig for alle som tjener penger å bo i en velferdsstat. Har du god inntekt, er det ingen steder i verden som er bedre å bo enn Monaco, Andorra, Bahamas eller UAE. Men dette er altså en familie som har blitt griserike på å utnytte felles naturressurser.

De burde stå absolutt nederst på sympatilisten. 

&gt;Eller for å si det på en annen måte, om du kjøpte 1000 bitcoin for 15 år siden, hadde du nå hatt en formidabel formue, som du måtte betalt skatt av om du har en inntekt på 500k i året og får en formueskatt på 900k så må du selge BTC, betale skatt på salget, og deretter betale formueskatten

Ja, selvsagt, og det er helt greit. Her er det ingen arbeidskapital som tappes, og det er derfor heller ingen problemer med formueskatt.",2021-07-30 06:12:17

h706dsk,MobTwo,4,"Long story short is that Bitcoin Cash is the highly improved version of BTC. Anyone can verify for themselves. Just send $10 worth of BTC and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash from your own wallet A (not an exchange) to your own wallet B (not an exchange) and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it has many unique advantages over the old tech BTC (forever stuck on 1mb). Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&amp;nbsp;

**Rapidly Growing Transactions Volume** - Bitcoin Cash has more transactions than BTC+Lightning Network combined recently. On some days, Bitcoin Cash has more than double the transactions volume of BTC. Bitcoin Cash is growing rapidly while BTC is on the decline.

&amp;nbsp;

**Defi Smart Contracts** - Bitcoin Cash has defi smart contracts functionalities (eg. AnyHedge, Detoken, SmartBCH). SmartBCH allows Ethereum smart contracts to be deployed as a sidechain to the Bitcoin Cash network. This means as an Ethereum developer, you no longer has any friction jumping over to join the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. All of them can come over to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem to enjoy the low transaction fees of Bitcoin Cash.

&amp;nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Derivatives, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB blocksize and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&amp;nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&amp;nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all

&amp;nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disadvantages of Bitcoin Cash** - Unfortunately, for the past 5 years, Bitcoin Cash has been constantly undermined by lies, propaganda, censorships and other malicious activities...

**1a) censorships** - https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

**1b) propaganda** - https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@adambalm/in-2013-peter-todd-was-paid-off-by-a-government-intelligence-agent-to-create-rbf-create-a-propaganda-video-and-cripple-the-btc and  https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8dd5ij/why_bitcoin_cash_users_reject_the_name_bcash_so/

**1d) DDOS attacks** - http://qntra.net/2015/09/xt-node-blacklists-fail-to-prevent-ddos-attack/

**1e) Plus a bunch of other unethical stuff** if you care to read more at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hgpjph/the_pitiful_state_of_bitcoin_cash_transactions/fw5qczk/

Anyone who dares to promote increasing the blocksize or favorably on Bitcoin Cash, they got banned and their voices silenced in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency subreddit. They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. All these started back in 2015 even before Bitcoin Cash existed.

&amp;nbsp;

**""Digital Gold"" Or ""Store Of Value"" Propaganda** - BTC is good with propaganda but this is simple economics. Something cannot be a store of value without it first be a means of exchange. Bitcoin Cash is both a store of value AND means of exchange thanks to its low fees. Bitcoin is not feasible as a means of exchange due to its high fees of around $10 (or more) per transaction.

&gt; Store of Value: To act as a store of value, money must be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved. It must be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. Additionally, the value of money must remain stable over time.

&gt; Source: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-economics/chapter/introducing-money/

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokens** - Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/. And anyone can then buy/sell/trade their newly created tokens on https://1BCH.com/ exchange which is fully focused on Bitcoin Cash and BCH tokens.

&amp;nbsp;

**Increased Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&amp;nbsp;

**Continuous Innovations** - For example, Cash Accounts allow people to send BCH to an easy to remember non-custodial alias such as MobTwo#12345. You may register your Cash Account at https://www.cashaccount.info/

Together with Reusable Payment Addresses (RPA), Cash Accounts will allow people to send BCH to your easy to remember alias with increased privacy. You can read more about RPA at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/o1z8a1/help_me_test_the_prototype_of_electron_cash_rpa/

Many more innovations on BCH not covered in this comment to avoid turning this into an encyclopedia.

&amp;nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 1 trillion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 1 trillion will give you around 68x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities. As an investor, it make sense to know the difference between price and value. Bitcoin Cash has a high value low price while BTC has low value high price.

&amp;nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage (eg. Friendster or MySpace or Kodak or Nokia) but that can only last them to a point. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap. Bitcoin Cash is the second opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price if you missed that opportunity back in 2013.",2021-07-30 06:12:16

h742xqt,throwaway55667701,4,"This is fair criticism, but regulatory risk is something that every industry deals with. The problem is, crypto is especially weak in its ability to counter this threat. This is what I mean:

Large banks have large consortiums of lobbyists, lawyers, and public relations teams that ensure that, even when their failings are on full display, their interests are advocated for at the highest levels of government power.

In contrast, in the crypto space, its decentralized nature means there's no corporate board hiring PR firms, there's no CEO that can be a lightening rod on CNBC and advocate for the benefits that his organization brings to the economy (Buterin and Hoskinson =/= Solomon and Dimon). There's no head of the organization that can hire a bevy of lobbyists to grease the palms of congressmen and senators.

Why this matters: the first time crypto shines it ass (and it will - every unregulated market gets frothy from time to time and The Great Bitcoin Recession of 2031 is going to wipe out trillions in global wealth), the government is going to reg the shit out of the tech. But unlike 2007-2009, there's going to be no centralized system to push back on reactionary and ill-informed government overreach.

All to say, expect uneducated/ill-informed overreaching regulations of crypto in a way that wasn't analogously reflected with large banks. We have to move smart folks who have trained themselves to think about pure tech problems only, and start having them think about how the industry is going to react to inevitable regulation.

h744um2,tonybarnaby,4,"Interoperability

Interoperability across blockchains is an often-discussed topic, and many projects have been proposed specifically to address this challenge. With reliable transactions across blockchains, true network effects can be realized in the decentralized economy.

The first example of blockchain interoperability was atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Litecoin. The trustless exchange of Bitcoin for Litecoin and vice-versa is made possible not through in-protocol mechanisms, but through a shared cryptographic standard (specifically usage of the SHA2-256 hash function).

Similarly, the design of Ethereum 2.0 allows for interconnection of many shard chains, all running the same protocol and utilizing the same cryptographic primitives. This uniformity will be valuable when customizing the protocol for inter-shard communication, however Ethereum 2.0 will not be interoperable with other blockchains that do not utilize the same cryptographic primitives.

Networks of blockchains such as Polkadot or Cosmos go one-step further, allowing blockchains built with the same framework (Cosmos SDK for Cosmos and Substrate for Polkadot) to communicate and interact with one another. These frameworks provide developers some flexibility in building their own protocols, and ensure the availability of identical cryptographic primitives, allowing each chain to parse one another's blocks and cross-validate transactions. However, both protocols rely on bridges or ""pegging zones"" to connect to blockchains that are not constructed with their own frameworks, introducing an additional layer of trust. To demonstrate: though Cosmos and Polkadot enable ""networks of blockchains"", the Cosmos and Polkadot networks are not designed to be interoperable with each other.

The crypto-economics of cross-chain networks may need further study as well. For both Cosmos and Polkadot, native tokens are used for staking, governance and transaction fees. Putting aside the crypto-economic dynamics introduced by staking, which can't alone give a native token intrinsic value (discussed in 4.2.4), reliance on cross-chain transactions to capture ecosystem value can be a weak model. In particular, cross-chain transactions are a weakness, not a strength of multi-chain networks, just as cross-shard transactions are a weakness of sharded databases. They introduce latency, as well as the loss of atomicity and composability. There is a natural tendency for applications that need to interact with each other to eventually move to reside on the same blockchain to reduce cross-chain overhead, reducing the demand for cross-chain transactions and therefore demand for the native token.

Cross-chain networks benefit from network effects - the more interconnected chains there are in a network, the more valuable the network is, and the more attractive it is to potential new participants in the network. Ideally, such value would be captured by the native token and used to further encourage the growth of the network. However, in a pooled security network such as Polkadot, higher cost of network participation becomes a deterrent for the network to accrue further value. In a loosely connected network like Cosmos, if we assume same cross-chain transaction demand and fees, higher cost of staking participation lowers the expected return for validators, discouraging further staking participation.

With its layered approach, the Nervos Network is also a multi-chain network. Architecturally, Nervos uses the cell model and a low-level virtual machine to support true customization and user-created cryptographic primitives, enabling interoperability across heterogeneous blockchains (covered in 4.4.1). Crypto-economically, the Nervos Network concentrates value (instead of message passing) to its root chain. This mechanism raises the network's security budget as the aggregate value secured by the network rises.",2021-07-31 03:45:20

I was looking at Bitcoin atm data and also looking locally to see if a Bitcoin atm in my neighborhood was still active.  It's still there.  The number of Bitcoin atms has doubled in the last 7 months approx.

Flexa is in an ideal spot for the next phase of the bull run.  Commerical adoption is going to be rapid and AMP holders are going to benefit tremendously from the BTC price increase which I think is going to be gigantic.

As far as I remember, there was no limit to how many Bitcoins you can buy.  The site had a very good amount of liquidity at the time.  Kraken and Coinbase were just starting at the time, so nobody felt they were as trustworthy as Mt. Gox at the time.

An issue I had w/ Mt. Gox at first, were the smaller deposit and withdrawal limits per day, but I don't remember what those limits were.  I do remember how restrictive it was though, until I finally gave in and did KYC, and those limits were brought up (according to an old email from them, it says 10x the existing daily limits).

Another issue was that all exchanges (Mt. Gox especially; but BTC-e, Coinbase, and Kraken were just as bad) frequently went down due to high volume or violent price spikes--this made trading Bitcoin very frustrating, esp. when prices started to plummet and everyone wanted to sell, or vice versa; when prices shot up fast and everyone was rushing to buy.

h7ctu7a,mimetist,2,"There are not that many ways to put currency into circulation.

1. Government mandate.
2. Employer - Employee contracts.
3. Black markets.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The most obvious is the first one. The politic powers can change laws in order to make mandatory the usage of any currency. Europe countries did make mandatory the usage of the EUR and stopped using their own ""local"" currencies in the 90s (Pesetas from Spain, Francs from France, Marks from Germany, etc).

2. The second is by contracts. Assuming that outside of the legal minimum wage that might be mandatory to pay with fiat money, anyone can negotiate with his employer or employees any kind of payment that they agree on.

For example, many members of the directive boards get their houses, cars and many other services paid by the company instead of having higher (fiat) salaries. That way they don't lose as much in taxes.

Other example is from a NFL player, Russell Okung, who asked for his salary to be paid in BitCoins.

3. The last option is ""black markets"", where you can literally pay with anything that the other part is willing to accept.

In many countries that have their fiat currency very undervalued because of hyperinflation, people stop using the official currency as a mean to exchange. Argentinians tried to buy US dollars as soon as they had any local currency in their hands.

BitCoin can be considered a form of black market, since it is not regulated yet. But this discussion deserves more technical and philosophical attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what you were thinking about ""going back to the gold standard"" can only be approached safely following the first point. The second point can accelerate the process if the government sees that there is no way of stopping it. The third point is only useful if the country is at the brink of collapse and you want to abandon it.",2021-08-02 06:10:28

First we need to understand 2 important catalysts. Short squeeze and momentum ignition bots. This post underlines how they are used. We are now much more vulnerable we are with the advent of derivates and 100x leverage.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1y1z31/momentum\_ignition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1y1z31/momentum_ignition/)

Why they cause so much damage.

[https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/13080/momentum-ignition-arson-for-financial-markets](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/13080/momentum-ignition-arson-for-financial-markets)

Part 2 of this recipe is A short squeeze.

[https://centerpointsecurities.com/short-squeezes/](https://centerpointsecurities.com/short-squeezes/)

A little guide and what happens to price after one.

What do these 2 combined accomplish? Simple...Create massive liquidity to provide an exit in a low volume/low liquidity market. It is a bait to trap new entrants. Our 29k crab market was the perfect primer. Market makers can now exit properly with high profits as momentum was ignited triggering a short squeeze and a slew of new market entrants.

Return of the bull ? Not if these 2 metrics are accurate. So where do we go from here?  

Part 3 is a Bump and run.

[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart\_analysis:chart\_patterns:bump\_and\_run\_reversal\_reversal](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:bump_and_run_reversal_reversal)

The Lead in line is prior to the bump and run (short squeeze) aided by the ignition bot.

[https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/h9rCbeIa.png](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/h9rCbeIa.png)

As you can see, we have fallen out of the lead in line and bleeding down to prior lead in pricing. Without the ignition bot, the market has no spot buying power to prop prices up...so why use it now? Market conditions were perfect for a short squeeze enabling them maximum efficiency. When all 3 are combined you begin understanding why the price is behaving they way it has and how to trade it. I tried explaining it to people in a few prior posts but the jubilation of a price rise from investors and not traders drowns out any meaningful discussion.

Finally the last nail. MACRO

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/HG2Un3O7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HG2Un3O7/)

Bonds have fallen, the US market is showing weakness. If you check the graph, Bonds dropping proceeds a greater market shift downward. We are due for a pullback on the SP500, bonds will give us a heads up.

h7k4tgf,ConohaConcordia,1,"For stocks, it really depends on “which one”. Some stocks, for example Tesla, are notoriously overpriced. Others, while certainly being traded at a premium, are still being traded with a substance other than the confidence in mind. Whether this substance is far lower than the trading prices of the stock is irrelevant; the fact that stocks has some substance to begin with means Bitcoin will always be more volatile, since it has little substance to back it up.

In my opinion whether — or how hard — Bitcoin crashes ultimately comes down to the events surrounding the asset, not the prices itself.

Elon sold the cryptocurrency when the confidence is high and ironically, by selling he boosted the confidence in it. 

In a different setting, Chinese ban on Bitcoin triggered an immediate crash long before any hash rate reductions came into effect. If $200m was dump *then*, I’d say it will be possible to drive the prices all the way down to $20k which would be about 50% before the news about the ban.

The intention also matters. Elon sold $100m but he had no vested interest in driving the prices down — rather he would like it to be as high as possible, so he probably traded accordingly. If the same $100m was used explicitly to drive down prices, then the effects will be very different.",2021-08-03 23:56:34

I understand that the whole point of your post here is to kind of ask ~how~ you can do that, but as you may have gathered, there isn't a magic investment you can make. The easiest way to accumulate wealth when you don't have a lot to start with is by literally not spending money.

You've mentioned you're living paycheck to paycheck. This heavily implies you're saving next to nothing each month. In which case, how will you be able to top-up those 5-7k each month, so that you reach 20? In the absolute best case scenario where you start with 7k, you will need to save around £270 a month to make back £20k in 4 years. If your starting from £5k, that number turns to £312. Can you do that? 

This subreddit is about responsible money management, and as such there is no magic way you can make the journey to your goal easier by investing in something. If you're truly dedicated to making £20k in 4 years without actually saving money, you could attempt to YOLO it on something like bitcoin or whatever - but be ready to also lose all your cash. From your post history someone mentioned you may have a gambling problem and therefore I wouldn't recommend this. 

Final word of advice. If you want to get out of the hole, you need to manage your spendings or do your best to find a better source of income. As I mentioned, the *only* way to accumulate wealth when you have nothing to begin with is to save your money, and be resposible. Good luck!",2021-08-04 18:30:55

- **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

“Putting everything else about bitcoin aside, there will never be another cryptocurrency that is launched as fairly as bitcoin, for all of eternity, because bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated.

Assuming natal Pluto is in the US chart’s second house, we are referring to finances but only from the perspective of what we own and what’s considered to be in *our* (as a country) possession.

Likely we are looking at the US as the global superpower coming to an end. It’s right there if you look - a country of people who can’t collectively agree on anything, tear each other down, do what they can to make money off of others, living only for selfish means and not for community, and who continue to elect ill-intentioned politicians at every level (from local to federal).

h7renag,sffood,44,"I thought about — and almost pulled the trigger on — buying $500,000 worth of Apple stock in December 2006 the day before a deadline where I was to invest it into a business in LA. I chose the business, eventually — and for a multitude of reasons, that went bust and $500,000 is now gone. Poof.

I’ve never gone back to look at what $500K in Apple would be today. And don’t care, because I didn’t invest it in that then. And there’s nothing to say I wouldn’t have sold all of it as soon as it was up 20%, overjoyed.

After that, I considered buying $2,000 worth of some stupid cryptocurrency called “Bitcoin” at a buck something back in 2011. Like WTF is that, I asked myself…. “I’m better off burning this cash,” said I.

h7roxl7,MerHeNomadic,40,"TLDR: De auteur van het essay combineert wat mij betreft twee totaal verschillende onderwerpen in één essay zonder ze correct te verbinden. Ik schrijf een wat lange reactie op het wat lange essay als schrijver van het in het essay genoemde boek.

Tsja het is inderdaad wel wat lang, maar ook interessant om te zien hoe de Groene Amsterdammer auteur Marja Pruis aankijkt tegen inmiddels schijnbaar populaire persoonlijke financiën keukentafel-onderwerpen.  
Ik vind het leuk dat de auteur mensen als Sander Schimmelpenninck en Ernst-Jan Pfauth en de titel van mijn boek Van F\*ck You Money tot FIRE noemt. Ik vind het jammer dat ze het boek wel noemt maar overduidelijk niet heeft gelezen. 

Het verbaast me dat dit in combinatie gaat met het noemen van Sywert van Lienden en de focus op graaicultuur, bitcoin-oplichters en zestienjarige sneakerverkopers. De auteur van het essay combineert wat mij betreft twee totaal verschillende onderwerpen in één essay zonder ze correct te verbinden.  
Het eerste deel (en de titel van het artikel) lijkt te gaan over jonge ondernemers met een drang naar rijk worden; een beetje als reactie op hebberigheid en graaimentaliteit a la Sywert van Lienden, Miljonair clubs en Bitcoin- of Vastgoed-coaches. Het tweede onderwerp lijkt meer te gaan over geldbewustzijn en FIRE.  
Op het moment dat gesproken wordt over ""Zoek de impliciete aannames in deze redenering: ambtenaren werken voor een laag salaris; slimme mensen zijn te koop; als je slim bent, ben je rijk; als je niet voor een mega-salaris werkt ben je dom"" vind ik dat de auteur een belangrijk punt mist, namelijk dat FIRE juist helemaal niet is voor 'slimme', hebberige, op rijkdom gefocuste ondernemende types. FIRE gaat niet over snel rijk worden. FIRE gaat dit soort types volgens mij veel te langzaam.  
Wat ik ook vind ontbreken is het plaatsen van FIRE in de huidige tijdsgeest, juist in Groene Amsterdammer termen en kringen, waar ook het zelf verantwoordelijker worden voor inkomen nu en later, en niet per se rijk worden, steeds belangrijker wordt.  
Op het moment dat de auteur stelt ""De 'politiek’, de overheid, zal de economie van het genoeg moeten bewerkstelligen; weer meer naar zich toetrekken in plaats van zijn burgers uitleveren aan de wetten van de markt. Het moge inderdaad duidelijk zijn dat op die markt alleen de toch-al-welgestelden uit de voeten kunnen"" gaat ze er vanuit dat niet de burger maar de overheid wel gaat zorgen voor een vangnet en voorzieningen. Ikzelf ben juist bang dat dit in de toekomst onbetaalbaar wordt voor de overheid, dat dit betekent een hogere pensioenleeftijd en lagere bedragen, wellicht zelfs zeer magere basis AOW en dat we juist daarom veel eerder moeten beginnen met voor ons eigen financiële vangnet zorgen.  
Ik ben inderdaad zoals de auteur het noemt een missionaris. Ik pleit inderdaad voor F\*ck You Money voor iedereen. Maar dit is juist het vangnet, dit is juist om zelfstandiger te worden, je eigen beslissingen te kunnen nemen zonder te hoeven leunen op de overheid, ook als het een keer tegenzit.

h7phpuk,VictorCobra,34,"Hey everyone, content update! I just made a new [analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TOTAL/JdqCzeC9-Crypto-Set-to-Eclipse-Gold-The-Long-Term-Bullish-Trend/) about the TOTAL crypto market cap. It actually seems like the Gold market cap is within reach (even this cycle, believe it or not). More downside here would probably invalidate this idea, but it's fun to speculate :)

The last drop below $30k DID actually end up being a bear trap. One of the main reasons I was skeptical was the extreme negative funding on Binance futures. [Here's](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Fo2bVgO4-Setting-Up-For-A-Bear-Trap-Taking-The-Uncomfortable-Trade/) a more in-depth analysis about why I thought this was possible. I always find periods of low sentiment and high uncertainty to be the most interesting.

Bitcoin has now broken all the possible downtrends I was looking at back in June, though it took a while. This includes most iterations of the curved downtrend (yellow). [This](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/ZupUxHeT-Bitcoin-Roadmap-For-The-Months-Ahead-Looking-For-Liquidity/) analysis showed why I expected a test of this level, even prior to more potential downside.

I also made a [video](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/Cz9dOYvS-Victor-Cobra-s-Crypto-Market-Update-7-27-21-The-Short-Squeeze/) about what I'm speculating about for Bitcoin if the cycle is not over yet. $46-48k seems like the strongest resistance zone. Breaking above $42k and consolidating there for some time would be very bullish. Support is now at $38k.

Bitcoin bounced against [SPX right on the money,](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/1lrZESlQ-The-Bitcoin-SPX-Ratio-Presents-A-Possible-Buy-Signal/) which is interesting.  Would have been embarrassing if it broke down to new lows, since that was the first post I've ever made to be featured on the front page of TradingView. Hope I'm not jinxing it. There's still a lot of regulatory uncertainty, but the cat's out of the bag, I suppose.

Take care!

What happens after you take the coins off the exchange you're correct in assuming no one can trace the transaction to the Bible study group. You may want to study up on some of the key features that make this possible. I'm not 100% of the privacy with MyMonero mobile wallet but I'm guessing that it uses a remote node. Technically you should use a remote node you control or a full node for the utmost privacy.

However, keep in mind that the exchange now knows you have X amount of Monero. Someday when your gov or some regulatory body finally catches up (BTW these mofos are years behind in terms of understanding tech so might not be for a while) will potentially want to have some tx proof or have us submit something to show what we did with that money.

This is where the boating accident meme comes from. I lost my seed words and that money the exchange thinks I had is no longer under my control. Since this isn't bitcoin no one can see any addresses so as long as you don't take X back to the exchange that you claimed to lost it at you should be good to go.

h7yqbcu,ExtremePrivilege,108,"&gt;The proposed legislation, if passed, would have a significant impact on both investors and exchanges. Exchanges will need to undertake significant efforts to comply with the reporting regime. Investors, on the other hand, won’t have to “do” anything. But under the new law, all of the information that the IRS would normally receive when an investor sells a share of Amazon stock will now be sent to the IRS when an investor sells one Bitcoin, one Ethereum, or the like. There’s a lot to be sorted out: what will happen with crypto stored in cold storage, wallets not on exchanges, so-called “self custody.” The proposed legislation does not address this “self-custody” cryptocurrency, because it is analogous to cash under a mattress. It is difficult to trace and even more difficult to devise an information reporting scheme that would encompass such an asset. Individual cryptocurrency owners and investors must still pay attention, however, because it is even more likely that the IRS will be made aware of their transactions and expect them to be reported on a tax return.

The crux of the issue is that the new amendment requires ""brokers"" to report transactions to the IRS, the same way your TD Ameritrade account let's the IRS know you sold $42,000 worth of Weight Watchers stock. This seems like an inevitability to me. They defined ""broker"" pretty loosely, though;

&gt;Language in the bill would require crypto brokers to report customer information to the Internal Revenue Service. More importantly, over the weekend it broadened the definition of what’s considered a “broker” to anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person” which doesn’t exclude miners, software developers, stakers and other individuals in the crypto economy who don’t have customers.

It seems like, due to an outcry from Crypto lobbying groups, they intend to tighten up the definition of ""broker"" but that doesn't change the main goal here which is for Crypto transactions to be reported directly to the IRS.

""Destroy ETH Blockchain"" is a bit overdramatic, isn't it? The government realizes how much money is in Crypto now and they want their taxes. They clearly don't trust people to self-report their earnings. And they're right, people don't.",2021-08-07 03:22:42

h81uwrl,Tricky_Troll,100,"I wasn't fucking joking when I told you all multiple times that the effect of EIP-1559 will be significant on ETH price. Most miners operate as a business and sell most or all of their ETH immediately to pay their operating expenses which thanks to a competitive market with razor thin margins, is most of their earnings. We just reduced their income by a double digit percentage. This means that we have effectively removed millions of dollars of daily selling pressure on ETH overnight. While I will concede that it is still early for me to claim with absolute certainty that my theory was correct since there are many forces at play in these markets, but just look at Bitcoin and what it does after its halvings. Every time without fail it goes on a huge parabolic run due to the dramatically reduced selling pressure from miners. ETH is no different.

In the coming months, we'll see just how much of an effect EIP-1559 will have had. Then, after that you can extrapolate what happened to ETH price post EIP-1559 which reduced miner income by ~20-30% and apply it to a 90% decrease. Seriously, people are still sleeping on the significance of the merge and ETH becoming ultra sound money. I don't care how knowledgeable you are my EthFinancier friends, you are sleeping on the significance of such a supply shock. I don't care how much I never shut up about this, but I too am sleeping on the effect of this. We are going from tens of millions of dollars per day in constant selling pressure to *net negative* ETH issuance. Even crazier, the first few months post-merge  will be effectively no issuance because stakers who receive the remaining 10% of current ETH issuance won't be able to sell it as withdrawals from the beacon chain will be activated at a later date. So with this, within a year from now we will be burning ETH to interact with DeFi and mint NFTs but nobody will be selling newly minted ETH. But someone has to sell you some ETH for you to buy back what you burned minting your superfluous cat JPEG. Well I can guarantee you you'll have to pay a pretty penny for such a scarce asset.

h800b5m,Generationhodl,73,"You can write as much as you want, I learned that people mostly won't change. I have a nice job, where I earn about 3k every month after tax. Its enough for me to buy bitcoin every month after I paid for rent &amp; food &amp; little bit fun, hobbys and so on. I see people living paycheck to paycheck with the 3k they make. I bought Bitcoin for 10k $ already this year.   
They did not even invest 1k in ANYTHING.

It depends what you want. Some people lust for that expensive lifestyle. They need expensive leased cars, big apartments and party every weekend.  
Newest mobile phone and so on. They cannot save money, and they mostly don't invest in anything at all. Those people won't change, ever.   
They NEVER learned the dispense, and they just cannot save money, its hard to see. 

I'm living a pretty simple lifestyle, I have a very smol' car , only a small 2 room apartment and I don't have any expensive hobbys (okay gaming is a bit expensive but thats not every month). So most of my Cash is really going into Bitcoin. And for me personal, thats the best way to buy property in 10 years.

Congrats on the move, it's never too late. ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week. Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin)

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful.

Obviously I don't have the resources to help all of them but I listen to their stories and many kids of parents who are actively being scammed write to me.

Of course, the answer seems easy now, but about one month ago it was not.

Therefore, no, you should have not bought more. You should buy as much as you can, but always preserving your financial stability. If you did this, you are going the right way. Crypto is not about investing a lot, it's (and has always been) about investing wisely.

h84t9y3,SpontaneousDream,53,"About a year ago Yearn Finance ($YFI) went from ~$1,000 per coin to a high of over $40,000, at the time making one YFI worth more than one BTC. This left many investors puzzled at how it could suddenly and seemingly randomly fly up in price so fast. YFI would eventually hit an ATH of over $80,000 per coin during May 2021. 

How is this possible and how does it relate to Bitcoin? 

1. Scarcity. 

2. The effects of supply and demand on price. 

What people didn’t understand at the time, and in my opinion the primary reason for YFI’s massive price spike, was just how *scarce* it’s supply was (and still is). YFI’s supply is only **36,666** (originally it was 30,000 but they voted to increase it). That is ridiculously, insanely scarce. When you take into account basic laws of economics, it leads to an exponential price increase when there is enough demand. In this case, even just a small amount of demand (compared to BTC) was able to hugely increase the price. 

These exponential price increases (and exponential growth in general) are *difficult for human minds to comprehend. 

This is one reason why if you told someone years ago that one Bitcoin would eventually be worth ~$50,000 they would think you’re absolutely insane. They would not be able to understand how that’s possible. 

Bitcoin’s supply is of course many times greater than YFI’s, but compared to the supply of other traditional assets, Bitcoin’s supply is still *extremely* scarce. For this reason, I believe we are going to see 1 BTC reach future long term price levels that will seem utterly preposterous to us right now. Of course, demand still needs to grow, but all macro indicators continue to point to increased demand over time. I’m not going to list them all here, but I think most of you know at least a few. 

The point of this comment is to hopefully convince some here to step back and look at the big, long term bull case for Bitcoin. Of course it’s hard to take into account the sort of exponential growth that I mentioned above, but it’s still something to try to be aware of. Any smart investor knows that *time in the market beats timing the market*. 

I think anyone who is *patient* and determined to hold onto their Bitcoin for 5, 10, 20 years or more is going to see some pretty incredible price growth that will make traditional equities pale in comparison. I know this is a trading sub, and I trade a small amount of my stack, but I think you’d be pretty foolish to not have a long-term nest egg.

h8ab3mt,JosephWalrus,57,"Hal Finney's last post on the bitcoin talk forum, posted for context and continuation of legacy:

&amp;#x200B;

""I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.  
For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.  
Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.  
When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  
I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.  
When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.  
Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.  
After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.  
The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.  
Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.  
My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.  
ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.  
Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.  
It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited.

He never said this. Someone asked how we could possibly increase the blocksize later on and he simply gave an example of how this could be accomplished.

Satoshi didn't say if we should or when we should increase the blocksize or whether to do so with a soft fork or hard fork. 

Regardless , the bitcoin community changed the block limit Satoshi set to from 1MB blocks to 4 million units of weight in 2017 with a fork allowing blocks as large as 3.7MB in size for Bitcoin

&gt;If it had happened and the new currency was so popular and it replaced BTC wouldn't that have made Satoshi's allegedly mined 1M BTCs be worthless?

If you control your private keys you get both sides of the split with hard forks, so no. 

Also ...Satoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory.

Where Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory 

Here is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter - 

https://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/

&gt;In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think **the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed.** Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.

&gt;**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it’s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.

Thus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .

This means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**

Since there was over 3 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in .",2021-08-10 09:46:02

h8bob6h,echoesreach,76,"Article Text:

The pro-Trump internet went wild on Wednesday for the Freedom Phone, a $500 smartphone that comes stocked with conservative apps and promises to liberate anyone else who buys it from Silicon Valley censorship. The American flag-branded phone was immediately promoted by a wide range of right-wing figures, including former Trump adviser Roger Stone, Jan. 6 rally organizer Ali Alexander, and pundit Dinesh D’Souza.

“I’m holding a freaking phone that is not controlled by Apple or Google,” conservative personality Candace Owens told her fans in an Instagram video. “We made the switch immediately.”

Despite being lauded by some of the right-wing media’s leading figures, though, the Freedom Phone’s buyers could be getting less than they expect for its $500 price tag. That’s because the Freedom Phone appears to be merely a more expensive rebranding of a budget Chinese phone available elsewhere for a fraction of the Freedom Phone’s price.

The Freedom Phone was created by Erik Finman, the self-proclaimed “youngest bitcoin millionaire” and one of Time Magazine’s “Most Influential Teens of 2014.” In a video announcing the phone, Finman said he was inspired to create the phone after the tech giants’ crackdown on both Donald Trump and conservative social media app Parler in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot.

“Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg censored MLK or Abraham Lincoln,” Finman said in the video.

Freedom Phone’s website is nearly totally devoid of technical information about the device. Finman declares in the promotional video that the Freedom Phone is “comparable to the best smartphones on the market” and “truly is the best phone in the world.”

In fact, Freedom Phone appears to be a simple rebranding of a budget phone called the “Umidigi A9 Pro,” made by the Chinese tech company Umidigi. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Finman confirmed that the Freedom Phone was manufactured by Umidigi, but couldn’t say immediately which Umidigi phone it was based on.

The Freedom Phone’s $500 price tag would represent a substantial markup on the Umidigi A9 Pro. That phone is available on Chinese retail giant AliExpress for $120 — less than one quarter of the price of a Freedom Phone.

Asked to justify the Freedom Phone’s notable price increase over the Umidigi model, Finman claimed vaguely that the Freedom Phone features customized hardware and improved memory. He committed Wednesday to publishing the phone’s technical specifications — basic details any company selling a phone should be able to provide. As of Thursday afternoon, however, no technical specifications had been provided to The Daily Beast or added to the Freedom Phone’s website.

In an interview, Finman claimed that the Freedom Phone is manufactured in Hong Kong.

“Nothing’s manufactured itself in mainland China,” Finman said.

According to Umidigi’s website, the tech manufacturer’s headquarters is located in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city near Hong Kong. Umidigi didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Freedom Phone also comes preloaded with an array of free apps for social media networks Parler and MeWe, would-be YouTube competitor Rumble, and media networks One America News and Newsmax. Popular battle royale shooter Fortnite is also preinstalled on the Freedom Phone — a fact that confused more than one conservative influencer who promoted the product.

It’s not clear why a handful of free apps, all of which are currently available in the Google Play app store for other Android devices, would justify the price increase over the Umidigi. Even if the apps were ultimately banned from Google’s store in the future, users could still install them on non-Freedom Phone Android phones through a process called “sideloading.”

The vagaries of Freedom Phone’s actual specifications has produced some awkwardness among the Freedom Phone’s legions of conservative influencers. For example, the Freedom Phone’s “Freedom OS” operating system is based on Google’s Android operating system, according to Finman. But during a livestream video promoting the phone, right-wing activist Anna Khait was confused by her fans’ basic questions about the phone.

“Is it an Android?” Khait said. “I’m not really sure. No, it’s a Freedom Phone.”

While Freedom Phone’s founder has failed to include basic details about its device, he did line up a massive ad campaign among conservative influencers. Along with Owens, Stone, D’Souza, and Alexander, the Freedom Phone has also been backed by a number of other figures popular on the right, including Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, journalist John Solomon, and Students for Trump cofounder Ryan Fournier.

Many of the Freedom Phone’s prominent endorsers urged their followers to use a promo code to buy the phone, suggesting that the influencers will receive a cut when their fans buy the phone.

Freedom Phone’s promotional campaign generated attention across Twitter, as conservatives promoted it and critics pointed out its potential technical shortfalls. Finman spoke to The Daily Beast from the Freedom Phone’s launch party, right as he realized the phone’s name had become a “trending topic” on Twitter.

“Oh shit, this is trending,” Finman said. “Wow.”",2021-08-10 04:47:06

h8h0dz1,pmcolt,97,"The quiet woke him.  
  
Not the noise of tires and engines and honking traffic below his apartment window. Not the clamor of pedestrians. Not the brain-rattling report of jackhammers from the construction zone up the street.  
  
He sat up in bed, confused. The City that Never Sleeps was never silent.  
  
Confusion turned to panic when he checked the time. Mid-morning! Yet there was no city noise. No signs of life outside his window. Not even an angry text from his boss asking why he was two hours late for work.  
  
Outside his window he saw a line of cars, all motionless, as though this city street had been converted overnight into a parking lot. And slumped over each steering wheel, a peacefully slumbering driver.  
  
Was everyone in the neighborhood asleep?  
  
Grabbing his binoculars, and feeling a little sheepish, he peered into the windows of the apartments across the street.

Mr. Night Owl on the second floor had his windowblinds closed.

Nothing stirred inside the cluttered apartment of Angry Old Man on the third floor.

And on the fourth floor, Loud Blonde Sex was wrapped up peacefully in her satin sheets.  
  
He opened the Reddit app on his phone. Search. ""Is everyone asleep?"" Sort by newest. Somehow he found himself in /r/nosleep.  
  
There was one recent post, titled ""anyone else awake?"" Four comments.  
  
With a relieved chuckle, he tapped the post.  
  
""Is anyone else awake?!?! Post your location.......""  
  
It was posted by a new user, u/NotSleepingChick, one post. He scrolled down.  
  
First comment. u/NoSleepAutoBot ""It looks like there may be more to this comment. Click here to get a reminder to--""  
  
Second comment. ""Do you want too make $1.000s of dollars a week in BitCoin? Its easy with Cryptex Inc.'s proprietary fluctuation-prediction algorithm--""  
  
Bad bot. He clicked the link to report the post.  
  
Third comment. Bot.  
  
Fourth comment. Bot.  
  
He realized that the moderators must also be asleep.  
  
In desperation he posted ""I'm awake!"" with his city, street address, and apartment number.  
  
Then he started checking location-specific sites farther from his home city. East Coast. West Coast. Norway. South Africa. Southeast Asia. Northwest Territory. No news, no Reddit posts, no Youtube comments had been posted for hours. Traffic cameras showed city after city with no moving traffic, drivers blissfully asleep.  
  
His phone chimed: new notification! A tap, and Reddit opened.  
  
""PrivacyBot has detected what looks like a street address. As a reminder, for privacy reasons, you should never post personal--""  
  
So that was it. There was no sign of wakeful human activity anywhere in the city, the country, or the world. For all he knew, he was the last conscious man on the entire planet. Alone, alone, all all alone in a sea of slumberers.

Except... a human must have posted the original ""anyone else awake"" Reddit post. Right?  
  
The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

This is the edge that dictates nothing can ever be like bitcoin.  Even if another coin did a fair launch (no premise for founders and VCs) anyone who entered would be doing so with the expectation of It’s appreciation in fiat price. You also have to consider the fact that hash power that is directed towards this new coin would be doing this at the expense of hashing on the bitcoin network. Thus it’s implied that those miners would be expecting significant return for their hashing. The bitcoin birth is genuinely impossible to replicate.

[https://imgur.com/a/IphHIsX](https://imgur.com/a/IphHIsX)

Obviously the price turned overnight and we are currently building a downward column of Os.  If this surprised anyone, shame on you.

I want to point out what makes this “turn” significant—at least in my eye.

This column rose 30 boxes in seven days.  We have had 30 box columns before.  While that is good, it is not significant.  What is significant is that it took so long to move up 30 boxes.

It shows that while there remains volatility, it has not nearly as volatile as previous months during this past year.

It is not an official “metric” of point and figure charting but I keep track of how many columns we have in any given month.  Subsequently, I also keep a tally of how many days it takes to create a column (up or down.)  This gives me a sense of the “manic” nature of the market.

If you were to look at PnF charts for things like a boring bank stock, they are not that manic.  Take a look at TD Bank in this chart.  Its moved 3 columns this year.  Thats 80 days per column.

By comparison, bitcoin moves—(2021) a column every two days.

In the first 12 days of August, this is our third column.  Thats four (4)days, on average, for every column.  Since the first of the year the average is 2 days per column.   There has not been such a “slow moving” period this year.

So…are bitcoin traders on vacation?  Is it taking a well deserved breather?  Is it about to go bat-shit crazy?  Does it mean I should spend more time in my garden?   I have no idea.

When you are staring price movements over time and you get used to the “rhythm”, when that changes you notice.  You might not see what causes a change….but you know something is not “like it was.”

So here are today’s numbers:

1. Moved to a column of Os.
2. The formation is 2 columns wide.  A break back up might not be too explosive.
3. The current High Pole Warning target is at $42,136.
4. The price would rejoin the widest part of the previous formation down under $40,100.
5. Support is back at #38,145.  So, a little up and down around our current price would build some higher support.  **Right now this 30 box column looks as much like a cliff as it does the trail of a rocket.  Be careful when there is little support.**
6. A break down would at $37,393.
7. The price would need to rise up tomorrow to $47,010 to break out.  And resistance, starting tomorrow would be $46,086.

Keep an eye on stuff until this settles out a little.  I could see being a light short down to the $42,136 mark.  But I think this is probably a healthy pullback.",2021-08-13 03:28:29

h8x38bx,CalligrapherOneTwo3,49,"I have been involved in this alternative asset class for a few years now and I would highly recommend staying away from Wealthsimple because it is expensive and you will not own any crypto-assets with them as I will detail below. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:  
  
1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montréal which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.     
  
2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them ""offline"" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.  
  
3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy BTCX, ETHX or BTCC in your TFSA. With that said, you do not truly own crypto with any of those because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not the asset itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: ""not your keys, not your crypto"". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. The products mentioned above are not insured. Big risk, but tax free/deferred in a TFSA/RRSP.  
  
4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold ""entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga"" while Quadriga held the ""keys"" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of ""not your keys, not your Bitcoin"" as well as a lack of insurance of clients. Also, as of April, 22, 2021, Thodex, an exchange with 400,000 users went offline while Interpol issued a red notice for its CEO who mysteriously disappeared. According to Fortune,  an international manhunt is currently underway to locate the CEO and secure $2 billion in digital tokens he allegedly embezzled from Thodex.  
  
5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, ETHX, and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the ""keys"". They are the ones who own the real asset (crypto) and simply run the fund with the crypto backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).  
  
6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (crypto), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your ""adjusted cost base"" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your ""adjusted cost base"" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.  
  
7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency.   
  
Now, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:  
  
1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its ""blockchain"".  
  
2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a ""key"" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this ""key"" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word ""seed phrase"" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word ""seed phrase"" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word ""seed phrase"" is essentially your ""keys"" to your assets on the blockchain.  
  
3. Your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word ""seed phrase"" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your ""keys"" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.   
  
4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word ""seed phrase"" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word ""seed phrase"" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your ""keys"". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your ""keys"", never give it out. Period.

h90oedk,Liberosist,41,"Great questions. Ethereum and Bitcoin and decentralized blockchains, and one of the primary ways it can achieve this is by making it relatively easy for users to run nodes. Unfortunately, there are hard limits to how far a single blockchain can scale. Currently, it already takes nearly a day to sync an Ethereum full node, and you need at least a 1 TB SSD. So, Ethereum is already pushing the limits of how far a blockchain can be pushed.

Now, you'll say that X, Y and Z blockchains have lower fees, and that is true. This is for two reasons a) they have much lower demand, or b) they have much higher system requirements. Over time, very few people will be able to afford to run these blockchains, and they'll become very centralized. Indeed, something like Solana is already de-facto centralized. Remember when I said it takes nearly a day to sync an Ethereum node? It's actually impossible to sync a Solana node, so the only way to do it is to get snapshots from centralized entities like Solana Labs. Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with this - it's just a completely different approach that shouldn't be compared to Ethereum.

Arbitrum One is a rollup chain, a separate chain built on top of Ethereum. Thanks to an array of clever innovations, it's possible for rollups to execute transactions off-chain, and then post back only the minimal data back to Ethereum in a compressed form. (See the Finematics link Papazio posted above for a brief explainer of how all of this is possible) This way, across all rollups we can squeeze 4,500 TPS out of Ethereum while at the same time keeping it decentralized and not increasing system requirements. More importantly, because all the data is on Ethereum itself, it's as secure as Ethereum. So, instead of severely compromising on security and decentralization as mentioned above, you get low fees and high security. In the future, Ethereum will release data sharding, which rollups can use to post their compressed data, and thus scale to 85,000 TPS, increasing to millions of TPS over the years. These are the type of scale that's simply impossible to achieve with traditional monolithic blockchains.

As for if Ethereum transactions cost $5,000, yes, Arbitrum transactions will then cost $50. But if that happens Ethereum will be burning $6 trillion in fees per year. After data shards release, this will be more like $120 trillion, which is literally more than the GDP of the entire world. I know some of us are bullish on Ethereum, but come on, there's no way we'll see this level of insane demand!",2021-08-15 20:07:33

Two days ago I made an update. Back then the top 25 whales had 78,64 trillion. They had sold 0,5 trillion a day for 11 days.

Now two days later the whales are down to 74,72 trillion. Thats 2 trillion sold a day! Now they only hold 12,92 % of the circulating supply, down 0,67 % in just 2 days. Just think if Bitcoin whales sold 0,67% of all circulating coins in 2 days.

Now some things I have noticed these past two days:

- Mini whales (1000-200 billion) are also selling huge bags. That is not even counted in the above 2 trillion a day. Bonus info, I counted them and there are 81 mini whales.
- Yesterday I made a little update. Here I statet two things. My next update we would go under 25 whales, and behold now it is 24.
- Yesterday I also statet that our big old whale #1, would drop from #2, and behold he is now #3.

Lastly, look at chart. You see that we eat the dips but we mainly go down because of the whales (+mini) are selling.
The price hurts but if you believe in this coin and the team, then remember that whales selling now is better than later. Just contiue eating that dip. The big whales can't continue this fight and big dips forever.

Almost every Crypto out there is a store of value asset.  Even the ones that are designed to be a currency are not being used as a currency.  People hold these assets because they expect them to appreciate in value.  A medium of exchange coin is something that can easily be exchanged for fiat and is widely accepted by merchants.  Because Dogecoin is basically Bitcoin source code, it has a ton of development and acceptance basically built in.  They are basically saying Dogecoin isn't an investment its a currency.  Maybe there are objectively ""better"" currencies but I can't really think of anything that has anywhere near the adoption of Dogecoin.  XRP, NAno, sure they are great and have low fees but no one actually uses them as a currency.   Maybe instead of instantly hating Dogecoin we should be excited about any adoption of any Crypto?

If so, how did he pay for it - Bitcoin (I have no idea how this works)? His personal CC (as he did with his AM account)? And why download it twice?  Once he downloaded it, he downloaded it. 

2. The articles that have come out in the past few days (discussing the additional un-related officers who were able to access Josh’s files) have discussed that Josh left his CSAM downloads on a file-sharing network/server.  Josh allowed his files to be shareable.   Why would he do this - stupidity, lack of understanding, desire to share? Are these networks specifically devoted to perverted/criminal material? 

3. If Josh purposely left CSAM on a file-sharing network which allowed multiple agents to independently download CSAM from Pest’s IP Address, then why is Pest not also being charged with Distribution or Intent to Distribute CSAM?

I was asked if I could do this daily or weekly. I replied that the whales do not sell to often for a daily (back then they sold 0.5 trillion a day). And here I am, making an update 11 hours since my last.

Right after my morning update the whales went on a rampage. That is the first dip you see on the picture, and they keept going. BUT look at us fighting back! I will come back to that but first some numbers:

- In just 11 hours the whales are down 4.75 trillion. And remember this is not counting mini whales. The whales ""only"" sold 4 trillion the 48 hours before that. Oh and the 11 days before that? 5.5 trillion. Now compare that with todays numbers..

- In these 11 hours the whales sold 0.82 % of the circulating supply. They ""only"" sold 0.67 % the 48 hours before that. I will repeat myself. How would Bitcoin or any other crypto look if whales sold near 1% off the supply in half a day? Or 1.5 % in 2.5 days?

- The cold hard facts: 24 whales with 1 trillion or more. They now hold 69.97 trillion. That is 12.10 % of the circulating supply. 


Now back to todays fight. Look at the picture again, see how many green jabs we hit away after the heavy red blows bye the whales. That  is beautiful. I saw Fudsters today writing that we are the only token that does not recover. Are we looking at the same picture? I sure think that looks like a fine recovery. As I statet in my last post, the whales can't keep doing this. 

To you dip eating, diamond handed Safemoon family. I salute you. 
Today will be a day we shall remember. We have shown our great devs that we believe in them and this token (soon to be coin). Now we keep fighting, because the whales still have some in them. But soon the devs will send us to the moon (if a dev should read this, please don't make me wrong).

My last remark. Don't hate the whales. Them selling now is better than later. They take profit and we can get some cheap Safemoon before the real takeoff. This is a chance for us little people. 
Maybe we some day will become a whale (not their size) and may sell. Or even better, live off the reflections. Not financial advice.

h9anmt8,bitusher,69,"For the US, if you sell, trade for another asset, or spend it becomes a taxable event. One reason, of many, why day trading is a nightmare. 
**Yes, Every single trade on an exchange is a taxable event!**

Now this has several implications. Day trading becomes tax nightmare because every transaction is a taxable event. So someone that daytrades or invests in altcoins may be forced to use specialized software or hire an accountant for thousands of dollars and someone that just makes an occasional purchase of Bitcoin and withdraws it has a much easier task of calculated any taxes especially if they don't make large purchases giving them an excuse to simply not report. Not the same if you are daytrading on exchanges , especially if you have made over 200 trades in a year.

Also there is a distinction between short term and long term capital gains taxes so its much wiser to not sell your BTC for at least 1 year so at worst you have to pay the much lower long term capital gains -

Look at this chart -

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021-capital-gains-tax-rates-and-how-to-minimize-t/
TL;DR - most people will need to pay 15% in the USA for selling BTC after a year.

**Buy Bitcoin , record the price you bought it for and the date in a spreadsheet and wait at least 1 year before selling it or taking profits so if you do decide to pay taxes on profits you are at least in the lower tax category of long term capital gains.**

Many people do not pay taxes when they spend BTC or sell it in person for cash but if you sell on any exchange like coinbase in the future , buy a car, boat, atv, house , land with Bitcoin , you better pay your taxes

Examples - 

**Example 1 legal**: Say you bought 10 BTC for 1k USD each and want to sell them over a year later. Those BTC are now worth 10k each so you have a realized profit of 90k USD, thus your taxable income is now 90k if you have no other income. This would means you are in the 15% tax bracket thus are subject to 13,500 USD in taxes on the profit - deductions and writeoffs. So lets say with your writeoffs and deductions you now have to pay 6.5k in taxes , leaving you with 83,500 USD to put a down payment on a home.

**Example 2 legal** - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You wait a year to sell them and never sell more than the amount where your total income exceeds 39,375 usd per year and than file your taxes where you pay none due to being in the first capital gains bracket **if you have no other sources of income as you state** . This will take several years or much longer(as btc continues to appreciate) to slowly sell off your bitcoin


**Example 3 technically illegal**  - You have 10 BTC purchased or mined at 1k each when you received them. This is now worth 100k USD. You decide to use your reported income from your occupation to buy a home and keep the BTC spending separate on other items. You slowly spend your BTC on amazon, plane trips, hotels, selling small amounts in person or in atms without ID , restaurants in a private manner(personal wallet that you control private keys and you have done the minimum to wash the BTC). Technically you need to report taxes on every tx , but since you are not day trading the exchange you bought the BTC from does not report you and it is unenforceable for the IRS to even know you are spending those BTC. Since you are not buying large items registered to your identity you are also not targeted as well.

Here are other ways people avoid taxes -

spend btc directly for non registered items –technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce

sell at 2 way atms without ID (coinatmradar.com) –technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


sell p2p with others–technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


sell on a DEX like BISQ–technically illegal if you don’t pay taxes but difficult to enforce


Sell the minimum in a country like the USA where you can get in the 0% long term cap gains rate - legal

Keep the btc as collateral and take on debt that is not taxable - legal

Gift bitcoin with a gift tax exemption - legal

Donate bitcoin to charities - legal


For countries like the USA you can use any accounting method as long as you are consistent

If you were to use FIFO(first in , first out) it would look like this

Buy 1- 0.12 BTC @ 1000 USD

Buy 2 - 0.5 BTC @ 3540 USD

Buy 3 - 0.025 @ 4512 USD

Buy 4 - 0.0054 @ 8004 USD

Say you decide to sell 0.5 BTC for fiat(USD) when Bitcoin is valued at 40k usd
This would mean you would take your first in 2 purchases

0.12x40k = 4,800 usd in value - 120 initial purchase price = 4680 in profit

0.38 btc x 40k = 15,200 - original purchase rate of 0.38 (1345.2) = 13,854.2 profit

Total taxable profit = 18,534.8 usd

If its over a year , you are looking at the lower long term cap gains ... most people this would be 15% so you pay 2,780.22 usd in taxes if you decide to pay them
If under a year you will have the much higher ordinary tax rate (22-40% for most people)",2021-08-17 23:44:33

Bitcoin Lottery Mining is when you take hopelessly outdated miners and then have them mine ""solo"" against the network. Every miner has the random chance to create a ""winning block"" and be awarded Bitcoins. However, the slower and outdated a miner is, the less likely they will be able to find the right combination to ""win"" a block before someone else does.



**What's in the photo?**




- A Raspberry Pi Zero W running Raspbian and CGMiner
- A 7-Port USB Hub (Modified)
- Six USB Block Eruptors (333MH/s)
- A 12V to 5V DC-DC converter.

A webcam was added later.



**Modified USB Hub?**



The power rails were reinforced with added capacitors and I stuck thick wire on the rails to allow them to carry more amperage. I found the miners drop out sometimes without it.



**Cool, how much is it pulling in?**



It has been running for over 40 days, and has mined zero coins. It is a hopeless endeavour and mathematically likely will not be able to mine a single coin as long as I live. I think. Of course there's still the sub-atomically small chance...



**Can you mine other coins?**

Nope. Only SHA-256 based coins can be mined by this. I do have another Lottery Miner mining Litecoin+Dogecoin however.



**Can I see it in action?**

Okay, I stuck a webcam on it. [Here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPaJ37ZaYgQ)",2021-08-18 11:59:33

h9c0kmc,GlockAndLoad,66,"Today I decided to spend some time driving around to some of the businesses listed on the Spedn application.

I first stopped at Lowe’s. I picked out a nice little succulent plant that was $10. Approached the cashier and explained to her that I was testing the Spedn application to pay with Bitcoin. She had no idea that Lowe’s was even accepting Flexa/cryptocurrency and she thought it was a cool concept. She was a good sport and scanned my phone a few times as the register denied the request. She  manually inputted the code on the bottom of the screen and no dice. I showed her the message on the app that said “advise the cashier to use ePay”. We both could not figure out how to access that function on the point of sale and I just used my debit card. Could be that their location is not equipped or enrolled in the program so I got back on the road.

Next I end up at Baskin Robbins. I tell the cashier I intend to pay with Flexa/crypto and she is also very excited. I pull up the QR code and she scans it. Transaction goes through instantly and we both smile. She was very interested to learn more and I elaborated a bit about Amp and Flexa. Overall a positive and tasty experience.

Finally, I decide to make my way to Office Depot. I could use some extra pens, so I make my way to the register with some Pilot G2s and my QR code at the ready. This time I’m dealing with a 30ish year old guy and he seems to be just as interested in the Flexa concept as I am. We scan the code and the register says “this code/request cannot be completed”. We try a manual input of the code under the QR image and different types of payment/gift card methods. No dice. So I pay with my debit card instead.

Overall, I had a good experience when it worked at Baskin Robbins. None of the employees had ever heard of Flexa/Amp or even knew that it was possible with their brands. I plan on driving to other locations in the future to see if their registers are more up to date. I want to do my part to grow this network/community/concept so I’ll keep you all updated with my experiences.

h9en8y8,Liberosist,52,"Astute observation. Ethereum will have competition when something totally new and innovative comes along that supersedes Ethereum's long-term vision. Of course, Ethereum will have several years to respond, as network effects take years to unravel. Ethereum found success because it differentiated itself from and superseded ""Bitcoin killers"". Bitcoin had the opportunity to respond, but they botched it, and years down the line they will be flipped by Ethereum. 

The problem with ""Ethereum killers"" is they are perpetually behind, and looking to kill yesterday's Ethereum. Cardano, Solana and EOS are going for 2015-era single-ledger Ethereum bolstered by state channels and centralized relayers. By the way, it's interesting that over time these single-ledger protocols have become increasingly desperate and relying purely on ever greater brute force. Cardano's 2 MB block goals seemed reckless, EOS' 21 validators were highly centralized, Solana requiring you to run high power servers, and now we have ICP who require such exotic hardware that you can only purchase it from them! What this should tell you that Ethereum won the decentralized blockchain market a long time ago, and as time goes on newer players are increasingly distancing them from Ethereum. 

Cosmos and Avalanche are going for 2017-era Ethereum bolstered by sidechains and plasma. Polkadot and NEAR are going for 2019-era Ethereum with sharding. We're in 2021, and Ethereum has moved on to a rollup-centric vision. Can you name a single L1 other than Ethereum that rollups are deploying on? Or a single L1 other than Ethereum that is focused on expanding data availability for rollups? 

You'll note the big difference here is that all of those earlier visions have failed. Rollups are the only one that's working because they are being deployed in production.   
So, what I'm looking for in an actual Ethereum competitor is something that supersedes rollups and data shards, just like rollups made sharding obsolete, and sharding made sidechains obsolete, and sidechains/plasma made state channels obsolete. Given prior history, though, it's most likely that only Ethereum can come up with a model that supersedes rollups + data shards, though I'd argue that rollups + data shards are finally ""good enough"".",2021-08-18 22:24:49

h9bncsh,ArticMine,45,"The really interesting development I see  here is the upcoming Taproot upgrade to Bitcoin. 

&gt; Without Taproot, anyone can detect transactions that use those complex functionalities, which require the creation of multiple transactions. However, the Taproot upgrade will make it possible to ""cloak"" all the moving parts of a Bitcoin transaction that includes these features. So even if the transactions adopt those features, they will look like a single transaction. This is a big win for Bitcoin privacy advocates.

&gt; In fact, Taproot makes it possible to hide the fact that a Bitcoin script ran at all. For example, spending Bitcoin using Taproot could make a transaction in a Lightning Network channel, a peer-to-peer transaction, or a sophisticated smart contract become indistinguishable. Anyone monitoring one of these transactions would see nothing but a peer-to-peer transaction. It's worth noting, though, that this doesn't change the fact that the wallets of the initial sender and final recipient will be exposed.

https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-taproot-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin

The implication here is that it is not possible to tell on the Bitcoin side  that an atomic swap with Monero actually took place. So while Taproot by itself will not make Bitcoin private, Taproot when combined with Monero atomic swaps can throw a real monkey wrench into blockchain surveillance on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

If a significant number of Bitcoin transactions could potentially be an atomic swap with Monero, the days of Bitcoin as a ""surveillance coin"" could very well be numbered. As chess players understand

h9h5bdy,troyboltonislife,1595,"Sure. 

“Over 70% of Eth was premined”: Okay at the time that was 5 million dollars. Since then the Eth foundation has sold a large majority of it to pay for development. Also how much Bitcoin do the early adopters of Bitcoin have compared to the Eth foundation? Satoshi still holds 5% of bitcoin and we don’t even know who he is. He almost certainly owns more as well considering he hasn’t even touched the Bitcoin we do know about. 

“Nobody knows how much Eth exists”: This isn’t true. Anyone can run scripts to calculate the amount of total Eth. It’s possible to do. Is it harder than bitcoin? Yes. Because Bitcoin has a simple command anyone can run to check total bitcoin while Ethereum doesn’t. That still doesn’t mean it’s impossible to do. It’s just harder. 

“Scaling issues…”: Unlike bitcoin, Eth founders have acknowledged scaling issues and have been working on the problem since inception. This is basically a solved problem. Layer 2s make it much much cheaper and Eth 2 will make it even more cheap. Has it been a slow process? Sure but in a year from now anyone complaining about fees because they’re not on a layer 2 will look like an idiot. Fees will be a moot point. 

“Transaction failures”: This has been fixed with EIP-1559 which went through in the London fork. 

“Dex’s are broken”: This is a valid critique of Dex’s but compare total amount you pay on a Cex to total amount you pay on a Dex and you will quickly see that because of fees Cex’s are still much more expensive even with Dex front running. Dex’s can be much more capitally efficient and your usually paying market makers about the same you pay to front runners + LPs. 

“Ethereum is bloated”: This is a problem that’s being worked on. State expiry is the next on the list after the merge to POS. Also saying “amazing infrastructure built out for Eth is a bad thing” is incredibly naive. It isn’t impossible to not use 3rd party block explorers but why bother? As long as you can do it yourself as a backup and can confirm that a centralized third party is giving you correct info then I don’t see a problem. 

“Ethereum is so broken they are abandoning”: I shouldn’t even have to address this. Upgrading ethereum is being spun as a bad thing? The craziest thing is that all currently planned upgrades have all been planned *since Ethereums creation*. If it was in the plans from the start I wouldn’t consider this abandoning.

literal nonsense, its a public blockchain you can see for yourself

&gt; cant scale

no blockchain can scale at L1 and maintain decentralization at this time. this isn't an Ethereum problem its the technology as a whole. L2s are launching this month and sharding will be here after the merge which will drop gas fees significantly

&gt; lost the fee on failed transactions

trying to make it sound like if you want to send ETH and you dont put a high enough fee you lose your ETH. Anyone who has actually used ethereum knows this is false. only time a fee is lost if the gas limit isnt high enough on a smart contract which is a user problem. the computation takes place you cant just refund someones fee on a failed smart contract because that would allow anyone to spam and ddos the network for no cost. this also has nothing to do with the actual cost of gas (setting that too low wont cause you to lose transactions).

If he invests in any of those projects, he's effectively been front-run by someone that got in earlier and is better positioned to cash out. Elon is not going to risk his money on someone who can and probably will dump on him. 

So he found Doge which, once upon a time, was just a sort of funny joke and which, is not really funny any more.  He bought a whole bunch before the run up and basically cornered the market. He is in early enough that those cashing out really can't dump on him. 

The worst part is the other billionaires basically trying to help him pump. There are plenty of other more worthy projects that could use and deserve their help and attention.

Is there an annual dividend currently and if so what day do we receive dividend and what's the dividend yield exactly? What percentage of earnings are retained? I can't find anything about this so I'm guessing there's not a dividend yet but it doesn't hurt to check.

Mining seems like a pretty cool idea but I try to understand and I can't get a clear answer, what's the product that all the miners are producing? Who is buying this product and what is our profit margin on this product exactly? Or are these datacenters like Facebook, where the end-product is free and we just earn money through advertisements? Honestly I should have done more research, but how does the company earn money exactly? How much money are we spending on this mining thing exactly? Does management have a plan to reduce our expenses there, or are they going up?

Is the Bitcoin company currently making a profit or are we still in negative earnings territory right now? Is revenue growing? What's the price to sales ratio? What's the EV/EBITDA compared to the competitors? Do we have a lower EV/EBITDA than these Ethereum guys? What's our debt to equity ratio?

Has anyone figured out yet what the insiders are doing? Is management buying or selling? Who is the CEO of Bitcoin exactly? Is it this guy Paolo I saw on the news or is the Tether company separate from the Bitcoin company? How is the relationship exactly anyway, is Tether a subsidiary of Bitcoin?

Those circled numbers there, it saying ""The price of $0.964, up to 2% above that ($0.983) there is $4,206 worth of Pendle on the order book ready to be bought.""

But the other number.  ""The price of $0.964, down to 2% below that ($0.945) there is only $220.48 worth of buyers ready to purchase your Pendle.""

I.E. there's a bunch of people looking to sell their Pendle for near the market price, but there are NOT a lot of people looking to buy that shit.

So if you are trying to offload ~$1000 worth of Pendle, well there's only $220 worth of buyers close to the market price.   You'll have to dive down through the order book selling for $0.92, then $0.88, then $0.85 until you finally find enough buyers to sell all 1000 Pendle.

And **that's** on the actual Exchange where Buyers are matched with Sellers.  You are trying to go through the App.    With the App you are making an agreement with CDC which then later CDC will need to settle themselves.   That's why Crypto.com will only offer you e.g. $0.75 for each Pendle, because now THEY are the ones that need to go onto an exchange to offload it.   Something with high liquidity like Bitcoin isn't a problem, there will surely be buyers waiting so they'd only charge like a 1% spread, but for something like Pendle it's even more of a risk, so more of a spread.

It doesn't have extraneous features of alts because the focus is on creating the most secure, hardest money known to man without sacrificing any decentralization. It exactly what it needs to be, and still is being upgraded.

Because of it's immaculate conception and cutting edge technology, bitcoin has general consensus as being the most desirable cryptocurrency. Because the social contract is vital to the function of money, that consensus is an feedback loop that if were somehow broken, would damage the credibility of *all* crypto as potential long term stores of value.

Bitcoin was the first, but bitcoin is also the best. Bitcoin is fair. Bitcoin is decentralized. Bitcoin is a technical marvel. Bitcoin has general consensus as *the* store of value.

That is why bitcoin is, and will continue to be, the biggest.",2021-08-22 02:11:55
h9vn1pj,r13k,268,"Hi, I'm not saying this is just another rant or just another ""Cardano is overhyped post"" ... But yes.. It sounds more like a well studied rant. Let me explain why I think that -

Every community have Maxis, that doesn't make Charles fraud or something..
Charles never said go buy Ada, he never said we'll quickly provide solution to all the problems, he said it would take time, that doesn't mean a project is a scam. I mean come on! Ethereum is a scam in the eyes of Bitcoin Maxis.
Why do you think no one will use Cardano? At one point eth used to be the same, in development, without smart contact, or ""famous"" smart contracts, your argument sound more like a Bitcoin maxi rant from few years back arguing about ""Why eth is scam"".
Many other projects are doing great yes! And still eth is preferred even with all that blotted network, do we call eth hyped? No... A $50 transfer asks for $30 in fees, and when this is mentioned, eth lovers will says ""this is what you py for future technology in early stage"" but the issue is there right, saying this is like having faith.. That eth2.0 is ""Going to solve all the problems"".. But it is not here yet, but you still believe it, based on your understanding of the project, the same way people believe that when Smart Contracts are there on Cardano, it can be amazing, is it bad to think that? 
When buying Coins n tokens people can choose sides.. But when it comes to paying for transactions, people want cheapest option available, if Cardano or any other project provide that along with security, scalability don't you think people wants to use it?
Charles never said he wants to kill eth or something. We all are hoping for a interoperability future.

Btw eth also fell bad in 2017 even with all the smart contracts etc, and it fell from high in may to $1600 this june.. That doesn't mean people have discarded eth. Same way $1 to $0.03 for a project that yet to deliver smart contract is fair... You also needs to understand the way Stock market works too. Many companies with promising future but yet to deliver are also bought for high, takes time to mature, capture market, bearing losses and then they rise. And when that happens, all the investment is paid off. It's a long game.
Nokia was once a leader in Mobiles, that doesn't mean people didn't migrated to Android from Symbian.
I know you might say Windows mobile failed.. But in Crypto we are still way early. ✌🏻",2021-08-22 14:36:56

Well, let me burst some bubbles of people in here. The reality is that the infrastructure isn't there at all. We only have 3 bitcoin ATMs installed in the whole country (as far as I'm concerned) and businesses don't have clear regulations on how Btc needs to be accepted and handled,and we are only 3 weeks away from this to take place! 

Our Central Bank published this week a ""regulation"" document in which basically said to all banks operating that they are on their own on how to accept it. 

The government has failed in teaching our people about crypto and btc, there hasn't been an effort in marketing or educating people about it and it can be felt that people are confused and the majority don't want to accept Btc because of this. You can search for polls and you will see that over 70% of people have a negative view on the whole bitcoin law. 

The whole thing has been a PR stunt that yeah, functioned to impress the crypto community, but has the potential to cause more harm than good because of the incompetence the government has shown.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

https://bluewallet.io - easy to use, Open Source, Non-custodial (although I believe LN is custodial if not using own node)

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android or iOS

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

https://muun.com - Muun - another non custodial LN wallet working on Android and iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

If what you see in the video seems like something you can do on your own, purchase one *directly* from the official store. Never buy a used one.  Also recommend buying a disaster proof bag, as in water and fire proof. These are cheap on Amazon.

2. When you get it, install it on a PC that has current antivirus software or a trial version of Malware Bytes. Run all your updates.

3. Run the setup and write down the password phrases on the papers that come with your device.

4. Follow the instructions you saw on youtube to send a very small amount of bitcoin to your wallet only, as a test.

5. Shut down the pc and start over, except this time, try to recover your wallet. This is an important step to confirm your seed phrase is written correctly and the money is there.

6. Repeat this until the full amount is in there, and then take steps to weather and tamper protect this wallet. The seed phrase is more important than the device. Some people buy metal plates to etch them, as weatherproofing is very important.

If this is too much to do, alternatively you can:

1. Keep Bitcoin where it is, on an exchange or usb key etc.  If the security is tied to a phone number, this is dangerous. Change that to Google Autheticator or Authy (app) and write down your 2fa backup code in a safe place.  This is less secure but most people use this method as its the best for beginners.

ha18wsz,Merlin560,88,"PnF Update

https://imgur.com/gallery/fnpt12s

The rise last night moved us to a High Pole Warning position.  This happens when the price moves four boxes above the break out point.

The high pole warning reversal target starts out at $47,010.  A drop that that point would not be horrific, and it would be healthy.

A reversal, and then a swing back up to another break out would complete the formation of a “bullish catapult.”   (I don’t make the names, I just report them.). This formation is the most bullish formation in PNF Charting.

Here are the numbers:

1.  The formation is 7 columns wide.  This is not a “big” formation for Bitcoin.  But…we are in a world that has moved mining from China to other places so the entire market space may be evolving.

2. We are in a triple Tip break out (which is very positive) and last night we triggered a high pole warning.  A reversal can be expected—back down to the 47,010 price target.

3. The price target for this move is based on the width of the formation.  That price hits $51,414 over the next 10-20 days.  The second price target, based on the size of the last breakout has already been met.

4. The current Trend Line is at $33,517.  We are 41 boxes above the trend line.  

This is a good move and it predicts some decent gains over the coming weeks.  But expect a pull back.  Be prepared to see it go down under $47,000—although that would probably be a brief visit.",2021-08-23 23:12:53

That decision made by a court in China’s Jiangsu province was handed down in July 2021 and the matter (involving money owed by an Evergrande subsidiary) was resolved just days later. But since, Evergrande’s astronomical debt burden has continued to unravel and many fear the ripple effects could spread globally. Some have even suggest it could be the catalyst for another subprime-style crisis.

**Who is China Evergrande?**

China Evergrande cranes dominate the skylines of many Chinese cities. The company develops and manages real estate across China, primarily focussing on residential apartment complexes. According to the company website, Evergrande Real Estate owns more than 1300 projects in over 280 Chinese cities.

It is the second-largest property developer in China and ranks amongst the top 150 companies in the world based on revenue. According to Fortune 500, the company has over 123,000 employees, and posted total revenues of $73.5 billion in 2020.

Alongside its enormous property development and management operations, Evergrande has also made investments into other sectors such as electric vehicles, internet and healthcare businesses.

The company was founded by billionaire businessman Xu Jiayin in 1996. He is ranked by Forbes as the third-richest person in China and the 31st richest man in the world.

Xu Jiayin, 62, announced his resignation as Chairman of Evergrande Real Estate Group on Tuesday, August 17 2021.



**Sinking ship?**

 Xu Jiayin, the founder of China Evergrande, resigned from his role as Chairman of Evergrande’s Real Estate Group.
Evergrande is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKG: 3333). Since July 2020, its share price has plunged around 80%.

China Evergrande’s debt crisis
There’s speculation of more than $356 billion of global debt exposure to China Evergrande.

The company is the largest issuer of US dollar denominated Chinese junk bonds – bonds that very few investors now want to touch.

As Hilliard MacBeth, author of When the Bubble Bursts, puts it on the Richardson Wealth blog:

“Evergrande bonds which had been trading at par, and maturing in 2025, are now trading below 40 cents.

“This implies a return of more than 2.5 times in just 4 years, plus a 10.5 percent coupon, which means that the market believes there is little chance that Evergrande can pay this debt.”

Asia Markets notes the yield to maturity on Evergrande bonds maturing in 2023 is now hovering at around 35% – an huge yield, implying a risk level unacceptable by most investors.

Rapid debt-fuelled expansion is widely attributed as the main reason China Evergrande finds itself is a such a perilous position today.

“They did it (growth) in such crazy mass, with lots and lots of debt,” explained macro strategist Tyler Neville on the On The Margin podcast.

Since the China Guangfa Bank Co court proceedings were made public in July, there has been a series of further concerning developments.

Just days later, an avalanche of law suits were initiated by Evergrande suppliers for alleged unpaid bills. Those include Huaibei Mining Holdings Co, which took court action over an alleged unpaid bill of $84 million, an unnamed investment company that won a court order to freeze Evergrande’s 20% stake in Shanghai-listed Langfang Development Co, and advertising company, Leo Group, which claimed it was owed around $61.5 million.

Further, Lanzhou City overnment officials have publicly revealed the city is owed money for land.

The extend of the debt problems has, not surprising, prompted ratings agencies to take action.

On Thursday, August 5, S&amp;P downgraded the company’s credit rating from B- to CCC (two levels), while also lowering the long-term rating on U.S. dollar notes issued by Evergrande from CCC+ to CC-.

“Evergrande’s liquidity position is eroding more quickly and by more than we previously expected,” said S&amp;P.

“The company’s non-payment risk is escalating, not only for the substantial public bond maturities in 2022, but also for its bank and trust loans and other debt liabilities over the next 12 months.”

Other major ratings agencies, including Moodys and Fitch, have also posted similar credit rating downgrades.

**Survival**

While investors have long debated the presence of a Chinese property bubble, bubble speculators may be vindicated should Evergrande completely collapse… And global market bears too.

While it’s in Beijing’s best interest to try mitigate a catastrophe, the administration has stopped well short of indicating a bail-out may be on the table – this a continuation of a more cautious policy approach to debt that’s been a trademark of the China Government in recent years.

On Thursday August 19, The People’s Bank of China and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission took the unusual step of publicly urging Evergrande to take action to reduce its debt risk. It followed a meeting with company executives.

“Evergrande, as a top real estate company, must earnestly implement strategic arrangements made by the central government to ensure the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, and strive to keep operations stable,” the public statement read.

The statement went on to urge Evergrande to “actively diffuse debt risk and maintain real estate and financial markets stability.”

24 hours later, Evergrande management responded saying it would “fully implement” Beijing’s requirements, including reducing its debt risks and maintaining market stability.

There has been some progress on that front in recent days.

China Evergrande has confirmed reports that it’s in talks with smart phone manufacturer Xiaomi to sell a stake in its EV business, while negotiations with major creditors to extend loans have been successful. But the scale of the debt runs deep and much more will need to be done to avoid what many fear is the greatest threat to global markets.

**China’s Lehman Brothers?**

The collapse of world’s most indebted property developer could have an enormous impact on global investment markets.

David Llewellyn-Smith, co-author of The Great Crash of 2008 (currently a strategist at renowned Australian Investment Manager, Nucleus Wealth), is watching the devolvements closely and believes the significance of what’s occurring should not be lost on investors.

“Evergrande was once China’s greatest property developer. It is now an unbelievably over-leveraged tottering edifice with fewer and fewer friends and a near-impossible equity value below 10% of its debt load,” he wrote in Australian publication, Livewire.

Llewellyn-Smith also highlights something many industry insiders have long suspected – that the stable coin Tether is exposed to Evergrande’s commercial paper.

“This $300 billion debt monster is potentially China’s Lehmann Brothers, trading in subterranean junk debt to Chinese (and global) counterparties (which may include Bitcoin via Tether) at spreads that imply insolvency. There is no realistic scenario for restructuring Evergrande in which market dislocation is avoided. It is only about how much pain the Chinese government can bear.

“And there is a conga-line of Evergrandes queuing up in the property sector.”

Tyler Neville made a similar comparison noting: “If they’re borrowing money from the commercial paper market and doing all these funky things then this is sub-prime on steroids.”

“There’s probably a lot of other exposure… you could be looking upwards of a trillion or a couple trillion dollars.

Hilliard MacBeth further points out the baking sector “contagion” that could emerge.

“So far, Evergrande’s financial problems have not impacted other large developers or the Chinese banks. The largest Chinese developer, Country Gardens, is still trading near its all-time high,” he says.

“But aggressive price cuts on home pre-sales by Evergrande pushed home prices back to 2016 levels. Land costs have risen substantially, so profit margins are eroding. This could impact all developers, as buyers wait for price reductions before buying.

“The largest banks in the world are Chinese, with six of the top 11… The exposure of Chinese banks to Chinese real estate developers is enormous. About half of the assets (loans) held by the top ten banks are in China, about $15 trillion.”

h9yekx5,andylowe14,48,"ERGO - it's one of the most innovative and revolutionary new layer one cryptos and has tremendous support from both a strong community and influential figures like Charles Hoskinson. He even said that he can't believe ergo is not a top 10 project, based on how impressive it is. 

The project itself is a blockchain made in the image of bitcoin with an improved eUTXO model similar to cardano, so it can interoperate with Cardano for things like ergoDex which will be the premier Dex for ergo and cardano chains with shared liquidity. Similarly their oracle solution promises to be the best option for Cardano projects since it uses a revolutionary oracle pool design and the ergo lead dev was one of the founders of smartcontract.com (which is now chainlink). 

Ergo already has NFTs being minted bought and sold for a fraction of the cost of ETH NFTs. It also has its own crypto backed stable coin called sigmaUSD which is decentralised and not dependent on fiat.

Currently at a market cap of less than $500mil, with Cardano ecosystem coming to life soon, ergo has extreme growth potential 

Ps. If this is important to anyone (it should be) - ergo was launched with no pre-mine, no VCs, no private sale and no team wallet. There were zero tokens in existence when ergo launched. This is a very rare thing these days to have such a fair launched project and it's one of the reasons ergo has such a passionate community supporting it. It reminds me of the cardano community and we all know how that project turned out.

`I used to do the same thing, look on https://www.teen-chat.org . That place is a complete cesspool for pedos, and I'll tell you exactly how I used to do it securely.`  
  
`Get good security: Set up a proxy, connect to a VPN that doesn't keep logs (IPVanish, Tunnelbear, NOT NORDPVN)`  
`Set up a new skype account that isn't connected to you at all, this means new email as well. Do all of this with your security on.`  
`Download a pack of images/videos, I use https://nulled.to , I'm a member on there, as soon as you register to go leaks, and then thothub. They have a lot of pics to use for profile pictures, selfies, etc.`  
`On the teen chatroom, say something like ""hey, any older guys on?"". You will get flooded with PMs. on the website, with one message in the chatroom you can easily get 20 people messaging you privately. Chat with them for a bit, and get their age, and say you're 15 or 16. Those ages are the most effective.`  
`Make sure to seem legit to them, they know police are looking for people like them, and they will want proof you're a real girl in some way, use your social engineering skills for this.`  
`Once you know they are pedos, you tell them to add you on skype and say this: ""hey how about we talk on skype and maybe trade?"" something like that.`  
`Try to talk to just one person at a time on skype, because if you take too long to reply they'll suspect you.`  
`Once you've got them on skype, say ""ok want to trade pics?"". If they do say yes which they likely will, use the pics you got from the pack in step 3.`  
`Once you have their dick pics and you've traded a few pics, say exactly this when you're about to trade again: ""Hey skype is giving me an error when I try to send you the pic, can you send me your email and I'll send you the pic there? We can still chat here, its just the pic.""`  
`If they do send you their email, you've got them unless they have a throwaway, which we'll get to in step 14.`  
`Google their email, they will probably have facebook. Make a fake facebook account to see their profile, note down the names of their family and employer, as well as their city. As much personal info as possible.`  
`Here is where you make your money. You can say this however you want, but I usually say something like this: ""Alright (name), is this you? (facebook link). I'm going to send the chat logs we just had to all of your facebook friends if you don't send me $100 in bitcoin or gift cards within the next 30 minutes. Do you want (family member name) to know about what you say to 16 year old girls online? I didn't think so. If you need help getting bitcoin, tell me and I'll help you buy some. Be quick.""`  
`Ok that's it really, they'll pay you most of the time. If not you can report them or whatever you want to do, I like sending letters to their employer mentioning their name to scare them into paying you. Make sure not to leave fingerprints if you do that.`  
`Now, if they do have a throwaway, you can try to threaten them with police instead, or send a ip grabber to their email that leads to nudes and say you keep your pics on there because your laptop has low storage. You'll have to think about this part, be creative, just scare them however you want. If you do get their IP, you'll have their city which might be scary enough, you can find what the police force is called in their area and say you'll contact them`  
`Enjoy your money! If they paid with crypto, pretty easy to cash out, I'd prefer buying digital stuff with it instead of cashing it out, its a bit safer but you should be ok either way, a pedo will most likely not report you for taking $100 when you have proof of him preying on children.`  
`If they paid with gift cards, sell them on websites like paxful for bitcoin.`  
`Don't report them after unless you have very good security. If you report them and they're going to court for this, they have NOTHING to lose by reporting you for blackmail, and the police can investigate you and try to trace you.`  
`If you guys could leave your free awards for me I'd really appreciate it because I wrote this myself, didn't think it'd be this long lol. Enjoy.`",2021-08-27 18:22:06

Better decentralized exchanges, that can compete with centralized exchanges. Remove KYC, remove the risk of fractional reserve and exit scams.

It survived many adverse events, and one interesting metric is that it's 200 weekly EMA was never negative - meaning that someone buying BTC never lost money if they held for 4 years.

But could it crash, and crash hard? Yeah it could. Could it go to zero? Yes it could. As the old investor adage says, ""Don't invest in things you don't understand"". If you read on BTC and feel confortable in the technology and that it's going to stick around, put whatever amount you feel comfortable, and if past returns are indicative of future returns (which any financial advisor is obligated to tell you, isn't always the case), if you are ready to hold for four years you could have some profit in your pocket.

haumua3,GetYourAssToPluto,94,"I'm *very* biased, but it's never been more clear to me that ETH is probably the most visibly undervalued asset in the entire crypto space. 

**Some big picture points:** Ethereum is a global, decentralized network that has just [41% of the market cap of Bitcoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en) but is settling [196% as much value each day](https://money-movers.info/), has users willing to pay [4,654% more in fees](https://cryptofees.info/) to purchase block space each day and has just made an upgrade (EIP-1559) at the protocol layer resulting in a [net-issuance reduction of 39%](https://watchtheburn.com) (this number is variable but has always been over ~28% and is currently trending upwards). Ethereum has achieve all this (and much more) while still - *today* - being searched for globally [roughly 75% less than bitcoin](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=ethereum,bitcoin) and having [45% fewer daily active addresses](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/on-chain-metrics/comparison-bitcoin-ethereum/number-of-active-addresses-7dma). 

And all of this is pre-merge aka The Triple Halvening/[The Cliffening](https://ethmerge.com/). This is why I think one day seeing $100k ETH is no hopium, no meme - if you're a long-term investor with a high amount of conviction in Ethereum. Crucially, you can't buy conviction, you can't fake conviction, and no person (or reddit comment) can truly sell you conviction. From my experiences, long-term conviction takes time, interest, and effort and has to be earned on a continual basis. Personally, Ethereum and ETH earned my conviction as a long-term investor back in 2017 and that conviction has only gotten stronger over the last 4 years.  

For the past several months, L1 blockchains like Solana and Cardano have been making incredible returns against ETH. That's great for them and for the holders of those coins, but I don't think it will last forever - most importantly, I don't think it will last *long term*. When ETH eventually rips to $4k and $6k and $10k and $20k+ (with *dozens* of corrections throughout), very few L1s, if any, will be able to outperform or even keep up. We can see evidence of this from the last major bull cycle and also from very recent history. For example, Avalanche (AVAX) increased 1,000% against ETH over the course of 37 days in January-February 2021. Today, even with recent 200% gains, AVAX is still [down 58% from its ATH against ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche). 

A few recents tweets from Adriano Feria, with a chart of some of the 2017-2018 ETH killers (NEO, EOS, XRP, LSK), demonstrates this point perfectly:


&gt; This is a cautionary tale for those who are new to the crypto market and may be hungry for massive gains taunted by #Ethereum Killers.

&gt; These are [some of the top $ETH Killer contenders](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E97KZWgXsAAv5tZ?format=jpg&amp;name=orig) from the prior crypto cycle. All of which provided cheap fees (even cheaper now)

&gt; Every single one of these projects had a community of enthusiastic supporters who were sure the flipping was just around the corner because the tech was better and Ethereum was broken. [[Source](https://twitter.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1431806185863319555)]

&gt; There is one crypto asset that has been CONSISTENTLY [trending downward for the past 8 years.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E97El_NWEAEe1U7?format=jpg&amp;name=orig)

&gt; They say it's because there are thousands of shitcoins diluting the market, but somehow there is another asset that is trending up.

&gt; They say also say ""#Ethereum is like Myspace"". 🤔 [[Source](https://twitter.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1431800263011028994)]



I'm no trader, nor flipper - directly because of the experiences I've had trying (and sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing) to trade and flip assets that I had no actual conviction in. None of this is to say that a different person can't have the same level of conviction in a project like Solana or Cardano, many certainly do and that's fine. 

At the end of the day, it's the millions (and eventually billions) of users and developers and businesses and governments who will decide what's actually valuable and what's not.",2021-08-30 06:13:20
hat7myr,bitusher,86,"Some educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million and the supply schedule-

1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi’s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveler's checks, other checkable deposits

2) “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,” Nakamoto said. “If Bitcoin remains a small niche,” he added, “it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”

3) Some believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks – roughly every 4 years.

4) ""A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube 21.0 m on a side.""

5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or

50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise

6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.

hawv4e3,Show84,53,"Banks such as JP Morgan have been investing in Bitcoin since 2017 all the while saying Bitcoin is bad.  Because they don't want a new technology to put them out of business and they don't want the general public to become wealthy.

Banks, politicians, corporations, government, they all spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty Doubt) through the media.

The following is FUD:

Speaking at a conference in New York, the boss of America’s biggest bank said he would fire “in a second” anyone at the investment bank found to be trading in bitcoin. “For two reasons: it’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”

The following is called hypocrisy:

He added: “The currency isn’t going to work. You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think that people who are buying it are really smart.

Fiat money, is printed out of thin air.

3rd World countries with hyperinflation, also spreading FUD:

“If you were in Venezuela or Ecuador or North Korea or a bunch of parts like that, or if you were a drug dealer, a murderer, stuff like that, you are better off doing it in bitcoin than US dollars,” he said. “So there may be a market for that, but it would be a limited market.”

We are literally living in a historical time, as El Salvador is making Bitcoin legal tender.  More countries will soon follow.

More FUD... He's also shocked that people are intelligent and can see the benefits of a new technology:

It is worse than tulip bulbs,” Dimon said, referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s. He predicted big losses for those investing in bitcoin. “Don’t ask me to short it. It could be at $20,000 before this happens, but it will eventually blow up,” he said. “Honestly, I am just shocked that anyone can’t see it for what it is.”

Fast forward to 2021 (After spreading FUD for 4 years). 

Banks now publicly saying they're offering Bitcoin to their RICH WEALTHY clients only.  (You see how they want the general public to stay poor?) 

They've been spreading FUD for years, saying Bitcoin is bad.  That way they can buy Bitcoin at very low prices and keep as many uninformed and uneducated people away from Bitcoin as possible.

The downside of Bitcoin is the same thing as the upside. No one can edit it. If you accidently send money to the wrong address, no one can reverse the transaction. 

Now that it has become obvious that Bitcoin is not very useful as a bank in the real world, the promoters of Bitcoin are suggesting that it could be used as a store of value like Gold.

There was a time where beanie babies were a good store of value, but eventually people stopped buying them and the price went down.

The order of the day is confusion. Until now, 7 days until the law kicks in, the government is starting to place all the bitcoin ATMs in public spaces, a move that is considered a bit controversial since we don't know if the whole thing is being done by a public or private entity. The whole licitation process is lacking of transparency and nobody knows if it is the government handling everything or a private company the one in charge.

There has been very little effort in educating people about Btc and crypto in general. A massive campaign should have started since day 1,but this effort is missing. Because of this people are confused and feel that the whole Btc thing is being shoved down our throats (something I do agree tbh). You can check the polls and see that an overwhelming majority of salvadorans, over 70%,have a negative feeling towards the bitcoin law.

Regulations for businesses are still missing, nobody knows how Btc will be accounted and handled other than through the ""chivo app"". Only regulations that have been issued are for banks and financial institutions in which they need to inform their customers about certain information related to btc, for example the nature of blockchain transactions and that they are irreversible and give a sort of average of price fluctuation.

The whole thing just proves how incompetent the government has been in handling the issue and that more debate was needed, not just approving the law just because the president wanted it.

I'm afraid that the whole thing will be a fiasco and it will bring more harm than good. I just hope that other places that want to adopt crypto will follow better models.

hazqan8,LogrisTheBard,70,"This is going to be a rant about the unfortunate end state of Defi if we continue along our current trajectory. The fundamental issue is that we’re using money for Sybil resistance. Simply using governance tokens as a vote count makes money correlate super-linearly to influence. Vitalk [recently wrote](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) about this problem and it has been bubbling on my mind for some time. So let’s start with the basics, how we got here, where we will end up if we don’t course correct, where we want to be instead, and things we need to build to get there. 

Going back to basics, we need to reach consensus. We do this by voting amongst a set of peers whom are unwilling or unable to collude with one another to dishonest ends. Why are they unable to collude? Well, if they collude in public others will rally against them. As a memetic schelling point, fucking over dishonest actors that are attacking the system is tried and true classic (see ETC). So, to conspire effectively, they have to do so in secret. However, as the number of peers in a conspiracy grows it becomes exponentially more likely that a leak will occur. This creates a game theory scenario that makes it profitable and safe to be honest and risky to be dishonest. The more peers you have the better this system functions.

In a blockchain, you inherit the problem of Sybil resistance. Addresses are free. So how do you ensure that all voters are unique peers? Bitcoin uses proof of work to answer this. With proof of work you get voting proportional to the cost invested in your vote. Once you vote, that investment is gone. To offset these costs your vote comes with a lottery ticket and occasionally you win the lottery so the expected value of participating is positive. The actual source of Sybil resistance is money. Proof of resources invested in a vote that can’t be faked.

Proof of stake reuses this capital based notion of Sybil resistance. Rather than your investment being lost with every vote though your investment is reused from vote to vote which makes the system more capital efficient. However, it’s still money proportional to influence.

Governance tokens basically just extend the ideas of proof of stake. Starting with the food token craze, every project today seems to need to launch a governance token. Without it, there isn’t enough marketing power. Outside of some notable L2’s people just don’t have enough reason to care about your new thing amongst the thousand other things happening in Ethereum unless there is money to be made. A governance token distribution gets people to market their bags. This is all fine and well until it comes time to actually use those tokens for voting. Then several problems arise.

The first problem is voter apathy. When only 20-30% of the tokens are voting it gives outsized influence to whales. Most projects today don’t directly reward voting. Even if voting doesn’t take gas it still takes time and Defi is already past the limit of human attention if you want to be informed and vote on every project. There’s just too much going on. Clearly if active voters are a required component of an ecosystem they need to be incentivized directly. This goes against pure buyback + make/burn philosophy of Maker and argues in favor of systems like Kyber that explicitly direct profits to voters.

The second problem has to do with coordination amongst a large number of peers. It’s an age-old problem that technology has helped with but not perfectly solved. You can’t feasibly have thousands of people in a meeting with an open mic. Active voices have to be throttled or every meeting will just turn into twitch chat and the system can’t function at all. So how, do we throttle it? Often by voting weight. You get a handful of the most influential players in a room and talk about the most important issues of the day. This creates tiers of users though; those with a mic and those without. If these tiers are defined using money, even indirectly, then those with money have a categorically different amount of power than those without. Not just proportionally more influence, not just on another scale, but entirely new types of influence. If I donate $10 to a senator I get an automated thank you email; if I donate $10M to a senator I get direct personal access. Using governance tokens as we do leads to using money as a filter for tiers of power.

Getting political for a moment, I’m not suggesting a world where everyone has an equal say in everything. We live in a world today where we can’t agree on basic facts even when ignorance is literally a matter of life and death and people are dying by the millions. We need a system that directs influence to those with knowledge and good intention and money is at least partially effective at this. However, each necessary participant in an ecosystem should have and retain influence. An incentive system should not allow the influence of any necessary actor to entropy to zero over time.

This comes down to wealth inequality and wealth accumulation. These are at historically dangerous levels and accelerating every year. In historic times this was about when French heads started to roll. I doubt that kind of reset is viable today. The wealthy, at least the type I’m talking about, are no longer country locked, reachable in any material sense by a mob, or really accountable in just about any way for the evils they do.

Outside of just the top sub point-something percent the real wealth of the world is controlled by institutions. This capital is granted the rights of people while being effectively international, immortal, unjailable, and legally beholden to short term shareholder profits above all else. It is a dangerous recipe. They write the laws in their favor. They can manipulate and endanger global economies and and are not accountable for the harm they cause. Even when they get caught and convicted in court they pay a few days worth of their profit in a fine and continue on with business as usual. The wealth gap is **staggering**. I really can’t bold that enough. The gap is staggering, and growing every day.

If you are thinking that Defi is going to change that, think again. While Defi has democratized access to the financial system, the opportunities it provides still require capital. Once the regulatory clarity for institutional custody and voting procedures have been established these players will own crypto. Many already do and are aggressively hiring crypto capable talent. Wealth inequality is here to stay and it’s only getting worse. If we tie influence to capital, we set ourselves up for a rather dystopian future. Whatever cypher-punk anarchist utopian visions crypto founders had, we aren’t heading there unless we correct our course. So what can be done? Vitalik has several answers to this in his post. I’d like to build on a few of them and offer something of a vision for a possible future.

The first has to do with a different solution to Sybil resistance than money. While I’m aware of projects like proof of humanity and BrightID I don’t think a social solution can’t be eventually gamed. This problem exists today on reddit with bot networks that create a new account, post some repeatable meme, and then upvote themselves to bootstrap their account past the Turing test level. It’s an endless cat and mouse game like spam filtering. In the long term I think we’ll see a bunch of Legos taking the form of things like POAPs, some on chain history oracles, social attestation systems, and implicit KYC systems such as being whitelisted by Nexus Mutual and others. While no Lego is perfect the combination of them will be sufficient to enable systems like quadratic funding to function. This can reduce the influence of capital to alone to something resembling a logarithmic function rather than a super-linear one. I’m working on one such Lego personally.

Next, we need a standard delegation mechanism across Defi like xToken provides but tied to celebrity rather than “economic mandate” which is just too abstract to answer every governance vote. Delegation systems allow informed, public participants to rise in influence above their personal capital. I want to be able to shop for my representative to each project, delegate to them, and split the voting profits with them. Obviously this requires that more projects begin directly tying rewards to voter participation but I think this is inevitable. xToken is currently the frontrunner on a standard delegation platform but they can’t support a representative system at the moment because they can’t fragment the liquidity of each xToken. Either they’ll need to crack that underlying problem or another platform will come along eventually and replace them. As a bagholder I hope it’s the former.

Lastly, we need a good pattern for reputation systems that interplay with voting influence. If governance tokens represent monetary influence then reputation is inalienable (perhaps decaying) influence. Reputation would be earned against some combination of objective functions that each project could define. Maybe someone can build some type of pluggable oracle that maintains reputation scores for each project on an L2 which could integrate into snapshot. The details on this need a lot more thought. How are those objective functions defined? Is your monetary influence capped somehow by your reputation? Is there any way of discouraging people from “selling” their reputation by incentivized delegation? How do you solve the nothing at stake problem for those voting with reputation? It’s a complicated topic that needs a lot more work but I agree with Vitalik that we need to move past straight token voting and this is one of the most straightforward ways to do so.

hb4c86s,JupiterXX,344,"You have it backwards. Market cap comes from price. Not the other way around. Here’s a comment I’ve left a few times that seems to help people:

Market cap is calculated based on the current price and that price is predicated on supply and demand. 

Here is the theory: Let’s say that everyone was holding and there was only a single xrp available. And let’s also say that someone wanted to use the ledger system to move $1000. They would then have to agree with the seller to buy it at a minimum of $1000 and assuming they could come to an agreement that then becomes the marginal rate. That then adjusts the market cap to be $44 trillion (or whatever). That does not mean all the coin is collectively worth that much, only that the coin is currently selling for that as an indication of strength of value based upon available supply and current demand. 

This is a copy paste from yet another comment I made in a different thread that might also help shed some light: 

I encourage you to try not to use market cap like this. Market cap is less of “how much is this coin collectively worth” and more of “how much is someone willing to pay for a coin today”. 

The market cap calculation is based on the marginal rate multiplied by the amount of coin. That is very different than saying someone paid a trillion dollars for all the Bitcoin. 

I’ll say it the reverse way. Let’s say that you owned all the Bitcoin and wanted to cash out. How much would you get for it? Not a trillion. Once you started to sell on the open market, it would lose value and you would struggle to find buyers at a given price. If you wanted to keep selling, you’d have to drop your price and then the market value would drop. So from this example, you can see that the real value of the coin is not the same as the market value. Not even close. 

Market value is more of a reflection of popularity across coins. It goes up when the demand goes up and down when the demand goes down. 

So, while I think it might be hard to hit $100, I do not think this because of any market cap limitation.",2021-09-01 08:20:13

People aren't actually buying the clip. They don't have any ownership of the underlying intellectual property. If somebody buys an NFT for anything (Twitch clip or not), they are buying a hash/code that arbitrarily is assigned to said clip or item/concept.  


Example: You own a blue shirt, and I really like it. I offer to pay for an NFT for that shirt for $1,000. You can accept, and if you did, I would own a hash or code (not sure if it's always in this format) which in reality is shown on paper as ""NY7001PYU"". I own this NFT - NOT the shirt. I have no expectation of ever possessing, touching, seeing, or owning the shirt. I just own the hash/code that is ""associated"" with it.

How many of them are willing to take what they get?  That's the part that gets hypernormalized to me.  Other countries might have worse economies but better social programs and even work conditions, the US had none of that.  So while other countries are in bad shape, I think that what's to come in the US is getting much worse, which is why you have so much talk and stories of people who have chose to leave while they can or already left.

* Used (and continue to use) 4% rule as my guideline.
* Investments now worth $1.4m
* I got lucky w/ this market

More deets:

* I've withdrawn far less than I anticipated (around 3%). Turns out those FIRE'd people were right: we spend far less than we anticipate, once we're actually in retirement.
* I do ACA, a high-deductible plan, while I've still got good health 
* Investments are 80% in a total market fund and 15% in a total bond fund, and 5% in bitcoin. Just kidding 5% in cash
* I don't pay rent; paid off my house a year before I FIRE'd. But that doesn't exclude me from $2k in monthly housing expenses like prop tax, skyrocketing insurance (fires/floods), and structural upkeep. Nor does it exclude me from the substantial lost opportunity cost of using investment capital to pay off the mortgage (I'd be a multi-millionaire if I'd kept the mortgage and kept that capital in index funds)
* Yes, my good fortune will likely be challenged when the market crashes like it's historically supposed to do, and inflation spikes even more, and my body starts aging like older bodies tend to do

Francis Ford Coppola, the producer of Clownhouse, told the child actors who brought the charges against the director that they'd never work in Hollywood again because of it. The director was found with video and pictures of him raping these boys. So he gets arrested and spends like 3 years in prison. he gets out and starts making movies again. because like I said Hollywood is fucked. Makes that movie Powder for Disney. Then makes Jeepers Creepers.

now let me explain Jeepers Creepers is about a monster that specifically preys on teenage boys. Like in one scene he sniffs a boys underwears and shit. They knew this director was a pedophile at the time. he write a movie that is basically about a pedophilic monster. And Hollywood pays him millions of dollars to make it.

**Fake Investment Scams that use Fake Cryptocurrency Websites:**

Fake cryptocurrency websites controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common.  Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency.  Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested.  Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website.  In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim’s account on their website.  Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website.  Sometimes the scammer will let the victim “remove” some of their money from the website (actually it’s just the scammer sending some of the victim’s money back to the victim) as a way to make the website seem legitimate, before asking the victim to “reinvest” even more of their money.  Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer’s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer’s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake.

You can post the scammer’s wallet address here on r/scams.

If the scammer used Bitcoin, then you can report the scammer’s Bitcoin wallet address here:

If the scammer used Ethereum, then you can report the scammer’s Ethereum wallet address here:

hbg3fgd,AMos050,125,"&gt;I know there are many other cryptocurrencies but they are less established.

Bitcoin only accounts for 41% of the crypto market cap, so I think you're doing other crypto, especially Ethereum, a disservice here.

&gt;However, unlike other speculation like antiques, art, real estate, etc. crypto has no inherent value.

I don't really agree that something like art has more inherent value than the paper it's printed on. Real estate does of course but it's hardly a speculative investment since shelter is a human need.

Crypto's value comes from being decentralized and easily transferable. You can't send art or real estate at the click of a button with no intermediaries like you can with crypto.

&gt;cryptocurrency is just currency- it doesn't have growth/earnings potential.

It's actually classified by the US government as a commodity, but moreover there are lending platforms such as BlockFi that will pay a solid interest rate to keep your Bitcoin on their platform so that they can use it as part of lending pools. Whether or not you think that's worth it is up to you.

&gt;Unlike currency such as gold, cryptocurrency can't be converted into jewelry, statues, etc. Gold seems similar to cryptocurrency in that it has a fairly limited supply, whereas the dollar is ""pretend"". As far as I know, no country currently uses the gold standard. Today economies run on ""pretend"" money which seems to work pretty well.

All true but Bitcoin isn't trying to be converted into jewelry or used as a national currency (except maybe in countries with hyperinflation); that isn't the use case here.

&gt;I did some calculations to show that crypto is hundreds of times more variable compared to real currencies. Also, its value is steadily increasing compared to other currencies, which seems very concerning to me. Real world currencies, as far as I know, don't behave this way unless an economy is collapsing.

It's a commodity, not a currency. The demand for it (and therefore the price) swings wildly because it's so new and the market hasn't decided on its value.

In the dark future of 2038, the roughly .2 Bitcoin created in each block are worth $200m, with almost $30b in Bitcoin created each day.  Bitcoin mining alone takes half the US GDP, and consumes over 80% of the world's electricity.  A single transaction costs over $100,000.

The ~21m BTC in existence are worth a staggering $21,000,000,000,000,000 or 21 quadrillion dollars.  This outstrips the total value of all wealth in the world by a factor of 400.  None of it is ever spent, because a) transaction costs are too high and b) its value can only continue to increase.  All economic activity grinds to a halt as 99.75% of the world's wealth is locked in unproductive wallets.  Eventually the internet collapses, then civilization itself, leaving the Bitcoin billionaires dressed in animal skins chanting ""HODL HODL HODL"" around the dwindling firelight.",2021-09-03 09:55:10

 The price will likely not see any huge changes until the SEC case concludes which could be anywhere from 2 week through sometime in early 2022. If it is favorable for Ripple/XRP this could drive the price up significantly. It will be relisted on sites and I'd expect a fair amount of people to buy. If the outcome looks bad for Ripple the price might take a hit but I dont think it spells the end by any means. They could simply move their base of operation out of the US and carry on.

hbbsku1,abalcs81,74,"I should add - i'm very intrigued by the idea of using collateralized debt to fund living expenses.  To use round numbers - let's say you had $1M in bitcoin.  You could conservatively collateralize 5% of your stack ($50k) on a 50% LTV loan and use that $25k to pay your mortgage, bills,.etc.

The $25k is tax free and costs $200/mo in interest.  Then 1 year later you take out another 5% to pay off the first loan and capture the surplus in the market appreciation.  If the market was down YoY you can take out 10-15% collateral to pay off the original loan and work your leverage back down to 5% when the market pumps again.

If the person fundamentally believes that price will increase over the long run I don't see how this strategy fails unless the person allows the leverage get out of control and/or ignores any potential margin calls along the way.

hbke39j,anykeyh,241,"Solana is hyped by: 
- Overall branding &amp; marketing. Their blogs, their naming, their resources, and the few first applications are at a top-level execution.
- Big VCs are in the party
- Great tech, presented with even greater bullshit to make it look awesome (a sort of Tesla for Blockchain).

On another side, Harmony is much more tech-oriented and lacks a bit in terms of image. 
Let's put it like this: Harmony looks like a bunch of geeks doing cool stuff and not being evil. 
Solana's team looks like a bunch of seasoned businessmen creating the Tesla of the blockchain. I rather prefer 100% the first option, although I might feel alone sometimes. 

Just to be clear, Harmony has nothing to be shy of, in comparison to Solana in terms of technology. An example:

- Block propagation algorithms are exactly the same for both Harmony and Solana (p2p distribution with parity bits). Harmony call this ""Adaptative IDA"". Solana calls this the ""Turbine"". Unless you are an engineer, you will feel the latter more appealing than the first one.

In the long term, sharding is the key. Solana's ability to 50'000 tps (on paper) will never be enough for the world of tomorrow. People always compare blockchain TPS to Visa network, but they forget transferring value via blockchain is just like sending email over the internet. It's trendy today and occupies most of the network like it was in 1995 for the emails.

Also, Visa is not so much used. How many times do you use your card each day (2~3)? How many countries do not use Visa or by-card payment? (70% of the population).

Solana will never be able to compete in terms of transaction cost versus a sharded blockchain. 
This is just physically impossible, as nodes in Solana need to validate all transactions instead of a fraction of them.

Blockchain in the future will be the mesh of every interaction with our connected world. Mark my word: 50'000 TPS is nothing when most humans on earth will soon interact thousand of times a month with BC technologies.

In 15 years, our interactions with Blockchain technology will be in the hundred times a day, not 3 or 4 transactions. We are currently the 1%, and we see only Defi usage, fed by greed. 

In 5 years will see 20x more people, with 10x more usage, at least 1000x in usage growth.

Ownership, identity, governance, and service distribution apps will come soon, once governments catch up and proper regulatory frameworks are set up, market mature and successful Karen-proof apps are released.

My second grief to Solana is their tech doesn't allow individuals to Validate or participate in the network. Because the cost of setup is prohibitive.

If decentralized means hundreds of mid to large-size companies contribute to the network, so yeah it might be decentralized.

That's not my vision of decentralization. Because it doesn't protect for example from governments. Each validator based on Solana will need to be a company or an organization as the setup and annual fees are a few hundred thousand dollars minimum. They will need to comply with authority or will be taken down. 

What will happen if tomorrow Uncle Sam asks Solana validators to stop accepting interacting with Iranian-based IP or accounts? Will they comply? This cannot exist on Bitcoin for example, and there is little chance it will work with Harmony too.
Today even a non-American company need to comply with international sanction unless being blacklisted to make business with any US entity/individual. 

That's not my vision of what should be Blockchain tech. I see it as a tool and don't think any political means should interact with the network. It needs to be neutral, and yeah I don't care if the Taliban are using Harmony, it's a TOOL meant to be used by humans for the greater good or the worst bad.

In the short term, I don't see Harmony going to the moon like Solana. But I see it steadily growing and attract great world-class applications. Still, I feel huge profits will be taken if you invest in Harmony today.",2021-09-04 22:26:06

hbhhyp8,BTCDEX,59,"I recently lost some funds due to malware which had full control over my browser. It resulted in a Binance hack with 2FA on.

The malware had access to my google chrome browser. The gmail account was a separate one, but it was logged in at the moment. They placed an email filter for ""do-not-reply@directmail2.binance.com"" on it, so it looked like the mails never arrived (such as withdrawal confirmation code). On top of that they placed a binance login redirection from the legit site (I always check), so after login in with 2FA, the page seems to refresh and 2FA needs to be entered again: once to login and once to approve the transaction...all altcoins converted instantly to bitcoin, so they only needed one transaction confirmation. Whitelisting can help a little, but eventually it only takes them longer to get the funds as they need you to login a second time a few days later.

Luckily it was only a fraction of my crypto, because the majority is on cold storage on a hardware wallet. Had to reinstall my laptop completely to get rid of the malware, really nasty. Not sure how it got there...probably when downloading a desktop wallet app from some new project.

My advice:

1) Use a separate email address only to access crypto exchanges and only open it on a separate device. If you have malware on your pc, they can basically follow whatever you're doing in the browser and even put a filter on binance emails so you won't notice the withrawal confirmation code mails 
2) Activate 2FA with an authenticator app and NEVER enter the 2FA twice in a row during login. Hackers can refresh the legit login page after the first 2FA entry, and make it seem like you have to enter again, while actually you are confirming the withrawal...
3) Whitelist crypto addresses
4) Ideally access the exchange on a separate device  e.g. ipad

The government of El Salvador is in the middle of installing 200 Chivo 2-way Bitcoin ATMs that don't charge any fees.

The government is also going to have 50 financial branches where people can convert US dollars into bitcoin or bitcoin into US dollars and these financial branches are not going to charge any fees either.

General Bytes also manufactures Bitcoin ATMs that allow the ATM operator to enable Lightning Network support.

hbmc6mi,Muanh,108,"A lot of crypto projects are looking at classical techniques for scaling adding a secondary voting layer completely ignoring the breakthroughs that Satoshi introduced when he released Bitcoin. IOTA is the only one iterating on these breakthroughs by applying the same kind of virtual voting as Bitcoin (longest chain wins) to a chainless DAG structure. Because there isn’t just one chain, everyone can add transactions wherever they want in the structure, this also means we don’t need an election process like POW to determine the next leader allowed to append to the structure. Because there are no leaders, no election and thus no mining we don’t need fees. No blocks and no fees also means better latency and more throughput while also allowing other usecases like data only transactions. Data only transactions opens a lot of usecases, for instance project alvarium, a combined effort by the iota foundation Dell and others to create a data trust layer decentralizing data and giving people a way to look up how trustworthy that data is.",2021-09-05 07:21:49

hbnku7r,rdood2,54,"I'm going to respectfully but very strongly disagree with this opinion. I think you need to look into cryptocurrency token supplies and understand their resulting impacts on the price. A coin like QNT has a current supply of only 12 million and a maximum supply of 14 million. HBAR in comparison has a current supply of 9.6 billion but a maximum supply of 50 billion. 

Have you done high school economics? I want you to think of a supply/demand diagram, if you don't know what it is, you can search it up. Basically when supply is scarce, like QNT, the price naturally increases as it is harder to become an owner of a scarce resource. A real life example was when a Hurricane hit Queensland in Australia a few years ago, taking out all the Banana plantations. The price of Banana's skyrocketed here as they became scarce. 

Now funnily enough, QNT and HBAR's market caps are almost exactly the same at just under 3 billion. But a QNT is worth $242 and a HBAR is worth $0.3. Why is this? I want you to think back to the supply/demand diagram I referenced earlier. The law of scarcity is being applied here, which basically states that when the supply is scarce, a resulting disequilibrium occurs between the demand/supply curves. Upward pressures will be placed on the price until a new equilibrium is found where supply=demand. In the case of QNT, this is what we've seen in the past few months, the demand has been outstripping the supply and to find a new equilibrium, the price has had to increase. In comparison, HBAR's current supply is about 750 times the supply of QNT, so for HBAR's price to reach QNT's price, we need demand to multiply by 750.

Now if HBAR were to reach the $300 price as you've stated and the demand for it does multiply by 750, it would reach a market capitalisation of more than that of Apple. But we haven't considered that HBAR still needs to release another 40 billion or so coins. If HBAR were to reach bitcoin's market cap with a maximum supply, it would be worth $18.73 (which is still massive!) but I believe HBAR can be worth much more than bitcoin, let's pretend we go best case scenario and it does become the ""trust layer of the internet"" with the biggest market cap in the world. It's price at a 5 trillion market cap would be $100. This would take many years to occur, 10-20 years, possibly more through heavy adoption, to the point where almost all transaction, financial and smart contract processes are run through HBAR. 

All in all, I don't believe it's possible to ever reach a 15 trillion market cap at the price of $300 as there's simply not enough money and adaptation in the world for that to happen. Let's focus on reaching $1 first! :)",2021-09-05 14:06:54

&gt;because of the imminent grow up of next week.

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, nor next week.** Statistically, it's less than four years from now. Anyone who bought Bitcoin at any point in the past and held it for 4+ years is in profit. 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least first year**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to.

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for SATs. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://amber.app/calculate-your-investment/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference.


&gt;Where do you guys bought it?

Now, don't buy a fake Bitcoin at etoro, RH, PayPal or similar, get the real thing. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 


&gt;I have an exodus wallet.

That wallet is closed source, I wouldn't trust anything that isn't open source with my Bitcoin. I wouldn't even trust Bitcoin if it wasn't open source.

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets. 

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial (although, Lightning is custodial!)

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS, excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza

[https://muun.com/](https://muun.com/) \- Muun, simple and elegant LN wallet - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different than the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words &amp;amp;amp; passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words &amp;amp;amp; passphrase(s) safe.

&gt;Vote the best comment so I understand that will be the best place to buy and hodl
Fee s are high af

Anyone has different preferences, you have to try a few places to see what works best for you.

Crypto has several problems: 

1. It's already dominated by the super rich, who had disposable income to toss a Bitcoin eight years ago. If I had extra millions laying around, I would have thrown some at Bitcoin. Why not. Bitcoin's wealth distribution is worse than North Korea. We can stop pretending like crypto is going to save poor people. It is a rich person's game.
2. Tether. We all know.
3. NFTs are total bullshit. People paying for text files saved to the blockchain. Absurd.
4. Why does crypto need to be publicly traded? For example, if a bank wanted to move wealth easily between two different institutions, it would almost make more sense to use XRP as a technology (stablecoin) to transfer and receive the wealth on the other end. Or some other tech. 
5. Blockchain technology is not as innovative as the internet. It's a minor change to the ledger system that eliminates the central validator--which mostly helps people commit crimes. Valid use cases here are not abundant.

Darker questions:

1. Where would all of this wealth be going if it were not going into crypto, which is basically gambling on internet currencies? The stock market. The stock market is worth $50 trillion. If crypto goes 10x again soon, no one will be investing in real businesses. It's super messy.
2. At what point does crypto destabilize the dollar? There are crazy, real-world issues with this happening. Namely, if the dollar loses all its value because crypto takes over, many people will get left behind. And then being your bank will become extremely dangerous. 
3. The threat of crypto crime is very real. Instead of banks being targets, people will be targets. If someone really wanted your crypto, they could almost certainly get it.",2021-09-06 16:09:31

hbrlwql,durlsty,96,"I think it’s important to realise that this internal comparison and feelings of inferiority is not coming from the basis of reality. Objectively, we should all feel shitty about ourselves because Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and none of us will ever come close. So why is that we feel so shitty when we compare to our peers instead of the objectively rich? 

Because we rationalise it, we think since our peers are “quite” similar to us, then we could have done what they did. “If only I bought Bitcoin like him last year”, “If only I graduated with a GPA 4.6”, these are all false reasons. We all know people’s road to success is much more than a single decision. Some of your friends made a lot of sacrifices to reach where they are, and you only get to see a small part of their life story. 

So knowing that, how do you feel less shitty? I think a good step is to find out what metrics are important to you? Is it power, money, popularity? And find out why you hold these metrics so highly. Why do you want to be a leader? Why do you want to be rich? And afterwards, ask yourself, what are you willing to give up for it and make a plan. Heck, maybe turn that envy into productivity and ask your friends out for coffee so that you can learn from them. 

But I think there’s something deeper than trying to emulate what your friends do and that is the feeling of envy and comparison. If you want to get rid of the feeling of inferiority, you will also have to get rid of the feeling of superiority you have over others. The act of comparing is harmful and even if you feel better by thinking “At least I’m not like THAT person”, you are still engaging in it. Catch those moments when you are comparing yourself with people and remind yourself that all of us are writing our own stories. 

There’s no objective metric of success out there, it’s up to you to find your own definition of success/purpose and plan how to get there.

TLDR: You can make a plan and learn from your friends OR find your purpose and stick to it.",2021-09-06 12:19:03

Que se usen para actos ilícitos no significa que hayan sido concebidas de esa forma o para eso.
3) el tema de la energía. Para minar Bitcoin, que es básicamente procesar todas las operaciones, se usa mucha energía es cierto.

Since El Salvador has been using the US dollar as it's own national currency is basically next to being useless after *de-facto* abandoning it in the early 2000s. 

It shouldn't surprise you that El Salvador, being a Banana Republic itself continues to be a huge AmeriKKKa shill. So the President of El Salvador who is definately not a 21st-century CIA plant decided in order to shift the nation's economic troubles and chronic crime problem by declaring it's country to be the first one to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender (for no appealing reason), alongside with the existing US dollar. Essentially the entire country will be subserviant to Crypto whales if they ever want to leverage their Scooge McDuck size BTC wallets and completely make El Salvador into their bitch.

People aren’t being paid in Bitcoin and most citizens aren’t holding their wealth in Bitcoin either. Because of this, the fluctuation in Bitcoins price doesn’t affect anyone. Bitcoin is simply the “rails” that the country is using to make payments and send remittances.

hc5kbo7,OhHiGCHQ,132,"Honestly? Right wing Libertarians.

I say that because *left wing* libertarians (believe it or not but the word ""libertarian"" refered to left wing ideologies until the 70s) are usually chill people and include the likes of Social Ecologists, communitarians, Anarchists, Bookchinites and the like, basically people who hate the state but also hate capitalism and believe the way to go is decentralised, community based, and confederated. They support things like mutual aid, community assemblies, worker/community ownership and such like.

Right wing libertarians on the other hand make the Ferengi look altruistic and like to openly advocate for child labour, company towns and corporatocracy. They'll talk about freedom and liberty but then right after that adovcate for a system where the rich control everything and your life boils down to ""Obey the rich and be paid a small sliver of what you actually produce or starve"", which to me doesn't sound much like liberty and more like Victorian England. It sounds like a world where the poor work for low wages and no real prospect of advancement unless they get *really* fucking lucky while a small class of owners who own everything from the land to the thoughts in people's heads live off the work of others.

Oh and when push comes to shove the Right wing libertarians when faced with issues like the state using violence against protesters always seemingly side with Right wing Authoritarians (the Traditional right, conservatives, the ""Alt-right""). They're totally okay with the Police using Agent Provocateurs to spark off riots and use equipment banned on the battlefield to attack unarmed protesters, but ***god fucking forbid*** those same police tell them they can't use 10 year olds to built bitcoin miners because that's on their *private property!* When the state uses their tax money to help people they get up in arms and start babbling on about leeches but are oddly silent when those same taxes get poured into police that they use to bust unions and take away the few possessions Homeless people have. They're totally okay with that to protect their property, just not everyone elses. Oh and they seem okay with their taxes going directly to their companies in the form of contracts where they can pocket half of it and use the other half to make shitty products for a quater of the actual cost.

William Rees-Mogg, a man who literally co-authored a book about how to crash and economy to make money from it. Ayn Rand, a woman so against Altruism that she developed her own cult around it where even Romance was frowned upon.

\&gt;all of a sudden a car that looks from the 60s and very damaged parks on the other side of the street

\&gt;The door opens, the sheers smell coming out is enough to kill everyone in there

\&gt;some guy inside the car struggles to get out.

\&gt;he's probably 450 pounds, wearing a fedora and holding an anime body pillow of some clearly underage character

\&gt;I'm really annoyed by his sheer existance, but I have manners

\&gt;explains that he's that chick's husband, she married him because of money

\&gt;""yea he invested his parents house into bitcoin before it was popular and now he has a lot of money""

\&gt;we chat for a bit more, the guy behind me is called Chad, very nice guy

\&gt;we chat for a bit more

\&gt;at this point I'd prefer to be TOPPED by Chad than to fuck this chick

\&gt;all of a sudden I hear someone shout loud and clear

\&gt;it's the morbidly obesy cuck, he tripped

\&gt;he's rolling like a ball, 20 mph directly at us

\&gt;I know I'll get crushed, this is not the way I wanted to go

\&gt;all of a sudden Chad pulls me and saves my life

\&gt;thanks chad

\&gt;morbidly obese cuck reaches the door and gets stuck

\&gt;10 men are pushing him

\&gt;he finally entered the house, mother fucker can't stop giggling

\&gt;he sits down and opens a trashy laptop

\&gt;its screen is probably filled with crusty cum and dorito powder

\&gt;at this point both me and Chad are really annoyed

\&gt;""Hey Chad would you like to get some beer, I swear this mordibly obese cuck is going to ruin my fun with the chick""

\&gt;Chad agrees

\&gt;we get to the bar, staff already knows Chad

\&gt;Chad introduces me

\&gt;we get free beer and nachos

Investing, according to the greater fool theory, means ignoring valuations, earnings reports, and all the other data. Ignoring the fundamentals is, of course, risky; and so people subscribing to the greater fool theory could be left holding the bag after a correction.

Everybody is being deceived here, there is no pretense of “fundamentals.” Everybody knows the money is coming from other foolish people. People are buying into the hype of Bitcoin and buying it because they think other people will buy it at a higher price if it gains further adoption.

The person controlling this address is very likely the  Binance client  with the deposit address 1JHNETTaxquUWBn4ke8DaYWqzSJKmiPYuP. So go to law enforcement and ask them to freeze the scammers funds at Binance. The scammer seems to be very active at Binance so it's likely there is something to freeze. Alternatively the police can ask Binance for the id, bank data or withdrawal addresses of this person. If the police in your country is too slowly then try it with a lawyer.   


Report:   
If cases like this are handed over from one person to the next inside law enforcement or exchanges it's helpful to have a report with the evidence. You can do this on your own if you or your friends have a quite good understanding of bitcoin transactions. We programmed more or less these attacks:

hckhad1,MinimalGravitas,118,"Decentralization is pretty much the point of crypto for a lot of people. 

The one complaint about Ethereum is the high fees, which come down to something called the blockchain trilemma, you have to balance decentralization, security and scalability. It comes about basically because there's a limit to how much data each block can hold, validators/miners/nodes must process blocks in a secure way to avoid rollbacks etc, but the bigger your blocks the more powerful hardware is needed and so the less people will run nodes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have both prioritized decentralization and security on their layer 1s, I've run a bitcoin full-node before on an old PC and basically the low requirements mean it can just be done as a hobby project, which lots of people do. Both chains' nodes can even be run on a Raspberry Pi.

The compromise is that the space for transactions that can be processed per unit time is relatively low. For Bitcoin this doesn't hugely matter because the only transactions being done are simple transfers of BTC. For Ethereum this is much more of an issue because there are lots of much more complex transactions (such as token swaps and interacting with liquidity pools for dApps) that need to write more data to the chain and therefore take up more space.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are solving this through the use of layer 2 solutions, Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Rollups for Ethereum. Almost all other chains that offer lower fees do so by sacrificing decentralization for scalability. They then either make some vague hand waiving platitude about decentralizing more in the future (e.g Solana) or just market themselves at a captive audience of newbies who don't yet understand why decentralization matters (e.g. Binance 'Seriously-only-11-block-producing-validators' Chain).

With regards specifically to Solana you can read about their validators here https://solanaguide.github.io/staking/how-much-do-solana-validators-make/ - this makes the point that on top of the hardware requirements a validator needs to own 5000 SOL staked to its own network to break even. People often point out that the staking requirements of 32 ETH are high, but for Solana is the token cost is roughly 10x higher.

I'm in crypto because I want the future economic system to look different to the current one. I want the financial dominance of huge banks and corporations to be a topic of history. I want anyone in the world to have access to the same financial tools and advantages as the richest segment of society. I want a transparent monetary system where if you try to hide your income from the taxman in an offshore shell company, anyone can just lookup the transaction ID in a block explorer. I want a world where we don't need to seek permission to deploy a good idea, where we don't need to trust some 3rd party who sits between us and our assets.

I want a decentralized economy. There's a long way to go before we get there, and there's plenty of hurdles on the road ahead, but I believe there's at least a possibility of bringing it about. If that means paying more for transactions at the moment rather than switching to cheaper options that comprises the core values I believe in then I don't mind at all. If it's a choice between short term profits or the chance for complete systemic change it seems to me there's not really a choice at all!",2021-09-12 23:51:54

A man may end up behind bars for 15 years after he was allegedly caught mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies inside the county center in Riverhead, New York.

The Associated Press reports that Christopher Naples, an IT operations supervisor at the county clerk’s office, is facing charges for public corruption, grand larceny, and computer trespass for secretly installing 46 crypto miners inside the government building.

The 42-year-old, an employee of the county for over two decades, allegedly placed the devices in six rooms, hiding them in locations like unused electrical wall panels and underneath floorboards. Authorities say that some of the machines had been in place since February. 

Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy Sini says that Naples’ scheme cost the public coffers at least $6,000 in electricity bills.

“Mining cryptocurrency requires an enormous amount of resources, and miners have to navigate how to cover all of those electricity and cooling costs. [Naples] found a way to do it; unfortunately, it was on the backs of taxpayers.”

Sini also says that Naples had placed so many miners inside the building that several employees were complaining about the slow internet speed, and when miners were removed from one room, the temperature dropped by more than 20 degrees.

“Not only do we have thousands of dollars of taxpayer money funding this operation, but it also put the county’s infrastructure at risk.”",2021-09-12 22:15:44

Right now if I buy Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin appreciates, and I use some of that Bitcoin to buy myself a new laptop, I have to report that as capital gains.  Specifically, I have to calculate out what the appreciation was on the particular coin value I used to buy the laptop, and pay tax on that.  
If you buy Bitcoin frequently, and want to use it to pay for things, this is totally unworkable.  It adds a GIGANTIC tax burden of calculating out a 'capital gain' every single time you either sell Bitcoin, or trade Bitcoin for any other crypto, or use Bitcoin to buy things.  

Now, if you see Bitcoin only as a tradeable asset- that is, no need to make purchases with it, it's only good for trading and not using, then yes taxing Bitcoin makes sense because it's 'playing with the big boys' like other assets.  

But if you want Bitcoin and other crypto to be used as a transactional currency, to be used in commerce or trade, then taxing Bitcoin as an asset basically inhibits use of crypto in commerce or trade.

Satoshi made bitcoin after the events of the 2008 housing crash.

hctn6uw,SenatusSPQR,162,"Welcome to the Nano subreddit!

First off, nice to hear that the green aspect interests you. I personally find that rather important as well, and am glad to hear it attracts people. As to the points you made:

&gt; But I also see a lot of cognitive dissonance. Like claiming nano has more TPS than the big yellow coin. It's not true since layer 2 has basically unlimited TPS at maximum speed of validation (speed of light anyway).

You won't find many Lightning supporters here. There are many reasons for that, differing between people. My personal take on it is that it has quite some issues. In terms of security, there's the [Flood &amp; Loot risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08513). In terms of scalability, there are just 7 TPS or so available on the base layer to open, upgrade, change or close channels. Even if there are ways to open more channels with the 7 TPS, it's hard to see this scaling to hundreds of millions of users.

Then there are the routing issues that it runs into if it ever gets big enough. The other option is that it becomes more of a hub-and-spoke system, which would solve many of the routing issues but leads to centralization and a lot of power with just a few hubs.

I personally have some more gripes with it, but let me not go into it too deeply, haha.

All that being said - I believe we could have a L2 solution built on Nano as well. 

&gt; Another thing making me uncomfortable is the ""limited supply"" which will never have ""new coins"" anymore. Is it possible to have any kind of privacy with such a system ? How ?

Correct, it's fixed supply. Why does that worry you? Privacy is roughly the same as in Bitcoin, it's pseudo-anonymous.

&gt; On the other hand, the ""fee-less"" part is really very very interesting. I still don't understand how it can work, but I'm digging. I will understand (do you have tips ?)

I'd humbly suggest my own article called [the Basics of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an). A lot of the more fundamental questions, like why Nano is feeless, are answered there. 

Let me know whether that helps! And if you have any further questions I'd love to help.",2021-09-14 23:23:24

hcp6wac,retire-early,85,"Folks, if you're worried just sit back, take a few deep breaths.  Now, ask yourself:

* Is the economy in a good place and getting better?
* Does the ""new highs every day"" stock market reflect the economic reality on the ground?
* Are housing prices, now at all time highs, likely to continue up?  Prices are correlated to interest rates - if rates go up, houses become less affordable.  Do you see negative interest rates being accepted by investors forever?
* Is inflation transitory?

If not, then you need an alternative to the market.  Something that's at least uncorrelated, and even better something that's likely to go up when the market and economy go south.  With the Everything Bubbles getting bigger, as I see it you have three options:

1. Precious Metals.  These retain purchasing power when economic times are rough, though I'd expect a big drop in short-term valuations if we reach the point where margin calls are everywhere.  Then the rocket's first stage ignites.
2. Real Estate.  Yes, it's overpriced, but it  outputs (rent, or produce, or wood) are all the sorts of things that keep up with inflation and generate cash flow, and if you can lock in a 2% rate it's almost free to pay off if real rates finally jump back to something unimaginable, like the historic average of 7%.
3. Crypto.  I'm not a believer here, but I've been wrong on this for 100,000% so far.  I wish I'd put just 2% of my portfolio into bitcoin, but I can't go back and re-do that.

You've bought silver.  You're fine.  Relax.  Keynes, after he greatly outperformed the market then went bust, but before he invented the whole Keynesian Economics thing, said in his defense that ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""

I also believe the slow pace of releases shows that a careful auditing process is being made by the developer community. Lastly the bitcoin nodes can update to a new release, but they are not forced, so it will happen gradually making it less risky for a bug -or a malitious hack- of this kind to happen and damage the network.

Understanding this is a strong open source community (I can only think of Linux as a comparable community in terms of ww impact and success) should give a reasonable peace of mind in regards to being exposed to hacks or the likes.

It seemed like a clever scheme back when institutions could buy in at cost and then sell at a premium to retail investors after a lock up period. And there is also a lending market for those shares. So it made sense to them to buy these shares at the time rather than just hold onto the physical Bitcoin

That premium got erased though and eventually became negative and is still negative.

hcsgsv8,MinimalGravitas,67,"Decentralization is pretty much the point of crypto for a lot of people. This is why BTC and ETH sit where they do in marketcap rankings.

The one complaint about Ethereum is the high fees, which come down to something called the blockchain trilemma, you have to balance decentralization, security and scalability. It comes about basically because there's a limit to how much data each block can hold, validators/miners/nodes must process blocks in a secure way to avoid rollbacks etc, but the bigger your blocks the more powerful hardware is needed and so the less people will run nodes.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have both prioritized decentralization and security on their layer 1s, I've run a bitcoin full-node before on an old PC and basically the low requirements mean it can just be done as a hobby project, which lots of people do. Both chains' nodes can even be run on a Raspberry Pi.

The compromise is that the space for transactions that can be processed per unit time is relatively low. For Bitcoin this doesn't hugely matter because the only transactions being done are simple transfers of BTC. For Ethereum this is much more of an issue because there are lots of much more complex transactions (such as token swaps and interacting with liquidity pools for dApps) that need to write more data to the chain and therefore take up more space.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are solving this through the use of layer 2 solutions, Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Rollups for Ethereum. Almost all other chains that offer lower fees do so by sacrificing decentralization for scalability. They then either make some vague hand waiving platitude about decentralizing more in the future (e.g Solana) or just market themselves at a captive audience of newbies who don't yet understand why decentralization matters (e.g. Binance 'Seriously-only-11-block-producing-validators' Chain).

I'm in crypto because I want the future economic system to look different to the current one. I want the financial dominance of huge banks and corporations to be a topic of history. I want anyone in the world to have access to the same financial tools and advantages as the richest segment of society. I want a transparent monetary system where if you try to hide your income from the taxman in an offshore shell company, anyone can just lookup the transaction ID in a block explorer. I want a world where we don't need to seek permission to deploy a good idea, where we don't need to trust some 3rd party who sits between us and our assets.

I want a decentralized economy. There's a long way to go before we get there, and there's plenty of hurdles on the road ahead, but I believe there's at least a possibility of bringing it about. If that means paying more for transactions at the moment rather than switching to cheaper options that comprises the core values I believe in then I don't mind at all. If it's a choice between short term profits or the chance for complete systemic change it seems to me there's not really a choice at all!",2021-09-14 15:15:36

hcpup2c,Few-Nothing-4607,64,"Can confirm. I am involved in real estate on the side in greater Portland and it's a big issue, at least that's what I hear from the networks I've joined. It's not just non-resident second homes; but non-resident second homes for non-US residents. That isn't meant to be a xenophobic dog whistle or anything, merely noting that everything else equal a foreign second home purchaser is apt to spend even less time in the unit than a domestic resident. In fact, there's a lot of speculation that many of these purchasers are really just purchasing the property as a store of value, almost like bitcoin. Of course that's really difficult to prove.

The biggest problem in my opinion isn't just the reduction in useable housing, but the long term economic impact. Portland proper grew by just 3% in **ten years.** Less than half of what Biddeford, Saco, and Brunswick grew by, and roughly a seventh of what Westbrook grew by. People can't move to Portland if there's nowhere to live, and businesses can't open in Portland if there's nobody to hire.

Another issue is with the Short Term Rental market. From the perspective of a landlord, STRs are so popular because they're arguably more profitable than long-term housing, significantly less work (since it's a seasonal market), and with the whole eviction moratorium, much less risk.

The whole thing is a mess. The problem is that realtors are making out like bandits, and aren't exactly inclined to look more thoroughly into the buyers, and people selling their homes don't usually care -- or even know -- how the home they're selling is going to be used.

A lot of ideas have been tossed around to address the issue. The problem with just blanket taxing the owners of second homes is that -- at least historically -- a huge portion of these folks have been average-joe retirees who have two modest homes, one in Florida, one in Maine. These folks really aren't the ones to point the finger at in my opinion, as they're using their second homes for good faith reasons that are often related to health and comfort for the elderly (Maine is not senior-friendly in wintertime).",2021-09-14 02:58:49

hd49rfp,Delam2,296,"The full article:

“The sceptics have plenty of fodder. The earliest adopters of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, used it to buy drugs, while cyber-hackers now demand their ransom in it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of ether, another digital money, were stolen this year after hackers found a bug in some code. Many “believers” are in reality trying to get rich quick from the global mania that has seen the value of cryptoassets reach $2.2trn. Others are freakishly devoted. The entrepreneur who announced in June that El Salvador was adopting bitcoin as an official currency sobbed on stage, claiming it would save the nation.

The crooks, fools and proselytisers are off-putting. Nevertheless, the rise of an ecosystem of financial services, known as decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, deserves sober consideration. It has the potential to rewire how the financial system works, with all the promise and perils that entails. The proliferation of innovation in DeFi is akin to the frenzy of invention in the early phase of the web. At a time when people live ever more of their lives online, the crypto-revolution could even remake the architecture of the digital economy.

DeFi is one of three tech trends disrupting finance. Tech “platform” firms are muscling in on payments and banks. Governments are launching digital currencies, or govcoins. DeFi offers an alternative path which aims to spread power, not concentrate it. To understand how, start with blockchains, vast networks of computers that keep an open, incorruptible common record and update it without the need for a central authority.

Bitcoin, the first big blockchain, created in 2009, is now a distraction. Instead, Ethereum, a blockchain network created in 2015, upon which most DeFi applications are built, is reaching critical mass. Its developers view finance as a juicy target. Conventional banking requires a huge infrastructure to maintain trust between strangers, from clearing houses and compliance to capital rules and courts. It is expensive and often captured by insiders: think of credit-card fees and bankers’ yachts. By contrast, transactions on a blockchain are trustworthy, cheap, transparent and quick—at least in theory.

Although the terminology is intimidating (fees are “gas”; the main currency is ether, and title deeds over digital assets are known as nfts), the basic activities taking place on DeFi are familiar. These include trading on exchanges and issuing loans and taking deposits through self-executing agreements called smart contracts. One yardstick of activity is the value of digital instruments being used as collateral: from almost nothing in early 2018 it has reached $90bn. Another is the value of transactions that Ethereum is verifying. In the second quarter this reached $2.5trn, around the same sum as Visa processes and equivalent to a sixth of the activity on Nasdaq, a stock exchange.

The dream of a low-friction financial system is just the beginning. DeFi is spreading to more ambitious terrain. MetaMask, a DeFi wallet with more than 10m users acts as a digital identity. To enter a decentralised “metaverse”, a looking-glass world with shops run by its users, you link your wallet to a cartoonish avatar who roams around. These digital worlds will become the subject of intensifying competition as more spending shifts online. Big tech firms could impose huge taxes on these mini-economies: imagine Apple’s App Store charging fees, or Facebook selling your avatar’s intimate secrets. A better alternative might be decentralised networks that host applications and are run mutually by users. DeFi could provide payments and property rights.

Crypto-enthusiasts see a Utopia. But there is a long way to go before DeFi is as reliable as, say, JPMorgan Chase or PayPal. Some problems are prosaic. A common criticism is that blockchain platforms do not scale easily and that the computers they harness consume wasteful amounts of electricity. But Ethereum is a self-improvement machine. When it is in high demand the fees it charges for verification can climb, encouraging developers to work on minimising the intensity with which they use it. There will be new versions of Ethereum; other, better blockchains could one day replace it.

Yet DeFi also raises questions about how a virtual economy with its own norms interacts with the real world. One worry is the lack of an external anchor of value. Cryptocurrencies are no different from the dollar, in that they rely on people having a shared expectation of their utility. However, conventional money is also backed by states with a monopoly on force and central banks that are lenders of last resort. Without these, DeFi will be vulnerable to panics. Contract enforcement outside the virtual world is also a concern. A blockchain contract may say you own a house but only the police can enforce an eviction.

Governance and accountability in DeFi-land are rudimentary. A sequence of large irrevocable transactions that humans cannot override could be dangerous, especially as coding errors are inevitable. Money-laundering has thrived in the ungoverned grey zone of services lying between Ethereum and the banking system. Despite the claims of decentralisation, some programmers and app owners hold disproportionate sway over the DeFi system. And a malign actor could even gain control over a majority of the computers that run a blockchain.

Digital libertarians would prefer that DeFi remain autonomous—imperfect but pure. Yet to succeed it must integrate with the conventional financial and legal systems, as Gary Gensler, a crypto-expert who is America’s financial watchdog, has outlined. Many DeFi applications are run by decentralised organisations which vote on some issues; these bodies should become subject to laws and regulations. The Bank for International Settlements, a club for central banks, has suggested that govcoins might be used in DeFi apps, providing stability.

Finance is entering a new era in which the three novel but flawed visions of tech platforms, big government and DeFi will compete and intermingle. Each embodies a technical architecture and an ideology about how the economy should be run. As with the internet in the 1990s, no one knows where the revolution will end. But it stands to transform how money works and, as it does so, the entire digital world.”",2021-09-17 04:40:49

hd7f5be,rainbowgeoff,62,"https://www.techradar.com/news/how-cryptomining-is-making-it-harder-to-find-the-graphics-cards-you-want

I was referring to crypto in general. The miners are causing a scarcity in the market which is driving prices up. According to this article though, bitcoin can be mined this way and many are doing so. 

&gt; The problem with that little factory we've built is that CPUs aren't designed to be workers in a factory, they're designed to be managers. Setting up the kind of multiprocessor system using CPUs like an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X to create a digital assembly line is very cost prohibitive.

&gt; A GPU, on the other hand, is precisely designed to be that kind of worker. In its essential architecture and operation, the GPU in an Nvidia RTX 3090 performs the exact same kind work as a computer's CPU. What's more, multiple GPUs can be run on a single machine to multiply its computing power, cutting into those duovigintillion (nice) or so seconds required to find the right ""guess.""

&gt; This is how you end up with the kind of mining rigs you see online where someone has a single tower case – usually open-sided – with adapter cables stringing together several or even dozens of graphics cards together in the backroom of some office somewhere.

&gt; You don't even need a desktop PC anymore to run everything. With the recent release of mobile RTX 3000-series laptops, even notebook computers are being incorporated into cryptomining operations in China.",2021-09-17 22:37:59

hdbso15,khanzarate,1400,"In short, mining involves 2 steps. Some necessary bookkeeping, which is what we really want it to do, and a ""proof of work"".

The bookkeeping creates a block of data, which is linked to the block before that, which is linked to the one before that, so on, so forth. Multiple people might try to add a new block, and odds are, they're trying to commit slightly different new blocks, and, briefly, that means there are multiple block chains. 

Bitcoin is decentralized, that's the point, so if there's no central authority to ask, how do you determine whose block is gonna get to be the next new one? Proof of work. Whichever block chain was the hardest to make is the real one. This is why it's so hard to counterfeit, because every future block adds to the work done and a would-be counterfeiter needs an impossible amount of computing power, easily offsetting fraud profits with electricity cost.

This work is the energy waster, though. This work is how we prevent fraud.

No, using it to heat water won't break anything. Actually, nothing stops a company from doing exactly that, but that's recycling already-wasted heat. The question is, ""can this proof of work be itself put to work?""

Repurposing some algorithm that does something that is already worth money, though, opens Bitcoin up to fraud, because it's no longer a loss for people to try. Worst case scenario, you make money doing... Whatever it's doing.",2021-09-18 22:04:51

hd9jxae,writing_genre,1179,"Warren Buffett sat on the stage.

Today was a bittersweet day. It always was.

His back was killing him and some asshole was five minutes over time; talking about what a brilliant businessman he was. He didn't feel brilliant right then.

He felt like a fucking pig waiting to be slaughtered.

His mind ran through the last eight years. The shortest period for anyone to ever do the run from zero to ""winner"" of capitalism (well, if you didn't count that bitcoin jackass nobody could seem to track down). They were good years. He hoped his successor at Berk-5 would be able to keep it running this time. He thought he'd found a good man with Ajit, but after Sokol had wiped out Berk-3 in the Lubrizol affair...his faith in his ability to find honest men had been permanently eroded.

The speaker finished up, and another replaced him at the lectern. His first wife.

At least she was always kind.

He'd finally sold the house where he'd lived with his third wife for five years. They had divorced a couple years back.  It was rational, even though it hurt at the time.

No sense in taking them both out just because he would win. Again.

He'd rent this time. A house was a temporary possession anyway, and it was a drag on building any *real* wealth. He'd have to get a loan to furnish the place, but hell, if a five time winner of capitalism couldn't get a personal on a promise who could?

Though...last time B of A rejected him.  He put everything he had on the line, bailing them out during the housing collapse. A year before they rejected him he had *owned* half the company. Now it was run by some asshole who's main talent was being nephew to a boardmember of the charitable foundation run #4 had gone to.  His bailout of B of A was cited as the reason they couldn't bail him out.  He found it funny now, he'd tell the story at a burn-party if he could ever get himself to go to one again.

Everyone was looking at him.

Goddammit it was his turn to speak.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the speech he wandered down the busy streets of DC, wearing the towel he'd been given (his first new possession!) like some Greek philosopher in a toga. He'd be able to go pick up his five winner's badges tomorrow. He always got to keep those, they weren't worth anything.

He briefly considered going to one of the parties being held around DC. After all, they were supposedly in his honor. The real reason of course was to burn through enough cash so that none of the hosts would have the ""honor"" next year.

Enough wine and food would be wasted tonight to make the Romans blush.

He'd had more enthusiasm for it in his forties. Then he watched someone jump out of Van Gogh's Starry Night as an entrance gag and it soured him on the whole premise.

The man had called it performance art when Buffett confronted him. Warren was never a spendthrift, but that night he became so tight-fisted that he...

...well, that he'd become ""winner of capitalism"" five times.

He found a promising looking alleyway next to the offices of the Washington Post. In the morning he'd try to get a job as a paperboy. Hell, maybe he'd just stay one this time. 

He bedded down, anticipation for tomorrow was going to make it hard to sleep. There was something stoic about sleeping on the ground one night every decade or so. Starting over was hard, but it was honest.

The revelry on the streets was quieter here. They'd perfected bread and circuses in a way the romans couldn't hope to match.

Out of the corner of his eye Warren caught a flash. A man with a switchblade walked towards him, ""Your money or your life!""

Warren raised his head to look at him, ""I'm afraid your a few hours too late, friend.""

""This isn't a joke old man. Give me everything!""

But there is a problem, who is checking the miner's work? A nefarious miner could lie about a Bitcoin transaction and say everyone gave them all the Bitcoin.

The current solution is proof of work. This is where the waste comes in. A miner's computer must perform some operation that is inherently wasteful to deter any such behaviour from a single entity. Groups of miner's usually work together to verify a block (group of records) on the Blockchain. Every miner on the entire Blockchain network must come to a majority consensus (&gt;50%) on whether a new block is valid. This means a nefarious actor would need majority of the Bitcoin mining capacity to manipulate the Blockchain.

hdcltt0,A117Z,101,"Constructing a Bitcoin transaction, and getting the network to accept it, costs virtually no energy whatsoever. What costs energy is grinding through the nuanced space to find valid blocks. Miners do this because they are compensated primarily with the coinbase reward of 6.25 BTC per block, which is defined in the protocol.  
  
As defined in the protocol, the per-block reward is cut in half every four years. This reduces bitcoin’s issuance rate and thus the miner revenue. So, in the long term, miner revenue from issuance will dramatically contract. As 88% of all coins have been mined already, mining is structurally shrinking, not a growing industry.  
  
Thus most of the miner expenditure – and hence carbon outlay – from Bitcoin is due to largely invariant coin issuance rather than any variable that’s correlated to transactional intensity. This fact invalidates the “energy cost of transactions” metric that critics like to promote. It is issuance that largely finances miners, not transactions. And because most coins have been issued already, Bitcoin’s future carbon outlay is likely to shrink.  
  
Therefore, comparisons to other payments systems such as visa systems should be met with extreme skepticism. Bitcoin is a full-stack monetary system with no outside dependencies; Visa is a small part of the U.S. dollar stack that relies, among other things, on 11 aircraft carriers patrolling the world’s oceans and enforcing dollar hegemony. Visa payments rely on a vast interconnected infrastructure of clearing and settlement. Bitcoin transactions are natively final and settle right away – they are more comparable to wire transfers. The energy exchange rate comparisons must take these differences into account.

hdhrt8f,MSRsnowshoes,183,"&gt; Most systems in cars are safety-critical and need to perform in practically every situation regardless of temperature, humidity, vibrations, and even minor road debris. With so much at stake, tried and true is better than new and improved. 

That's the other side of the Moore's Law coin. Validating new chips is expensive. While newer chips might be smaller and more power-efficient, testing and certification takes time and money. 

There's a reason mission-critical chips in military, aeronautics (including devices launched into space), and other applications run on old chip designs; (hell, Perseverence [uses a twenty-year-old](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750) chip) they're rated for hard use.

It's the ol' ""price, performance, reliability; pick two"" rule. 

I get jazzed about new tech too, but after having been in a couple of car accidents caused by others, I'd rather the chip(s) running the safety gear of my car not take a proverbial dump if it's too cold or simple road vibration damages them over time. 

I've noticed that the tech industry can display a surprising amount of hubris. I see it in app phones when people complain that battery life doesnt improve with more efficient chips or people complain about the increasing size. I see it in every laptop with glued components that has a poor repairability rating. Tesla, Uber, and others are behind their self-driving car goals. Bitcoin is exciting, but [electrically inefficient](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952). I wonder if this buy-our-newer-chips messaging is another example (it may not be, especially if newer chips can perform better and meet operational standards). Cars are already being treated like disposable appliances, to the detriment of buyer's bank accounts and the environment (when it comes to disposal), it'd be a shame to see them slide further down that path via chip failures.

To be fair, if chips of newer, smaller design can meet or exceed the standards of the previous chips at same or lower price points, I'm all for it.",2021-09-20 03:28:34

I believe you are misunderstanding the purpose of the bitcoin law and bitcoin's two biggest use cases in El Salvador. The 2 biggest use cases for bitcoin in El Salvador is remittances and being able to use bitcoin apps as a bank account. Around 70% of the citizens of El Salvador don't have a bank account and only around 7% of them have a credit card.

The purpose of the bitcoin law is not for the poor citizens of El Salvador to gamble their money investing in bitcoin. The purpose of the bitcoin law is to allow the citizens of El Salvador to transfer value between bitcoin and US dollars and spend bitcoin without keeping track of their cost basis and without paying any capital gains tax. The government of El Salvador is also trying to encourage tourists to come spend bitcoin in El Salvador and the government is also attempting to entice wealthy bitcoin investors to come move to El Salvador and spend bitcoin. The government of El Salvador is even offering permanent residency to anyone who spends 3 BTC on goods and services in El Salvador.

El Salvador has a very poor economy and remittances account for 23% of their gross domestic product. A very large number of the Citizens of El Salvador rely on money that is sent to them from their family members that are living in other countries. In fact, over $6 billion dollars was remitted to El Salvador last year. If their family members in other countries used bitcoin instead of scammy money transmitting services, then that would save them a lot of money.

Now the unbanked citizens of El Salvador have the option to use mobile apps like Chivo or Strike as a bank account. Their family members living in other countries can also instantly send them money for free by using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, and using bitcoin wallets, exchanges, or just mobile payment apps like Strike and Chivo. Now they can use Strike like demonstrated in this 1 minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt2C3CsLi7k 

Your government wants the citizens of El Salvador to be able to use Bitcoin as the value transfer protocol that it is. Salvadorans no longer have to pay any taxes on bitcoin gains. So now they can seamlessly transfer value between bitcoin and US dollars and spend bitcoin without keeping track of their cost basis and without paying any capital gains tax. Salvadorans will be able to pay any off any debts in bitcoin. They will be able to pay taxes in bitcoin. They will be able to send, receive, and spend bitcoin without having to keep track of cost basis or having to pay capital gains tax.",2021-09-21 12:52:00
hdlzc2s,13toros13,83,"Sure. Im not 100% confident it will. However I think the possibility, under this scenario, is much more feasible now than it could have been in the past.

Dow is down 500 pts or so, on fears of Chinese economic/financial slump. Money will flood FROM chinese exposed stocks and funds.

That money could look for someplace to go that ISNT connected to that same exposure. Bitcoin is a globally traded currency now, unconnected to any one nation or national monetary policy. (We can still argue that it is deeply affected by regulation and monetary policy but indirectly).

Right now BTC is mirroring the dow decline because the same reaction is affecting its price - because many investors had previously looked at it as a stock equivalent. What if they discover that the dow tanks 2000 pts but BTC only goes down a few percentage points? They will recognize BTC as what it really will become - a digital store of value based on the entire world economy, with an enforce scarcity at approx 18 mil max coins.

The money fleeing exposed chinese markets might discover that BTC has a “purity” apart from any one market, and flood into it. 

The price at that point could be whatever you imagine the scarcity and global financial value could support. The worse the crisis, the more modest the BTC decline, the greater the eventual BTC price.

hdlkujb,Yancy_Farnesworth,65,"What I find funny is that volatility is the perfect place for rich people to get richer. Bitcoin champions often talk about the people grabbing the power back from the rich and powerful. In reality all they're doing is changing who the rich and powerful are. From a system with some semblance of regulation in favor of the little guy to one with 0 accountability.

Highly volatile assets are literally a gold mine for people with a lot of money. They have the capital to exploit the market and win regardless of if it goes up or down. Meanwhile 99% of everyone else is at their mercy and are essentially doomed to lose money. The stock market has regulations against this that will protect the average investor to a certain extent. In the bitcoin world people can do anything, including everything that is illegal in the stock market. If you thought the stock market was rigged, going to bitcoin is literally like handing your money to the super rich of the world. 

Think about it, Musk was able to swing bitcoin prices wildly with some tweets. In the stock world that would be illegal and get him in a lot of trouble. All he had to do to make money off his own tweets was buy a bunch of bitcoin before he tweets to raise the price. Then sell a ton when he says something bad about bitcoin. And when that happens he could have shorted bitcoin and made a killing. In the bitcoin world where everything is anonymous, he could have done this with no one knowing it happened. That gain has to come from somewhere. It comes from small time investors that don't have the money to play both sides of the market like that.

hdn1dd1,Ghost_carapace_0,60,"1. This is the biggest one. Avax has coopted metamask. Algorand and cosmos can't use metamask. Dot can't use metamask. Solana does not use metamask. This is important, because people looking for actual defi usage are going to hopping ship for a platform that uses a wallet they are already familiar with. Not only that, but its incredibly... friendly to have a single wallet that manages both your eth and your off chain addresses.... from a single wallet.
2. Second... listings. Avax is not listed on coinbase. Algorand, solana, polkadot have already been listed on coinbase. Coinbase will list avalanche sooner or later. Its simply not feasible for them to list shitcoins like shiba inu and then not list a coin like avax. The coinbase listing effect is a one time bonus pump that gives a project between 50-75% marketcap.
3. Third. Defi. Avax has a slew of defi projects from sushi to crv that have already opened or are opening their doors. With the large number of bridges, avax is shaping up to be a semi second layer tier of ethereum. But, avax has their sharding already done with subnets. Avax is everything ethereum 2.0 wants to be, but isn't as of right now.
4. Avax has a hard cap, burn fees for transactions, and staking. This might not matter with eth burning faster right now than its used, but if eth ever issues faster than it burns, avax will outcompete it.
5. avax staking uses lockups. This is incredibly important. It means that every single person who has bought and staked avax is out of the market until their stake is up. They literally gave up their ability to sell for anywhere from 1 month to 1 year. This is INSANE hodling, and this level of hodl is normally only seen with extreme bitcoin maximalists.

hdtkyw0,liberty4u2,326,"Who in the hell is reading shitposts from 8 years ago?????  Fn Reddit.  I wake up to take a piss and I see multiple people having mentioned me in this post.  

I had forgotten that post but I remember distinctly hand writing my logic out on paper and doing “my simple math”.  Boy how the crypto world has changed since then.  It’s been a joy to watch it change and grow.  You guys have no idea how hard it was to get Bitcoin back when there was one exchange (mtgox). In fact that is part of how I knew Bitcoin would be successful.  

My very first purchase of Bitcoin required me to go to my local bank fill out a wire transfer form, pay a $50ish fee and argue with the personal banker AND branch manager that this “wasn’t a scam”. They were not going to allow me to transfer MY money to a bank in Japan. I had to threaten the withdrawal of all my funds to get them to do it.  This whole process took about an hour and cost $50. I thought to myself “how I the world are banks going to compete with Bitcoin when a similar transfer would take me 10-20 seconds to initiate and cost pennies to perform”. Btw I have tried to find the personal banker to see if they remember “the scam”.  I hope I find her some day. 

I learned almost every thing I needed to know about Bitcoin here on this Reddit. In fact bitcointip was popular back then and people would give you “small” amounts of Bitcoin just for commenting.  I figure I got about .74 Bitcoin given to me here just for commenting.   Thank you for educating me. Thanks to r/ancap for getting me here. 

Back to my original post.  I’m surprised how accurate some of my predictions have been. Last year I stood crying as I watched the Bitcoin ticker I have in my office cross $50,000.  I didn’t believe it would happen so fast.  Btw I’m still largely hodling. I sold some Bitcoin when it was zooming up above 50k to pay off my house.  The rest is in cold storage. 

My rant about how governments will try and shut down Bitcoin is just now starting to play out. I’m sure many of you have seen the proposed US regulations.  The bankers/politicians  will not give up their ability to print print print without a fight.  But if there is one thing I understand more clearly than ever it is that Bitcoin is freedom, it is liberty almost in its purest form.  It has to win or we will live in a draconian future.  Most people don’t know that we already have currency controls in place.  Large wire transfers have to be approved by a fed bank. You can’t carry large sums of cash on your person without the treat of it being taken.  Transfers of greater than 10k (?$600?!!!!) have to be reported to the government. 

The future of Bitcoin may require civil disobedience.  If you haven’t started a node you should. 

Where will the price of Bitcoin go in the future?  I think that it will be worth 10s of millions of dollars someday mostly because the usd is being printed into oblivion currently. I think it’s value will drop significantly as the world governments try and reign it in/destroy it.  But the day after they make it illegal it will still be there, it will still be working. When people see that the governments can’t stop Bitcoin with laws then they will flee their current fiat and use Bitcoin.

A week later, the market crashes and 1 BTC is only valued at 40k USD. you still have 1.00 (remains the same, as mentioned). However, the BTCUSD took a 20% hit, right? (20% of 50 is 10k, so now we’re at 40k)

Now, let’s assume another week goes by and the market recovers a bit. By the end of the next week, the market is up 20%, **but it’s 20% from the closing price of the week prior, which was 40k USD**. 20% of 40k is 8k, so now BTC is valued at 48k USD. 

As you can see, the price dipped 20% and then gained 20%, but it didn’t retutn to the initial 50k USD price point, as it’s still 2k short. That’s because in order to go back from 40k to 50k, you would require a 25% gain.",2021-09-22 06:26:35

hdwy4my,UnrulySasquatch1,61,"Wow, you brought some heated discussion from some very uninformed people.

Think of an upgrade like a baton pass. Miners lead up to the block of the PoS upgrade and validators take it from there. This is actually true of any upgrade. Normally the bottom is passed from PoW miners to PoW miners, but in this case the PoW miners can move on to other things after the upgrade. They are only responsible for getting to the block for the upgrade. Validators will take it from there.

Let's say Bitcoin decided to update to be ASIC resistant. (They wouldn't, but let's say they do). The ASIC miners would be responsible for getting to the block necessary for the upgrade and then the GPU miners would take over. Nothing else needed from the ASIC miners to proceed.

All that matters for the initial group is that they get to the upgrade block. They don't need to run some special code for the upgrade, just keep doing what they are doing. Then the validators pick it up from there and move forward as necessary. The second group is the group you need to be in sync with the upgrade.

The reason is because the entire community is in sync. If you and me and etherscan and metamask, etc, etc all decide that PoW blocks are Ethereum until block 13.5M and then PoS blocks are all that matters, then that's what will happen.

That is why consensus is law. If everyone (read: the super-majority) decides that the upgrade happens that way, then it does. Right now the community believes in the Ethereum foundation and the code they are creating, testing and releasing.

At any point, the community could decide against using their upgrades or use someone else's code. That doesn't seem likely in our current timeline, but could change if the Ethereum foundation stared acting outside of the community's best interest.",2021-09-23 11:01:14

&gt;To me there are a bunch of red flags here, why they only want to pay in Bitcoin, and the transaction is a Swift transaction from outside of the US.

eh? Which is it? Swift or bitcoin? These are two very separate incompatible payment channels. 

If the customer actually pays bitcoin to a wallet that your client controls and provided the customer an address for, and the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, then your client has received a very real immutable payment.

It also prints money when needed to stimulate the economy if unemployment starts rising. These are powers that (used properly, of course) keep your country going.

Bitcoin's decentralization means that countries can no longer play with money to dodge crises or boost the economy. Unless you want to live in some anarchocapitalist dystopia, this isn't desirable.

he3qo90,saucy_intruder,183,"I'm going to answer this from a legal perspective because there's a prevalent misconception of what a ""Ponzi scheme"" is.  The short answer is that what you're describing is not a ""Ponzi scheme.""  In a Ponzi scheme, a person invests in a business and is paid at regular intervals with funds from subsequent investors.  A Ponzi scheme involves the investors being deceived as to the sources/legitimacy of the funds used to pay them.

Crypto currencies don't work that way. If you buy one bitcoin, that's it. You own a bitcoin that might go up or down in value, but you aren't being paid in cash with funds from subsequent investors.  The only way you get cash is by selling the bitcoin, and there's no deception or mystery about where that money is coming from. So crypto currencies are not a ""Ponzi scheme.""

That's not to say crypto currencies are a good investment; beanie babies weren't a ""Ponzi scheme,"" but they also weren't a good investment.  It's also not to say that the ""investment advice"" people give about crypto currencies is legal. What you're referring to is something more like a [pump and dump scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_and_dump), where people artificially inflate the value of an asset with misleading statements.  That's much harder to prove than a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty easy to prove someone is lying about the source of a business's revenue if there's no legitimate business activity going on. It's much harder to prove someone is knowingly lying when they say, ""I think the value of \[madeup coin\] will increase 10%.""",2021-09-25 00:45:00

1. Dont chase pumps, let them come to you. If you believe in a crypto and see the project going somewhere, buy and wait. If you are finding it stressful seeing \~90% losses, you will never make money in this market. People who hold long term are the ones that have historically done the best. 
2. Value does not go up monotonically. You WILL see losses, sometimes significant losses. its just an element of the maturity of the asset class. 
3. Dont marry an alt coin. You should never be fully invested in something like safemoon. Make sure you have bags of bitcoin, eth, ada, avax, chainlink etc etc. Projects that have stood the test of time. You are in crypto to make money, dont ape in on dumb shit without a plan. 
4. When you see parabolic rises of 10x-100x in a short period of time, you WILL see a blow-off-top' event where the price will crash down. This is because the selling pressure for all the people that got in early becomes too much and they take profits. Quick large rises = bad, gradual rises with tests of 8-20 week moving averages = good. 
5. When you see losses, zoom out and have a look at the rest of the market. When Bitcoin is at or below its 20 week moving average, alt coins bleed. New coins like safemoon bleed more. When bitcoin is stable and showing growth against its 20 week moving average, alt coins rally. At this point, the ENTIRE market moves with, or shortly after bitcoin. 
6. Look at what other projects are doing. If you look around the new binance smart chain eco system, projects are COPYING what safemoon is doing. I only just found another project today on ETH called SafemoonA. If projects are copying your project, it is a good sign. 
7. Something being good doesnt mean it will be immediately valuable. Look at Cardano, 12 months ago it was valued at .10 and now it is sitting stable at $3AUD. ADA has ALWAYS been a good project, but for 2 years it did almost NOTHING, it sat around .10 to .20. Be patient. 

90% of you will capitulate out of the crypto space because you dont understand how markets work or how value is attributed to asset classes. My final bit of advice is go and learn, find some clever people like Benjamin Cowan and absorb every bit of information you can. 

I am personally holding safemoon because it is an interesting project that others are mimicking, its a highly risky project that will likely fail, but there is a chance that it can succeed. So to me, that is worth a measured risk in my portfolio of lots of other crypto.",2021-09-28 10:04:24

&gt;Bitcoins correlation with the Nasdaq-100, as measured in late May, was around 0.20 on a rolling 20-day average, and its correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is 0.29, as of June 2, according to Dow Jones MarketWatch data.


&gt;The asset with the highest correlation to bitcoin, presently, is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, at 0.81, meaning that the trust moves nearly in lockstep with the crypto.


If you look up 'how significant is a 0.2 correlation' on Google, it's pretty weak. The [general guidelines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jt.2009.5) are: 


1. 0 indicates no linear relationship.


2. +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship – as one variable increases in its values, the other variable also increases in its values through an exact linear rule.


3. −1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship – as one variable increases in its values, the other variable decreases in its values through an exact linear rule.


4. Values between 0 and 0.3 (0 and −0.3) indicate a weak positive (negative) linear relationship through a shaky linear rule.


5. Values between 0.3 and 0.7 (0.3 and −0.7) indicate a moderate positive (negative) linear relationship through a fuzzy-firm linear rule.


6. Values between 0.7 and 1.0 (−0.7 and −1.0) indicate a strong positive (negative) linear relationship through a firm linear rule.",2021-09-29 07:03:33
